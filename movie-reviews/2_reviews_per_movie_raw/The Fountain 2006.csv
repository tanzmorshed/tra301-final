"baldwinbrothers2000","8","812","1000","13 September 2006"," A hard, but intelligent film
","I recently saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival.I was eagerly anticipating it's release, being a big fan of Pi and Requiem for a Dream. That being said, this is a hard film to watch. It has beautiful cinematography, an amazing score, and very impressive acting, however, I feel that the advertising on the film has been misleading. This is not a love story, nor is it a science fiction film (although it has elements of both).The true core of the film is a man dealing with the idea of mortality. The fact that he, and everyone, especially the woman he loves, is going to die. This is nothing like Requiem for a Dream or Pi, it has a heavier feel to it, though it is not as depressing. Not everyone will like this movie, in fact, I find it hard to believe that this will get a wide release, as it is not a commercial film. It is an art film, a discussion piece, a beautiful poem about the fragility of life and the idea of forever."

","Fantastic in every sense. This film is indeed poetry, and a beautiful testament to love and the cycle of life, and the impermanence of death. Wow. The script is tight, and the non-linear presentation works very well. The scene compositions were exquisite. The score enhanced without being overbearing, which is so often the case in contemporary film.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely superb, but then it's got Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. I can't imagine Brad Pitt doing any sort of justice to this film. Darren Aronofsky lucked out in the long run by getting someone who has the range to portray the vast emotions required for Tomas/Tommy/Tom. Weisz has the depth for regal intrigue and spirited grace. Their chemistry makes their stories even more entrancing.<br/><br/>This film does require a thinking brain to be appreciated."

","""TheFountain"" is a story tackling three different time periods. Tomas (Hugh Jackman) is a 16th century Conquistador on a bloody hunt though a hidden Mayan temple to retrieve sap from the mythical Tree of Life for his queen (Rachel Weisz), who is desperate for immortality. In 2005, Tom (Jackman) is a doctor frenetically searching for the cure to cancer to save the life of his wife Izzi (Weisz), who is in the final throes of her battle with death. Five hundred years later, Tom travels through space on a quest to reach the place of tranquility that Izzi spoke fondly of, using the Tree as a device to get him to the answers he needs to rest his weary mind....<br/><br/>In performances that can only be described as exquisite, Jackman and Weisz assist their director in opening up this knotty story through their soulful and romantic interpretations of desperation and peace. Essentially playing one lost soul, Jackman foams with remarkable anguish as he performs three separate interpretations of duty, handing in career-defining work. Weisz is the face of love in ""The Fountain,"" lending the film a flowering emotional core of the film.<br/><br/>The Fountain"" is masterful on so many unique levels, presenting a demanding filmgoing experience that should elicit a grand sense of awe on an emotional and spiritual level unlike anything you've seen this year.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has out done himself again...."
"lagriff05","10","148","187","4 October 2007"," Beautiful and probably one of the best movies of the century
","...and here I shall attempt to review what will one day be a classic in the hopefully near future. The Fountain is many things. It's a touching film. It's not long, though, clocking in at around 80 or 90 minutes, but it does manage to pack in enough emotion to out-do every single lame, candy-assed Hollywood romance ever created, or almost. More movies should cut down their running times like this; because there is not a wasted moment in The Fountain from start to finish, despite the movie still moving at an gregariously slow pace. You won't find any blitzed, seizure-inducing cut-and-paste editing scenes here, and there are no epic explosions and battle scenes either. What you will find, though, is an entire treasure trove of realistic passion and jaw-dropping emotion, and that's the strong point of this movie. Nothing here feels contrived or derivative or fake at all - this is a story of a woman with a lot of love in her heart and a passion for life in general, and a man who would do anything to preserve the same love for all eternity. That's the Fountain.<br/><br/>The Fountain is a simple movie. While at first it's repertoire of lazily abstract images and slow plot construction may seem intimidating and might even turn off the average moviegoer, a deeper voyage into The Fountain's layers reveals something not hard to comprehend at all. I mean, honestly, this film is a love story at it's core, there are no mind-bending plot twists and secret meanings. It's just a passionate, intricately woven romance about how far a man would go to let his love live on forever. If you're looking for super slick plot twists and drama, then look elsewhere, because The Fountain is not your typical modern flick at all. As I said, average moviegoers probably won't be able to get into this one. It's just too abstract and weird, and I won't blame anyone for disliking it on the basis of it's obvious inaccessibility. But regardless, the shimmering majesty of this movie is evident to those who are willing to try and find it. It's clear after the film sinks in - The Fountain is a straightforward and simple film disguised by multiple layers of artistic refinement and glorious imagery. Oh, it's not all clear cut for you, there is one other sticky point for some people - the fact that The Fountain takes place in three different time-spans all at once, weaving them together into a rich, complex tapestry of master-class storytelling. Yet somehow, despite the winding complexity of it all, The Fountain remains a pretty basic story once you get your head around it's eccentricities. Simplicity and complexity go hand in hand here to create a plethora of beauty and sorrow, a perfect oxymoron.<br/><br/>There's a very deep, broad contrast between the beautiful simplicity of the film's plot line and the absolutely jaw-dropping grandeur of the special effects and graphics utilized here. The directing here is through the roof, and the cinematography on display here is probably amongst the five or six best from any movie I've ever seen, if not the very top of the goddamn list. Just watch the last few minutes of the movie, and you'll understand. One of the things I really love about The Fountain is that it's beautiful and touching without trying to be anything it isn't. It's an honest film, and it does everything it wants to do effortlessly and flawlessly, with graceful, sweeping movements that etch a stunning caricature of rich, luscious aesthetics into an otherwise simple story. Marvelous."
"Monotreme02","9","672","899","20 October 2006"," A unique film experience - Incomparable to any other film you've seen
","As I am writing this review I really don't know where to begin. It reminds me of the feeling I had as I left the theatre after the closing credits rolled on the film  absolutely bewildered. I can't even begin to describe the feelings I left the theatre with, but I can safely say that no movie has affected me quite like The Fountain has since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind two years ago (and which is known as my all-time favourite movie). All summaries and attempts to present the plot are futile, because it's truly indescribable. Any summaries you may have read about the plot are null and void  truly, don't judge the film by what it sounds like it will be like. It's a movie you must experience for yourself. And what an experience it is.<br/><br/>I find it much simpler to focus on the technical aspects of the film, which are, as expected from director Darren Aronofsky, absolutely incredible. His use of camera angles and movements that repeat themselves throughout the film, such as shots from directly above the action, and extensive use of zoom/dolly outs (an important emulation of the film's message, at least what I perceive it is). The entire colour tone of the film is absolutely gorgeous to observe  a beautiful combination of gold and black colours. Much of the lighting is sharp but in a soft gold colour, which creates a really specific atmosphere. Many scenes in the film take place in a hospital-type setting  the setting you'd normally see in filmed mediums lit with very bright white lighting. Aronofsky lights these scenes with very specific soft golden lights, which place most of the setting in blackness and create an eerie, melancholy atmosphere.<br/><br/>Both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are absolutely phenomenal in their roles, with Weisz particularly standing out, playing her character with what I can only describe as held-back intensity. It's a performance both of subtlety and of passion at the same time. Extra kudos must be given to Ellen Burstyn who delivers an extremely heartwarming and absolutely brilliant supporting performance.<br/><br/>The musical score by Clint Mansell is absolutely, completely and utterly gorgeous. It's minimalist (serves as quite a polar opposite to the profoundness of the film itself) but extremely intense. It is a score that perfectly emulates the feeling, emotions and mood of the film. It's the perfect type of score, and the melody itself is extremely appealing to the ear, with extensive and almost exclusive use of string instruments.<br/><br/>And of course, the special effects (and when they appear, they are quite prominent) are nothing short of amazing. Just amazing. I have nothing more to add, just see it for yourself and be impressed.<br/><br/>But really, one finds it difficult to remove ones mind from the spectacle that is the film. The Fountain is, quite simply, unlike ANY other film I have ever seen. The only movie it even only slightly resembles in terms of vagueness and atmosphere is 2001: A Space Odyssey, although The Fountain is only ever so slightly more down to earth. This isn't to say that it's an imitation of Space Odyssey nor that it has similar things to say, but you do get that feeling while watching The Fountain that you are experiencing something incredibly profound. And profound it is. I never stopped thinking about the film since I saw it last Saturday, and I still don't think that I fully understand everything the film has to offer. But it is absolutely loaded with substance ripe for interpretation. I have recently developed a theory regarding SOME of the themes of the film, but there is still much to decipher. What is important to say is that it is the type of film in which every single shot. Every single editing decision, every single is thought out right down to the last little detail, because it is all these little details that combine to create the broader picture, the profound meaning.<br/><br/>The Fountain isn't ""this year's Eternal Sunshine"". It isn't the ""next Space Odyssey"", although I can assure you, if you enjoyed either of these two films (and preferably both), you should find much The Fountain that will appeal to you. It's a movie that many people will not like, perhaps even hate. But I was profoundly affected by it. See it. Decide for yourself. It's definitely one incredible film experience."
"DanielStephens1988","10","14","15","8 August 2019"," Beautiful film about mortality
","It is essential to let go of needs and allow for something new, something more peaceful, to take its place. The main issue for people is not to advocate any specific worldview or philosophy, but rather to show that death is natural to life and something that everyone has to face. It is when people find some way of reconciling with mortality that they can fully be present and not be too worried about the world around them. Our lives are brief and are at the mercy of forces beyond our control, which can suffocate consciousness and delude people into falsehood."
"MConley7","10","432","587","15 October 2007"," Death is the Road to Awe
","This is not a film for any one public. Americans, often ignorant of philosophy and mythology (by and large) would stumble awkwardly through much of the film, wondering what the hell is going on. Others still would prefer to call the film pretentious and drenched in metaphysical bull----. Woe it is to the archetypes. No one knows how to reach the elemental, the archetypal arena of human experience anymore; a fact proved by so many other reviewers penchant for searching for the ""realism"" within the movie. (cf. Roger Ebert's review; this is a thoroughly stupid and ignorant way of viewing such a film...it seems that the Divine Comedy would be cast aside today, because Dante does not describe Paradise in a ""realistic"" fashion. Which of course is worse than nonsense...its f---ing stupid.) <br/><br/>The problem many people have with this film is that they see it as a story about two people, and not two archetypes that are elemental within human mythology (first man and first woman). It is interesting to note how Jackman becomes Western man (furious and daring, he hopes to reach beyond nature, to become a 'superman,' while not understanding that he is not simply a product of nature but very much a PART of nature) and Weisz becomes the embodiement of Eastern thought (her submission to the truth of nature (death) is not a submission, but an understanding of the tide of life, an understanding Tom, in all his embodiements, does not possess). I see a purity in the representation of first man and first woman, a purity that allows me to see the characters as archetypes that resemble the spiritual forces that have driven us for our eternity.<br/><br/>Ebert said that it is a standard critical practice not to create a fiction that was not implicit within the film; but with a film like The Fountain, there are so many interpretations and meanings...deep thoughts linger in me while I watch, an ocean of experiences that dwells inside me, calm and enveloping. Interpretaions can, in their own rights, be works of art, if what they interpret, in itself, is beautiful. I will not pretend that my interpretation is right, complete, or a work of art; but what I have seen and felt from this film has filled me with something I cannot describe--if the definition was not insufficient, I would call it God--yet so many pass by it with scorn and rolling eyes. I hope some will see in it what I have felt pass through so many times...or at least to understand, at the very least, that just because a movie doesn't touch you, it does not mean that your perception of the movie is, in itself, truth; it is merely an opinion like mine. On art there is no truth, except the pieces we craft ourselves."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","126","165","2 February 2008"," A Fascinating Gem
","'The Fountain' is one fascinating film. I don't think there's enough words to describe what it's like. After watching the film, I've read several different interpretations and can only conclude that don't make a decision on what you've read, simply watch the film. It's a unique movie-watching experience.<br/><br/>Aronofsky took me by complete surprise. I loved his 'Requiem for a Dream' but I did not expect him to come up with something so different. Man, is that a big difference, not only in content but also in technique and pretty much everything. All I knew beforehand was that the film was a science fiction and that it starred Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz (actors whom I like). After watching it, I can safely say that 'The Fountain' is much more than just a science fiction flick.<br/><br/>I won't mention much of the plot as I do not want to ruin the experience by giving any spoilers. I would love to discuss the film with people who have already seen it. Aronofsky uses of symbolism, colour, and spectacular visuals to tell a story of life, death, love and rebirth. The visuals are simply breathtaking and the special effects are phenomenal. The use of different camera angles is particularly excellent as it gives the viewer (well at least me) the feel of the moving time and space. He cleverly uses lighting and colour to distinguish between the atmosphere of the different times as he does with the zoomlens. And, of course the soundtrack which is very underused but beautifully noticeable.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is terrific in a multidimensional character and Rachel Weisz is phenomenal. She's particularly outstanding as she plays her part with a subtle intensity. Ellen Burstyn has a smaller role but she is splendid to watch.<br/><br/>It's really difficult to describe what the experience is like in just a few words. I haven't yet understood every single aspect of 'The Fountain' and am going to be rewatching it, but it does stay in mind long after the end credits have rolled. It's a complex theme but the basis is simple. It won't be liked by many as so many of it is left to interpretation with a lot of questions but for me it's fascinating and is all a movie-watching experience should be."
"MihaiSorinToma","9","17","19","22 April 2018"," A very good drama with a great idea
","With his beloved wife suffering from terminal cancer, a scientist works hard to find a miraculous cure for her terrible disease, while having trouble with the terrible thought that they might get separated way too soon. At the same time, two more stories unfold, one in ancient Spain and the other in space, all somehow linked, presenting the idea of a man who seeks eternal life with his beloved.<br/><br/>It's an unique movie, one which presents three apparently different stories but which all have the same core concept. Each male character swears to do everything in his power for a chance to spend time with his lover, forever if possible. It's full of drama and emotion, presenting in detail the sufferings of the characters, their desperate attempts to fulfil their quests and what lies ahead for each of them. You simply have to be very though in order not to drop a tear, as this movie seems determined to make you cry with it's very well developed characters and its parallel stories.<br/><br/>Although it seems confusing from time to time, changing the story almost out of nowhere, it manages to keep the viewer interested and curious about what will happen next. It manages to link two of the stories pretty well, this being the main point of interest in my opinion, but the third one seems a bit off. It tries to present the spiritual part of the story, but it somehow left the feeling that it wasn't all that connected as it should have been.<br/><br/>All in all, I really liked this movie. It brought plenty of drama which makes you care for the characters and their fate, thus keeping you eager to find out how it ends. It's unique idea manages to be at the same time it's most important plus but also a bit of a let-down, in terms of connection. I had a very good time with it so I will definitely recommend it to anyone. It brings something new, a fresh idea, and this alone deserves recognition, not to mention the feelings involved throughout."
"LarkWithakay","10","530","739","18 October 2006"," The Path to Life
","I had the immense pleasure of viewing this film for its second screening ever, when it was showcased at Chicago's International Film Festival. Fans of Aronofsky who enjoyed the intensity of 'PI' and 'REQUIEM FOR A DREAM' will find that Darren's primary thematic focus has shifted yet again from the mind and gut ('PI' and 'REQUIEM', respectively) to the heart. However, don't take this to mean that 'THE FOUNTAIN' isn't intellectually engaging or visceral in its impact.<br/><br/>In a word, this film is warm. Aronofsky's palette for his third feature is a swirling miasma of golden yellows, and it sets the tone for the work. 'THE FOUNTAIN' is a life-affirming treatise on the eternity of love. Cynical hacks might decry this as a mawkish, facile rumination of saccharine proportions, but despite the sentimental themes, the film is never cloying, opting instead for a (sur)realistic portrayal of the nuances of one of life's most powerful emotions.<br/><br/>The casting was superb: Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman are outstanding in their roles, with both offering utterly believable performances. Weisz reveals the same depths she did in 'THE CONSTANT GARDENER', portraying myriad subtleties in a role that could've easily been misplayed, starring as Jackman's love throughout time. For those who've only seen Jackman in action-oriented mutant movies, his command of his character's strengths AND frailties is a welcome surprise. The supporting cast was excellent as well, with Ellen Burstyn standing out in particular.<br/><br/>Special effects were phenomenal, even without taking the film's halved budget into consideration. I won't spoil the surprise, but when you find out how Aronofsky and Co. achieved some of the extraordinary images, you're sure to be impressed (and reminded of a film classic from over 25 years ago). This is not a film to rely on FX, though. In fact, the segment (not scene; the story is split across three time periods) using the bulk of the effects is probably the shortest.<br/><br/>Aronofsky ambitiously tackles heavy themes and concepts and he does it in a little over 90 minutes. I didn't realize how short the film was until it was over. However, 'THE FOUNTAIN's brevity could also be perceived as an extension of one of its themes: learning to appreciate the world and its beauty in whatever time we are allotted."
"warren-10","9","294","410","17 November 2006"," A New Transcendental Film
","This is one half of a review. Some films need to be seen more than once to be fully grasped. This is one of them.<br/><br/>I would like to read Paul Schrader's review of this film. Not because he wrote the screenplay for Taxi Driver, but because he wrote a book about ""Transcendental Style in Film"" and ""The Fountain"" is certainly in this category of film-making.<br/><br/>Because of Schrader's book, I've been viewing as many films by Dreyer, Ozu, and Bresson, that I can lay my hands on  especially those by Robert Bresson. There are many parallels between Aronofsky's film and Bresson, and yet their style is completely different  it's like comparing a Tintype photograph with a Van Gogh: Bresson is understated while Aronofsky is over the top. Yet, both directors create films that are best viewed more than once. Both styles leave a lot to the imagination which can be frustrating on the first viewing. I certainly was. This is why I consider this to be one half of a review. I've only seen this film once.<br/><br/>The Fountain has three story lines: one set in the past, one in the present, and one set ostensibly in the future. The three timelines weave in an out of each other like a Chinese puzzle. The past is poetic, the present is realistic, and the future is plausible. Moreover the future be either a real future (as cinematic futures go) or merely a dream of the future. So, this could be a very subjective story that takes place now. It is ambiguous, mysterious, and subject to personal interpretation. In this regard, The Fountain, is very much like the films of Bresson.<br/><br/>Bresson once mentioned that he intentionally avoids the obvious in his film; it is the mystery that propels the viewer's interest forward. Often later scenes reveal the mystery of that earlier enigma. This is a very literary form of film-making. Last night, I was surrounded by people in the audience who wanted every plot detail handed to us on a silver platter. As this was a sneak preview, we all got in for free. Some were probably expecting the extremes of ""Requiem for a Dream"". A group next to me left early. As I was leaving, I heard a teen say into her cell phone ""don't bother to pay for this film  wait for it when it is on TV  for free"". And I agree: if you can tolerate a lot of commercial TV and prefer magazines to books, then you may not like this film. If you read some of the reviews, for Bresson, you'll get some of the same impatience. These are films which break with what you'd expect from a film. Forget that you're in a movie theater; this piece will reward an open mind.<br/><br/>The acting in The Fountain is very dynamic but there was not enough breathing room for empathy. There is only one break in the tension when there could have been more. Instead, to serve the three story lines, the tension feels like one continuous climb. A tearful moment, from one storyline, leads to another tearful moment in another storyline. The group next to me  the one that ultimately left  were snickering. It feels like overacting, even though each performance is convincing, on its own. So, I felt my empathy in suspension. A different edit would have added more power to the emotional timbre of the acting. I find myself wishing for another 20 minutes of story to draw me in.<br/><br/>The music blended very well with the story  they never stood apart, which is ideal for a cinematic score. The visuals, however, did break the suspension of disbelief, on a few occasions. In one case, there was a tracking shot that uses a unique point of view that took me out of the story, thinking ""wow, cool shot!"", instead of thinking ""I wonder where he is going"". There is a certain amusement ride feel to some of the cinematography and Special Effects which detracts from the story. But, these shots are not gimmicks. They're premonitions and echoes of action in other sequences. They are crazy bold, like Van Gogh's brushstrokes tracing out a landscape. These bold strokes are the first thing that I notice, about ""The Fountain"". But, upon reflection, they paint a picture that is rather calm.<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing this movie again."
"forceoftruth","10","282","396","4 September 2006"," Extraordinary film
","I got into a screening by chance a few weeks ago to see a film called The Fountain up here in New York. I was about to see another film while a young woman approach my wife and I about a free screening while I was about to purchase my tickets. Now I have heard that special screenings are common and they happen at random, so we took her up on her offer right away and followed her inside the theater to a screening room. Now considering that the film was free, we were going to take it in stride that it might not be any good and just go along for the experience. Long and behold, the movie started and we were treated to one of the most intelligent and emotional films we have ever seen. Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman play eternal lovers who are destine to live in tragedy though their several incarnations over time (Past, Present and Future). Thou these experiences, they are forced to look at the meaning of life and death and if there is a way to prolong their love thou it all. The running theme in the film is about acceptance, wheatear it's trying to live your life to the fullest or to die with dignity and that is more represented in the present day time line of the film where Huge's character is trying to save his wife (Rachel's character) from an inoperable brain tumor. This segment of the film is where the film's emotional bread and butter come from and in my opinion the best part of the whole movie. There is a realistic chemistry between Hugh and Rachel and it carries the far reaching premise of the film with such emotional gravity that you are able to feel their love for each other. Rachel Weisz has always been one of my favorite actors and here she delivers her best performance to date with such passion and such grace that you can literally feel her inside of your heart. She makes her character a real three dimensional person, with real flaws, real fears and real bravery. In any lesser actress's hands, Weisz's role would have been a sad stereotype of a dying woman who is brave in the face of death, in Weisz's powerful hands however, she makes her human and that in my opinion is even more heroic and realistic. Hugh Jackman is extraordinary as well and this performance will prove to everyone that he's among the best actors we have around. In any other lesser actor's hands, Jackman's role would have been the stereotypical man on a mission to save his wife but in Jackman's hands, he give an emotional complex performance of a man who is trying to come to grips with his own fears of loss while watching his wife slowly comes to grips with her own mortality. The climax of the film is set on some kind of spiritual plain where all the stories of the characters come together to give an impression of ever lasting life and renewal.<br/><br/>To make a long review short, it's a great film that my wife and I were completely taken by surprise with and it really had us talking once it was over."

I literally felt the tragedy of the situation. And despite connecting with that tragedy emotionally, I couldn't help but sit in awe as the credits began rolling. I felt neither depressed nor hopeful as the experience ended . I just felt spent, moved , and incredibly eager to engage in discussion.<br/><br/>I have a newfound respect for the talent of both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. If I see either of them on the street I will feel compelled to offer a handshake.<br/><br/>I am convinced Darren Aronofsky is going to be regarded as one of the elite directors of our time before his career comes to an end.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is layered in intriguing elements.

","I do not know how to sum this movie up in this review, and to try to would be an injustice to Darren Aronofsky's genius. So I will just state the facts. I saw this film at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was blown away. This movie is so original and so breath taking. There is only one word that I can use to describe it: BEAUTIFUL. Darren Aronofsky is a genius and the greatest film-maker of our time. He is a visionary, and one of the greatest script writers. Hugh Jackman's performance ranks among the greatest male screen performances in cinema history. Rachel Weisv is amazing, as is Ellen Burnstyn, and Sean Patrick Thomas. Clint Mansell teams up with The Kronos Quartet and the Scottish rock band Mogwai to bring us some of the most beautiful and epic music I have ever heard. Matthew Libatique's cinematography is breath taking. It is so simple, yet so effective and so amazing. Jay Robinowitz deserves special mention here because the movie is so well put together it flows, and as an editor myself, I can understand how hard that must have been. The three time lines weave in and out of each other flawlessly. This movie is so good I need to see it again in order to catch all of it, but this taste will be enough to sustain me for another month, when I will surely see it four or five times. This movie is about themes bigger than you can possibly imagine, and it will take some thinking, and it is genius. In my opinion, the best movie I have ever seen."

It's like every shot is intended to promote critics to say ""beautiful cinematography"" or ""so symbolic"". <br/><br/>It would be one thing to include visual references once in a while to universe, spheres, continuum, death/rebirth, etc. But truly, I find all this is so overdone it's simply patronizing. <br/><br/>All the shots within symmetrical architecture, the references to circles, all the visual mathematical patterns which try to be symbolic of it's theme, it's like someone designed this just to provide fodder for a dissertation abstract. <br/><br/>This is what's wrong with the New Age: All this effort to be intense, meditative, conceptualizing the spiritual cycle of life/death/growth/rebirth, references to ancient failed religious cultures and civilizations, etc. It all becomes Kitsch (loosely defined these days as an attempt to over-sentimentalize and communicate canned spiritual platitudes through digital quasi-religious imagery in an attempt to be philosophical, profound and intense). <br/><br/>The problem is that this sort of imagery, which is rampant in computer graphics these daze (the lotused guru centered in the explosion of enlightened universal nebulous self/god discovery, etc. etc.) is completely anti-art, anti-emotional, anti-intellectual, not even based in reality of revelation of any kind, just visual pablum, like something you find on a greeting card or CD cover in a scented store in Woodstock, with no genuine human fallibility, funkiness nor truth to any aspect of human reality (nor even spirituality). <br/><br/>True he fails to cure her in time, but his extremely over-acted tearful intensity, the vague crutch-like references to history, religiosity, spirituality, it just all seems so contrived, posed, and for lack of better words, patronizing. <br/><br/>True the skill and presentation is amazing, but this is not new. When craft completely outstrips content, this creates a phenomenon called ""slick"". <br/><br/>This is a very slick, overwrought attempt at extracting applause for visual brilliance and spiritual profundity, but in the end becomes just a perfectly blended, photo-shopped faux-philosophical platitude, like some poster or card with some deep introspective quote or other from the Dalai Lama, (except no Buddhist could ever be so shallow and predictable). <br/><br/>I find I resent all the Catholic and other religious references, just more effort to add contrived intensity to an already canned theme. <br/><br/>It's also as if the movie can't transcend any of it's points, but just states them over and over and over, attempting to make a hypnotizing mantra-like dream about spirituality, life, death, fragility of life, the continuum, etc. but rather than stating it once, or subtly, it fairly beats you over the head with endless perfectly framed symmetrical shots of every symbolic reference it could muster. <br/><br/>This kind of thing is better done in one image, one frame, a post-card which you are free to toss or file or forward, but not something which you have to watch over and over and over for hour after hour, as if you didn't get it the first time. <br/><br/>This is exactly how you make something which could and should be really deep into something cheap, sentimental and silly. This is how you do Kitsch. I for one cannot accept Kitsch without camp. To take oneself as seriously as this movie attempts to do is nothing but, I hate to say it, bad taste. <br/><br/>Excuse me while I go rinse the stevia and wheat-grass from my teeth, and purge my nostrils of the bad incense and uncrimp my knees from the absurd pose of enlightened philosophical faux-religiosity the imposed lotus-position of contrived spiritual and emotional profundity has self-flagellated me into. So sorry guys, you worked hard, but this is just a bunch of extremely well-done schlock."
"disposablejs","9","5","5","23 February 2018"," The Fountain
","This is a film about acceptance of death. <br/><br/>The general tone of this film is earthy, dreamy, and calm. <br/><br/>All visuals are carefully composed and very pleasant to the eyes, because Aronofsky is the kind of director who knows his lenses. The music, scored by Aronofsky's long time collaborator Clint Mansell, is captivating and inspiring. <br/><br/>Aronofsky's script is experimental and a bit coarse, but full of strong details. The characters are a bit one-dimensional, but skilled actors give them sufficient depth. <br/><br/>The film features one simple main narrative, and two parallel fantasy narratives (with lots of elaborate fantasy imagery). The main narrative takes place in the present. The fantasy narratives take place in the past and in the future respectively. <br/><br/>The fantasy narratives are not realistic or logical, nor are they supposed to be. Unfortunately this is confusing, and some viewers seem to believe that something super complex is happening and that they need to understand it like in one of those ""Inception""-type movies. But that is wrong. The fantasy narratives are more like dream sequences, used to express stuff about the main narrative in a more powerful, visual language which is more accessible to the unconscious. <br/><br/>The fantasy narratives are fast paced, which prevents boredom, but the drawback of this is that there is not much time to build mood. Therefore the mood building seems a little clumsy at times, and some moments which are intended to produce sadness or goosebumps might make you chuckle instead, or you'll find them pretentious. But the artist's intention is always clear and I was willing to stay with Aronofsky's vision and take all scenes serious in order to enjoy the film. <br/><br/>This film is definitely a break from the boring Hollywood conveyor belt. It bombed at the box office which suggests that most people dislike it. But some people will love it, and so do I."

","I was fortunate to see this at the Toronto Film Festival. While I have not seen Requiem for a Dream or Pi, I was fascinated by this film after hearing about the reaction in Venice. This is one of the most thought provoking & evocative movies I have ever seen. I think it is a movie that people will either love or hate, there doesn't appear to be a middle ground.<br/><br/>While introducing the film, in Toronto, Rachel Weisz commented that Aronofsky asks a lot from his actors, this appears to be true and most certainly pays off. Hugh Jackman's gut-wrenching and emotional performance is phenomenal. This is undoubtedly his best performance and, as far as I'm concerned, you can hand him the Oscar. It is superbly written, acted and directed. Mansel's score is beautiful. Be open to this movie and receive it. There aren't enough superlatives to do justice to this film. I can't wait to see it again. Brilliant!"
"bigbluevanfoundationofam","10","147","236","21 October 2006"," 3 stories occurring at 3 different time periods that seem unrelated at first but tie together by the end of the film
","I got passes to see an advanced screening of this in Boston, and then got to meet Aronofsky after the screening and ask him about the film. I absolutely adored his earlier work (PI and Requiem for a Dream), but as he said at the beginning of the Screening ""For those of you here to see requiem for a dream part II, go home, this is not it."" That comment best gets you ready to see this movie. It takes place during 3 different time periods, simultaneously and actually pulls it off!!! It doesn't have as much of the Hip-Hop montage that Darren is known for in his other films, but while watching, you can still tell it is one of his films. Aronofsky has evolved as a Director and the Fountain is a shinning example of his evolution. It is BY FAR one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in a VERY long time. It's hard to believe that it came together as well as it did after it was dropped by the studio a few years ago as being ""an impossible movie to make"" and it took Darren 7 months of coffee and late nights to finally rewrite and re-story board the entire film and convince the studio to give him another chance! Another interesting thing to note is that there is only 1 CGI used in the entire movie (which considering it's amazing visuals is very hard to believe). Instead, he hired a chemist so that he could film the Trippe backgrounds through a microscope (much like 2001 a space Odyssey)and give the film a more natural feel. Another cool fact is that Darren is tone mute, which means he can identify the difference between different musical notes but can't differentiate them when he tries to reproduce them (like singing or playing instruments). He said that he spent almost as much time on the script as he did working with the Kronos Quartet on the soundtrack and that the soundtrack was finished BEFORE any shooting for the film occurred. All in all I believe that The Fountain is a MUST SEE for ANY movie goer this year, as it's by far the best movie of the year. This is one of those films that stays with you a long time, even after the film has finished. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!"
"dj_sam_r_i","9","53","80","12 September 2006"," Another great Aronofsky film!
","I just came home from the North American Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. After hearing that this movie got booed by critics and hailed by the public audience in Venice, I knew it had to be good. A movie that could split crowds just had to be. Having seen both ""Pi"" and ""Requiem For A Dream"", I had pretty high expectations of it. ""The Fountain"" did not let me down, not one bit. The film was a visual spectacle and a beautiful story of love, death and learning how to mourn. Thematically, in the end, at least as I see it now (after about an hour or so of thinking about it), the movie is about acceptance. The acceptance of all our fates, in the end. The fact that we will always return to the earth and it's just inevitable. And as humans, the only way we can get past the death of a loved one is to learn how to mourn, accept and move on. My take on the ending is that to seek immortality is to knowingly or unknowingly seek your own death. So, immortality isn't a way to live forever in the living world, it's to die and live for eternity in the afterlife. Now this is just my opinion on the movie. I may be wrong with my interpretation, as the plot is covered in several layers of metaphors. So I may need to see this film once again. But for now, this is where I stand. For those seeking a great Aronofsky film, you won't be disappointed. This man's way of storytelling is just phenomenal. The film is screening again at Ryerson on September 14th at 15:00. If you are in the neighbourhood, I'd suggest going to the screening before it's wide release."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","223","374","24 November 2006"," Film is an artform and Aronofsky is a Picasso
","How very sad it is when a great film is spoiled by an ending that simply isn't in-tune. Darren Aronofsky received the Visionary Award 2006 at the Stockholm Film Festival where I watched 'The Fountain', which should serve as a mark of his momentous, earth-shatteringly beautiful visions in breathing life into a universe dependent on the delicate cycle of life and death. It is not until the ending, however, that the film abandons all other components and overdoses on the latter.<br/><br/>But first let me recap the dizzying storyline. The Fountain spans across 1000 years of time, opening in the gritty dark jungles of the Mayan civilization, cutting to present day America and ending in a golden bubble in space (no, really). These three parallel stories are sewn together by Tom's (Hugh Jackman) odyssey to save the woman he loves (Rachel Weisz) from cancer. In many ways, the present-day story is the film's central element and the other dimensions the mere windowdressing, and arguably fantasies from the book Izzi is writing. Nevertheless, the latter are among the most absorbing, especially the grueling trials of the Spanish inquisition in the 1500s.<br/><br/>It is no wonder the aforementioned plot is so whacked-out because Darren Aronofsky means that 'The Fountain' should not be analyzed as a story, but enjoyed as an experience. To facilitate this experience he embellishes with lush iconic stills by the bucketload, often in the form of aerial shots from the ceiling looking down at its characters. There is in this way a dramatic symmetry in the buildings, arches and scenery. You truly just want to snap a picture of each scene, frame it and hang it on your wall. The colours are unspeakably vivid and the vast visions form a world unto itself  an indescribable experience that welcomes you into dreamy dimensions and takes and shakes you. My audience sat speechless and tear-eyed.<br/><br/>It is true that The Fountain is mostly cinematography (a kind of 2001), but it is no ""vacuous"" film. For one, it is emotionally compelling not only owing to its visuals but also its cast. Tom/Tommy/Tomas is a demanding role for Hugh Jackman to inhibit, but he captures the struggle of his character aptly. Rachel Weisz, too, is appropriately emotive and likable in the story. Togethery they have bubbling chemistry that creates mesmerizing magic, although with splashes of melodrama. The latter can best be attributed to the faltering dialogue that sometimes contains more corn than Kellogg's. This shortcoming is however far from a fatal one (since the film is anything but dialogue-driven) and between the meaningful glances, the expert navigation of the parallel dreamworlds and the epic score, The Fountain stays afloat with assured direction.<br/><br/>Until the end, that is. Here the dreaded hubris kicks in and Aronofsky realises he has already gone down all kinds of ambitious paths in the film, and compensates by applying the 'big, bigger, epic' formula. There is, in all fairness, no perfect way to sew The Fountain together because it has been so out there for so long. I will not spoil the ending sequence for you, mostly because all I can remember is a vague blur of explosive golden crescendo. The fine line between poignant and over-the-top corny along which the film has treated throughout suddenly shakes and The Fountain tips over into... simply too much of everything, completely overdosing on furious flair.<br/><br/>In conclusion it must be said that I truly do think that Aronofsky has created something unspeakably beautiful here. The Visionary Award is perfectly earned and cements his position as one of the most interesting new directors. Aronofsky cites Werner Herzog's ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"" and Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in America"" as key influences for The Fountain and indeed much of the former is present in his film. Watch it and absorb the lush cinematography and explicit emotions  don't dissect the story.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"freesoul87","10","31","45","22 November 2006"," This is an amazing film
","Its hard to know where to start. I will now attempt to transpose a tapestry into a stick drawing. The basic element of the story is that we cannot live forever in our current state. In the Bible, it says Man was cast out of the Garden of Eden to prevent his access to the tree of life. It says that God did this so that man would not live forever in his sinful state. The Bible then says that God placed two Cherubim with flaming swords to protect this tree. According to the Mayan creation legend, the first man was slain before the foundation of the world, and from his body and blood, the tree of life sprang. These two religious stories are the basis for The Fountain.<br/><br/>Note: The Bible also speaks of Jesus Christ as the second Adam, and it says that He was crucified before the foundation of the world. Some think that the location of the tree of life is the location of the rock of ages, and the cornerstone upon which Yahweh sang the world into existence. This is the current location of the Dome of the Rock. It is the ancient location of the Holy of Holies in the Jewish temple. The Ark of the Covenant, upon which two cherubim were molded, sat above this spot. Once a year, the high priest would enter the Holy of Holies, and would place the blood of the sacrifice upon this ark, also known as the Mercy Seat. Biblically, Christ was sacrificed before the foundation of the world, and his blood was placed on this rock. Christ is the fulfillment of the Law, and He stood as High Priest for us, and gave eternal life to us while we were yet sinners. Biblically speaking, in Christ mankind will be restored to its fullness.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's first film, PI, was about cabbalism and the strange power that we as human beings have when we come into knowledge of ourselves. I believe that this film is another aspect of that exploration. This film confronts the paramount philosophical problem of death. Unless a person has seriously examined their own heart, I do not believe they will understand or enjoy this movie. I love the film, and this is just my interpretation. <br/><br/>Jackman is on a quest to stop death in its tracks. From what I can tell, the quest for the Tree of Life and the voyage to Shibalba did not actually happen, but were the narrative written by Jackman's character's wife, Izzi(Weiss). As Izzi nears death, she understands the struggle Tommy is going through, and attempts to help him understand. In his quest to stop her impending doom, he ceases to spend time with her, and is instead in his lab, researching. During this time, she is writing a book, and the book is the story of her husband, told symbolically in a Conquistador who seeks the Tree of Life, and a Voyager who sets out for Shibalba. It is the story the story of the same man, in two different times, plagued by the same dilemma as her husband. Before Izzi dies, she leaves the book for Tommy to write the final chapter, and tells him to ""Finish it."" She is leaving Tommy with the ability to determine how their life together is going to end. He, by his actions, will ""Finish it."" After she dies, Tommy is revealed the purpose of existence. The book is then finished on the screen. The Conquistador arrives at the tree, and drinks from the sap himself. He is granted everlasting life, but in achieving that which he sought, he is turned into a plant. The Voyager arrives at Shibalba, only to understand that in order to be with the woman he loves, He has to die. He accepts this, and upon his arrival at Shibalba, the star explodes, and he is vaporized. He cannot remain in his imperfect state and live forever. He must die to be made new again. The moral of the story: Death is there for a reason. In our quest to attain eternal life for ourselves, we destroy the purpose to life in the first place. We must die. We must treasure that which we know to be good, and we must find the source and purpose for all things good. We must see beyond the temporal, to the object that the symbolism of our lives is describing. I think the reason many people will not get the film is because it ends with a question. We have to write the ending. What are we really looking for? Why do we hate death if death is a natural part of life? What does our current situation say about our origins and our future? Why are we scared? Why must we die? You are called to ask these questions of yourself. There is death. Those you love will die. What can we do? Nothing. You decide how it ends. You can either live, shaking your fist at death in futility, or observe the purpose for existence. Now finish it."
"homerdabraves","10","24","35","22 January 2008"," The Circle of Life - from ashes to ashes, from dust to dust
","There are three paths through the film. Each tells a small part of a larger story: fantasy, reality, and meta-physicality. In each story, there is a quest for ""The Fountain of Youth"" or ""Eternal Life"". In each instance, the quest for that goal consumes their lives, and only in the end is the basic truth of mortality revealed.<br/><br/>Part 1 - Modern Day/Reality - This is the one true thread of the movie. Tommy and Izzy are married, Izzy is sick with cancer, and Tommy can't accept it. Tommy spends every waking hour away from his wife, instead of enjoying the time they have together on trying to keep her alive. He is searching through science for a ""cure for death"" or in other words eternal life, ie, the Fountain of Youth. Izzy has come to terms with her own mortality, and has begun writing a book to help Tommy understand. The reality is that we all will die, and that there is no cure for death, but that death isn't the end... It's the beginning of forever.<br/><br/>Part 2 - The Book - Tommy is the conquistador trying to find ""the fountain of Youth"", much like he did in real life. This was Izzy's way of communicating to Tommy how futile his efforts are to save her. The book is unfinished because Izzy wants Tommy to finish the book and accept both life and death. Ultimately, the conquistador's quest for eternal life leads to his own death. It's the penultimate irony. Tommy finishes the book by the conquistador dieing and becoming one with nature, completing the cycle of his own life away dieing alone and away from his beloved queen.<br/><br/>Part 3 - Xibalba - This is a purely metaphysical story of yet another search for ""the fountain of youth"", the distant star of Xibalba rumored by some mythology to be the birthplace of the universe, but to the Mayans it was the afterlife, where we all go when we died. His quest in this story is to return the ""tree of life"" that represents Izzy to Xibalba to retrieve her from the afterlife. This is all just symbolic of his search in the modern day for the ""cure for death"". It is an intentional exaggeration, that even given a life long enough to actually travel to the far star of Xibalba, one could never reach eternal life without death. This is not actually occurring as should be obvious by the ""flying bubble"" and the trip through space as well as Tommy facing both Izzy and the queen from the story. It's a symbol of his journey through life and his eventual acceptance of both his wife's death and his own mortality.<br/><br/>Circle symbols are used throughout. The ring, the bubble, Xibalba itself is circular shaped. This is to symbolize the circle of life, from ashes to ashes, from dust to dust.<br/><br/>The message of the movie is that we should appreciate the lives we are given, and we should spend them cherishing those that we love, not wasting them trying to find a way to avoid death, for in only in death can we spend eternity together. From ashes to ashes, from dust to dust."

","This is a film of images, colors, it will be different for everyone, because the director here, in fact, is the viewer himself. It is he who, depending on his beliefs and perceptions, will see his plot and his meaning in what is happening. Although in the description of the film it is said that the plot lines of different times are intertwined, but for me everything is completely different. This is much deeper than time or space - it is a manifestation of a person at different levels of his existence - the level of the material world, the soul and the spiritual world. Only a person who strives for spirituality can come closer to eternal life and the more we care about material things, the less space remains to the eternal ""here and now."""

","Here it is... the movie I knew Aronofsky was capable of; after the ""Look at me, I'm shaking my camera"" singularity of Pi... And after the ""starts-in-human-squalor-and-goes-lower"" one-note experience of Requiem for a Dream... Aronofsky has contributed a real service to humanity by providing a litmus test for blind-dates. Just drop the name of this piece of overwrought obfuscation into a conversation, and if your new friend gets excited, you can spare yourself an entire evening, at the very least, with a complete poseur.<br/><br/>This is the terrific-looking, crappy movie that every director seemingly has in them after The Cell, Flatliners, Blade Runner, Brazil and everything else by Terry Gilliam, and hundreds of other bad movies. It's been art-directed to death. No such care was tendered on the script which is composed of faux-gravitas interrupted by arty posturing, and outbursts instead of drama. Why does someone devise such original visuals, then stumble over cliché after cliché. It seems impossible that Aronofsky hasn't realized there isn't a great movie that doesn't also work on a crappy 10"" black and white TV, with a bent hanger for an antenna. The whole show here is prettiness.<br/><br/>The films features are keyed to the pretensions of a high-school sophomore, but when you're 37 and you present this material with a straight face, you should be deeply embarrassed. This is the kind of movie where everyone is either talking in breathy, serious whispers or they're shouting. It's about as deep as a perfume commercial, which is what it seems to be taking its cue from. (Calvin Klein's 'The Fountain...') If I ever see another character pull their partner into an overflowing tub again, I'm going to track them both down and make them eat soap.<br/><br/>I was completely open to the imagery of the space terrarium. But I was laughing out loud at the conclusion, where Jackman drinks some Ranch dressing from a tree and discovers his inner salad. That's your big conclusion after such a bloated, belabored tease? These muddy 'ideas' are worth about twenty minutes of investigation, or a viewers time. I welcome experimental work, but when it results in material more vapid than a Friday the 13th movie, you're not an artist. If you've compared this movie to Kubrick's 2001, it means you don't understand either of them.<br/><br/>Wow. This is just powerfully bad, self-indulgent, adolescent stuff."

","I've read, with great interest, the various interpretations and comments on The Fountain and while I appreciate that the film was open to interpretation and probably deserves re-watching to appreciate its finer points, I can't help feeling that it was left so open as to be almost utterly incomprehensible (assuming one was watching it without the synopsis to hand). I persevered in the hope that it would all become clear - it did to some extent but it was such a difficult and baffling experience that I can't say I would want to bother with it ever again. I thought it was pretentious in the extreme. For those of you who got something out of it, I'm pleased otherwise it would have been a complete waste of time, money and talent."
"marv-36","1","136","246","7 July 2007"," Boring and Prententious
","Thought the movie was boring, pretentious, and predicable. Many elements of the artsy-fartsy stuff were cliché (for example: the silent walking scene with Tom - until he almost gets hit by a car, the inverted swing around camera-work when Tom rides the horse by/ drives the car by) I couldn't get myself to care for any of the characters: wasn't drawn in to Tom's plight; Tom and Izzy's love for each other just didn't seem to resonate. Somewhere at about the half-point of this movie, I decided that Keanu Reeves (with that slightly confused look of his) would work better than Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>I hate to say it, but I felt more sadness when the Autobot Jazz was torn in half by Megatron than when Izzy died. I actually wanted Izzy to die as soon as possible because I knew that would indicate that the end of the movie was near.<br/><br/>I couldn't stand the way Aronofsky frames his shots - too claustrophobic - maybe because he was on a small budget and had to tighten down in smallish sets? I thought his tight framing on faces was just totally out of place - that sort of style works better on action heroes - i.e. Bruce Willis in Armageddon.<br/><br/>Just way too artsy-fartsy for me. Don't get me wrong, I like art films. I pretty much swallow up almost anything by Wim Wenders. French films can be slow moving, but they certainly aren't pretentious like this one.<br/><br/>No wonder the big studios pulled-out when they first started filming in Australia in 2002. Aronfosky is a mediocre director who just over-extended himself on this one.<br/><br/>This is one of the worst pieces of crap that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Sorry if I have upset anyone."
"bob the moo","Null","14","20","18 July 2007"," Visually and thematically impressive and touching  trying to attribute a narrative context to all of it will be missing the point
","Tomas searches Mayan country, seeking the legendary tree of eternal life that offers him the chance to free his captive queen. A medical researcher pushes the bounds of professional ethics as he attempts to extract a natural cure for his dying wife. A traveller in deep space attempts to make it to a dying star wrapped within a nebula in order to spend eternity with his destined love.<br/><br/>The Fountain got mixed reviews when it came out for a short cinema run in the UK. Perhaps understandably because, although he is hailed by some, he is dismissed by others. So far my experiences have seen me fall into the middle ground as Pi didn't totally win me over the way it did others but I did find Requiem for a Dream to be as impressive as I had heard. So I came to the Fountain unsure of what I would find and not sure if I would like it or if I would struggle with how impenetrable the ploy summaries and comments did make it sound. At first glance it does seem this way because the link between the three stories (and the nature of at least two of the them) does make it seem like a concept to be cracked and pieced together. I do think coming at it like this will only lead to frustration. It is my belief that the modern section is real and that the other two exist within the book  this explanation helped me as it allowed me to focus on the emotion and themes within these sections rather than trying figure out the exact narrative reason for a bald man inside a spaceship that looks like a bubble.<br/><br/>By doing this I was left with a film that I found interesting from start to finish, with the theme of movement from life to death and perhaps rebirth being one that was explored visually as much as it was in the material. To say it like this does run the risk of making it sound corny but rather, with this approach, it does work really well, layering ideas and themes to awesome effect. The central relationship holds the film together and, although some have criticised the other two threads as weaker, I personally saw them as being as much of the main thread as the main scenes were themselves. I was surprised by how touched I was at points and found myself watching a sci-fi with an intense human story running throughout it (or vice versa  I'm not sure).<br/><br/>Some have said that Aronofsky's style as director is a bit cold and distant from his subjects. Technically I agree with that, which is why the performances are all the more important here. While the camera may not be about the heart, the performances must be and accordingly we get a pair of tremendous performances from the two stars. Jackman dominates the film. It must have been difficult to find his character in the midst of so many effects and concepts but he does it and, while you can see a lot of effort is being put in technically in some scenes, he never loses the focus on what he is trying to do. Weisz has less time and less of the material but she does almost as well  really connecting with Jackman and making her acceptance of transition seem convincing  something I saw as key in the delivery. Burstyn has a small role, while famous faces such as Thomas, Margolis, Curtis and Suplee provide solid turns even if their time is limited.<br/><br/>Although he is cold as a director there is no doubting that Aronofsky is a skilled director with a great creative force. His control of the theme across the film sees Libatique producing a wonderful control of light that I cannot even begin to comprehend how he created what he wanted and managed to capture it on film. The space sequences will catch the eye most but I was just as impressed with the use of light in the present-day scenes as the use of distant light, being just out of the light etc was an excellent visual extension of the theme.<br/><br/>As I expected, on the surface of it this is not an easy film to crack and, although not inaccessible, it is understandable why it didn't rip in a massive mainstream audience. However at its core it is a simple and touching tale, that is cleverly expanded thematically across the bookend threads. While the director and talented crew seem to focus on the technical delivery of the themes, they are matched with a masterful turn from Jackman  meaning that the emotion is right there the whole time, holding us in a story that is inventive and technically impressive as much as it is human."

Go to this film with an open mind. <br/><br/>But if you're still here.<br/><br/>I suppose I had a lot of expectations going into The Fountain. Besides the 6 year wait, I truly believed in Aronofsky's potential as a filmmaker. I knew that given the right material (and the right budget) Aronofsky could really make something great. <br/><br/>From the moment the film began, thought, my expectations were completely shattered. I went in thinking I knew what this film would be, but the film proved to completely different. I thought I was going to see a Darren Aronofsky film as I knew them to be, complete with his usual cinematic vocabulary. Gone are the hip hop montages, the split screens, the snorri cam shots. This film worked on a completely different level, which wasn't a bad thing by any means. Just different. It took some getting used to, and I definitely think a second viewing with help with the acclimation (Thankfully, I only have to wait two weeks for Fantastic Fest!!)<br/><br/>In fact, as Aronofsky pointed at the introduction to the film on Tuesday, The Fountain and his previous efforts are completely different. Don't get me wrong. The Fountain is still very much an Aronofsky film in its dizzying use of dozes of layers of thematic ideas, dazzling visuals, and emotionally crippling narratives. <br/><br/>But things feel different this time around. It all boils down the fact that I've simply never had to process a film like The Fountain before, which leaves me both confused and amazed. The structure of the film is pretty much old news by now. Tomas, Tommy, Tom Creo is a man of three different times (1500 Spain & New America, 2006 America, 2500 Space). In the past he is a conquistador struggling to find the tree of life for his queen, Isabella. In the present he is a cancer research specialist struggling to find a cure for the cancer killing his wife, Izzy. And in the future, Tom, a combination of the past and present meditates in deep space, with painful memories and hopes of a solution to his single greatest need. <br/><br/>Once the film shifts into the third act, which is difficult to pinpoint since much of the movie plays like three separate third acts, the film goes into overdrive, relying most on images and the music of Clint Mansell (with Kronos Quarter & Mogwai). It's a powerful conclusion, and while not completely spelled out, more than wraps everything up. More than that, its the most satisfying 20 minutes of film I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>Visually, the film is nothing short of spectacular. Aronofsky did the right thing by not relying solely on computers. Instead, he assembled a hodge-podge of effects crews including Peter Parks crew (microphotography) as well as his long time collaborator (and once roommate) Jeremy Dawson of Amoeba Proteus (Aronofsky and Dawson's SFX company). The visual tapestry they create is jaw-dropping. Trust me. You've never (and most likely will never) seen stuff like this on screen. <br/><br/>The score by Clint Mansell also surprised me. I guess I was expecting Requiem for a Dream II. The music plays throughout most of the film, with only one or two scenes operating in silence. The music is never triumphant (as I thought it would be) and instead creates an organic rhythm that is finally granted release in the most spectacular moment in the film. Sorry, I'm not giving that away. Mogwai's contribution seems to function mostly in the 1500 time period, giving the period piece quite a unique and dangerous edge to it. Of course, the Kronos Quartet amazes again, and really provides the score with some emotion. Those Clint Mansell fans who happen to like his composition, ""The Last Man"" will be happy to know that the theme is prevalent throughout much of the film, and plays over the closing credits.<br/><br/>The editing of the film must've been a large challenge to get right, but for the most part they get it. The film uses a lot of fades, which gives the film a feeling of breathing, of a heart beat. It sets up an interesting rhythm which accelerates as Tommy gets more frantic. <br/><br/>Thematically, the films delves into some pretty heavy territory. There is a scene in the film involving Tommy after Izzy's death which left me feeling uneasy about Tommy's character and where the film was taking me. He decides to continue on with his research, revealing a darker shade of Tommy's character. The Fountain is not an easy film emotionally, and those expecting a Hollywood treatment of the concept of death will be surprised. The Fountain is about accepting death, which is something most people aren't ready to do. I admit I'm not sure if I'm ready to deal with that. However, if the Fountain is even half right about the implications of death, there's really nothing to fear. <br/><br/>Again, The Fountain really surprised me. I wasn't expecting it to turn out the way it did. Instead of being the movie I wanted it to be, it was the movie I'd never even imagined. The Fountain is a beautiful film, and I'm thankful that Warner Bros.gave this film a chance. Thank you, WB & Regency. Forget the reviews, (including this one) and go see this movie for yourself. Give into it. Love the characters Tommy & Izzy as Aronofsky intended. If you do, I promise you the experience will be a completely rewarding one.<br/><br/>Finally, thank you to everyone involved in the making of The Fountain. It was truly a rewarding experience, and worth the wait."

","What a waste of time! I realize that most movies do not live up to the hype or promotion but I had to look several times during the viewing to see if I read the right description. While I appreciate the cinematography and imagery of the film, it still really sucked as a movie. I spent the first hour wondering how they would tie all the ethereal visual crapola together into something resembling coherency, then when I realized they were not even going to try I began to wonder how they would end it gracefully. Guess what?? They didn't. And by that point I was not even surprised.<br/><br/>Then what I found even more discouraging was reading the reviews here. What a bunch of bung. All those pompous morons who haven't a clue what the movie was about going on and on about how graceful and artistic it was. ""I didn't understand exactly what it was about but it must have been good!"" Maybe, it was just incoherent babble!! If I ever have to sit through it again I will turn the sound down and treat it like art, just slightly more mobile. And slightly less interesting.<br/><br/>It would be really nice if people gave honest opinions here, good, bad, or indifferent. If a movie sucks, you can say so without flaming it or being obscene about it. People have a right to know. This movie should not be anywhere near the 7.6 rating it has, even if those that could not watch it all the way through did not bother to vote."

","It purported to be an ""Eternal Love Story"" so I went to the film expecting something spectacular about two people in love. Was totally disappointed that the film didn't deliver what was promised. <br/><br/>What this film is about, is a man in three life-times (reincarnations?) who decides that the ""tree"" of life is more important than a relationship with his love. Isabel/Izzy is left behind, while Tomas/Tommy/Tom is off chasing an obsession. Regardless of his being ordered by Izzy to find the tree of life/fighting against Mayans/cancer/memories, the character of Tom cannot see the forest for the ""tree."" His queen/wife begs for his attention, as she has accepted her own inevitable death, and just wants to share a few moments of quality time with him, (a walk in the snow, a look through a telescope, a read from her journal with feedback.) He refuses because in his hunt for the ultimate cure, his obsession develops, which leaves him with 1500 years of regret.<br/><br/>This is not a romance, it's a morality play. It has some pretty pictures, but the inner core of the script did not tell anything close to a ""great love story for the ages."" Wish the advertising hype had been honest.<br/><br/>This is a tragedy, Shakespearian in scope. It liberally uses ""dark ages Christianity/Eastern philosophical"" images, but there is no truth concepts gleaned from the actual religions. It's images are ""Kung-fu"" meets ""2001-Space Odyssey in a culture cliché.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was the lack of funds and the push to finish quickly, that left the film filled with missing pieces of development. One wonders what was actually filmed and left on the cutting room floor or on the script page. Perhaps it could have been much better. <br/><br/>As is, it's empty, devoid, Dante's inferno. The advertising should have told more about it's ""Death"" themes. But I guess ""hooking"" an audience was of prime importance. Sad."

","This is probably the worst movie ever made. It is like an emo kid that keeps cutting himself, but never goes all the way with it. It was pretentious beyond all measure - reminiscent of spoken word night at the coffee shop down the street. The movie looks like it was made by arts graduates, with below average IQs and armed with an over estimation of their own intelligence.<br/><br/>I rented the movie because the back of the case implied there was going to be some Spanish conquistadors pillaging stuff, and there was, for 2 minutes. Deceiving. The synopsis mentioned conquistadors, a fountain of youth and cancer so I figured this movie must be kickass. In the future, I am officially red flagging all movies with the word 'fountain' in the title. The movie was so obvious, I felt confused at the end because I figured that I must be missing something. I wasn't, the movie is so bloody pedestrian there should have been a 'don't walk' sign over my television. The slow narrative and obvious symbolism made me yawn so wide, I almost swallowed my head. The stupid and lenghty emotional sob sessions made me want my kitchen to catch on fire, just so I would have an excuse to drag my ass from the couch and away form my TV. <br/><br/>What the hell was with the bubble, flying towards the nebula? Did the director actually put that in there? Seriously, this movie tried to hard to be art-house intelligent, that at least 10 well read and emotionally retarded Starbucks baristas must have been consulted during filming.<br/><br/>Anyhow, this movie is pretentious, obvious nonsense made for that part of society that likes to stretch 4 sentences of plot into 2 hours of ridiculous pseudo intellectual posturing.

Contrasting modern characters against characters from 16th Century Spain, and then throwing in a bunch of Zen and psychedelic imagery does not make the movie ""deep.""

","Last year someone went to the time and bother of burning Darren Aronofsky's THE FOUNTAIN on to a DVD to give to me . There's something very flattering when another human being does something for someone , if only to gauge their opinion . Unfortunately neither my DVD player or PC was able to play the DVD so that my viewing pleasure was scuppered . Luckily THE FOUNTAIN was broadcast on Filmfour tonight so made a point of watching it . With hindsight both my DVD player and PC did me a favour because the film is pretentious uninvolving nonsense <br/><br/>I had seen one of Aronofsky's previous films PI a couple of years back and found it very flawed . That was a film full of striking images but Aronofsky showed himself to be a film maker who sacrificed narrative drive for imagery . THE FOUNTAIN carries on in the same flawed style except it's even worse as it's trying to tell three story threads at once and failing to do any of them justice . What makes this even more unforgivable is that at the heart of the film is a theme of eternal love . A love story doesn't have to mawkish or corny , SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is a great example for instance , but I was never engaged by the on screen events . A medical researcher tries to find a cure for his dying wife . Should have tugged at my heart strings just a little - it didn't <br/><br/>The much hyped cinematography and incidental music didn't do anything for me either . In fact I found them both irritating and intrusive . The silhouette of Thomas blocking out a star scape background did impress me but apart from that Matthew Libatique tries too hard to have an impact upon the audience . Cinematography should be a visual supporting character not the main star . Likewise if you're watching a film and you notice the score you should be thinking "" Oh what beautiful music , it really enhances this scene for me "" not "" For goodness sake will someone please tell that bloke to get off the violin because it sounds like someone scraping their nails down a blackboard ""<br/><br/>There is also a philosophical aspect of which you will shape an opinion on THE FOUNTAIN and that is - "" Do you want to live forever ? "" In my opinion no . Why would anybody want to ? Total eternity full of existentialist angst at the unfairness of life , of having doing things you don't like , of rejection and alienation and watching pretentious drivel masquerading as cinema . Total oblivion for the rest of eternity will suit me fine"

Save yourself 90 minutes of your life and do anything other than watch this film, I only wish someone had given me this advice sooner. The only good thing about the movie is that she finally dies at the end and he gets sucked into some vortex, I only wish the same could happen to Darren Aronofsky.

","Let me preface this by stating that I have NEVER posted a movie review on here, and rarely do I rate a movie. I've been using IMDb for years now, and this is the first time I had the will to write a review.<br/><br/>This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. That's not to say that the story was not interesting, or that it didn't have great potential. However, it felt as though the movie was a short indie film that expanded itself into a series of montages that were so drab that I wanted to hang myself. I did enjoy parts of the ""conquistador"" storyline, but other than those 10 minutes, I spent the rest of the time, as did the other 4 movie buffs who watched it with me, in disbelief that projects like this get funded. However, it makes some sense since this project was delayed/scrapped at least one time (7 years ago). I was even more surprised by the comments and ratings this drivel received on here. I've come to the conclusion that people who enjoy movies like these enjoy them strictly because A) They make you ""think"" (which granted, is a good thing, but I much prefer PBS, books, and the news for that type of programming  also, this movie gets tagged as being ""intellectual"", but I'm having a hard time figuring out how the retelling of different ancient creation myths makes this film ""smart""), and B) it's ""cool"" to like artsy garbage with little to no substance. In essence, this film had Memento's brilliance of story going for it, but Battlefield Earth's outcome. Wait, I gave Battlefield Earth a 2 star rating out of 10. I regress.<br/><br/>I had all the intentions in the world to write a nice long rant regarding why I disliked this film, with specific references, but I have just realized that I would lose more of my time with this horrible and egocentric ""masterpiece"".<br/><br/>Unless you enjoy pretentious existential story lines and film-making, please avoid this thing like the plague. If you're looking for a ""love story"" in the general sense of the term (which I knew it was not), avoid, avoid, avoid. If you like artsy movies that tell a 15 mins story in 90 mins, this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>Now you can all attack me for not having the ""class"" to enjoy this film, whatever that means.<br/><br/>1 out of 10  would have received a 0 but I liked the cast."

The idea of a non-linear narrative spanning thousands of years, with allegories of spirituality and faith is very very promising. It has moments of beauty and so many beautiful ideas behind it. This film could be great.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the final product is a film so flaccid and genuinely unexciting that I feel my girlfriend (who slept through it) got the better deal. There is something unique about this film in that not only does its plot and script not deliver, but the performances Jackman and Wiesz are completely and utterly uninteresting, despite their working overtime in the acting department - no matter how much Jackman weeps and smashes things up over the limp Weisz the film remains utterly uninteresting.<br/><br/>Ultimately the overriding pseudo-intellectual pomposity wins over the powerful premise of the film and the terminal anti-climax left me absolutely unfulfilled.<br/><br/>Trust me, folks, this film is not worth the money nor the time and effort - and I have found merit in The Toxic Avenger.

"daniel-lehmann-66402","10","3","3","7 May 2020"," This is a masterpiece.
","This review will be totally superficial - without spoilers.
Reason is, I think this movie should be seen without knowing what to expect.
On top of that, I found that 'the Fountain' is a movie, that makes you want to dig a little deeper afterwards and that might leave you there, wanting to know more, go online and search for answers, opinions, thoughts... interpretations?
The first time I watched it, was with 15 years - back in 2006 - and I fell in love with it, right away. And I have to say one thing, right as we're getting started: If you consider watching this movie, don't let yourself be fooled by the trailer.
---<br/><br/>With 'The Fountain' Darren Aronofsky created one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.
What may seem like a simple drama about love & death after watching the trailer, evolves into a true piece of art where the music, the visual fx, the acting and what lies in between melt together into an emotional journey that leaves you breathless - if you let it.
I admit, this movie might not be for everyone and it's most definitely not an easy one. The Fountain is filled with details you might not even realize the first time you see it. You're just being thrown into the story without knowing what's up exactly and you have to be very attentive from there on.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman & Rachel Weisz were delivering the performances of their life, with most people out there not even knowing about this film.<br/><br/>Clint Mansell (& The Kronos Quartet) created the perfect (and I truly mean perfect) soundtrack for this movie. I've never heard a soundtrack that comes even close when it gets to perfectly underline what we see on screen.<br/><br/>
The Fountain is not an easy one, not a feel-goog movie.
It's meant to be watched alone, when you're fully there, to experience it.
It's when it shows it's true beauty, when you're able to feel your emotions to the fullest. It's an cathartic experience that The Fountain offers - and it's one worth taking.<br/><br/>It's been fourteen years since the movie came out and to this day I see it as a treasure and it's still in my Top 10 films of all-time.<br/><br/>And for one last time I have to mention the music:
It's so beautiful, it hurts.<br/><br/>If - at one point in your life - you truly(!) felt what we describe as love & passion and you are open minded towards thinking about the cycle of life & death, give this amazing creation a shot!"
"Saw-it-on-Tubi","8","3","3","17 January 2019"," Not for everyone
","Have you ever been to a movie night where someone was just confused the whole time? Or someone needed everything on the screen explained to them instead of just watching things play out, thus ruining the movie experience for everyone else? I have a strong feeling this film will prompt that if you attempt to watch this at a party with your friends. Like a lot of artistic endeavors, this film goes beyond the bounds of reality, which some may find off-putting.<br/><br/>The trick with this film is that the story is nonlinear. In other words you have to watch all of it to make sense of the pieces, resulting in many ""wait, what?"" moments throughout. Considering what this movie is trying to convey, I'm a bit shocked by the relatively short runtime. I think because of the shorter length, the parts do not feel overly drawn out. The film doesn't sit you down and explain itself; it lets you put it together. Whether that is a task you want to undertake is up to you."

Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. In fact, it seemed that the same three or four scenes were showed over and over again. One of my friends fell asleep for about fifteen minutes during the show. When he woke up, the same scene was playing - he didn't miss a thing. I wish I had fallen asleep.<br/><br/>Interested in seeing this film? Watch the trailer and you'll see the all the interesting parts. If you want to see the rest of the film after the trailer, go gaze up at the sky for twenty minutes, look through a microscope for about a half hour, then go hug a tree for fifteen more minutes - it will be much more satisfying for you."

","There's a lot going for this film. The CGI is exceptional as are the performances. There's beauty in every part from the actors' performances, direction and CGI/visuals.<br/><br/>So why not a higher score?
The message of the film isn't ludicrous but it has been explored before many times. Is death a necessary part of life? Can we conquer it? Should we even be trying? It's not a bad set of questions to ask. But as the film develops you're repeatedly pounded on the head by a weak analogy with a tree of life. When you get to the last twenty minutes of the film the analogy becomes actively irritating.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth a watch. Just don't expect anything hugely thought provoking."

I also learned the director spent six years to complete this film. In this time one should come up with something fresh and new. Others say he did. I second-guessed almost every line, almost every cut, every dolly back. Like a hundred minutes pop video, stuffed with inappropriate references to Maya culture, oncology, inquisition an so on.

","Let me start by saying I adore films with obscure or unique plots that challenge the viewer, I hoped this would be one of them... it was not. It was the most over rated film I've ever watched off the back of a respectable IMDb rating. <br/><br/>Any person hoping this was going to be a voyage in to deeper spiritual ideas is going to be left confused because you'll spend the film looking for the deep ideas, only to discover that the deepest it gets is ""we're all going to die"", well excuse my French, but ""No 'do-do' Sherlock"". <br/><br/>Anyone wanting twists and turns and an unexpected conclusion is going to be disappointed too, as above, you spend the film hoping for a good twist or original idea, and don't get any.<br/><br/>Just because an awful lot of people are giving it 10/10 does not mean this is worth £6.99 of your money, all it means is they saw how pretty the visuals are and most likely didn't understand it (and how shallow and naive the plot was), ergo it must be amazing. Something along the lines of ""It's art because someone arty says it is"". <br/><br/>Ironically, the performance from Jackman and Weisz is very good, shame about everything else.<br/><br/>So in summary, if you think Hugh Jackman floating in space in the lotus position equates to deep and meaningful, go for it and the best of luck, if you have an IQ over 35 and aren't wowed by pretty images or you just want a story line that has some cohesion and substance then give this one a miss."
"DJRumpy","3","25","45","26 November 2006"," Nothing more than a screen saver with a minor plot
","I so wanted to like this movie. The previews were very eye catching, and the premise was also very good. A thousand year epic. Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. It's more like 15 minutes from a Spanards point of view, and another 40 or so from 'current day'. The rest is all fluff with no filler.<br/><br/>I came across as not much more than a screen saver with a very small plot. The entire movie had maybe 30 to 40 minutes of actual character discourse. The rest was pretty scenery.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Hugh had a great performance here, although with so little to work with it was difficult to get emotionally involved in any of the characters. The film simply tries to be a bit TOO artsy, without the meat of the story to back it up. It's somewhat disjointed and wispy. I would guess that a better editing job might have helped, but not enough to bring this one out of it's own daydream.<br/><br/>The film starts up by just dropping you into a scene, completely lost. At first I thought this might be intentional except for the fact that the character himself (hugh) is not the slightest bit confused as to where he is. It doesn't do much to help with that fact, even after 10 minutes. I kept waiting for some sort of narrative, hint of a time line, starting place, stopping place, etc. They took far to long to appear. Once you finally start to get your bearings, it simply drops the story for another 10 minutes of very pretty scenery. This sequence is repeated throughout the entire film. It is a shame, because the movie has great potential, both with the current day story line, and the Spanish conquistador storyline. The acting that we do get to see if quite good, but with litterly no story behind it, it simply isn't enough. Many on here may claims some lofty hidden meaning in the film, or strive to give it acclaim for being a new vision in movie making. I simply think they are still a bit dazzled by the effects/visuals, which I must agree are quite nice.<br/><br/>Even the ending is rather abrupt and unfulfilling.

"neil-476","1","12","19","27 September 2008"," A lot less than meets the eye
","Invading Iraq must have looked good on paper, but it didn't turn out too well in practice. The Fountain is a lot like that. A sci-fi/fantasy epic with Hugh Jackman, addressing universal truths - must be great, right? Wrong.<br/><br/>This film only runs about 80 minutes without the closing credits. And a good 10 minutes of that is material which gets repeated during the movie. So how come I kept checking my watch repeatedly from less than 10 minutes after the start? There are two reasons. One, this film is stupefyingly dull. Two, it is mystifyingly incomprehensible. The narrative is non-linear in places where it doesn't need to be. Things remain unexplained. The audience is cast completely adrift and isn't even offered a smidgen of assistance to navigate their way through the disparate sections. And every slowly dripping second bears evidence of just how self-awarely clever the filmmakers were being. Far more clever than me, obviously (and, oh, how I hate it when filmmakers rub your nose in how clever they are and you aren't! Have a browse through other reviews, and see how many of them are by people who are impressed by it but confess they don't understand it. And those who say they understand it, but don't! Ambiguity leading to multiple interpretations is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean that it just might not be quite as clever as you thought. <br/><br/>Let me try to explain the story - and you must bear in mind that this is an attempted linear narrative constructed from segments which are delivered in what appears to be a fairly random order, none of which is ever fully explained. Hugh Jackman is a conquistador who is sent by Queen Isabella of Spain (Rachel Weisz) to the New World to find the Tree of Life (apparently God moved it there from the Holy Land, He alone knows why). The purpose of this is so that the Queen and the Conquistador will both live for ever and the Inquisition will be overturned (huh?). Jackman finds the Tree of Life, gobbles down loads of sap, and sprouts so many cabbages that he dies/becomes one with nature/God or something equally improbable / incomprehensible. Meanwhile in present day, research scientist Hugh Jackman is on the brink of discovering a cure for cancer, just in time to save his wife Izzi (geddit? Rachel Weisz again) who is suffering from a brain tumour. Whoops, too late. She is buried in the middle of a snow-covered wilderness, but not before telling Jackman to finish the last chapter of a book she has been beautifully hand-writing, which appears to be telling the story of the Conquistador. She even gives him an elaborate dip pen to use to write it (he, the fool, uses it to tattoo an ink wedding ring on his finger to replace the one which went missing in the lab. And/or at the Tree of Life if you believe that he is the same person as the Conquistador despite having become a cabbage patch). Meanwhile - or later - Jackman is living as a bald monk hermit in a huge gold Christmas tree ornament which contains a tree. I was a bit confused as to whether this was the Tree of Life or a tree which contained the essence of Rachel Weisz (or both). I wasn't confused as to how it and/or Jackman got into the Christmas Tree ornament, or why they were drifting about in gold ether - I simply don't know, because it was never explained. Jackman has been spending his time using his dip pen to tattoo further rings up and down his arms, shouting angrily at manifestations of Rachel Weisz, nibbling bits of tree bark, and hovering about in lotus position (get on with the last chapter Hugh, you've been there long enough for armsful of tattoos!). And then he leaves the Christmas Tree ornament and hovers off into the ether until he disappears in a blaze of light. The end.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the special features on the DVD feature a riveting sequence of bald monk Jackman preparing mushroom soup in extreme closeup. Can't understand why they cut that from the movie, he said sarcastically.<br/><br/>I must also offer a couple of words of comment about the soundtrack music. ""Constant"" and ""Dreary.""<br/><br/>This film was pretentious codswallop of the first order. I have no doubt that the filmmakers thought they were producing something of major importance and artistic impact. So, I suggest, did the tailor who produced the Emperor's New Clothes.<br/><br/>The IMDb is littered with comments by people saying ""This is the worst movie I have ever seen"". I am easily pleased and would not lightly make that remark and, in fairness, there are some striking visuals and the basic idea, dealt with in a less ""artistic"" manner may well have made a half-decent movie. So I wouldn't say this is the worst movie I have ever seen, but I would say that it is one of the least entertaining movies I have ever seen, and I regard it as a major blot on the CV of Jackman, an actor whose work I have otherwise enjoyed (Weisz? Meh).<br/><br/>If you like self-important drivel, then this is the film for you. If not, avoid it like the plague."

","I just saw The Fountain last night in a tiny indie theatre and have not been able to stop thinking about it since. There is something truly haunting about this film. I started watching it, somewhat familiar with non-narrative films, but having never been so affected by one as this one affected me. The film provokes something very human out of its audience. I can remember being one of seven people in the audience (having had a full house in the beginning) and still watching the credits afterward, sharing a very similar strange sensation. It wasn't joy. It wasn't sorrow. It was just feeling a part of something that I can't explain, and I think the movie is something quite remarkable for being able to do that.<br/><br/>I don't particularly feel like commenting on the performances of this film or the visuals because that is all anyone has been talking about lately. Both are spectacular without a doubt, but what I would rather talk about is this very 50/50 split between people on this film. (Everyone loves controversy.) The critics in my opinion have been very harsh about the film's approach to the story and how they consider it incoherent. The Fountain is a film of its own narrative and a very original one at that, I would argue, so it is no wonder why audiences are divided, but the critics are people who should be used to this kind of thing if they are true movie critics. These people have obviously never been able to sit through a David Lynch film. The Fountain evokes a much more harmonious feeling through its non-linear narrative than any Lynchian film could, which is new for me. However, many critics (I'm directing this to those who submit to Rottentomatos.com) are calling the film too artsy-fartsy and accusing Aronofsky of being too pretentiously... Well, of course the film is pretentiously. It's art. Has our culture become so used to being spoon-fed basic plot narratives that we have grown an aversion to art when art is not necessarily coherent or makes us uncomfortable in some way? I am usually not one for the experimental narrative, but part of going to the movies used to be about seeing something you've never seen before... Well, I can't say I've seen anything like The Fountain quite before, so I consider it a success in my mind.<br/><br/>Don't go into The Fountain expecting a typical film, because it isn't that. It reads more like a poem than a film and I can understand why the average moviegoer would stray away from seeing something like that. The critics I am a bit more disappointed with, but hey! Tenacious D and The Pick of Destiny is playing too and that movie is very enjoyable if you'd just rather watch a movie and not think."

We laughed so hard, we couldn't get out of our seats. We laughed at the ridiculousness of this movie.<br/><br/>I still do not understand how this movie was ever made.. it's just so bad.

Seeing it at the Hamptons Film Festival, where there were a substantial number of walk-outs, my seat-mate, a complete stranger, turned to me at the end and said ""I feel like I need a shower.""

This film is simply an embarrassment.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" has to be one of the most awesome vanity projects ever conceived. One can only imagine that the success of his previous projects has gone to the director's head, and that he is surrounded by yes-men. The film is a hodgepodge of pseudo-science and mysticism. Trees morph into nebulae, monk-like figures in seated-lotus position float away in bubbles, and apparently we're supposed to be impressed by the Deep Inner Meaning of it all . However, behind this here is little plot to speak of, and there is NO character development and NO visible editing . If you cut up the last half-hour of the film and rearranged the pieces randomly it would be indistinguishable from the finished project. (In fact maybe that's how they did it...) If you like having a friend describe to you, in excruciating and exhaustive detail, the step-by-step progression of his latest acid trip, then this is the film for you.<br/><br/>The rating scale on this site can not do this film justice - negative numbers, anyone?"

","I was privilege enough to snag tickets to the Toronto premier. It was cool to hear from the ""A"" man himself, Clint Mansell, Rachel Weisz and Ellen Burstyn. Hugh Jackman had apparently committed himself to a stage thingy in Australia.<br/><br/>""I'm glad that this audience has a lot of film makers in it. I have a feeling this movie will strike a special cord with those in the art form. I made Pi and Requiem when I was a snotty little brat. Go into watching this with no expectations, clear your mind of the last two. This one is it"" said Aaronofski.<br/><br/>The only expectation I had was that I knew it was going to be well put together and ironically, the story was so incredible that I found myself unable to pay attention to the craft. Ever watch a movie that you liked when you were younger and see nothing but all the mistakes the film maker made? Ever find yourself in the theatre being so understimulated that all you can do is pay attention to is the physical movie? This was not an option with The Fountain. After stepping out of the Elgin I couldn't even speak. My friend and I walked to the GO station in complete silence. This actually allowed us to listen to the conversations of other groups of people who had seen the movie. ""Oh they had such a good story going there! Why did they have to ruin it?""<br/><br/>It seems that most people can't wrap their head around it. I'll try to review it without ruining it for you. The movie takes place in three separate stories about the main character, Tom Verde (Jackman). One takes place in modern day, another in Spain in the past and another in the far future. Each story presents a different angle on the character, giving you an incredibly profound understanding of what the he is going through. People had trouble understanding that the separate instances held an equal weight in the story as a whole. They saw it as a normal guy with two wacky art film sub narratives. Technically, it's a masterpiece. The imagery of stars saturated the entire movie. Every frame seemed to imbibe this golden glow. It's also kinda neat that I found out my sound teacher was lead on post audio, which also was complete led with incredible finesse.<br/><br/>My biggest fear is that this film goes unappreciated. Best Aaronofski yet in my opinion. Though I can say the only fault is has is that it expects a lot from it's audience. If you can't invest yourself in a film, you won't like this movie."

","Sitting through this movie was one of the most difficult ordeals I've had to endure. I couldn't wait to get out of the theatre. I laughed out loud during supposedly emotional/profound scenes. It was all so absurd.<br/><br/>To begin with, the movie has no substance. It has the most bland plot I've experienced. I wouldn't have minded watching a very slow-paced film that deals entirely with one man coming to terms with the death of his beloved. But this movie was plain absurd, with pretentious ramblings by flaky characters who invoke Mayan legends and immortality. Can we just leave the Mayan stuff alone already? I mean, I know Europeans went around killing indigenous people all over the world and their descendants might have quite a bit of guilt associated with it, but please stop fetishizing and romanticizing all these supposedly genuine indigenous tales of creation and death.<br/><br/>Also, what's up with all the New Age crap (again back to the romanticization of ""Other"" cultures)? Are people really ridiculous enough to buy this clichéd crap for art? The soundtrack, and the repeated, annoying imagery of the protagonist (complete with shaved head and everything, in Lotus position), levitating and contained within some vesicle/floating globulet. God, even someone from grade 4 could be challenged to come up with more imaginative and creative stuff. What a bunch of fluff. The fact that audiences might appreciate this film scares me. I want to feel that people are more demanding than that.<br/><br/>I felt there wasn't a single genuine moment in this film. I was never able to identify with any component of the film, let alone the characters. Now, I am not by any means a film snob - I enjoy a huge range of films of several varieties. The genre is dear to me - funny films, romance films, slow films, action films, artfully done films, experimental films, etc. But I can't stress enough that this film is terrible in its conception and execution."

","I registered an account just to write a review of this movie. It is bad bad bad bad BAD.<br/><br/>This movie is NOT ""brilliant"", nor ""deep"", nor ""soulful"", nor ""romantic"". It certainly tries to be all of those things, and for the supremely ignorant it will no doubt succeed. But for anyone who knows anything about religion, particularly Eastern religions, it will only be a trite and never-ending bunch of nonsense. Just because you throw in some Buddhist symbology and meditation doesn't make a movie deep, especially when you use it the wrong way. Meditation is done to ESCAPE longing and desire. In real life, Wolverine would have thrown the ring away, not put it on his finger. The scene of him meditating in the air in the Mayan temple was especially absurd. As if this wasn't enough, the director decided to throw in some pseudo-Christianity and Mayan ""First Father"", finally reaching the Holy Grail of utter nonsense. And God moved the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden to the top of a hidden Mayan Temple. Apparently God left afterward, because there is no chance of redemption and meeting on distant shores, only floating in space hallucinating with a dead tree.<br/><br/>Besides this, the ""love"" between Wolverine and Izzy was almost imperceptible. And understandably so: Izzy is a moron who can't ever stop babbling about the Mayans and the magic star and blah blah blah. She can, however, write a book that contains just as much nonsense, and which Wolverine finishes when he is not meditating in space, tattooing himself, or fighting for ""Spain"". The best part of the movie is when Izzy finally dies, because 1) she stops talking, and 2) you know the movie can't possibly go on much longer, but mostly 1).<br/><br/>This movie sucks. Requiem was a powerful and memorable movie; The Fountain makes you feel like Darren Aronofsky hates you personally.

","Before I go any further I'd just like to say that my wife & I only watched this film after reading the glowing (and in some cases awe-filled) user reviews here on IMDb. We won't be making that mistake again! Frankly, anybody that was 'blown-away' by the 'deep spiritual message' contained in this film must have ; a) never picked up a book on spirituality before, or b) really enjoy hard to follow, slow paced films that are virtually devoid of anything approaching a decent storyline.<br/><br/>We had the feeling after about 30 minutes of dark, drearily slow & frankly boring screen time that this could possibly be a waste of time, but nothing prepared us for the realisation that we had just wasted a good Saturday evening on a 'message' that could have been said in one sentence, and delivered with more flair and imagination than this.<br/><br/>Basically is 3 story lines running at once. The first is a very shabby, badly lit and constantly repetitive yarn about a Spanish queen and one of her employees on the hunt for the tree of life. The second, and only vaguely interesting one, is about a medical researcher / surgeon, (your guess is as good as mine as nothing is explained properly in this film), who is trying to save his dying wife by finding a cure for her brain (again just guessing here) tumor. The last is basically hugh jackman floating around space in a bubble and hugging a tree.<br/><br/>The latter is the most annoying aspect of this film as it neither says nor provokes anything at all. Of course not forgetting the underlying trait of this film not explaining who, when, how or why he is in this bubble in the first place. I've read other reviews here that go on about him being a 25th century astronaut grieving for his dead wife.... where exactly is that mentioned in the film? Overall a dull, uninspiring dumbing down of the age old theory of everlasting life.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman puts on a great show, as always, and it's made even better by the fact that he had so little to work with.<br/><br/>Where this film does excel is in it's total disregard for anything deep and spiritual. If this was to taken as written we all basically end up in the ground and there is no need to worry about any sort of spiritual progression or higher learning.<br/><br/>If you have any interest in the afterlife or spirituality don't waste your time with this.. You'll walk away confused - not due to the lack of any plot or explanation - but because your head will spin wondering how a film with virtually no real content ever got a green light."

","This is the only movie that has had me wanting to leave the theatre. It is an interesting story that could have been accomplished much better. The stunning visuals only served to confuse the metaphor the movie tried to express. The film direction was stuffy and prolonged. Unnecessary close-ups stifled dialog, while unessential pauses and scenes that should have been cut shorter killed interest. Environmental lighting darkened the film at every turn setting a dismal tone throughout the entire movie. Changes in this lighting could have complimented transitions between scenes/time periods. The conclusion was overly ambiguous and slightly contrived. Any casual movie-goer will not appreciate this movie, and anyone who loves 'deep' movies will still question the quality of this film. This is a 'thinker' movie that does not accomplish its purpose and leaves you wanting more than just your eight dollars back. Few movies have actually earned my passion of disdain, this is one. Hugh Jackman's acting was great but, at points, seemed forced. Rachel Weiss' acting was entrancing, but her character was not real to me, not to her fault though. But all this was overshadowed by the lack of continuity of characters and concepts between realities. The film assumes the dignity of a deep movie and tries to dazzle with pretty colors, but it is pretentious in assuming it has a deep-inner meaning."

So you are cutting between the stores, and you are going back and forth inside each story. <br/><br/>And the final point is, well, you will have to try and figure it out because it is not clear at all.

","The only compliment I can pay ""The Fountain"" is that it's not ordinary. However, a little ordinariness might have helped this nearly unwatchable mess of a movie.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has made a cerebral, abstract film completely lacking any ounce of emotional significance. It comes across as one of those films that one person had too much control of. I can't believe for a second that there weren't people around Aronofsky who thought this movie was completely indigestible bilge; unfortunately, none of them had the balls to tell him so.<br/><br/>In ""The Fountain,"" Hugh Jackman plays some sort of doctor in the near future who is engaged in research to slow the aging process (or something -- I was never entirely clear on this point). His wife (Rachel Weisz, a long way away from ""The Constant Gardener"") is dying of a brain tumor, and curing her with these new but unperfected methods becomes an obsession of Jackman's. Meanwhile, she has written a book about a Spanish Conquistador during the inquisitions (Jackman again) who is sent by Queen Isabella (Weisz again) to find the famed tree of life. And as if that weren't enough, another version of Jackman (this one bald, looking like a cross between Kevin Spacey and Dr. Evil) floats around space in a big bubble with said tree of life (which I think we are meant to think at this point is Weisz in her immortal form) pausing occasionally to break off pieces of its bark to eat.<br/><br/>All of this is treated with utmost seriousness and earnestness, and the results are ridiculous. The tone of the film is one of unrelenting gloom, with sombre music and muted line readings. Jackman is not nearly a capable enough actor to handle this role, though to be fair, I don't know that anyone else would be either. He mostly just looks sad and harried, and the only difference between any of the incarnations of him is in how much hair he has on his head and face (there's the hairy Jackman, the moderately hairy Jackman and the shaved Jackman). Weisz mostly floats around in a stranded role as no more than something for Jackman to respond to. Arronofsky apparently was able to convince both of them to take this nonsense seriously, and the results are simply embarrassing at times. My wife and I laughed out loud more than once, and trust me, nothing in this movie was meant to be funny. But the climax, in which the Conquistador begins to gobble sap from the tree of life, only to have flowers erupt from all of his bodily orifices, is a tour de force of unintentional screen comedy.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn inexplicably shows up in a small role as Jackman's boss. I have to believe she only agreed to do so as a favor to Aronofsky for giving her such a good role in his ""Requiem for a Dream."" <br/><br/>Grade: F"

This movie is an artistic way of telling us that we become one with nature when we die. The problem is that it's not good art.

So I thought, okay, maybe it'll get better in a second. 20 minutes pass, and this movie kept jumping from one year to the next, and back. I was SO confused I thought my head was going to explode. I whisper to the person next to me and asked, ""Do you get this?"" They say, ""No, not at all!"" The acting was just terrible, Hugh Jackman didn't fit the part, the picture was way too dark, but WAY too bright at points that the ENTIRE theater actually had to shield their eyes! What felt like 2 hours(it was actually 1) passed and people kept leaving the theater in frustration. The movie had no plot, no good acting and SERIOUSLY made NO. SENSE. AT. ALL!! If you've ever seen a LOST episode, its either reruns or flashbacks. This film was A TON of flashbacks, but they were flashing back to parts of the movie we had already seen! It was just a disaster! When the movie ended, no one clapped. Everyone kind of just glimpsed at each other for five seconds then everyone started to laugh out of confusion. This movie is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, with 'The WILD' being a distant second. Please don't waste your money on this. I got in for free and felt ripped off myself.

While I find those types of movies entertaining, I also enjoy slower paced movies that make you think as well. This movie failed on both counts.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the acting was top notch, no complaints there. It was also filmed in a very interesting way, but it was over the top. I felt like I wanted to stand up and scream ""OK! I get it, you are trying to come up with interesting scenes and angles - enough already!"" It just was a bit much.<br/><br/>Here are the reasons I didn't like it.<br/><br/>#1, There IS no story here. Looking back, I am kinda scratching my head trying to figure out how it possibly was a full-length movie, because going from memory, it seems like 15 minutes worth of events. I was SO sick of seeing the same shots OVER and OVER again, and hearing the same lines repeated as though they carried the weight of the world...it was just wearing.<br/><br/>I am not a student of cinematography working on a class project. I don't want to spend the next few days trying to figure out what in the world was going on. I want to be entertained, moved, or influenced in some way, not annoyed at the waste of money and Saturday evening. Guess which one of those this movie succeeded at...<br/><br/>#2, The message doesn't get much more simple. Yeah, stuff dies, circle of life, blah. Congratulations, you can join The Lion King as a film of incredible gravity.<br/><br/>#3, Whatever the heck was going on in this train wreck of a film, there definitely was no reason to hop around as much as it did. Even for whatever (I think) it was trying to accomplish, it was just cumbersome and felt sloppy.<br/><br/>I have never used drugs, but I imagine the experience to be something like watching this film.

","Let me say at the onset that I would like to recommend this if only based on the passion. I have a special interest in filmmakers who feature their lovers. This man is so deeply in love with this woman that you cannot but be aroused by the depth, the urge, the engagement.<br/><br/>In that sense it is real, a love story that connects  and is as a result extremely powerful.<br/><br/>But as a film instead of a love experience, it fails. I hate to report this, because the man is so cinematic and adventuresome. But the problem is that he structures his projects in ways that are supposed to matter. <br/><br/>He built ""Pi"" in a way that was supposed to reflect mathematical hallucination of genius. He structured ""Requiem"" so that it was not only a story about the dissolution of a mind through addiction, but displayed in that manner. The problem is that ""Pi's"" structure had about as much to do with inspired insight as macaroni and cheese. ""Requiem"" was coherent, but the devolution in the vision had little to do with the way things really happen.<br/><br/>This is a love story, told with love, and permeated by love. So he has that right, but where the especially considered structure is concerned, he is as incompetent as before. Its too bad. I believe that narrative folding of the sort he tries here is the future. I believe so because it can greatly enhance the power of storytelling and in particular cinematic narrative.<br/><br/>I believe in a generation, everyone other than the nostalgic will be working this way intuitively. Its why it pains me to say that in terms of the folding here, its a failure. Oh, it has all the slices: reverse narrative: parallel narrative. One narrative writing (or dreaming or magically projecting) another. A life as planet, a love as religion. A death as life. A walk not walk. Expectations as beginnings. Mechanically, its all there.<br/><br/>But it isn't connected. The passion of the story which really, truly makes this film matter is not connected at all to the narrative devices employed. It the broom playing with the toaster in the foreground which in the background the couple makes love.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","From what I could gather, everyone in the theater, including myself hated this movie. Very boring. Extremely repetitive - some scenes are repeated over and over so many times I gave up counting. Constant flashbacks (seemingly every 30 seconds). SUPER close-up shots thru most of the flick. Drab, dull and dark. Endless tears,tears and more tears. Way too much for any one movie. Everyone I've spoken to says this is the dumbest or worst movie they've seen. The director neglects the fact that an audience needs to feel a connection for a romance to work on screen. Shedding tears only works if the viewer cares about the character and their plight. Flashbacks only work if the story line is and remains established, and should be limited. If boring films were illegal, the producers of this gem would be behind bars. Some reviewers try to play this off as ""deep"", ""sensitive"" and ""spiritual"". No. It's just dumb."
"pfehrman-1","1","21","41","25 November 2006"," wanted my money back!
","This was not the movie that the trailer lead me to believe that it was. It was 'artsy' and not a love story the way I would have imagined it to be (and hoped it to be). I sat through the whole movie thinking ""I sure wish I hadn't wasted my money on this"".<br/><br/>There was a film festival type short film here that was dragged out by repetitive (boring) scenes in order to lengthen it for the regular cinema. For example, Hugh's only 'happy' memory was the same vision of his dying wife running (I assume) through a part of their house laughing. This memory replay was vague at best and played like it was the only reason for his desire to blow off what little time he had left with his wife and to yell at her constantly even in the bubble. Personally, when I have happy thoughts about those that I love, I have many to choose from. This part seemed an extremely lame attempt of portrayal of 'happy memories' that were driving him mentally and physically. <br/><br/>But even that was not the worst of the movie. The worst was the future bubble in the nebula where Hugh became bald bubble boy. Oh my how that sucked the life out of the plot. It was by far the worst of the worst. Eating the 'hairy' tree (of life?) and Hugh 'inking' himself to death. Bald is beautiful they say; but what was it with the bald Hugh in the bubble? Making him a bald, tree eating, ink inflicting bubble boy floating around in a dead star nebula was just ridiculous; kind of like nails on a chalk board annoying artsy stuff. And where was the fountain that the movie was named for? In fact there was no fountain but just two trees. In the end, the tree did not extend his life but devoured it and turned him into a plot of flowers next to the tree (becareful what you wish for?).<br/><br/>I admit, I'm not a big fan of the ""I'm doing this but it means that"" type of art form. Whether it's on a canvas or on film, it is not my preference in entertainment. And all of these people commenting on how great the film is based on those factors...well, I can't relate because to me it was a great story idea ruined by the director's need to impose the 'figure out what I'm trying to say' film making technique rather than something that should have been finite and not open to so much interpretation and debate by the viewers. I'm not saying that I don't like a good 'figure it out as you go' movie, but something that has some real substance to it rather than so much vagueness and need to repeat scenes so often to fill up the empty space of the plot.<br/><br/>It's too bad too, because there were stars in this movie that I've enjoyed watching in the past, but this was not their magnum opus by any stretch of the imagination. The director went out of his way to make Hugh as ugly as he could; not only physically, but as a shallow person.<br/><br/>I can see this movie being redone with all of that in mind and make a true work of art in cinema by taking away the emptiness of this movie and filling it up with plot and acting that leaves you fulfilled instead of being left wanting for an actual story with some meat to it. This film should have stayed with film festivals instead of big screen cinema. There was just too much of the movie that didn't make any sense because it was played too much as 'artsy' instead of structured to deliver a real story line complete from beginning to end.<br/><br/>But having said that; if you like the artsy, it doesn't make sense movies, than this one will be a winner for you. Based on the comments here, there are a lot of folks who like this kind of stuff and I don't begrudge them that. But in all fairness, I do prefer movie trailers to give more accurate accounting of what I'm paying to see and this was not the story I had expected. Like I said, it should have stayed on the art festival level and not at my local movie theatre. <br/><br/>For me, I will be careful NOT to see anymore movies done by this particular director because he clearly has a style that I don't enjoy."

","It's not just a movie, it's a revelation. This film explores the emotional and spiritual highlights of a human life ever since we came to, all the way where ever we may go to. The story is about timeless topics like life, death, love, faith, hope, all which conjure big emotions that are brilliantly expressed by both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. But the biggest star of the show is the Writer/Director Darren Aronofsky for trying so hard to bring this enlightening experience to us. This movie almost never got made twice and it did even worse at the box office but in time, like The Shawshank Redemption, people will understand it's value. For those of you looking for a movie that's meaningful buy this film and embark on this timeless philosophical journey."

","I noticed that everyone said that this movie was spectacular, but when I saw it, the entire time I'm sitting there trying to figure out exactly what's going on. It made absolutely NO sense whatsoever and was pretty pointless. Total waste of money. When the movie was over, no one in the entire audience moved for at least 30 seconds, the credits were rolling and we were all trying to decide if that really was the ending. I tried to get into it, I really did, but it's basically 3 scenes playing over and over and over again throughout the entire thing. You think you're seeing one thing at one point and then it immediately switches to another thing, and then to another, none of it made any sense. Waste of money, waste of time, and waste of film space. I wouldn't suggest it. The only decent thing about it was the music, but that's usually pretty good in all movies."
"hall895","3","23","46","11 January 2008"," What a mess
","The Fountain is one of those movies which when you say you didn't like it those who did like it get very pretentious and say ""Well you just didn't get it"". No, I got it. And I hated it. It's nonsensical, interminable and in the end quite laughable. Just an absolute mess. This film spends 96 minutes (and it seems infinitely longer) beating you over the head with how important it is. Writer/director Darren Aronofsky is apparently very concerned with getting across his point about life and death and the meaning of it all. Maybe there is a powerful message in here somewhere. Too bad the message is stuck in such a terrible movie.<br/><br/>Trying to unravel the plot here is really a waste of time. Suffice to say it's a lot simpler than it seems. Really it's not that hard to ""get it"". Unfortunately even if you understand exactly what's going on here that surely doesn't mean you'll like the film. Aronofsky takes a pretty simple story and tries to jazz it up with all kinds of special effects and fantasies. But it just doesn't work at all. Really all this film is about is a man not wanting his wife to die. That's it. All the existential mumbo-jumbo surrounding that basic story ends up falling flat. Aronofsky was apparently so concerned with making a statement that he failed to notice he was making a very bad movie. Anything nice to say? Well, many of the visuals are stunning. That's something I guess. But pretty visuals can't hide the failings of the story. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz have in other films proved themselves to be fine performers but they've got nothing to work with here. It was an admittedly intriguing concept and ambitious effort from Aronofsky but he couldn't pull it off. The film can best be summed up by one moment near the end. After being so darned serious, so determined to get its message across you figure at least the movie must be building to an eye-opening, thought-provoking, wondrous climax. Instead you get one of the most laughable moments in film history, a moment so bad you may well find yourself throwing things at the screen. I won't spoil it here, you'll know it when you see it. It's a moment which sums up the film itself as it's meant to be painfully serious but is unintentionally hilarious. At this point you'll certainly be laughing at the filmmaker, not with him. Give credit to Aronofsky for thinking outside the box (way, way outside the box) but the sad truth is his movie fails miserably."

","The Fountain offers a variety of perspectives on life and death which ring true partly because, like most great spiritual beliefs, they express no specifics nor do they exhaustively explain themselves. In fact, just like many systems of belief that incorporate the notion of spirits and other profoundly affective/effective works of art, the film remains plausible by steadfastly refusing to make perfect and consistent sense in any but an aesthetic and 'gut' manner. Its ambiguity allows you to insert your own personal gods and demons wherever you wish so that you can end up saying that you both ""agree with"" and ""understand"" it. <br/><br/>Having said all of this - the film resonates strongly with my own beliefs (it will not do so with everybody), and expresses many things which I find attractive. The film can be interpreted as a piece of hardcore areligious psychological rationalism, and a simultaneous and completely complementary celebration of the infinite cycle of life springing from death and visa versa. The Fountain succeeds as a spiritual messenger incorporating ideas from a variety of religious sources (most profoundly Native American concepts) and also achieves the believability of good science fiction film because it carefully ties the parallels between the spiritual (the action of Izzy's book and Tommy's final chapter) and the real (Izzy's death and Tommy's denial about its inevitability). <br/><br/>There are essentially two plots, which appear, given the Slaughterhouse-5-like approach to chronology, to be several plots early in the film. The future and the past turn out to be components of a book being written by a surgeon's dying wife and completed by him after her death. The surgeon, from whose perspective we experience the story, must finish the story - a gift from his beloved to allow him to discorporate some of the demons regarding their relationship by formalizing the grieving process through creative expression (Our hero, Tommy is pretty intensely wound up throughout most of the film, and it is obvious that his road to enlightenment will not be the smoothest or straightest one around). <br/><br/>The plots are as follows: <br/><br/>The Real - sci-fi story about a brilliant surgeon who is trying to invent a cure for death - inspired by his dying wife. This plot is appropriately intense, and not very merciful.<br/><br/>The Spiritual/Fantastic - the same individual and his wife playing characters in her novel about a conquistador trying to find the fountain of youth and the tree of life, who later becomes an astronaut willing to sacrifice himself for the rebirth of the universe.<br/><br/>All the while, Tommy (Jackman) is beginning to come to grips with his own mortality. <br/><br/>Both plots are very carefully thought-out, nicely visualized, and well performed. The connections between them are very nicely paralleled through the narrative, and yet the film does not hold its audience's hands as it wanders through unfamiliar territory, but rather challenges its participants to interpret. The only problem I had with the intertwined story-lines is that the 'real' story was overpopulated with over-dramatic moments, unlikely somewhat forced coincidences and occasional visual and script clichés. The characterizations are all particularly good, and some (particularly Weisz, Jackman and Burstyn) will definitely stick with you after you've seen the film. However, the hyperbolic drama of the 'real' story sometimes makes the lead characters appear to over-act. <br/><br/>Visually, the film is an absolute treat, and although it tries to sell itself as an independent art piece, the $35+ million dollar budget shows - in a tasteful and sensually powerful way. The use of sound is nothing special, but doesn't detract from the entertainment value or the ideas. The camera-work is generally good, but I felt that there were perhaps too many gratuitous crying scenes shot with extreme close-ups. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has established himself as a force to be reckoned with in mainstream, commercial, artistic film making. I look forward to his on-going growth as a director with enthusiasm."
"Jacques98","4","8","13","30 November 2008"," This makes me wonder if anyone can make good surrealist fiction . . .
","Before you assume I'm one of the countless people who didn't get the plot, thus doesn't like this movie, think again. I understood everything about The Fountain from open to close. Being someone who honestly used to enjoy good surrealist fiction, I hoped this may have been at least worth a watch. And maybe it was. However, the main problem isn't that the movie was too confusing, but rather that it was too elementary.<br/><br/>It's almost an unspoken rule among bad surrealist authors and screenwriters: ""If I'm too unintelligent to think of anything but a traditional, clichéd plot, then I have to awe the viewer into thinking I've done something so utterly original and intelligent they don't even realize I just picked up some children's book off my bookshelf and copied it word-for-word."" Darren Aronofsky knows that rule, and he follows it here. It fooled a lot of viewers, but it didn't fool me.<br/><br/>The surrealist elements of The Fountain deal with the (presumed) spiritual world of the Garden of Eden. The main character, who is presented as your standard male hero, tries to save his dying wife by finding the Fountain of Youth, aka the Tree of Life in this spiritual world by finding a way to reverse aging in the physical world through medicine. That's the basic synopsis you get from the first fifteen minutes, and that plot takes you up to the last twenty minutes when the results of all this come into place. Without spoiling anything, the ending is traditional and expected, butback to that ruleis laced with some of the most over-the-top surrealist imagery ever put on screen. If you see past the intense flashes of gold light, you'll realize the ending was completely dull and unoriginal. And so was the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>So . . .<br/><br/>This is the point when it gets hard for me to write a review. Put simply, The Fountain isn't likely going to be in the top 10 worst movie list you've ever seen, but that doesn't mean it isn't bad. Like the rule states, it bashes you over the head with some very pretty environments and some truly emotional-grabbing scenes in order to create a faux sense of awe . . . then nothing. It's like going to a concert and the stage lights are going crazy and the band is tearing up the stage with more energy than anything you've ever seen and the lead singer tells you the meaning to one of their most powerful songs and it hits you hard . . . but they don't sing.<br/><br/>Put another way: The Fountain is literally nothing but a small love story with a semi-cliché ending. All the surrealist aspects are throw-away when it comes to the actual plot. They're just a hook. If that's what you enjoy, traditional love stories, then this movie is for you. But if you came here for a deep, intelligent movie, then you're going to be disappointed like I was. I guess I'm trying to instruct you to watch it with low expectations.<br/><br/>Other minor complaints/complements: The surrealist aspects really got so over-the-top they were borderline cheesy in more than one part of the movie. They also needed to be shortened by a lot, because they took away from the shallow plotwhich was the director's intention. On the other hand, the casting was very well selected and the acting was solid.The director avoided a lot of obvious things he could have done to cheese this movie up considerablysuch as add pointless nudity or a longer run-timeand that is something else I give him credit for.<br/><br/>Overall, worth a watch. Once. You may like it or you may not. It is not the intelligent, original movie that the trailer advertises it is. If anything, it's pretty typical.<br/><br/>4/10"
"dirty_dutchman","10","8","13","2 August 2008"," Behold! ... The Road To Awe
","How does a talented filmmaker like Aronofsky take simple themes, such as the fragile nature of life and death, and turn them into one of the most meaningful films in history? Just watch The Fountain and you will understand. In this one piece of art, Aronofsky has challenged himself, as well as the viewers, to see a film as more than just entertainment. The Fountain is an experience, a leap into the depths of imagination that will leave you utterly speechless.<br/><br/>Of course, a film like this is not without its critics. The Fountain is not for everyone. But I say heed the challenge. Try not to look for the realism and instead immerse yourself in an alternate world, one that struggles to reconcile the advantages and disadvantages of immortality.<br/><br/>For me personally, The Fountain is a milestone. It was the first film (and only) that left me utterly speechless as the end credits rolled. It took me a few minutes to snap out of the trance of what I had witnessed. Now, watching The Fountain is almost a religious experience. I ignore everything else and dive headfirst into Aronofsky's stunning vision.<br/><br/>This film has so many positive aspects that it would take forever to name them all. But there are highlights that cannot be ignored. For one, the two lead actors give stellar performances. I have seen The Constant Gardener, but Rachel Weisz shined even brighter in The Fountain. She is strong, both as the queen and as the ailing writer. Then you have Hugh Jackman. He may forever be typecast as a tough-guy, pseudo-Wolverine, but he gives the best performance of his career in The Fountain. The movie feeds off his energy, which from the first scene is genuine and intense. The thought that these roles were meant for Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette makes me so very happy that the first attempt was a failure. They would never have been able to do what Weisz and Jackman accomplished.<br/><br/>This film gets compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey quite a bit, namely the futuristic elements. But I see this film as entirely different. The visuals are simple, and yet incredibly poignant. The atmosphere of the film is very dark, but there are so many moments of brightness. It is indeed a film of contrasts, as well as parallels. <br/><br/>Above all, this film succeeds thanks to the unprecedented score by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet. Mansell has worked well with Aronofsky before on Requiem For A Dream, but this score is something special. It adds to the atmosphere of the film, as well as highlights the power of the message. <br/><br/>When this film first came out, I was worried that the effect would be temporary. It was a special movie, but how long would it hold up? It has almost been two years, and The Fountain remains one of the most powerful and disarming films of the last 20 years. It is truly an experience, not simply a film. And though it may draw on themes that have been examined time and again, the uniqueness and effect of The Fountain cannot be ignored. It is a road to awe."

","I'm having a hard time memorizing all the names of the reviewers here that think this is a wonderful movie, so I can avoid anything they recommend.<br/><br/>The Fountain is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It could have been made by a blissed out religious cultist whose brain keeps clicking back to the preceding thought like a broken record. There's Izzi and her other incarnations smiling beatifically, crying soulfully. There she is again, and again and again doing the same thing. There is Tommy puzzled, smiling, crying, angry, and there he is again, and again and again. I'm sure I've seen this scene before and before that and before that. What a long dragged out boring piece of pretentious pseudo spiritual garbage it is.<br/><br/>The special effects are nice to look at but also repeated ad nauseum. The musical score is decent and that's it. Hugh Jackman is a good actor but not here. Rachel Weisz isn't a good actress and is even worse here. I guess you can blame the writer and director for this, and the constant close ups and extreme closeups. I couldn't believe that Aranofsky, who made this bomb, also made The Wrestler. He didn't write The Wrestler so that explains some of the difference, but he directed and I guess he just improved greatly as a director in the two year interval between the films.<br/><br/>The Fountain is an embarrassment for all involved."
"backpackshack","10","14","26","22 November 2006"," 'The Fountain' is something to which we can all relate
","When the movie started, I was somewhat afraid that it was going to turn into a highly stylized costume drama (from all three periods it represents) that would try to convey its messages. By the end, I was silenced into submission by an overwhelming silence and humility by the power of the experience. It's not the kind of movie you can really judge according to traditional paradigms of good, bad, funny, sad, etc. To me, it conveyed this overwhelming message about the interconnectivity of life and death, sorrow and happiness, meaning and emptiness, acting and passing... I hate to use simple binaries like those, but The Fountain seemed to tell me, among many things, that everything is okay, that everything is connected to everything else, and that in the end what we take from life is what we make of it. At first the three different stories (Counter-Reformation Spain, early 21st century America, and 22nd century infinity) don't relate to one another. Over time, we find that they become a part of one another, complements as such, that signify the larger contiguity of its constituent elements: life and death. There is no need to fear death because it leads to life: eternal in the beyond and regenerative on this earth. Even if there is no eternity, so what? We enjoy who and what we have while we have them as often as possible. When death occurs, that person may cease to function, but they never truly leave us. Their body decomposes into soil which grows into a tree or gets taken up by a bird and soars above the ground and lands elsewhere in the world. There is life everywhere, even in death. We fight so hard to hang on while all we have to do let it slide like sand, to release ourselves and others and flow through and beyond, together and forever, in one continuous stream of eternal energy. When I read my local paper's review for The Fountain this morning, I almost laughed when I saw the one star the Joe Schmoe reviewer gave it. Every other movie that came out today received no more than two stars anyway and none of the reviews were written by the paper's main movie critic. That tells you a lot about how seriously my city's newspaper takes itself. Anyway, The Fountain, for lack of a better adjective, was phenomenal, connotatively and denotatively. The film in and of itself was photographed in these golden, glossy textures that gave every shot a timeless aura, like it could have come from any period in time and still looked the same. Matthew Libatique is a truly exquisite cinematographic artist. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz had remarkable chemistry and brought Thomas and Izzi to transcendental planes of existence. I'm especially impressed with Jackman as he's really gone all out to show the world what he's got, not only in The Fountain, but also in The Prestige, X-Men 3, Scoop, Flushed Away, and even the goofy Happy Feet, all of which came out this year. The man is truly remarkable and if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination than no one should. Rachel Weisz is a true gem and shines like a million burning stars. I've liked her since her Mummy days. When I saw The Constant Gardener last year, I had a feeling the Best Supporting Oscar would be hers, and in The Fountain she goes even further, pulling us through time as the queen of Spain, Izzi, and the Tree of Life. Clint Mansell's music was chilling but soothing at the same time. There was a lot more of the Kronos Quartet in this film than in Aronofsky's last film, Requiem for a Dream. In fact, this movie on the whole was almost silent compared to Requiem's crescendoing frenzy of hallucinations, paranoia, hospital noises, and television static that drove the audience into the same traumatizing decline that each of its characters experienced. The Fountain is one of the quietest films I've ever seen (bar those that are silent). There is almost 100% continuity in the gentle humming of Mansell's music as the Kronos Quartet briskly links the disparate time periods seen throughout the film. Finally, Darren Aronofsky. That man has had a vision since Pi (1998) and The Fountain is a reflection on the evolution of his vision, style, and life experiences. While Requiem focused on youth, The Fountain focuses on maturity and death. While I still find Requiem to be as equally profound as The Fountain, there is something about the latter that the former lacks and I believe that is 'hope'. The Fountain tells us that even though we die, we will live again. Requiem told us that you only get so many chances in life before you reach the point of no return. Together, these films say more than I could ever hope to write about or convey to anyone. More than anything, Aronofsky's films are perceptual and metaphysical experiences (or phenomena if you will) that can only be seen and heard and felt in order to understand them. I can write about everything about every shot but that would do very little to you in terms of understanding The Fountain. I'd like to see it again, if not more, just to experience it again and gain a deeper insight into its multiple layers of meaning. Here's an infinite number of cheers for The Fountain, best picture of 2006 and beyond."

He's trying to save his dying wife. Boooriiing! <br/><br/>As we watch Huge Ackman cry nonstop, we also see the story of a book that his wife has written. There's a part in this book when some old dude holds a dagger up to the night sky and lines some stars up through the holes in the dagger (like in the Goonies). this is how he finds the location of the tree of life. It's the Orion constellation. It's visible worldwide. You could hold that dagger up anywhere on the planet and line up the stars. Sheesh! And then, get this... it starts pouring rain! Guess what. It doesn't rain when you can see the stars. DUH! If my wife was such a sloppy writer, I'd divorce her. <br/><br/>There's also a part when they're star gazing and she says,""it's actually not a star, it's a nebula surrounding a dying star."" Uhhh... so it's a star then.<br/><br/>In the end, Hugh becomes immortal and travels through space in a snow globe with his wife as a tree. He thinks blowing her up in a dying star will bring her back. So he spent MILLIONS of years being devoted to this quest. He never met another babe in all that time? Wow. He doesn't want his wife's ghost bugging him, either. Probably cuz you can't have sex with a spirit (like in Ghostbusters). <br/><br/>Listen IMDb, you keep tricking me into watching bad movies because of all these good reviews. Cut it out already!

As a man of science, he can not accept it. He is trapped between a world of solutions and a profound love that defies explanation. He does not accept it, perhaps for many years, then finally he listens to the words of his late love. Perhaps the reason he can not accept it is that he gave up the precious few moments he had left to his ill fated attempt to save her from the inevitable. <br/><br/>Often we give up those moments with our loved ones. Some of us because of work, sometimes because we forget what those people really mean to us. I need this reminder about once a year, to remember how important my wife is to me, my children.

","Every year there's the more or less provocative and philosophical film, that naturally, because of its contents tends to provoke two completely different opinions. Either you firmly defend it and love it, or you hate it and attack it. There's no way of escaping this dichotomy for the simple reason that a movie like the Fountain is a movie that is character driven and their proof of love requires an elevate suspension of disbelief from the viewer. If you are not one of those, than don't even consider watching this movie, but if you are, if you let yourself be carried away buy the beauty of the images, the intensity of the characters and the devotion to one purpose, than you will most certainly enjoy and praise the Fountain as much as I did. Quite frankly I cannot imagine Brad Pitt or Cate Blanchett taking the place of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. They took the characters and made them their own. Although Weisz is extraordinary in Izzy's skin, is Jackman's take on Tommy that is the true engine of the movie. He composes three different characters in three different approaches but with the same love driven obsession. I myself reckon that at the beginning the movie does suffer not only from unmanaged pace but also from the viewer's eventual detachment from the story. But although the movie runs for 90 minutes it is more than enough to tell three different stories. I reckon that Fountain haters might criticize it for narrative confusion and some questions left unanswered or not explained, but that's not its purpose. We are meant to believe and connect with these two characters and their motives, strengths, weaknesses and actions. And we do. Thanks to Aronofsky, Weisz but most specially to Jackmans true masterpiece and Clint Mansell. The Foutntain would not have been the same without him: his soundtrack is a poem of love, tragedy, loss and beauty that very rarely has Hollywood presented us."

","Everything you want in a motion picture is here...except a story. I don't take issue with any of the glowing comments made about the acting, visuals, cinematography, sound, score etc. There is just no story continuity. It has pieces of a story, and the actors are wasted with the words they have to speak, but there is no theme, no meaning to the strife and grief exhibited. If the writer's goal was the glory of nihilism, then he failed miserably. At least nihilism declares existing beliefs are not valid. He owes an apology to those who hold the opinion that life is meaningless and senseless. He didn't even make their argument. I was left wondering if the writer wrote this on a bad acid trip. To make any comparison of this tripe to Kubrick's 2001 is stretching the imagination beyond any conceivable breaking point. Of all the story treatments that are pitched in Hollywood every day, I don't understand how anyone gave this the green light or any fool was willing to finance it. This script belongs in the garbage. Hugh, Rachel, take the money and run."

I think that could have been the worst piece of garbage I have ever seen, and that list includes such winners as Charlie's Angels 2 and AVP. Just having some trippy graphics or ""micro-photography"" or whatever it was and then try to make it seem all deep because you have people flying through space meditating and doing tai chi is not a movie. So I don't know what all you people watched who think it's awesome and makes perfect sense, because what I watched was neither. So if someone could explain to me what was going on that would be nice, please include the part about how the space traveling tree bubble got started.<br/><br/>I think I can surmise what the ""creative difference"" Brad Pitt had which caused this movie to be axed in 2002. It probably started with Brad saying, ""Hey Darren I have some creative differences."" And Aronofsky said, ""Really? What are they Brad?"" And Brad finished with, ""This movie makes no sense and is going to be the black hole that sucks my career down into the toilet, I quit."" And WB should have taken that as a clue and just left the project axed, but unfortunately they didn't and this crap-fest was unleashed on the public.<br/><br/>If anyone reads this who hasn't seen it yet and still wants to then maybe it will make more sense if you drink a bunch of cough syrup beforehand, otherwise you might as well take the 8 dollars and just throw it in the sewer and save yourself the 2 hours to do something else."

So many things aren't explained directly but through the correct viewing we are able to understand. for example and here are some spoilers: the future storyline we see the main character bald to the bone, I deciphered that it was a secondary effect to the drug he created for eternal life. He studied meditation long before he engaged in the forever long journey in space in order not to suffer from the great period of isolation. Indirectly we see that planet earth is long gone...etc. I do not understand the haters and negative critics towards this masterpiece, I figure that they are not quite open enough and thus the lack of understanding makes them discard the film as junk. well its not! I guess they prefer blockbuster hits like Iron man or SAW. Visually fantastic and musically amazing! I can guarantee you that you will not understand squat after first view so it is mandatory you give it several other opportunities and then make final judgment. I would almost ask for a ""The Fountain 2"" but it is not necessary for this film is uniquely different and outstanding from all the rest and giving it a sequel would be saying that the first lacked of explanation. In fact it does lack vital pieces of information but thats exactly the beauty of it, we put in whatever we want to and I don't know of any other film that you can do that.

"Quinoa1984","9","12","22","28 November 2006"," the kind of studio picture that won't do very well at the box office, but has 'cult' written (or floating) all over it
","I wasn't totally sure what to expect from Darren Aronofsky's the Fountain, but I knew from the trailer and the buzz that it would be extraordinary- for better or worse- and it could possibly have been a combination of both. Walking out of the theater was interesting in and of itself, as I tried to process what had exactly 'happened' in the last ten minutes of it, which is so loaded with abstractions it gives Inland Empire a run for its surrealistic money. It's the work of a director who one can tell is so obsessed and drawn by what he wants to convey to the viewer that its bound to not make complete sense. No bother- the Fountain works really on a few levels though, some much more harrowingly and amazingly than others. One things for certain, at least for me (and I do need to re-watch Requiem for a Dream very soon so this could change), this is one of the best directed pictures- or at least most ambitious in vision and scope and purpose- of the last several years.<br/><br/>If I didn't find it to be altogether a total masterwork maybe it was to be somewhat expected, or perhaps not. I still can't tell completely, but I think it probably has to do with the filmmaker skirting so along the edge of his unique, otherworldly vision of one man's search for not just life but a belief in it, that it runs the risk of running off the rails into pretentious land. One thing that worried me were the early negative reviews (i.e. 'Zardoz anyone?'), and the comparisons to Jodorowsky made me feel iffy, if intrigued, as well. If there is any one thing though that's compelling about the Fountain it's that we're given really an emotional context for most of the way, and a sort of bedrock that can be sort of fallen back on. Like Aronofsky's Pi- and maybe Requiem to an extent- it's about going past the limits of potential, or not even knowing what the limits are, in a certain goal. At the end of The Fountain I was definitely left with more questions than answers, and not necessarily in the greatest grandiose '2001' way either (befuddlement does need a little more rhythm then what comes out towards the end).<br/><br/>But, as I said, I really did get very much involved with the picture, and the struggle of Tommy (Hugh Jackman, in one of his best performances), to try in the present day to find a cure for tumors, in order to possibly save his wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz, very lovely if not as compelling overall as in something like Constant Gardener). There's an element of the movie the Neverending Story, I felt, that came into the movie quite well, as Tommy starts to read a book Izzi is writing about a Spanish conquistador in a search for her Queen (also Jackman and Weisz respectfully), called the 'Tree of Life', as said in the Bible. It's here that the theme is really interesting to me, and carries over for a big chunk of the film. What does it mean for someone to believe in something so fantastical that it can possibly be? Can Jackman save Weisz after death? Can death be 'cured' by this possible solution or tree or whatever? Aronofsky might be quite optimistic, or perhaps not, the ending only leaves a certain hint of what may or never be.<br/><br/>It's within though this framework that Aronofsky, with his technical crew from Requiem (DP Libatique with his amazing use of lights and close-ups, editor Rabinowitz for the different sense of pacing, and this time James Chindlund's stunning production design), with an added touch of magnificent, original special effects. From what I read not everything was CGI, which in and of itself is unique to me, that they apparently used what bacteria looks like for the certain ""future"" scenes and visions. But what had me all the way into the material was how Aronofsky pulled it off- even when a scene or two wasn't very well written (like some of the 1500s scenes) or when they just made about as much sense as a dog leaving a bone alone. One might say that it's too 'trippy' and hallucinatory for its own good, and as I said in the last ten minutes the onslaught of wild abstractions almost got to me. However I could never let go of how strong and commanding the visual style went with the material. And certainly filmmakers shouldn't complain much when seeing that a film like this, which looks like it costs a hell of a lot more than 35 million, cant make do with 100 million or more for theirs.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I'm sure it will divide a great many viewer, and unlike some other of the fantastical films I've seen in 2006 (i.e. the Science of Sleep, A Scanner Darkly, Tideland), I'm not sure if it will really improve or seem more illuminating or revelatory on repeat viewings, and unlike Tideland it's not even really ahead of its time as much as it's in its own time-frame. Like its main protagonist, it's uncompromising and daunting in what it sets out to accomplish cinematically, and 90% of the time I was hooked in. And it's a credit to Aronofsky that his main influence, Jodorowsky, comes through in all its weird, mystical glory. I mean, where else will you get Hugh Jackman (in the space scenes with the tree) looking like David Carradine in Kung-Fu? Overall, it'a stirring, romantically charged piece of art."

This film is mind- bending and some scenes are awe inspiring even but it will need a strong will of curiosity to sit through this film.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","2","2","27 March 2018"," An eclectic yet personal attempt to convey some form of spiritual enlightenment that often gets lost in its quest for something 'greater.'
","'The Fountain (2006)' comes close to pretentious portent, often feeling more like a collection of well-crafted images than a cohesive set of scenes in an actual narrative, but ultimately Aronofsky's personal yet eclectic tale of a man fighting back against the prospect of death is never dull nor meaningless. It is often more confusing than mystifying, though, and it is easy to see why that would frustrate rather than delight. It's a non-traditional attempt to convey some sort of spiritual enlightenment, with its non-linear presentation making for a sometimes difficult yet forcibly engaging watch and its wild visuals making for some wonderfully wide-eyed spectacle, but it's most emotional moments are those that are the most human and it's unfortunate that these are lost in the search for something supposedly greater, and in fact fleetingly perplexing, when nothing could best those simplest interactions that come the closest to being profound. 6/10"
"quinimdb","7","2","2","29 August 2017"," The Fountain
","""The Fountain"" begins with the death of a conquistador who was searching for the tree of life, then cuts to that same man, but bald, now sitting next to the tree of life as he floats through the universe, then finally cuts back to present day where that same man frantically searches for a cure for cancer. This is all in the first few minutes.<br/><br/>Of course, these three aren't all technically the same person - one exists far in the past during the Spanish inquisition (Tomas), another seems to exist in the future after death (Tommy), and the other exists currently (Tom Creo), but they all seem to have the same motivation. Tomas is trying to find the tree of life to grant him and his queen (played by Rachel Weisz) immortality, as her country is being taken over, Tom is trying to find a cure for cancer to save his wife Isabel (also played by Rachel Weisz) from death, and Tommy seems to be trying to keep the tree of life alive in the afterlife so that he can be with her for eternity.<br/><br/>On its base level, the movie is really just about death, and how we should deal with it, and what comes after, and all the anxieties that go with that. As I mentioned before, the film starts with Tomas, the conquistador, being stabbed, and looking down at his stab wound with fear as blood pours out of his body. He knows he is slowly dying, but the film cuts away before he does. Each of the versions of Tom is in some way fighting against death, while Isabel is learning to accept it. Many times throughout each of three plot lines, Tom is told to ""Finish"" his story and in each of them he struggles to do this. In one shot, he walks through the busy streets but the only audio we hear are his footsteps; he is unaware of the world around him.<br/><br/>There are many smart artistic decisions such as this. Many of the shots are directly overhead the characters, as if they are being watched from above. As a contrast to this, there are a large amount of extreme close ups, showing how the Tom and Isabel cling to each other. Not to mention to often gorgeous special effects during the ethereal scenes involving Tommy as he ascends through the universe and into a nebula. But the film was incredibly ambitious for 2006 special effects, and occasionally they come off looking cheap and unintentionally funny, especially towards the end of the film during what should've been a very serious and awe- inspiring sequence. Also, Tommy doing martial arts moves in front of a space background was completely irrelevant to the story and themes, and ended up coming off as ridiculous and absurd.<br/><br/>However, the film is elevated by Hugh Jackman's devastating performance in each of the three roles he plays. Rachel Weisz is fantastic as well, but one smaller performance that truly stood out was Ellen Burstyn as Dr. Lillian Guzetti. Her speech at Isabel's funeral towards the end of the film, although short, was one of the best scenes. As she says: ""We struggle all our lives to become whole. Complete enough when we die."" The film's message that the only way we can deal with our mortality is by accepting it as a natural part of the circle of life. Despite the ridiculously over the top visuals towards the end, it definitely has something interesting to say."

"CuriosityKilledShawn","10","14","27","2 February 2007"," The most indescribably brilliant movie in years.
","This is probably the most difficult film to review ever. The Fountain isn't going to sound like much if I give you just a brief plot synopsis. But I'll give it a go. Tom Creo, a brilliant Doctor, is searching for a cure for cancer. His wife Izzy is dying and his research on Monkeys only seems to mysteriously reverse the ageing process. The secret ingredient to his new medicine is taken from a magic tree in South America. The tree of life, or the fountain of youth. Whatever you want to call it. As Izzy slips away, Tom becomes intrigued with her unfinished novel The Fountain. It turns out that the novel is about Tom and Izzy's past lives as a Spanish Queen and Captain in South America hundreds of years ago. And the only way Tom can finish the book is if he stays around for the future, when he can literally take the long-dead Izzy into the heavens.<br/><br/>Phew! That sounds disconcertingly strange, but trust me it's an amazing experience. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are brilliant, delivering multi-layered performances. The dialogue avoids soap opera clichés of dying young and instead is filled with many philosophic double meanings and a lot of undeclared emotions. I could go on for ages about how good it all is from the direction, gorgeous cinematography, beautiful score, flawless storytelling etc. But I think you get the point already.<br/><br/>What The Fountain mostly resembles is the most beautiful, otherworldly dream you've ever had but can barely remember. It's a hypnotic movie filled with moments that will stay with you forever. Just when you think the film has given you all that it has to offer it surprises you with more and more amazing revelations.<br/><br/>To deny yourself a movie like this would be a heinous act.

","This is my first review on any movie anywhere. But after watching this movie for the first time, some months ago already, I knew I had to give you my words to describe this masterpiece. <br/><br/>The story, I will not tell.. The words will not let me, my own understanding of this film simply falls short, to accurately portray the story. You most likely have read the reviews, and are aware of the lead characters and the 3 time-lines.<br/><br/>And that's where the impossibility of reviewing a movie like this shows itself, everything in this film is intertwined, and has hard to grasp as some famous Escher (whose known for his mind boggling pieces) art works. The difference with Escher and Aronofsky, is that Aronofsky presents us the possibility, no the opportunity to actually experience the complexity of the artwork in question. To touch one subject of this film, is to touch seven other subjects that are linked to it. This has been made so you can experience the full value of that one subject you just touched, the depth, the complexity. And your rational mind will have one of the hardest times ever, to really 'get' this movie. <br/><br/>To me, getting this movie, is by far not as important as experiencing it. Art cannot be conveyed in words, it is experienced (felt), or it is not. Which is in itself, is the biggest and toughest praise an artist can get for his or her creation. The toughness of this praise is the fact that it asks allot from the viewer to properly judge the movie as it deserves. Meaning you have a very clear split between the fans and the 'boo-ers'.<br/><br/>This movie is flawless for the right viewer. It touches many many subjects: Eternal life, death, disease, acceptance, grievance, love, Mayan myths, spirituality, enlightenment, science, frustration, life. And most likely many, many more. The difficulty (as with an Escher painting) is that every subject, is at the same time the object of the movie but also each subject is complimentary towards all the other subjects. The result of this complimentary property is a flawless experience of the worth of each of those subjects in their united web which we call: The fountain.<br/><br/>This review isn't for your average reader i'm sure but neither is this movie. So if you get this review.. don't hesitate in watching the movie, and let go of everything you have ever read about it :), as words could never try and hope to convey, what the movie beautifully does.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time reading this, I hope it was an OK read."

It explores love, and mortality in ways no other film I've ever seen has. Secondly it is the most aesthetically beautiful film I've ever seen. Their have been a lot of advances in technology in film over the past decade, this is the first movie I've ever seen that has used that technology to create an emotional and dramatic effect instead of just a shock and awe spectacle. The movie is out of sequence and is hard to follow at times. But if you wait for the conclusion the film reveals itself and any confusion you had initially was well worth the culmination of the three story lines at the end. Hugh Jackman has an intensity that I couldn't imagine another actor bringing to the part while Rachel Weis is ethereal. I have trouble ranking this in terms of other movies I've seen because there are no films that are like it. Hopefully that will change."

","I don't really mind seeing a movie that's just outright bad, but a movie like this, that is so promising and contains so many excellent elements but doesn't pull through in the end, is worse! So much about this movie is great - the ""modern day"" story is excellently written and acted (mostly acted; Hugh Jackman is phenomenal) and really got me emotionally involved, and the Mayan mythological elements seemed surprisingly uncontrived. But every segment involving ""Tom"" positively ruins the effect. These sequences are so New Age-y and ridiculous that it totally detaches you from any kind of emotional involvement in the film, and it's really painful how ridiculous they are. It doesn't help that Mogwai lay on the cheeze as thick as it comes with their contributions to the score. To top it all off, the movie absolutely REFUSES to end, so that even though it has a short running time (hardly over an hour and a half), it feels like Aronofsky was actually the one who found the formula for eternal life (and gave it to his movie!). There's a lot of waste here - wasted acting, wasted writing, wasted visuals - because in the end, you will laugh at how ridiculous some of the scenes are, and at how godawful and inconclusive the ""ending"" is. I really hope that the graphic novel is better, but until then, just go watch Solaris (either version) - it deals with all of these themes much more gracefully and with great subtlety."

","The Fountain is very artful film and simply gorgeous to look at. Hugh Jackman is excellent as the struggling husband  a man who simply can't bear even the thought of the death of his seriously ill wife played by the beautiful Rachel Weisz.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Weisz and Jackman is luminous. The fantasies that wrap The Fountain are existential explorations. They are an emotional catharsis for Jackman's character, Thomas, as he works through his loss.<br/><br/>I took the film to be an artful portrayal of love that becomes mythic in scale after the death of a loved one. And the fantasies depicted are excerpts of the story that Weisz's character was writing to help her work through the inevitability of her illness  a fantastic 16th quest for the ""tree of life"" to a thousand years in the future to the lonely edge of the universe. She left the last chapter unwritten -- a charge for him. Her last wish is that he finishes their tale. And it is this conceit that takes us to the film's most fantastic images as we journey to the Xibalba nebula. Jackman's alter ego travels a thousand years all the way to the lonely edge of the universe. And in his most despairing moments he learns that he will be able to move on. That she will always be part of him. The tree metaphor is complete as he plants a seed of tree upon her grave.<br/><br/>Also worth mentioning is The Fountain's art direction and the palette -- gold light against darkness. The characters are always moving from dark spaces into gold light. Moving forward through passages, tunnels and doorways. Lines of the sets always converge on the lovers, making a visual connection, a center. The set design and lighting constantly reinforce the theme of moving forward towards the inevitable. Death. And eventually coming to peace with it. Part of the process of life.<br/><br/>Essentially, The Fountain is a ""cancer"" movie. I hate cancer movies  too much despair for me. But I really loved this picture."

Don't you think that if people didn't like a movie they would not view it. Well of course he couldn't answer my question. So we eventually got the chance to get the movie 6 weeks later after our first request.<br/><br/>Now my thoughts on this movie is simply, AMAZING, GRACEFUL, AND BEAUTIFULLY EXPRESS. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and I now understand why the manager at blockbuster didn't like it. I totally went over his HEAD. Its a great move that requires much attention. I really think this is a MUST SEE. I gather my own conclusion and feelings from the movie and I am sure other have too. The Added feature are a great way to see how the move was made and the thought process that went into this movie. I want to see more movies on this Level."

","It is disturbing to me that childish and dysfunctional relationships and understandings of life are passed off as ""normal"" and even worse ""moving"". Honestly I don't see why they just didn't cast a 4 year old child instead of the man, after all he acted like one the entire time. It would seem some believe infantile co-dependency on our loved ones is synonymous with love. Never once did he consider the needs and desires of his wife in all his ""love"" for her. I gave this movie a ""2"" rating only because of its beautiful cinematography. The main character's wife was also pretty one dimensional. This movie reminded me of ""The 6th Day""; the scientist who only worked so that he can find a cure for his dying wife. Ugh! Can any writers in Hollywood come up with something original?"
"ackstasis","8","9","16","1 July 2007"," ""Death is a disease. There is a cure, and I will find it.""
","After the phenomenal critical success of 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream' (neither of which I have yet had the pleasure of seeing), director Darren Aronofsky became recognised as one of the great emerging talents of the decade. His third feature-length offering, released after a six year hiatus, was 'The Fountain,' a film that has universally divided the opinions of reviewers and audiences. For example, though it was booed by many critics at its opening press screening at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival, 'The Fountain' received a ten-minute standing ovation at the public showing the following evening. Not particularly knowing what to expect coming in, I must say that I quite enjoyed it. Though undoubtedly flawed in some regards, 'The Fountain' is ambitious, brilliantly-acted and stunningly beautiful; it's the sort of bold film-making that you love to see a young director try his hands at.<br/><br/>The plot of 'The Fountain' is a blurred combination of drama, science-fiction and fantasy. Three thematically-linked narratives  respectively set in the year 1500, the present day, and somewhere around the year 2500  are interwoven throughout the film, each era featuring similar characters played by Hugh Jackman (fresh from Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige') and Rachel Weisz ('The Constant Gardener'). In the present day, Jackman plays Dr. Tommy Creo, a devoted husband who is dedicating all his time to uncovering a cure for his wife Izzi's (Weisz) terminal brain tumour. Izzi, in her final months, has been writing a novel, entitled ""The Fountain."" The novel, which she would like Tom to complete himself, traces the struggles of a 16th century Spanish conquistador, Tomas (Jackman), to discover the famed Tree of Life in the New World, a mission granted to him by his beloved Queen Isabel (Weisz). The third story, set in the far future  or perhaps merely in Tommy Creo's mind  shows astronaut Tom (Jackman again) travelling towards the golden nebula Xibalba in an ecospheric bubble spacecraft, his only companion a dying tree and occasional visits from present-day Izzi, in spirit form.<br/><br/>If all this sounds very confusing to you, then you're not alone. 'The Fountain' really is a film that you have to think about to receive most rewarding movie experience, and multiple viewings are sure to be beneficial in understanding the intricacies of the plot and themes. The ""Conquistador"" portions were certainly inspired by films such as Herzog's 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God' (and, reportedly, Aronofsky based his script on that of Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time in America,' which also employs a flashback structure between three different eras). Originally set to star Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the main roles, production of the film was ceased in September 2002 after Pitt left due to script disagreements. However, in 2004, production was restarted (with half the original budget), and Jackman and Weisz were coaxed onboard. Ellen Burstyn, the star of 'Requiem for a Dream' was also hired to appear in the film.<br/><br/>With a relatively small budget of about $35 million, Aronofsky chose to limit his spending on visual effects as much as possible. Rather than wasting millions of dollars on lavish CGI, visual effects supervisors Jeremy Dawson and Dan Schrecker discovered macrophotography, which is the extreme close-up photography of chemicals, fluids and bacteria. Peter Parks, who specialises in such photography, explains why such a method was highly suited to the visual effects of the film: ""When these images are projected on a big screen, you feel like you're looking at infinity. That's because the same forces at work in the watergravitational effects, settlement, refractive indicesare happening in outer space."" The final result is a product that generally looks convincing and timeless. However, especially in the final climactic sequence, the effects do begin to show their low-budget origins.<br/><br/>Though Aronofsky's dialogue is perhaps a bit simplistic at times, the actors deliver it with a real passion. Hugh Jackman is particularly good during the present-day sequences, and we can only watch with despair as the impending loss of his wife begins to tear him apart from the inside. Rachel Weisz is also very good, and the two actors share a strong chemistry, never leaving us in doubt that their two characters are very much in love with each other. 'The Fountain' is an especially visual film, relying on its vibrant colours and stunning cinematography to inspire emotion. The dying golden nebula, Xibalba, towards which Jackman's astronaut travels is simply beautiful to look at, encompassing all that is beautiful and fascinating about the endless universe. Clint Mansell's score also contributes greatly to the awe-inspiring feel of the film, gradually becoming stronger and stronger in tone, before exploding in a flash of sound and energy for the heart-racing climax.<br/><br/>At just over 90 minutes in length, 'The Fountain' is long enough to adequately get its message across, but it ultimately feels as though there could and should be more to it. In my view at least, not nearly enough of the conquistador's journey was shown to us, and, indeed, another filmmaker might even have made that single section into a fascinating feature-length film of its own. 'The Fountain' is often compared to Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' in tone and style. Though the film itself is probably not even science-fiction  as I'm inclined to view the astronaut's journey as being metaphorical more than literal  'The Fountain' is similar to '2001' in at least one way: both films were bold and daring enough to stray from the mainstream, from what audiences are used to; time, I predict, will be very kind to this film."

","I just saw this movie and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's the emotional equivalent to Requiem For a Dream, but the subject matter is obviously very different.<br/><br/>Let me first say that this movie is not for everyone. It's for people who don't like to have plot lines shoved down their throats. It's for people who like to think and talk about the movie they've just seen with their friends. It's for people to look back on and try to pull apart the pieces to see where it all fits. The message is clear, the story can be confusing at times, and it's almost open for interpretation by the end.<br/><br/>This movie is truly visual poetry. After seeing it, I feel like I've just come away from a very strange but magnificent poem that dealt with life, love, and death. Don't go in expecting a straightforward story full of action and suspense. Expect poetry. Something visually and audibly beautiful.<br/><br/>I have newfound respect for Hugh Jackman as an actor. His performance was just incredible as, essentially, three different roles. I thought he was more of a one trick pony, but I was obviously wrong.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has created a masterpiece to a select group of movie goers. The average movie viewer will either hate this movie or not know what to make of it. But for those of us who have somehow felt the movie click, well, it's like no other movie in the world, at least that I've ever seen."

Its so out there and thought provoking you really forget reality for the duration of this movie. The visuals are up there with the best. It's simply stunning, like an elaborate acid trip at times, but stunning. The acting is great with two Hollywood heavyweights (Jackman and Weisz) taking a break from the frequent wooden epics to deliver great and genuine performances.<br/><br/>It is a great story line that breaks from harsh reality to fantasy to flashbacks in history and then on to an obscure future. Its a real insight of love and the fear and concept of loosing that love, it takes you there.

Both actors did an incredible job and Rachel Weisz certainly gives her role the very necessary emotional and human tone. Wolv... I mean Hugh Jackmann, at last seems to have a challenging role and comes out very well indeed. Very touching story and images.<br/><br/>Another part of me felt the movie tried to spin way too much and at times seemed confusing. The future part seem way too much ""Buddhism"" and spirituality mixed with sci-fi images. It gets tiresome eventually. I was always thinking the could get on with the main story.<br/><br/>The movie is no doubt visually stunning. Pity that the director didn't give the Conquistador part of the movie more screen-time. <br/><br/>Its not an easy to movie to understand or appreciate. If you want an entertaining movie go watch something else. If you want a movie that makes you think a bit... and touches your heart I recommend watching ""The Fountain"".

"djihin","10","7","12","19 September 2011"," A greatly underestimated work of genius
","I had seen this movie three different times already, but a while ago I viewed it once more, this time in Bluray. I decided to write a review after reading other reviews, to give this piece of art the credit it deserves. It is definitely not the kind of movie you want to see when you are tired, or having trouble paying attention. It is artful, not only in the way it is presented; with beautiful creative non-digital effects and engaging camera pans, angles and a sense of unfolding - No, it is also an artful way of describing one man's journey from ignorance to insightfulness that transcends the terrestrial and human domain.<br/><br/>Like others have said, it is not a movie for everyone. However I believe it is greatly misunderstood because of the depth of the subject. It is important to know that there is nearly nothing obvious about this movie, everything is open for interpretation - whether it is religious, scientific or psychological.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays varied roles here (and does it very well), all with similar and different traits - showing us what the unfoldment of time does to his conscience, and how he finally resolves the conflict of death and decay which directly addresses all of us."
"knujonmapson","10","7","12","5 December 2009"," As close to a commentary on pandeism as I've seen in a film....
","There is an underlying theme hinted at in this film, that being pandeism, the theological theory that the Creator not only created the Universe, but in fact became the Universe. This is reflected in several ideas within the film, the boldest of which is that the First Father of the Mayan legend recounted here actually became the world, through the vessel of the tree of life. A second hint is in the apparent reincarnation of the main protagonist -- Tomas, Tommy, Tom, through levels where he is first animalistic and blood-thirsty/power-hungry conquistador, then a scientist driven to conquer death itself, and finally a space traveler given to meditation and personal revelation. In each level, he is something of a more advanced model of humankind, culminating in his rejection of the quest for immortality, and acceptance of death. It is hard to imagine this not being intended to reflect the path of pandeism towards transhumanism, and the acceptance of death as a mere return to oneness with the Universe. The ""return to nature"" is reflected far more literally and brutally in the conclusion of the conquistador story.<br/><br/>Some other aspects that add to this interpretation: it is (again, intentionally) never wholly clear whether the conquistador story is intended as a true history of the characters, or as a fiction-within-the-fiction, and this makes the space travel story that balances it equally hazy in its realism relative to the main arc -- but this merely reminds us that maybe all things are merely imagined, from a certain point of view. There are moments, too, the planting of a seed, the jangled horrors done in the name of the theistic faithful, the revelation of a discovery that will change the world for countless among the afflicted, but which comes too late to save the one person for whom it was sought, the breaking off in a moment of altered time. The carriage of these ideas is so fresh and subtle that I can not help but consider this among the best films ever made."
"transformerzdealer","10","7","12","18 December 2007"," What an incredible movie
","This in my opinion is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The Fountain carries with it a message that every human needs to understand and appreciate to live life to its fullest. I had to watch it twice to grasp the whole meaning of this movie, and I'm sure that the people that watch it once and say it is terrible cannot appreciate it anyways. I will say that it does take some knowledge of Zen to fully appreciate the movie. If you are reading this and have not seen the movie, but are planning on seeing it, I will just give you a hint and say that Jackman's character is not traveling through time. Everything that happens is within himself. It may make it easier to understand, because before I first saw this movie, I saw the trailer, and it confused many people, including myself because it made it seem like Jackman and Weisz were traveling through time and space. Just remember this is not the case. Now go see this movie."

","The Fountain is one of those movies that takes one out of the time and space that they exist in today. It is not for the average viewer who just wants some evening entertainment.

I believe only a few of us are truly capable of understanding the overriding theme, and thus wonder if many will not like it. I however found it fascinating, the acting was superb by both Hugh Jackman, and Rachel Weisz, and their supporting cast. Well done special effects makes the transformations of the three stories come alive. <br/><br/>It's a story bigger than love, it a story of existence and interconnectivity of all things past and future.

","-- This review contains spoilers! --<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky and Clint Mansell have created a masterpiece of modern cinema, which, unfortunately, have been undervalued much.<br/><br/>I would like to tell about the mistakes in understanding the film, which arose from the trailer. The mistake is to attempt to present the story of film as parallel stories in the three time periods (1500, 2000, 2500). There is no fiction, and not so much philosophy. This is a film about feelings.<br/><br/>Despite the non-linear cut, which can confuse the viewer, the story is rationally intelligible, and the action takes place only in our days. The only fantastic part is the existence of a medicinal tree from Guatemala.<br/><br/>The script uses the same method as in Mulholland Drive - the main hero is sleeping part of time, but it is not shown directly. Another part of the film is occupied by the fictional events of the book. Dream, fantasy and reality shift each other to come together in a high point.<br/><br/>Young woman Izzi Creo is terminally ill. Her husband-oncologist Tom is desperately trying to find a way to save her, even neglecting the last hours of intercourse with her. He is looking for drugs that might be the extract of wood from Central America.<br/><br/>Izzie asks Tom to finish her book, ""The Fountain"", which in symbolic form tells about her illness, as the Inquisitor, the enslaving of medieval Spain. Search for drugs is shown in the book as searching for the mythical Tree of Life by conquistador in New Spain. Tom reads the manuscript in the hospital the night before her death.<br/><br/>After the funeral, Tom has a dream (pajamas on him is an indication of the sleeping). He falls to the dying star in a capsule with the Tree of Life. In this dream, there are many elements that are etched in his memory during the period of great emotional stress. The capsule falls on the star Xibalba, which has been showed by Tom's wife shortly before his death, talking about the beliefs of the Mayas. He talks to the Tree, whose value has been mentioned by Izzy and which represents for him the Life and the living wife (association: the hairs on the neck of his wife and the hairs on the bark of a tree). He also does a tattoo on the body, so he started to do the tattoo of wedding ring before going to bed. Periodically repeated in a dream when Izzy calls Tom for a walk, but he says that he is busy. He feels a strong sense of guilt over this episode, and at one point in sleep between work and walk with his wife he chooses walk.<br/><br/>Dream intersects with an unfinished book in the time of the murdering of conquistador by the Maya's priest. In the dream, Tom realized the futility of the wish of eternal life for the individual. He dies when the Tree of Life flowers germinates through him, and Xibalba explodes, giving birth of new stars. Tom is going through the catharsis, and accepts the reality.<br/><br/>Waking up, he goes to the grave of Izzy, and embeds the seed of a tree. He has finished her book."

","Two lovers collaborate on a mythical sci-fi romance novel that projects them 400 years into the past, and 600 years into the future. Each period (past, present, future) is an exquisite allegorical variation on the theme of death as creation, each expressed as a love story between Thomas and Isabel Creo.<br/><br/>This film is full of imagery, symmetry, symbolism, and metaphor - especially in the future. This is a good film to make you feel the awe of nature and life on the grandest of scales from a perspective that is otherwise difficult to accept in part due to our attachment to ourselves and others.<br/><br/>The DVD jacket blur is misleading and causes some to be confused. Do not confuse the outer story with the inner story created by Isabel to help her husband through the suffering process."

Three very rare gems in this very weak movie decade.<br/><br/>The unique blend of sci-fi and she's-dying-of-cancer disease-of-the-week schmaltz may seem like an absurd and undoable mix, but Aronofsky has made those two gel perfectly. I love sci-fi and absolutely detest ""disease(d) melodramas"", so even more power to him for managing to pull this off in such a way that I am not only prevented from writing yet another hateful diatribe, but actually only have good things to say about a movie.<br/><br/>Visually slick, the movie constantly jumps between three vastly different periods and settings. This will put off the more brainless among ye, plus the fact that everything is not spelled out for the viewers. I.e. there is a sufficient amount of free-to-interpret aspects which is the way I like it with any story that goes beyond the traditional themes and structures. For example, it isn't quite clear whether the bald, futuristic Jackman is the 21st-century scientist many centuries older (and ""cured"" from death) or a different person, merely representing yet another resurrected male half of the ill-fated couple.<br/><br/>It's commendable that Aronofsky has gone back to creating intelligent movies like ""Pi"". ""Requiem For A Dream"" was a trite drug-user-drama piece of Dreck which I thought might be signaling his very early fall from grace. (The fact that IMDb-ers consider it the best Aronofsky film says it all.) I'm glad I was wrong, because it seems that besides him and a handful of others there are no high-quality writer-directors around at present. This is an age in which a nepotistic, incompetent boor like Sofia Coppola is considered to be a brilliant ""auteur"". But then again, the best of any age were usually underrated, overlooked or almost totally ignored.<br/><br/>TF is one of those rare movies that stick in your mind, force you to think about it long after the end-credits roll, which is always refreshing.<br/><br/>At the start I thought that the soundtrack wasn't good enough, but by the time the movie ends, the music kind of grows on you.<br/><br/>The only slight criticism I could make is Weisz's casting. She looks rather boyish, i.e. not feminine enough, especially with the short hair. Picking out a true beauty would have been better."

They may not see anything.<br/><br/>It is not an easy film, but there *is* a simple interpretation that makes perfect sense. The confusion has been exacerbated by bad marketing that is completely misleading. Darren Aronofski has produced a work of genius that the majority of viewers are unwilling or unable to understand. Hopefully this brilliant film will be increasingly appreciated as the years go by.<br/><br/>*** Spoiler ***<br/><br/>For those who want to understand the film better, pay particular attention to the book that Izzy is writing. It is called ""The Fountain"", and the name is not a coincidence. It is a story of three eras, based on the Mayan mythology of the Tree of Life. You are watching that book. To aid her beloved husband through his grieving, and to teach him what she now knows, she leaves the book incomplete and assigns him a task: finish it."

That being said, the structure of it is kind of confusing if you aren't paying close attention to what's going on. You REALLY have to be watching for details and keep an open mind when you're seeing it to figure out what each of the little sub-plots mean and how they're all connected. However, if you understand what's going on, you're in for a hell of a good flick. So, if you're looking for a great film that makes more sense chronologically than Donnie Darko but less than the Terminator series, The Fountain is the one for you. While it may not be as action packed or high paced as some other films around (which isn't to say there's no action, since there are some very brutal scenes), The Fountain's plot is the most mature and intelligent around.

","The Fountain (2006) -------------------------- Death has always been an institution of fear for humans. So man always tried to find a way to escape from death or the possibility of life after death. As a social animal the death of a person would mostly affect those who are close to him. The pain of living even after the passing away of a loved one lead our mind to think that they will be watching us in their after life and they want us to be happy. - We have to understand that death is unavoidable, ultimately this is what Darren Arnofsky's The Fountain is all about. This movie amazes me every time I watch this movie . After Kubrick's Space Odyssey no other movie has given me such an experience with its visual beauty and its enigmatic nature. --- 3 stories happening in a time interval of 500 years is presented before us through a non-linear narrative. In the year 2006 neuroscientist Dr Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cure for his tumor diagnosed wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz). Izzi is writing a book called The Fountain. The book is set in the 16th century Spanish empire. The Spanish empire is loosing to the Inquisition by the Catholic church. As the last hope Queen Isabella decides to send conquistador Tomas to the New Spain in Central America where they believe the Mayans are protecting the Tree of Life. As Izzy calls Tom ""My Conquistador"" playfully she hints that the book is an analogy of their life. She also says that only Tom can finish the last chapter because only he would know the ending. The third story line shows Tommy traveling in a transparent globe like Spaceship with a supposed Tree of life and a pond and a surrounding ecosystem where Tommy keeps talking to the tree and hallucinates about seeing Izzi. Even the remote meaning of what's actually happening here can only be understood at the end of the movie. - It's not clear that if all of these are actually happening or just going through Tom's mind. Even the climax leave you with more questions than answers. The genre of the movie includes a little bit of History, Science fiction, Fantasy, Spirituality etc but the soul of the movie lies ultimately in Love. The Tree of Life from Bible and Mayan belief of creation is main themes of the movie and besides them lot of other cultural influences can be seen throughout the movie. - Hugh Jackman brilliantly played his triple role (triple or single?) and Rachel Weisz mesmerized as Queen Isabella and breaks our heart as Izzi. - Gold and White are the recurring primary colors in the movie. According to the Mayan mythology Xibalba is their underworld which actually is a nebula covering a dead star . Tommy is traveling to reach this golden Xibalba. Golden color shows the meaningless physical entities and wealth and white color shows truth and mortality. --- For decreasing the use of CGI Micro Photography was used to shoot chemical reactions and micro organisms to show Xibalba and some similar sequences. This helped in increasing the timeless visual beauty for the movie. - The movie which was a flop at its release has a strong cult following since then. This movie has a special place in my mind. Its not digestible to everyone but for those can, it will be a great experience."

"Horst_In_Translation","4","5","8","3 June 2015"," The Fountain has run dry
","This is an almost 10-year-old movie written and directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz (Aronofsky's fiancée at that point, she won an Oscar right before that). It only runs for 90 minutes (without the credits) and thus is one of his shortest works. Also it came short in terms of quality compared to what else he did in the last 20 years, possibly the director's weakest effort. I am a huge fan of Hugh Jackman, so it's a bit disappointing to see this did not work out as well as Aronofsky's projects with Burstyn, Rourke and Portman. ""The Fountain"" is nice to watch and visually appealing (sometimes a bit pretentious though) from an aesthetic perspective and also has a good (Golden Globe nominated) soundtrack from Aronofsky's frequent collaborator Mansell, so this film probably works infinitely better on a large theater screen than on your small computer. However, the story in here never really got me engaged, let alone fascinated me. For all I care, they simply could have kept this at the present without digging into the book that Weisz' character wrote. Aronofsky's other film also usually depict characters who are walking the fine line between sanity and insanity and they could have centered this around this whole premise of Jackman's character (a brilliant doctor) facing the mortality of his beloved wife. However, in terms of the script they actually came up with, making this one work is almost as difficult as finding a cure to cancer. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend watching this film. In terms of Jackman, I easily prefer his other 2006 movie ""The Prestige""."
"summerloud","10","5","8","19 November 2014"," My favorite movie of all time.
","First off, that the first time I saw this, I was slightly disappointed, since I expected something more similar to Aronofsky's first two movies - ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Pi"". Something raw, something brutal, something in-your-face.<br/><br/>The Fountain is more complicated though. After seeing it for the first time, the music and the visuals never completely left me, and i kept watching it. Again and again. By now i saw this movie more often than any other (ten times so far), and it still does not bore me. In fact, I keep discovering new stuff every single time i see it.<br/><br/>This is one of these rare works of art where every scene, every dialog, every tiny detail in the background, every note in the score, is of importance for the grand overall picture - and what a picture it is indeed!<br/><br/>Life, death, love. The cornerstones that define the human conditions, are what this movie is ultimately about. Most that would have tried to get across the point that ""The Fountain"" makes would have failed, but not Aronofsky - he delivers it with unmatched visual perfection, and with the help of outstanding acting from his cast.<br/><br/>No movie ever matched the score and the visuals so well. The music is beautiful and haunting at times, and keeps building up momentum, just like the movie does, towards the biggest, most emotional and deepest climax I ever saw in any movie. Be sure to turn the volume up for this one!<br/><br/>An extremely powerful movie, and very thought-provoking at that."
"A_Different_Drummer","10","5","8","28 March 2014"," one of those rare films that makes the viewer work...
","Do you recall the recurring scene in 1979's ALL THAT JAZZ where Scheider, playing Fosse in a movie actually directed by Fosse, starts each day in front a mirror, eye drops, cigarette, ablutions...? That scene, one of the most memorable not merely in the movie but in the history of cinema, had a pace, had a pulse, had an energy that drove the film. Some 20 years later (approximately) Aronofsky emerged on the film scene, as if out of nowhere, with PI, a black and white (!) film where (trust me if you have not seen it, AND THEN GO SEE IT) every single scene in the movie somehow, miraculously, had the exact same pace and energy as that iconic scene from ALL THAT JAZZ.<br/><br/>Such is the power of Aronofsky, his films are so unique, so different, so powerful, that you get a sense there is nothing in the filmic medium he could not do if he really wanted to; and moreover if any scene in any of his movies is less than perfect, it is not because he failed, it is because that is precisely how he wanted it.<br/><br/>THE FOUNTAIN is a case in point. The juxtaposed themes do, it's true, make the viewer work harder than almost any other film that comes to mind, but the payoff, the joy of discovery, is worth it. No wonder the studio's PR dept could not focus on a single theme in the ads -- how do you market a film that is equal parts love story; Buddha-like reincarnation tale; sci-fi time travel story; medical thriller; historical fiction...? And -- forgive me for the emphasis, I just watched the film again top to bottom -- the technical perfection is something to behold. The ""action"" scenes in the jungles of South America are as well filmed as the metaphysical (and visual) elevation of the lead character into the heavens at the very end.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman (who, for better or worse, may be remembered by future viewers simply as Wolverine) gives the performance of his life; yet scene by scene he is yet outdone by Rachel Weisz, who, in this film travels as far from her paint-by-numbers MUMMY films as the constellations are from Earth. There are scenes, especially where she plays the Queen, where her face practically glows, and you wonder if this is CGI or Weisz, or both...? Astonishing."

","This is a movie that left me angry that I hadn't used that precious 2 hours for a nap instead of putting myself through it. The whole movie you can see the writers reaching for something deep and profound. What they achieve is a movie just about as boring and senseless as ""Solaris"". This is the worst movie I have seen all year, and in a long while. The only reason I can think of to rent this movie, is if you have trouble sleeping and like to fall asleep to the television. This movie would be very good at that.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't expect an ""aha! moment"" at the end when you get how it all fits together. It never comes."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","8","15","15 October 2011"," A great film from Aronofsky and under-estimated
","I have very much liked all of what I've seen of Aronofsky, and judging from the amount of hate I had seen for The Fountain I was not expecting to like it. But while I think it could have been a tad longer, I thought the film was fantastic and my third favourite Aronofsky after The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream.<br/><br/>I also think The Fountain is under-estimated, it is a perplexing movie I agree but for me that was what drew me to this film in the first place. I find 2001 and Tree of Life perplexing movies, and like The Fountain they are not movies for everybody but I think important films. The pace is slow, but I was too taken in by the quality of the visuals, music, direction and acting to be bored by any of it.<br/><br/>Visually, The Fountain is one of the visually stunning films I have seen in a long time, and I have seen a lot of visually amazing movies such as any of Kubrick, Kurasawa, Fellini or Malick's resumes. The cinematography is outstanding and the colours and effects are rich. The music is of such beautiful and haunting quality, Aronofsky's directing shows ambition and heart and the dialogue is thought provoking.<br/><br/>As for the story, of all of Aronofsky's movies, The Fountain is perhaps his most philosophical and profound. There will be some people who will finish the movie trying to figure out what it all means, others like me will be rewarded by its effective scenes and ambitious themes. Scenes such as Jackman trying to find a cure for his wife's cancer, saving the Spanish queen from destruction by searching for the Fountain of Youth and sitting like Buddha beneath his cosmic tree really stand out, and the film does much with the ambitious and difficult-to-define themes of life, death, love and immortality.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent, with both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz giving some of their best work of their careers here. All in all, a great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

His other incarnation is on the way to a supernova in a bubble with a big half death tree in it.<br/><br/>Not to worry the Mexican guy drinks from the tree of life, and turns into a garden center.

","This movie is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever created of all time. It takes on a whole new meaning to the concepts of primal fear, death, love, loss, creation, and rebirth. The critics are wrong. Listen to me and listen well.<br/><br/>To me this movie has shown how the fear of death can run someone's life rather than letting the person live their life and experience the joy of living with loved ones.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is notably one of the best around. ""Death is the Road to Awe"" on the soundtrack is a masterpiece. The music will surround you and drown you wave after wave of beauty and emotion.<br/><br/>The visuals are amazing; mostly done without any CGI.<br/><br/>I'm a guy and guys don't usually cry, but this movie made me cry. The story is not what you would think. The past and future are more likely than not metaphors to support the struggles of Tommy and his wife Izzy in the present. For most of the movie Tommy in a selfless and yet selfish ambition tries to find a cure for Izzy's tumor.<br/><br/>This movie is not for people who are average. This movie is for those that think and comprehend on a much higher level. Keep your mind open and in the last 20 minutes I garantee you will feel what I felt.<br/><br/>This movie has changed my life, and I can't say that about any other movie I've seen.<br/><br/>See this film."
"MovieAddict2016","6","8","15","24 November 2006"," Beautifully haunting and wonderfully bizarre, but its ambitions weigh it down, along with its clinical and distant approach to the characters
","Visually stimulating but frustratingly disconnected from its viewers, The Fountain establishes director Darren Aronofsky as one of our most daring and adventurous directors  but his ambitions are ultimately what cause The Fountain to sink beneath its own heavy-handed pretensions.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has a way of making the most everyday events thrilling and beautiful, but his clinical approach to the characters of the film  portrayed by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz  creates a cold distance. A film such as this requires us to invest our emotions in the characters, which is impossible to do when they are so haphazardly presented. While the art sequences are mesmerizing, every time Aronofsky spends time focusing on his characters the movie hits a brick wall and becomes incredibly tiresome.<br/><br/>The fragmented story structure certainly doesn't help much in this regard. While it is no doubt an excuse for some awe-inspiring visual creations, every time Aronofsky cuts to another storyline more distance is drawn between the audience and the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>The plot, if you can follow this, involves a driven doctor (Jackman) trying to develop a cure for death. He claims it is just a disease, like anything else, and that he will be the one to give humans infinite life.<br/><br/>He is not driven by greed  his wife (Weisz) is dying of cancer and so he feels obligated to deliver her a cure.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the film veers off onto two different paths  one involving a Spanish conquistador and his quest for the Fountain of Youth, the other about the doctor from the first storyline (I think?) being trapped in a bubble in outer space with a dying tree (which his wife is apart of because it grew from her corpse  yes, honestly) and his struggle toummpreserve the tree and himself so they can live together forever.<br/><br/>The film's soundtrack, composed by Clint Mansell (Requiem for a Dream), is perhaps the highlight of the entire picture. Mansell is quickly establishing a name for himself as one of Hollywood's greatest composers.<br/><br/>And certainly the movie will wow audiences looking for something pretty. But it is not a very enjoyable experience, for the most part, and the scenes involving human conflict dragged on seemingly forever.<br/><br/>And so as an art-house picture this is wonderfully bizarre, beautifully haunting and utterly captivating; I just wish Aronofsky had chosen a film that did not require more emotional involvement than he was willing to develop."

The story is actually very clear. The sections in Space and Spain is actually the illustration of the book that is Izzy writing and i think other scenes are reality but it is open-ended. In the book, she is the Queen of Spain and Tomas is the Conquistador who is seeking the ""Tree of Life"" to save Spain. In reality, Izzy is dying and Tommy is bent on to save her. Tomas drank Tree of Life and cheated death with the result of losing both his life and Spain (The Woman). Metaphorically, after he drink the tree he drops his ring and dies and flowers grow from ground and his fragments poured to dead tree and tree revived. Both these scenes are the symbols of ""circle of life and death"" which is the symbol of ""Ouroboros"".<br/><br/>Fountain is a circular system. The water rises, comes to peak point then falls and comes back to filter and pumps upwards again and it is a circle. If it just rises forever, then there will be no water in fountain.

In the timeless, a tree toward the fountain. Shibalba. Tommy denies the sacred, as does all mankind. But as the natural reflection of every human being, he seeks restlessly for answers, for solutions, for healing, for completeness. Now as a Conqueror, now as a scientist, now as a spiritual seeker. Izzy points the way ... in the three lives. Tommy only understands him in the finals. As a conqueror, he faces the ""guard of the threshold"", the death of the ego, and drinks from the sap of eternal life. It becomes the whole. Like the buddha in the stars, it becomes light.

If you understand only half of the movie on first viewing i think it's absolutely normal.<br/><br/>One hint i can give you is that the scenes in the ""bubble"" are in the future, a few hundred years after the present time line.

She is losing her senses (only shown to have lost sense for sensing temperature). She has a seizure and was admitted to the hospital. Meanwhile, our biologist is trying to find cure for tumor by testing different drugs on monkeys(the test subjects). While he was upset and thinking about her wife condition, nurse warned the doctor the the test subject has been open for some time and is about to die if nothing is done soon. So they tried everything and nothing worked. Then he realized (which is shown as looking up to peep in his mind palace), that some extract from some tree could help stabilize her (monkey). And it worked. The monkey is better than before except her tumor. But he wanted to cure tumor so that he can save his wife. His team tested the same herb on different subject and it worked except the tumor is there, which later on starts decreasing. Now there are two other sets are there in the movie. One is the doctors mind palace, shown as a shown in an invisible bubble traveling in space. Inside it is dead tree of life and the doctor as a monk. The other is the fountain the book which her wife was writing. He has to complete the last chapter of the book as she could do it.

","If you're going to watch The Fountain, I must caution viewers that this is one of those films that require some semblance of a brain due to the complexity of this film. People didn't like this film precisely because they did not want to think. However, I found this film fascinating because of the story that is rich in underlying themes about eternal love. This film not only boasts a well-made and rather controversial storyline, it's visually striking and features some amazing visuals to look at. Just looking at the end credits will say it all.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's film has one complicated plot that spans centuries and millennia and talks about the past, present, and future. There are story lines revolving around a guy named Tom who's looking for a cure for his dying wife, a guy named Tomas Verdes who is looking for the Tree of Life, and a space traveler who hallucinates his lost love.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman delivers one of his career-best performance as he plays these multiple characters. He sheds away his X-Men persona and gives a heartfelt, emotional, and raw performance. A performance we have not seen from him before. Rachel Weisz does a very good job as well.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're able to close your eyes and use your brain, you'll more likely to find this film fantastic. I loved how this film drew parallels from the past through future while looking for the meaning of life and what one takes to be in love. There are several biblical references here and that makes the journey even more spiritual. A fantastic and a vastly underrated movie to behold. I rate this film 9/10."
"MBunge","4","4","6","18 March 2011"," This movie is like jumping off the top of the Empire State Building. It's kind of a fun ride until the very end.
","Watching this film is like taking a long, slow, scenic drive that ends with your car going over a cliff and plunging into a bottomless pit of stupid. Writer/director Darren Aronofsky takes the snippets of three baldly melodramatic stories and mushes them together to try and create something new and smart and deep. He fails on all three counts.<br/><br/>Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is a medical researcher trying to find a way to cure the brain tumor that is killing his wife Izzi (Rachel Weitz) when he happens to discover the secret of eternal life. Izzi is writing a novel about the embattled Queen of Spain (also Rachel Weitz) sending a brave and loyal conquistador (also Hugh Jackman) to find a mythical tree in South America that can grant eternal life. We're also presented with a bald and pajama-clad Tommy, after some indeterminate eternity has passed, flying through space in what appears to be a giant, novelty bowling ball with a tree growing inside it. He's taking the tree to a star that represented the Mayan afterlife where he expects Izzi to be reborn in some never explained way.<br/><br/>As a story that contrasts both the romantic and the practical pursuits of immortality with the end result of that pursuit, The Fountain isn't that bad. The individual plot threads are simple but direct and affecting. Aronofsky also crafts some marvelous imagery through the movie. But it's all fairly weak treacle that needs a big, mind-blowing ending to make it worthwhile.<br/><br/>To his credit, Aronofsky tries to pull off a big, mind-blowing ending. But like a cross-eyed cliff diver, he hits the rocks and he hits them hard. The conclusion of The Fountain isn't big, it's overblown. It's not mind-blowing, it's nonsensical. Instead of making you appreciate all that's come before, it makes you regret sitting through any of it. Aronofsky reaches out for meaning, but what he pulls back are two handfuls of hog manure.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have been there to see Aronofsky try and explain the conclusion of The Fountain to the actors, the producers, the marketing people at the studio and pretty much anyone at all. It would have been fun to see which of them pretended they understood what he was saying and which ones just let their eyes glaze over. It would have also been neat to see how many different BS explanations Aronofsky practiced in front of his mirror until he had one that he thought he could sell.<br/><br/>If you compressed The Fountain down into a half-hour, like it was an episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits, the cleverness of the premise itself would be enough to sustain the story. When you stretch it out to 96 minutes, however, it needs a lot more and Aronofsky doesn't provide it. The result is a crappy movie with extraordinary production values that's will only captivate budding cinematographers."

","I love Hugh Jackman & Rachel Weisz, however, this movie is a colossal waste of their talents. It is the biggest bunch of new age drivel I've ever seen- it's hard to follow- all the jumping around in & out of history leaves the viewer a tad confused & having to draw their own conclusions about exactly WHAT is going on! A Mayan Indian in Spain? Oh there IS some fact mixed in w/ the fantasy, but you may need to smoke opium first to sit thru it!! We were amazed at the number of snoring people around us! I sat thru it only to see if it got any better--after all w/2 actors of that caliber you EXPECT it to GO somewhere!! If you want to see a movie w/ no plot, no message, and ANYthing but factual- OR if you live in the ozone-- then go see it- otherwise your money is better spent on just about anything else that's playing right now."

","It's been roughly 3 hours since I came home from watching that movie with a few friends. Along with all the people walking out of the theatre with us, facial expressions and moods were basically the same, teary eyed and sunken, not because we were from whatever happened in the film, but because they had just woke up from a 96 minute nap, and a realization that th0se 96 minutes of our mortal lives had been torn away and lost forever. Why did we watch this movie? The idea of exploring immortality and eternal life might have caught our attention, but maybe because the trailer looked cool. <br/><br/>The Fountain was hard to follow at times, however, no matter how much we tried to give this movie a chance that it would come up with scenes that would excite or kick it up a notch, it never did. Instead, it leaves us listening to some repetitive, redundant, redundant, repetitive quote i must've heard 10 straight times in one part saying: ""(I can't even remember what the d*** Iz said 'cause after hearing it over and over i must have tuned it out already)."" Anyway, after that useless, piece of crap line was said, the credits show with the director's name first as usual. The most hilarious thing about that part was that in the middle of the silence of seeing the credits already, my friend 2 seats to my right gives a very useful and definitely agreeable exclamation, ""WHAT THE HELL?!"". My friend followed it with a couple of audible 'BOOS'. I was relieved to hear laughs in the rows down and around us because of course, what the hell was that movie anyway? I expected to hear some cocky intellectuals get up and bash at my friend for making those remarks but hell if they did(nobody did), i would've said that was a piece of sh*t movie anyway. I'm experiencing heavy Deja Vu right now but hey!, that movie was showing too, why didn't we just see that instead? Too bad, my time's run out...I saw Happy Feet a few days ago and even thought that was way better than this *agbag of a movie."
"krussell1357","4","10","20","23 November 2006"," I would not want to see this again...
","So many positive comments of this film from other viewers??... I'm glad some people got value from this movie... but...<br/><br/>I tend to judge movies by how they affect me, touch me, cause me to think, move me in some way. ""The Fountain"" did not. I sat through the whole movie waiting for some meaningful metaphor or other redeeming quality to an otherwise 2-dimensional, very flat experience.<br/><br/>Technically, there were some excellent visuals. But the story and it's point I thought could have been accomplished in a 7-minute music/visuals video. Many times I felt like I was in the midst of a film trying to be an ""Enigma"" album... but with no touching of the soul.<br/><br/>First, I'll say I tend to compare ""art"" films (which I think ""The Fountain"" is trying to be), filmmakers and film-making with the masters, such as Tarkovsky (my favorite) and Kurosawa.<br/><br/>The general lighting was not good, and was awkward in my opinion. There is a time and place to create a mood thru light... but to maintain the same nightmarish bleak lighting thru-out the whole film is huge saturation and overkill, to emotion and mood. I became de-sensitized essentially. I think for the horror genre, this is O.K. But even Tarkovsky, the master of the use of light in film to create mood, impressions, and metaphors, would not resort to creating or trying to maintain mood in this way, not without tight editing and a suitable storyline. I honestly kept feeling that the lighting was being used to compensate for what I thought was a potentially interesting... but weakly executed storyline and editing. I understand what Aronofsky was trying to accomplish... but this reminds me of a young, inexperienced chef over-spicing food to compensate for inexperience... when the master chefs use very subtle, skilled, varied and sparing use of spice.<br/><br/>Same with the same repeated string and synthesized pieces of musical score... same thing again and again and again... instead of varying the score for depth and mood, for story progression.<br/><br/>I did not like the many replays of scenes that were repeated again and again and again. I understand this repeating also, but I judge the use of this technique on whether the story is carried further or deepened in some way. Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" is a perfect example of a master's skillful use of repeated scenes, and in fact this was the idea behind ""Rashomon"". I honestly felt that some of ""The Fountains"" repeated scenes were repeated NOT to carry the story... but to fill screen time.<br/><br/>I really like Hugh Jackman as an actor. But I don't think this was a good role for him. I could not feel for his characters, at all. His characters' angst and pain were constant, 2-dimensional, a bit over-acted I think, and felt not real... not human. I just could not connect with his characters (and I have some experience with death). But I'm not sure if it was Jackman, the script, or a combination.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz's acting was one of the few redeeming qualities, in my opinion, of the movie. I thought she did a great job with the material she had. Her characters had depth, a human feel, and I quickly connected with her characters.<br/><br/>Although I'm very spiritual... the spirituality in this movie also felt 2-dimensional to me, and ""pseudo"" (contrived). Something someone developed in Hollywood. It did not connect with me cohesively on a Christian level, or any other religion for that matter. There was a little theology behind it, of course, but the movie was an incohesive and somewhat disorganized mix of a few different spiritual concepts, in my opinion. I gained no new insights into life, death, love, loss, etc. I'll mention ""The Sacrifice"" as a film to compare it with, on a spiritual level. But there is no comparison between the two.<br/><br/>I also judge a film by whether I want to see it again, and try to gain more from it. ""The Mirror"" is a good example. Tough film to watch emotionally and it takes a lot out of you, but a fresh re-viewing is worth it because I gain something more for the effort, every time. But with ""The Fountain"", I have no desire at all to see it again. I can gain nothing further from it. Apparently some other viewers can. All I can say is go for it and more power to you.<br/><br/>Overall, there were a few redeeming qualities... but nothing that would bring me back to see it again."
"bowtiecinema","1","15","33","16 November 2006"," I'm still trying to figure out what this film was about. All I know is that I should waste my time.
","I recently saw this film at a preview screening at Warner Bros. Studios. I don't know how a film like this can get made. Although I've heard it called by someone, ""the best film I've ever seen"", I couldn't disagree more. I believe it to be one of the worst films, not only of the year, but also of all time. The story of this film is so mutled, baffling, and incoherent that only a true fan of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Zardoz could appreciate it. Every scene is totally random and out of context with no structure. We see a man in the jungle, a doctor operating on monkeys, and a monk floating around space in a snow-globe (which I later found out by reading a quote from the director was suppose to be an astronaut 600 years from now (I couldn't understand that after watching the entire film)). Many films, like The Fountain, try to trick the audience into believing that they hold some kind of intellectual insight, when in reality they are a series of random and uninsightful images based around a loose concept. No one can understand The Fountain. It's beyond comprehension. The screenplay for this film is simply atrocious. The characters appear randomly without context and have no development whatsoever. Although the running time of this film isn't very long, it seems like an eternity that I'll never get back. Director Aronofsky has made some of the worst films I've ever seen and he still somehow finds a way to outdo himself with ever new attempt. Don't get dooped into believe that this film holds some deeper meaning. It you did, you'd spend an eternity trying to find that meaning and would never be able to. This fountain only a mere puddle that will soon evaporate away."
"just_a_little_frog","1","11","23","8 December 2006"," The worst film ever made?
","This film is so bad that more then half of the audience left in the middle of the screening. There is no story, the characters are meaningless, the acting is beyond bad, the writer director is so full of himself that it is simply hard to believe. Who ever green lighted this film must be crazy.<br/><br/>I would write a summary but there is nothing to write. I would highly advise anybody who wants to see this film to save their money and time. there is more action in watching the grass growing and it is more interesting by far.<br/><br/>I have never seen a film in which the audience booed loudly during the screening and in which so many people started to leave within minutes."
"gheremond","10","7","13","18 January 2009"," Ambitious storytelling of the highest caliber
","When I first watched Aronofsky's first feature, ""Pi"", the one thing I thought was ""I really have to make room in my top ten for this"". It was flat out one of the greatest movies I had ever seen, with the most ridiculous budget ever. I was certain there was no way in the world Aronofsky could ever surpass such an achievement, even with a huge budget at his disposal, no matter how hard he tried. And then ""Fountain"" came along.<br/><br/>The central theme of the movie is death. The death of humans, of trees, of love, even the death of entire stars. It is a millennia, light-year-spanning epic, a symbolic representation of man's eternal quest to conquer/evade death and his futile hunt for immortality. Three different parallel stories, taking place 500 years apart from each other, give three different perspectives on the same adventure, each one a reflection of the others, until they finally merge into a single storytelling thread. Three different incarnations of essentially the same character, Thomas Creo (Hugh Jackman), embark on a desperate mission to save the woman he loves, Isabel (Rachel Weisz). The story is profoundly original and as ambitious as it takes, dealing with some of the most important issues of human existence. Death, fear of death, the hunger for eternal life and eternal time and the way people waste most of their lives trying to evade their demise and conquer death, while forgetting to live every precious moment. At the same time it is one of the most engaging love stories. In essence, this ""undying love"" is the only thing that survives and defies death, connecting all the different parts of the story and becoming its driving force.<br/><br/>All of the known and beloved camera and direction tricks Aronofsky introduced in his previous two movies are also in the Fountain, but very enhanced due to the higher budget available. The script is very elliptic, with many key phrases being repeated throughout, just like in ""Pi"", in different context and different eras. The same goes with the repeated use of imagery and camera shots to connect the three segments of the story. This repetition feels like a pulsating beat, becoming louder and louder and resonating, until by the end of the film you think you have been watching a 3+ hr odyssey. You know everything by heart and have established a special connection with the characters and their ordeal. Visually, the movie is utterly breathtaking. Whether it is 16th century Spain, a present day hospital or the deep space in the deep future, the depiction is uniquely original, possessing an otherworldly beauty. The special effects of the movie are also very imaginative and well balanced. No over-the-top, alienating CGI. Aronofsky has by now established a reputation of shocking endings and ""The Fountain"" is no exception. The final 10 minutes of the movie are shocking, heartbreaking, awe-inspiring and emotionally charged like no other sequence Aronofsky has put to screen so far. <br/><br/>The will and determination of the director also pushes everybody else involved in the production to give their very best and Aronofsky has over the years assembled a group of incredibly talented people around him. Matthew Libatique reaches new heights in his art with his accomplishments in this movie. James Chinlund also excels in the art direction of the picture. And Clint Mansell gives his career's best with the score for ""The Fountain"". I always liked his previous entries for ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"", but his style is certainly minimalistic and I was skeptical whether he could come up with something able to rival grand orchestral work. And Mansell truly delivers! His score is at times very intimate and personal, at times rousing and bombastic and always at perfect sync with the film's imagery. It complements it and lifts it to a whole new level. After watching it, you simply cannot think of this movie disconnected from its wonderful music.<br/><br/>And then there are the performances. Basically, this is an almost theatrical kind of movie. Most of it could actually be reduced into a monologue. It is all about the two protagonists: Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, who literally shine in their respective roles. About Jackman: Forget Wolverine! Hugh Jackman IS Thomas Creo. Period. He depicts his character with a mixture of determination, agony and grace which makes him almost iconic. He is a conquistador, in every sense of the word, the eternal image of a man willing to overcome every challenge, being either an explorer, a scientist or an astronaut, to move forward. Rachel Weisz plays his companion Isabel, the woman Thomas is always trying to save from imminent death. She imparts in her role a quiet, restrained dignity and wisdom. Weisz's stunning performance leaves no doubt that this is the woman one would be willing to cross oceans of time and space in solitude in order to save. The chemistry between the two is amazing and they give one of the most memorable screen couples ever. ""Fountain"" is essentially a love story, just not a conventional one. The love between the two is never explained, never disputed, never challenged, even barely described. It is a quintessential romance, the shining heart of this emotion that remains once you remove all the layers of human imperfections, mistrust, jealousy, ambition, dissatisfaction that always plague real relationships. This is an outmost romantic love tale, one which defies clichés. It is important to note that, the word love is not uttered even once in the entire movie! Bravo, Aronofsky!<br/><br/>Is it better than Pi? For me it is almost a tie, although I have to admit ""The Fountain"" has the edge at some categories, like superior cinematography and a much better score. Just like classics as ""Blade Runner"", this movie will become better and better with the passing of time. I really hope that in the end, it will receive the universal praise it rightfully deserves."

","Just list the most memorable films that have had a real impact on culture, or reflected what the big questions are in life, and you will soon see some of the most savage and banal criticism. The Fountain is a genre creating work, in the way that Blade Runner was. This is a problem of categories, in this case, 'Science Fiction'. Reading the reviews it is evident that any film that does not spoon feed the viewer is a failure, oh dear.<br/><br/>This is a complex and stunning work of depth and beauty, and more to the point extremely thought provoking. It leaves you with a great deal of introspection, and demands, goodness me!... thought.<br/><br/>Another category issue is 'entertainment' - are we so banal that we have to be happy or somehow sated on leaving the cinema? That is the problem of marketing to 18-25 year old audiences...this requires some insight. This movie hit home with me because it deals with loss of a loved one through death, not divorce, or break-up, but the ultimate finality. I think this is film that requires the viewer to have experienced this kind of loss. Then you get it.<br/><br/>Aranovsky clearly understands this cannot be dealt with simply, and there is really no such thing as 'closure'. We are doomed to confront the ultimate truth that we cannot stop our loved ones from dying, and we all die alone. But we can take solace in memory and consciousness, and remember that we are all made from the effectively immortal fabric of the universe.<br/><br/>The answers are more questions, but this comes down to the latest theories and speculation of the nature of consciousness. Some of the ideas that are alluded to in the film are clearly related to these. This is an area that will see far more material on screen in the next decade, it is low hanging fruit for filmmakers.<br/><br/>Aranovsky is one of the first, take heart sir, you can never be a prophet in your own land, you are in good company, ask Ridley Scott."

"mattdenes","10","7","13","22 November 2006"," A Fountain of Meaning
","I must say, there was more than enough buildup of anticipation to seeing this film long before it came out. Aside from the mesmerizing trailer that seemed to scream masterpiece, the conception of a modern re-telling of the story of the fountain of youth all but floored me. Walking into the movie theater tonight, I already knew that, whatever the outcome of the film, I knew I would enjoy its movie-going experience for the special effects. However, I never thought this film would be among my top five favorite films ever.<br/><br/>""You're either going to love it or hate it."" the concession stand employee said to me before the show, which was the gist of how I characterized most intelligent or groundbreaking films.<br/><br/>At a span of 96 minutes that seemed like hours on end that I never wanted to stop, THE FOUNTAIN is a masterpiece of modern cinema by way of Darren Aronofski. It tells the stories of three seemingly different sequences simultaneously that, within the film's magnificent climax, become one with each other. Its lessons or messages are many and complex, requiring a heavy amount of pondering and thought for the intelligent movie patron, comparable to other legendary films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the recent CRASH. Which, perhaps is what the concessions worker meant. Those who find this film shoddy, repetitive and inconsistent simply lack the patience and capacity to think after a movie concludes. The average movie-goer demands explanations, answers and solutions to absolutely every concept within a movie, the audience member leaves confused, baffled and angry, blaming the movie for their feelings instead of humbling themselves to recognize their own lack of mind broadness and increased ignorance.<br/><br/>Films like these demand the viewer to think, as if the film itself is an equation offered to the audience to solve. The audience then conjures what THEY believe to be the rightful meaning of a movie, whether it is actually the one or not, or if there is a solitary one at all. Like good music, the listener is forced to conceive their own elaboration of a song or movie, which, when considered, few may want to.<br/><br/>This film is targeted at a specific genre of people: intelligent people. Films like these win awards while 2/3 of America disagree or rant that they've never even heard of the movie before. Will it receive #1 at the box office? Probably Not. Will it win an academy award? Perhaps. Will it be, in the short run merely forgotten only to be remembered by future generations? Perhaps.<br/><br/>Aranofsky examines a fact of life that can only be deemed ultimate and utmost, and that is the concept of life, death and the hypothetical hypothesis of living forever. For when we lose someone, we mourn for their absence and wish for the reversal of their death above all things. This film asks the question, what if you could live on? Perhaps its primary aim is to not only remind us that we would not want to live forever, but that, ultimately, we have to die, and that the death of anything means the birth and living of another, from the death of a person, to the sprouting of flowers."

","I've just watched The Fountain at the Copenhagen Film Festival. A lot of puzzled, but also blown away people left the theater, especially with such a poetic, arch-typical and climatic ending.<br/><br/>In an effort to provide some help for those still searching for ""meaning"" in this wonderful, layered film, I would like to humbly suggest delving into some of the Kabbala teachings which the authors surely have under their belt, perhaps even check-out the Gospel of Philip (from the Gnostic library; all those quotes about Heavenly Marriage, Eve and Adam, and all the Magdalenes surrounding Jesus :).<br/><br/>And then, those more technical minded people perhaps, could also look-up some of the books and passages from the authorship of Alice A. Bailey, dealing with the subject of Initiation (points of crisis and break-through in the process of spiritual growth), namely those writings on the 4th initiation.<br/><br/>I have not argued specifically for the spirituality in this film, as it must be up to people to explore that pathway for themselves - ie. with no more spoilers given directly here (which an adequate argument for ""a spiritual interpretation"" would include in spades) :)."
"threebotsfive","1","9","18","23 March 2007"," A failed experiment
","For this movie, the viewer has to have an open mind... a VERY OPEN mind! Tons of Flashbacks & flash forwards & repeating of scenes, it was ridiculously done in my opinion. If there were no repeats, I'm guessing the movie would have lasted only 30-45 min. This is the story about a Conquistador in one time period, a doctor in another time period, and a futuristic scientist all seeking life everlasting (referenced from the Tree of everlasting life in the Garden of Eden). My girlfriend and i agreed that if they had just stuck with the present time story, it would have been an interesting movie and there was no fountain at all in whole thing. The ending is very abnormal so it scores big in the unique category, but the worst served in all of this is Rachel Weisz, who gives such a phenomenal performance but she's stuck with trying to give this film meaning."
"djfluke76","10","9","18","27 November 2006"," The best movie that no one will watch.
","Disclaimer: This movie is NOT for everyone. If you are looking for a movie to ""zone out to"" (which is fine), do NOT go see this. If you want a movie that makes you think and question life, death, and the journey for solace days after seeing it, then go see The Fountain. In terms of visuals, it's absolutely stunning (cinematography, lighting, special effects) and in color tone, is the polar opposite to Requiem For A Dream (RFAD was cold blues and grays, TF is all warm amber glows). The special effects enhance the story instead of compensating for a lack thereof. For a movie with relatively so little dialog, the acting is universally spot on, and Rachel Weisz should be recognized for Best Supporting Actress (even though she won't be). Her ""bed scene"" was absolutely heart-wrenching and yet gloriously strong in depicting her character's acceptance of the situation around her. You'll sit through the first 15-20 minutes wondering where the hell it's going, but once you're ""in"", it becomes absolutely rapturous. It's very rare that a movie actually reaches the ""hype"" and ""concept"" presented in the trailers. IMO, Darren Aronofsky has succeeded and created an amazing film that won't be appreciated by all, but will be cherished by those that do. Let's just hope we won't have to wait so long for him and his next project."

Part of the story is reminiscent of tired TV hospital melodramas. Painted on a dirty dark brown canvas. Tedious direction. Bland acting: one more role and Jackman will o.d. from overexposure. Jackman tries too hard to be a hunk, an artiste and romantic lead and succeeds as neither. Rachel Weisz looks pretty even when reciting her silly lines. The cg effects work for the first 15mins.

","The harsh critics made at this movies are, in a way, understandable. There is a French adjective that might sum up the opinion of those who did hate it: ""pompier"", which could be roughly translated by ""pompous"" : a generic, bombastic subject rendered in a academic and pretentious fashion.<br/><br/>Its highly sophisticated visuals and non-linear structure makes it particularly challenging, indeed. Furthermore, dealing as it does with as universal themes as Death, Eternal love or the search for immortality makes it daring, a word that could also mean ""risky"".<br/><br/>When a movie challenges what we, mere moviegoers, expect from them in general (a clear structure and the feeling that we have understood all of it when leaving the theater) the risk for its authors is never far.<br/><br/>I for one see it as a daring and beautiful work. And, dear me, a profound and moving narration. To make matters worse, the acting from Hugh Jackman, in his quest through Time, is really impressive.<br/><br/>But then again, is the movie too ambitious? Did Aronofsky foolishly tried to make a timeless movie? Is Mansell's score, dramatically departing from his previous works with Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem For A dream), equally overly vapid and grandiose? I reckon these are the sorts of critics that could easily be made but I do not share them and would find them more appropriate concerning Kubrick's 2001 (another ambitious Sci-Fi epic aiming at universal themes) which I found cold and distant.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, Darren Aronofsky, as an auteur (unlike Requiem For A Dream, this is an original screenplay), completely ignored formulaic structures for a (daring/risky) story with universal themes. And giving the main role to his wife proves is eagerness to illustrate first and foremost a love story in a non-conventional way and how sincere he was in this bold enterprise. That sets him and his movie apart."

The way I look at it, this movie is just a group of feelings combined together in a visual work. If ever wonder how would someone draw or visualize a human feeling, I would say Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain is one of them.<br/><br/>The music in this movie played a huge part, It's really hard to imagine how would the movie would have this effect if it had different music or less effective.

The film left me horrified.<br/><br/>That aside 'The Fountain' promised some profound concepts that no doubt would apply to any philosophical mind. So finally the release date came and my partner and i managed to find one of the few cinemas in London that showed it on the opening weekend.<br/><br/>I could never have expected such an experience. It was profoundly touching. Its content pressed on fundamentals into the mysteries of life that are simply so rare in modern film. As a result i considered it so great, magnificent, awesome, ecstatic, heart-breaking and mind-numbing all in one. It couldn't be more pertinent. The concepts of life and death in there most absolute form are so easily overlooked as we are consumed by the workings of our everyday mundane life. This film shows them plainly for all to see.<br/><br/>My partner and i left the theatre without a word to each other. We actually didn't speak for the rest of the night. I never would have known that a film could reduce me to such base emptiness.<br/><br/>We both spoke the following day about how we heard so many people in the cinema mention that they didn't understand the movie and by the way they were speaking one could tell they were unimpressed and belittled it.

","Spoiler alert.<br/><br/>When the movie ended, I was somewhat disappointed. I was really anticipating this movie. I guess it wasn't what i thought it was going to be. I do this all the time with music. I think an upcoming album is going to be amazing and I have an idea of what i want it to sound like and then when i actually hear it, its different and im not sure if i like it. this movie was somewhat the same. I want to see it again, and i probably will tomorrow since it was only 3 bones at my local theater. It is quite amazing how aronofsky tied it all together. The first thing that bothered me was that her story was somewhat short. Like how was hugh supposed to finish it. Then i realized that him dying at the fountain of youth was exactly how he died in the spaceship, one with his wife. I was confused when she kept whispering ""finish it"" until i realized she meant ""write the last chapter."" I really liked the idea that they would live forever, but in death. And once he accepted it, all was well. People don't like how it was tied together, but honestly, how would you have done it? Could you have thought of this plot line? I hate how people criticize movies and say ""it sucks"" when they are usually just some bum that sits on these messageboards. You know what, get off your ass and go make a movie. Go write a better movie with a more interesting plot line. I bet you couldn't make a better movie that legally blond 2. <br/><br/>The point is, is that this is a breakthrough film. It challenges thought, and is done in a beautiful way. I think it is a great follow up to his other films, and was an extremely risky move as a director. Cant wait till the next film.<br/><br/>jagshemesh."

The cinematography was a cliché brought to the nth degree. Enough already with the dark lighting and whispering.

","I can't add much more to some of the other many-starred reviews here, suffice to say the film will have you thinking long after you have left the theater.

Don't look too much for answers, as you sometimes have to put together your own.<br/><br/>The visual effects are stunning and,don't betray the ""lowish"" budget of $30 million this cost to make. They're done with some old-fashioned methods, fluid chamber work, model work and a dash of CG.

","Every year there are being released a few art house movies that have a very big potential: a story with several dimensions and every time you watch it you see the movie from a different perspective. Often they have a poetic beauty and are visually stunning. Eternal sunshine was one of those and this year's there another one...<br/><br/>I was fortunate to see ""the fountain"" at the gent international film festival (belgium) in the presence of director Darren Aronofsky. In his speech he told he wanted to make a new kind of science fiction movie. No laser guns and stuff like that, but beautiful, poetic images of space...<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a couple: Isabelle(Izzy) & tom. Izzy has a tumor and Tom is a scientist who's trying to find an antidote against dead. This is one of the three stories. The second one is the story Izzy's writing: the fountain (which explains the title) and the third one shows us tom as a space explorer in the 26th century. They're all connected to each other and deal with questions about life & dead, the reason of existence...<br/><br/>It's no ordinary science fiction movie, but a poetic tribute about love, dead & existence. Sometimes it's surrealistic and then it reminded me a bit of eternal sunshine.<br/><br/>Conclusion: The fountain is a wonderful movie that leaves you more questions than it answers. Every time you'll watch it, you'll get another dimension of it. There'll definitely be loads of people who'll hate this movie, to those people: stay away! But if you're in for a poetic, visually stunning and intelligent film then this is your movie!"

It didn't get any better.<br/><br/>The plot, if you want to call it that, is to do with curing cancer and eternal life - but it doesn't seem that sure which or what. It pulls the poor Aztecs into the rubbish, as well as the Spanish Conquistadors and some gratuitous violence with Inquisition bashing (as if there are serious supporters of the Inquisition around today who might be offended).

","I am totally shocked that anyone in their right mind is sitting here raving about the hidden genius of this film while I have never been so ready to leave the theater. <br/><br/>I like to enjoy a film on two levels; first, being in the movie and being entertained by the story, secondly analyzing hidden messages and symbolism after the film. It bothers me that anyone can appreciate the second without the first.<br/><br/>The fact is, this movie is hard to watch. It is weird, it skips around, you don't know enough about any of characters to care if they live or die, and well, half the movie takes place in a bubble floating though space where a guy is nursing a tree with hair. And what did you like about this movie? <br/><br/>Furthermore, I have read people's comments about the supposed ""brilliant"" symbolism of the movie. OK, so these stories are connected, after death they are together, the tree represents the life and the 12 tribes of Israel, the main characters are Adam and Evem and after death they are together.... WHO CARES? First of all, no symbolism or meaning in this movie is original. We've seen these themes thousands of times! The fact is there are a million movies you can draw the same end meaning from that are actually watchable! It hurts me that people try so hard to be intellectuals that they actually pretend to like this. It is like when someone takes a crap in a bag, puts it in an art museum, and then people sit around marveling at its significance."

","I cannot begin to say how disappointed I am in one of my favorite actors, Hugh Jackman. This movie was very... well, to put it bluntly, stupid. It starts off weird and ends weirder. It's depressing and unrealistic (even from a sci-fi standpoint). It goes far in the special effects, but lacks in character. I could not find myself connecting to the conquistador or Isabel, nor could I connect to Thomas and his never-ending obsession for an end to death--especially as he is in a little bubble with a tree for so long. Plus, Hugh Jackman loses all of his charm when he is bald and kissing trees. I could hardly sit through the whole thing, it was too weird to even laugh at."

Kubrick's film was full of nice images and had all the intellectual content of a 3 day old slushy, not surprisingly it made imbeciles feel cleverer than ordinary folk. Aronofvsky had previously made the shockingly bad ""Requiem For A Dream"", a melodrama so lurid and OTT it induced chuckles. I never believed he had the capability to outdo the rankness of that effort but astonishingly he has succeeded with room to spare. Over 3 different time spans of bad acting and worse dialogue we learn that love is good and death bad. Flicking channels after this I came across ""Beerfest"", in it's own way a very bad film, it seemed like a masterpiece after ""The Fountain""."

","One of the most beautiful films about love and life I have ever seen. I've never written a review on IMDb before, but really felt compelled to do so just for this film. The story it tells on the topmost level is simple, but the experience and spiritual journey it takes you on leaves a profound and powerful impact from which a true genius of a director such as Aronofsky can only attain. I usually walk away from a film and leave it behind in the theater where it screened, but this film ""walked away"" with me. I can't shake it, and I'm glad I can't. This will sound really corny, but it's affected me down to my soul and I can honestly say I feel better because of it. Hugh Jackman as Tom is awesome and perfectly played. Rachel Weisz as Izzi is truly a beauty that radiates from deep within. Beautifully shot. I just noticed how many times have I said beautiful or beauty in this commentary, but in every sense and level of the word this film in all its manifestations truly is."
"kjaworski","3","7","14","14 November 2006"," neat visuals, but an over-ambitious plot and a LOT of over-acting
","It's good to see a filmmaker really reaching - but I'm finding more and more that, for my taste, Darren Aronofsky had better results when he had more limitations. I'm referring to Pi, of course, definitely my favorite of his films so far, and I'd go so far as to call it a classic of independent film-making.<br/><br/>I like Requiem for the most part, but The Fountain, to me, just leans a bit too far on the side of film histrionics too many times.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's performance is obviously a committed one, but Aronofsky seemed to direct Jackman to just 'act' the crap out of their roles, as well as the other actors - there's very little subtlety in their performances - which is certainly not to say that they aren't capable of it, and haven't achieved it in the past. Virtually all the way through the movie, the principles have these actions and reactions which are, for lack of a better term, over-the-top most of the time. One moment towards the end involving Jackman's character, without giving it away, prompted laughter from some in the audience I was in - and laughter clearly wasn't the intention of that moment.<br/><br/>Visually, Aronofsky certainly doesn't disappoint. The look of both the realistic and less-realistic scenes is pretty at worst, and thrilling at best. Again, though, too many times, it feels to me like there's no enough root in the story for some of the visuals to be justified. Great visuals are good - but great visuals can only be truly grant in a movie with deeply motivated reason to be there - by the story and the plot, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The story and plot certainly are interesting, and worth at least trying to track with - I was actually most engaged by the present-time story. I'm all for stories and plot that deviate from the standard formula - but I'm of the mind that it has to add up in some fundamental way for the viewer SOMEhow. Clearly it has for many - but it didn't for me or for anyone else I heard from at the screening I attended.<br/><br/>This is NOT a bad film - you can do much worse at either the theaters currently or Blockbuster. A lot of people clearly love the film, which is why I was excited about seeing it. I wouldn't say I was let down. While the story is rather refreshing in spite of what I consider to be its problems, and the visuals were nice, I expected more."
"holker-127-845774","9","5","9","3 September 2011"," Quest for acceptance
","Watching this film was like watching a masterpiece painting coming to life. Visually it reminded me a lot of Anton Corbijn's video-clip of R.E.M.'s song ""Losing My Religion"", but then with the captivating music of the Kronos Quartet 20 times longer, who by the way did such a good job in the ""Requiem for a Dream""-film from the same director, who made this very picture; Darren Aronofsky.<br/><br/>I read that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were cast for the lead characters, but Brad went for Troy (big mistake). I do not know if these two could have done a better job then Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, but actually I think the rolls would have fitted better with Latino actors to be honest. I think it is a missed opportunity there for Penelope Cruz or Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas or some other Latino, who could have maybe given this film that extra star it needed to make it truly legendary.<br/><br/>But I am nitpicking this film to much. This film is a story of a man who cannot accept his wife is dying. His wife has already accepted her faith and has to painfully watch her husband struggle with this. This beautiful story is not about Tom trying to help Izzy by finding the cure for cancer, but exactly the opposite; the dying Izzy helping out Tom finding reconciliation with his ordeal of losing her. A wonderful film full of symbolism you can watch over and over again. 9/10"

","When I set to write something about this movie I had only one dilemma; is it going to be short or massive comment. I decided to be as short as I can, cause words can hardly describe what I feel. Maybe just one word: unique. Unique on many levels; writing ,acting, music... <br/><br/>Sound background fits perfectly in this story telling and the acting of Hugh Jackman & Rachel Weisz is amazing. I knew that Weisz is good actress, but this is movie where Jackman became a real actor. This is so heavy role and Jackman done it nearly with perfection. <br/><br/>Something about the script; movie follows three stories. Each one from the past, present, and future - conquistador in Mayan country searches for the tree of life to free his captive queen; medical researcher, working with various trees, looks for a cure that will save his dying wife; a space traveler, traveling with an aged tree encapsulated within a bubble. My understandings (don't read any more if you haven't watched it): The only story that is really happening is the one that takes place in present. Story from the future presents Tommy and that tree. Probably you've all realized that Izzi is actually that tree, cause when she dies, tree dies too. Story from the past is search for eternal life, actually Tommy's search for cure that would save Izzi. At the end Tommy dies in future and past. In future to bring life to that tree that presents his everlasting love to Izzi and in past where he dies and fails to save Spain and live happily ever after with Queen (Izzi). In the present Izzi couldn't be saved but the whole story leaves us bright hope that Tommy will find cure and he says: ""Death is a disease, it's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure - and I will find it."" <br/><br/>At the end, this is a big comment. Sorry, I got carried away. But I didn't changed my mind regarding this movie. Really superb piece of art that will have negative reviews only from those who couldn't understand this beautiful movie or from those who simply don't want to use brain to interpret this story."

","Watching The Fountain was one of the most profound and moving experiences I have ever been part of. <br/><br/>Not only were the special effects (dealing mostly with the nebula) and score amazing, but the whole storyline and the way it was presented left me speechless when I finished the movie.<br/><br/>The story begins in the 1500's, in Spain, during the Inquisition. Hugh Jackman plays Tomas, a conquistador, who goes on a journey to find the Tree of Life (or Fountain of Youth). He was sent on this mission by Queen Isabella, played by Rachel Weisz. The story takes place in three story lines- the one in the 1500's- one in the 2000's- and the other, and most spectacular, in the 2500's- deep in outer space.<br/><br/>After watching the film, it took me several hours of thinking about what really happened- and I came up with this interpretation-<br/><br/>Only one of the story lines is truly real- the ""present."" The future storyline is a clear metaphor for the struggles ""present"" Tommy is enduring in relation to Izzy's illness. The tree in his spacecraft clearly represents Izzy. His travel to the dying star is directly parallels his quest to find a cure for Izzy's cancer. If he can find the cure for death, Izzy- as well as he- will live forever. Izzy's death coincides with the tree's. In the end, however, Tommy realizes, after ""finishing"" the book, that death cannot be avoided and should not be feared- something Izzy told him earlier. His acceptance of this is illustrated in the very last scene when he ""exits his bubble"" and becomes part of space. In the present timeline, he finally says goodbye to Izzy, planting a seed on her grave, renewing life. <br/><br/>This movie was absolutely mind blowing and hopefully more people will experience this masterpiece in the future."
"grhill__","8","5","9","20 May 2007"," An incredible movie filled with meaning and wonder! Next?
","I have been anxiously looking forward to this movie from the time it was originally announced approximately five years ago. I was totally engrossed by 'Pi,' and became a certified Aronofsky fan when 'Requim For A Dream' came out on DVD (it never appeared in any local theaters and Lancaster is not exactly a small town. There are about 28-30 screens in Lancaster.). with 'The Fountain' finally being released on DVD I was just hoping that my expectations weren't so high that almost anything was going to be disappointing. I am glad to report that the movie was all I had hoped for and then some. As I write this I find myself still sifting through various parts of the movie in my mind and plan on watching it a second time tonight, hopefully being able to clear up a few things that I'm still a bit unsure of.<br/><br/>What really amazes me however is the group of people who try to rip it down as nothing more than ""mind candy."" If you don't like the movie that is okay, but I do have a problem with people who insist that it is junk and that nobody should enjoy it. The suggestions that Aronofsky was trying to make a movie that was mind bending to the point of being nonsensical is absolute rubbish. I think Aronofsky made a movie with a great deal of thought in regard to very big and complex themes. My own very quick interpretation of this great film goes likes this. I believe that the parts that took place in the 1500's are not real but come from Izzi's unfinished book, and since Izzi wrote it, the parts of Tomas and the Queen are based on Tom and Izzi of the present. When she show's Tom the Nebula and the story of the death of a star and the rebirth, she is at that point telling Tom, without telling Tom, how to finish the book. And she is also telling Tom that she is now unafraid of death because she is confident that life is truly eternal. She even tells Tom that she will always be with him, but that it is up to Tom to be able to come to that understanding on his own. The part that takes place in the future is Aronofsky's way of telling this to the viewer. Whether the portion of the film that takes place in the future is real or imagined is up to the viewer. Either way it still delivers the same message. At it's very depth I believe Aronofsky's tale is one that every human wrestles with. Death! Is death final, or does the soul/spirit continue to exist. I believe that is the overriding theme of the film and it is up to each individual to interpret it as they see fit.<br/><br/>The metaphors in the movie are many and far reaching. The role of the inquisitor. The meaning of the ring. The tree of life itself and how it is used in the future to sustain him and in the present as a potential cure. The hairs that are raised when he reaches his fingers out towards the tree itself and the hairs on Izzi's neck. The movie is almost intoxicating in it's own way.<br/><br/>My question for fans of the movie is this. Other than what is all ready scheduled what book or author would you most like to see Aronofsky take on in the future. I would love to see him work with fellow Brooklynite, author Paul Auster. Some of Don Delilo's early work would translate well to the screen with the right director(guess who I have in mind). I think his visual interpretation of anything by Albert Camus would be well worth the effort. For a dark comic twist I would enjoy seeing him work with a Thomas Berger novel. Thomas Pynchon and Aronofsky would be interesting. In the end his ideas are so original he probably doesn't need the help, but I still find it interesting to contemplate. An Aynn Rand book could be interesting (although as I grow older I find Rand to be less and less relevant). One last idea would what he would do with Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's great book 'One Hundred Years of Solitude.' This has run on far too much all ready, but I would really like to hear what you would like to see him do in the future? Thanks."
"zlove-1","9","5","9","21 February 2007"," A movie to be felt
","Most people I know would HATE this movie, and I that's understandable. (Classic comment at the end of it from a fellow film-goer: 'What the f*ck did the dude in the ball have to do with it?') It is slow paced, arty, self-indulgent, and if watched with a mind for plot and coherency, ultimately frustrating. It is a hard and demanding film, and I don't think it can be enjoyed in any sort of normal conscious terms. As the filmmaker has stated, Requiem for a Dream this is not. I don't think its a film to be necessarily understood, just experienced. It plays like a dream, repeating motifs and themes in vastly different contexts, connecting them by way of suggestion and symbols rather than an ordered narrative. It is, above all else, a movie about accepting death, that death is part of the key to eternal life, and therefore a mystery and a paradox which we cannot understand by applying conscious human tools of perception. And this is why people will hate this movie. Its answer, its heart, is impenetrable by the conscious mind. Walking out is like waking from a dream, or coming down from an hour and a half nitrous oxide high where something in you knows you have seen a truth, there is a feeling of some kind of vague understanding, but you could not express it in the words we have to use. It is the same way one might feel after meditating on the meaning of life - you reach a point where you have to accept the mystery of it all. And that is frustrating. Unless you can just accept it. To just let the images, the hints, the paradoxes, go into you and to feel them. I know why people compare this to 2001 - I certainly couldn't say what 2001 is about - but I damn sure have a feeling. Its like my stomach knows something my brain doesn't. People hate that feeling. An extremely ambitious film which so nearly fails so often, but I applaud the filmmakers for having the guts to do it."
"DICK STEEL","10","5","9","21 February 2007"," A Nutshell Review: The Fountain
","After watching Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain, I realize why some booed and walked out during its screening last year in the Venice Film Festival. This is one movie which you'll either hate to the core, or simply love. No in-betweens because it doesn't allow you to, with its storyline totally, and I mean totally, open to an individual's interpretation, which makes it truly unique. I suspect if I were to watch it again, and multiple times even, each experience will be different, as you draw upon and focus inevitably on different aspects of the plot. Such is how diverse and layered The Fountain is.<br/><br/>For those enticed into this movie by its trailers, let me say that this is one which the editing of the snippets make it look so accessible, you'd think you know the plot. The fact is, you'll probably be shell shocked within the first 15 minutes, akin to drowning and desperately gasping for any pocket of air that will help keep you alive, just for a little while more. And my advice is to stick to it, grit your teeth, bear with it, as slowly, bit by bit, with more details revealed, you'd start to see some semblance of the plot, though still stuck with the difficulty of assembling all the pieces into their rightful place.<br/><br/>This is a story about love, loss, spirituality, myth, science fiction, fantasy, all rolled into one. It contains fantastical elements for the most parts, which you'll have to take them for what you will. And you have to salute Aronofsky's storytelling craft, for wielding together chunks of seemingly disparate plot elements and dialogue to tie in so intricately to one another, becoming a mirror to its talk about the circle of life. Almost every spoken line of dialogue becomes a visual element, every action measured and not wasted, and when seen as a whole with that helicopter hindsight, just masterfully done. The music by Clint Mansell is extremely seductive, probably one of the best I've heard in recent times, complimenting the visuals perfectly, eliciting every mood out of you on cue, becoming that directional signboard to follow even when the environment around you becomes confusing. If there is a gripe, then it should fall on the close-ups and fast cuts during night action pieces, like what Batman Begins had.<br/><br/>The next paragraph contains extremely mild spoilers, so skip it if you don't want to know, in my opinion, how you should anchor yourself to gain some bearings.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays, amongst others, Dr Tom Creo, a man obsessed with seeking out a cure for his wife, Izzi Creo's (Rachel Weisz) cancer. He knows that time is running out, and you feel his pain of wanting to be by her side as she spends her last days, versus spending more time devoting himself to his research, for that breakthrough he needs that can heal Izzi. That basically sums up the central story from which to base whatever happens outside this narrative structure, where, depending on how you look at it, will give you totally different interpretations.<br/><br/>The following is my take, which contains MAJOR spoilers, and you should read it only if you've watched the movie. Otherwise, skip the next two paragraphs. <br/><br/>SPOILER STARTS What happened in medieval Spain, I would believe, is Izzi's written story, and it makes a heartfelt one. Like the Queen, she believes in her knight, sending him on an errand to the Mayan land, vis a vis Dr Tom's quest for a cure, to allow them to live together, forever. She stands firm in adversary, ever optimistic, and in total trust of her man. It ended the way it did, because it became Tom's story, entrusted by his wife to complete the book, to write the final chapter, because in truth, the outcome will depend on how his research/quest will turn out to be. And with that slightest of hope (the little rubbing of the sap from the Tree of Life on his wound), it developed to a possible full fledged cure, but alas all is lost, too much too late, and he lost his will to live - what use is the solution, when the problem no longer exist?<br/><br/>But he has the other side of the equation to choose from - instead of giving up on himself, to continue with his efforts so that others might live. This follows the futuristic tale (of what could happen in future), of travelling into the nebula together, of the Mayan belief of rebirth and new life, of the sacrifices one makes, so that others will benefit from the fruits of your labour. The end is presented in an amalgam, of the choices presented in itself, and the difficulties in making that sole decision, and the exploration, and probable existential feeling, that perhaps both can co-exist together. That Dr Tom Creo chose both to grieve his personal pain and loss, but yet to seek strength from that grieve, to continue, symbolized by his planting of the seed atop his wife's grave, as in the Mayan story of a new life. SPOILER ENDS<br/><br/>All I can say is, go to The Fountain with a very open mind. Like a sponge, absorb the proceedings, groove to the soundtrack, listen intently to every whisper, gaze intensely at the visuals. Feel, people, don't analyze during, do it after. It's gonna be extremely rewarding, and a very memorable, trippy ride."
"neo_100_","10","5","9","29 November 2006"," A Critique of The Fountain
","WARNING: Interpretations of the film = SPOILERS!<br/><br/>As a work of pure individual vision, Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain is the epitome of ambitious conviction. The film is a meditation on our susceptibility to humanistic inclinations pertaining to the preservation of life and the sustenance of youth. Figurative juxtaposition, as conceived through three non-discrete time periods, punctuate persistent symbolism, as presented through a central image; the tree of life. The story is of Man's requisite to defeat mortality. Love is the connective fiber that binds past, present, and future monologues together to ultimately form a harmonious expression. <br/><br/>The Fountain is superb philosophy decisively because of its posing questions concerning our perception of reality, the communication of learned gestures impulsive to stimulus, and the nature of human existence. Actor Hugh Jackman delivers his performance with a raw intensity rarely demonstrated through the film medium. He assumes the roles of a 16th Century conquistador stalking the fountain of youth on behalf of the Spanish queen, a 21st Century research scientist flustering in heated anguish in a race against his wife's cancer, and an astronaut in a transcendent voyage to a nebula wrapped around a dying star. <br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky masterfully overlaps symbols throughout the duration of the picture in relation to the fountain of youth. The unbroken circles represented in several variations symbolize perfect natural design, and flirts with the concept of reincarnation. In critiquing the inevitability of death, the protagonist's conclusive encounter with eternity abandons the literal for the metaphoric. The future monologue transcends the metaphysical as the visual representation of the principal character's final destination in conformity to the laws of the circle of life. <br/><br/>There are immaculate moments of sublimity that leave you with a feeling of inscrutable well-being. A tangible sense of love transcends beyond the living that surpasses our ability to completely articulate. Love is the quagmire impeding our progress towards revolving full circle. It's Man's thirst for knowledge leading to the denial of our right to literal immortality that is ultimately the most fascinating. The Fountain neither makes an attempt to solve the intellectual mysteries of life, nor devolves into the conventions characteristic of an exploitive genre piece. <br/><br/>The Fountain is an emotionally devastating survey of loss and grief that takes you inside the mind of its protagonist, and it's the definitive example of where cinema should be taken more often."

","This movie was spectacular. Plain and simple.<br/><br/>The only downside was the end when some guy in his late-40s stood up and said to the whole audience, ""Did anyone else get that movie?"" And sadly, the audience (for the most part) laughed and agreed.<br/><br/>What does that tell me? About 85% of the population are either not trying very hard or are just completely stupid. I could not believe it. This movie is remarkable and honestly, not very hard to understand.<br/><br/>Once again, Aronofsky made an impact that left me feeling something special even once I left the theatre. He did this with Requiem for a Dream but this time it left me with the opposite feeling. Wonderful."

","Another of those films that hopes do dazzle the audience with a plot so convoluted and nonsensical that it hopes to embarrass the audience into thinking ""I can't understand it so it must be a masterpiece"". The film has impressive imagery and a memorable score by the Kronos Quartet but outside that it has to be one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. Ask people to explain it and they are at a loss to even describe the meaning or intent of the film so they use grandiose and irrelevant statements as convoluted as the film itself.

"mildew01","1","9","20","25 November 2006"," Whatever happened to character, story, and pacing?
","I have never in my life been so disappointed in a movie. This was a 96 minute set piece for beautifully constructed images that contrast with the tight closeups of people whispering through tears as they lament, with no emotion, about life, eternity and love. Love? I'm sorry, but there is no reason for me to believe that these two even belong together. He's a jerk with his own agenda, she wants him to finish her awful book about a Conquistador who has to fight for a Queen (Jackman and Weisz play triple roles, sort of) in the most sleep-inducing segments of the movie. I find it very hard to believe that this was a movie 6 years in the making. When i saw Requiem For a Dream, the detached emotion of the dialogue added to the intensity of the story. Maybe people don't really talk that way, but it all fit together to make you feel almost crazy - the music, the crazy pacing and unbelievable cinematography - it really took you on a ride. But I felt like a large part of Requiem was grounded in reality, if a heightened vision of it. The Fountain has minor characters that speak as if they've just been given their lines, struggling to remember, without giving any depth of emotion to the dialogue. It has a story that is so pretentious, it had me laughing when everyone in the audience was holding their breath. The worst part is that people are falling for it. I've never in my life wanted so badly to walk out of a movie - I've never, ever been so disinterested in a movie, like I was with the Fountain. I wish someone had warned me - do something else with your time, please. I feel so cheated - it's going to be a while before I see a movie in theatres again."
"sc8031","3","6","12","6 July 2008"," Aronofsky is such a funny guy
","I'll give this two stars for the beautiful set and the fact that there was actual effort involved, and one star for the fact that it is unique in presentation. However, this is one of the most unwatchable things I've ever seen.<br/><br/>""Daronofsky"" has a pretty poor track record at this point. His first flick, ""Pi"", seemed watchable when I was a young, easily influenced, angsty teenager. Looking back on it today, even that film does not hold up so well, as Aronofsky movies parade style over substance while being totally oblivious to the fact. <br/><br/>The next flick he did, ""Requiem For a Dream"" (featuring Jennifer Connelly, yowza!) was the most glorified, pretentious movie about drug addiction put to film. I always knew drugs were bad (eh heh heh...) but I never knew they could be so stylish! His film editing in his first two films is like MTV-meets-Tarantino except without the ""Gilmore Girls""-on-steroids writing found in the latter. On the surface, his movies appear to be about profound things (Kabbalistic math, drug addiction, death and spirituality, Jennifer Connelly) but then you realize that he has nothing to say on these subjects. He just keeps flashing subject-related images with minimal, cryptic dialog and melancholic or ominous music. What sorcery! <br/><br/>Which brings us to ""The Fountain"" a film purportedly abandoned by production companies and so forth because they thought it was too risky. I think their assessment was still rather generous. I think it's just plain bad. Here, for the third time, Aronofsky has proved himself to be an exclusively aesthetic director. <br/><br/>It's strange -- Aronofsky doesn't seem to understand that people have covered the same tragic/epic themes in better movies that also contained developed plots and characters. Someone here argued that the main characters are archetypes of the human experience. Whatever. I would say the same thing about the characters in Takashi Miike's ""Izo"" (also unwatchable but much more complete in its grasp) or ""Children of Paradise"", a film in which the characters manage to be simultaneously ridiculous, endearing and exaggerated and yet totally human. Children of Paradise is a masterful meditation on love and, unlike this one, has a sense of HUMOR. Considering the lack of jokes in his movies, I am convinced that Aronofsky is not only unprofound, but also a spiritual STATUE.<br/><br/>An example of the ridiculous pomp in this film: for some reason, Hugh Jackman randomly does Yoga and Taijiquan (Tai Chi) for brief segments. What relevance does this have to the grand human experience? Seriously, what of it? This is only relevant to people (like Aronofsky) who don't actually know anything about Yoga or Tai Chi. People who actually practice these things wouldn't advertise them as the pinnacle of human achievement in a movie about love.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" wants to be profound so very badly and yet just reeks of New Age yuppie pretense. You can critique anything and commend its artistic credibility and symbolism because: hind-sight is always 20-20! If you really thought this was deep, you just might be a New-Age yuppie. It's basically up there with ""Mindwalk"", ""What the &($% Do We Know?"" and any of the aforementioned films Aronofsky has done.<br/><br/>Proof that Aronofsky is no great writing/directing talent? He has no sense of humor. He should direct other scripts and stories. Then he might have something."
"BookBuffBob","Null","6","12","1 June 2007"," Enlightenment
","In ""Pi"" Aronofsky dealt with the subject of the mathematics of the universe, and he touched on the theory that a higher understanding of this math reveals God, and in turn reveals everything about God's creations. The idea was based in part on the Judeo-Christian philosophies and religion, more specifically in the patterns of the Torah and Hebrew language.<br/><br/>In ""The Fountain"", Aronofsky actually deals with very similar subjects, such as those of the creation of the world, and reaching a higher level of enlightenment. In this film, instead, the ideas and concepts are rooted in eastern religion and philosophy. In fact, having a familiarity with eastern religions would go a long way in understanding this film. An open mind would help a lot too.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a straight forward film with a traditionally defined chronology, or a film that can be easily understood without much thought, this film isn't the one. (I don't say that out of pretentiousness. Sometimes you just want simple entertainment. My statement was not a judgement.) But, if you are looking for a film to ponder and discuss, or if you have interest in eastern philosophy or in the theories of the Mayan's higher level of enlightenment, this film is a lovely interpretation of some of those ideas.<br/><br/>I've read some of the theories about this film on this site. In order to understand this film we can't try and follow a character as much as we must follow energy and life force ... or parts thereof. We also have to let go of our understanding of time and realize that past and future aren't necessarily exclusive if the meaning of time is changed or if the time line is no less easily maneuvered than a roadway. We must also realize that the film is just based on a philosophy, a metaphysical theory, even if it's a powerful one. A concrete understanding of the philosophy (for lack of a better word) can only come with a higher level of enlightenment, if that exists for us in this world. The Fountain is just a very good effort in bringing the ideas to film.<br/><br/>Film, of course, is limited to stimulating our senses of sight and hearing. The film touches on ideas that are to be understood with higher levels of senses. I think that Aronofsky did as well a job as could be done to help us visually follow something that is not visual. He's definitely a bright, knowledgeable and open minded filmmaker."

","Overbearingly ambitious metaphysical yarn was one of those projects passed around and restructured around different actors a few times and unfortunately, it shows. Darren Aronofsky's long awaited follow up to his break-thru smash Requiem for a Dream may have noble intentions but has second rate written all over. In his undercooked and convoluted script, Aronofsky will proceed to beat viewers over the head with themes on death and rebirth in so many ways. Three different scenarios, all centering around the underdeveloped love story, weave within one another in a way I'm sure will remain appealing to the young demographic it will reluctantly take on, but feels embarrassingly trite for the demographic thought to be in mind.<br/><br/>Let's start with The Fountain's appropriation of a much stressed spiritual context. In what was supposed to feel like allegory for the soul's evolution instead is butchered into three convoluted narratives which do little to exemplify the material at hand. For the most part, scenes in The Fountain have the unfortunate air of a thrift-store film, one can absolutely sense a middle-ground compromise that tarnishes any authenticity the film had going for itself.<br/><br/>All of Aronofsky's cinematic trickery (and even a few sublimely framed shots) cannot rescue The Fountain from drying up. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz aren't the worst overpaid actors around, though what they bring to this vision stays superficially deep. Unable to master dynamics needed to lend the epic pull this movie posits, Jackman and especially Weisz turn in disappointingly unimportant, selfish performances. It all adds up to little more then a time traveling soap opera with some shiny eye candy thrown in. Viewers may enjoy piecing fragments together in order to gaze upon a naive vision in all it's splendor, but most wiser enough to feel a stinging pandering to ones sense of soul will achieve little resonant redemption for following this through. It's heart may completely be in the right place, and for that we will still hold hope for Mr. Aronfsky in future endeavors, but unfortunately I must declare the film an undeniable failure in any greatness it seeks."

","Despite some excellent acting performances from the lead caste and some imaginative special effects this movie cannot escape its flawed confused and occasionally disgusting philosophical message. The pace of the film varies from slow to a full stop. The director, who also wrote the script, provides a jigsaw puzzle of pieces that he is irritatingly slow to develop into a meaningful narrative. Once we discover the central thesis we find that it is a celebration of the spiritually fulfilling nature of death. The scientist lead is portrayed as emotional and self-indulgent in his desire to come up with a cure for a fatal disease. His potential for success in developing a life saving remedy is portrayed as a foolish failure to understand the spiritual significance of a fulfilling death. This film was surprisingly antilife and truly dreadful. Its most satisfying feature was the fact that we shared the theatre with only two other couples. Clealry word has gotten out. I was severely disappointed with the IMDb rating which persuaded me to part with money for this offensive rubbish. One to avoid."

","Okay all of you sci-fi geeks out there. It's time to drag your spouse, girlfriend, or significant other out again. They'll hem and haw about going to see ""yet another"" science fiction film with you, but this time redemption is at your feet.<br/><br/>THE FOUNTAIN is, for all intents and purposes, a love story built around an SF theme: immortality and the future. But there aren't any magical conjurers or any time machines. The story is all too human, spanning eons as we witness the immortality of ...love. It may sound a bit offish to some SF fans, but don't let it be. There are still amazing scenes shot using bizarre methods (micro-photography of petri dishes?) instead of the usual CGI, a remarkable coherency between the vast time scales, and some damn fine acting.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman (X-Men) stars as Tomas, a man in love with his queen (during the Spanish Inquisition), his terminally ill wife (present day), and the symbol of his wife's immortality (in the distant future). Tomas' queen/wife/symbol is none other than the amazing Rachel Weisz (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) known throughout the film as Izzi. Tomas, in the earliest time of the Spanish Inquisition, is trying to save his beloved queen by finding the tree of life (something hinted at in many religions, including Christianity where Adam and Eve eat from the tree of knowledge causing God to yank away the tree of life and hide it).<br/><br/>We then jump to present day and find Doctor Tomas desperately searching for a cancer cure in order to save his wife, Izzi. Again, the tree of life plays a part as he and his research team uncover a strange piece of bark from a long forgotten tree. It's healing properties are astounding, but will the cure come in time to save Izzi? The most distant time is that of Tomas on an existential journey through space with a tree as his only companion. Again, the tree of life, but this time the tree is appropriately a symbol of his wife.<br/><br/>Weaving the conquistador past, with present day medicine, and an uncertain future, director Darren Aronofsky has really given us a piece of poetry as art. This isn't too surprising coming from Aronofsky, the same director of such mind-benders as PI and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Don't expect a formulaic plot or for things to be spelled out. You know better than that if you've seen any of this director's work. But that's part of the big draw. You move along with the story rather than being forcibly dragged through it. It flows on its own ethereal plain, never stopping, never letting the viewers' eyes rest. Each scene is shot to near perfection, using dark sets, lighted doorways, and golden globes to exquisite advantage.<br/><br/>But it's the love story between Izzi and Tomas that holds the entire movie together. Their dedication to one another is palpable, and when Izzi sits near death's doorstep, you can feel Tomas' overwhelming need to save her, his beloved for all time.<br/><br/>So it's time to haul your spouse/girlfriend/significant other kicking and screaming into the theater again. And they'll love you for it later. Perhaps you might even ""get lucky"" after the film..."

It encompasses many themes and includes a number of recurring symbols and concepts. Note that one who does not follow these will not make the connections necessary to understand the plot. Kudos to Aronofsky's genius.<br/><br/>Aside from the film making aspects, The Fountain is a very emotional movie. At several points in the film the audience is struck hard with grief. Many cry at a multitude of points (at the end, I hear a few crying in the theater). The will of the movie to convey emotion is very impressive, and relentless. Those who have experienced Requiem for a Dream and/or Pi will find it much less intense, as a welcome relief, but much more crushing.<br/><br/>The Fountain, all in all, is a wonderful film to watch.

","Some of the most beautiful imagery is brought together with an endearing story, that sums up the epitome of an ideally inspirational love tale. Written and Directed by the masterful Harvard graduate, Darren Aronofsky, The Fountain spans across three different time periods, with reoccurring theme of love and eternal life. This blossoming film becomes more and more entrancing as it continues to go back and forth between the three lover's, doomed to meet the same fate by the end of the film. Hugh Jackman plays all three male protagonists, while the ever-so gentle Rachel Weisz plays all three of the lovers. The third story, which takes place in the future, is the more complicated, and what will no undoubtedly drive most cinema goers away from this masterpiece. Set in the future, of which time we are not privy to, the third segment takes place in space and takes us along for a journey to a dying nebula. After many problems behind the scenes of this film, Aronofsky finally completed The Fountain and this futuristic segment without the help of modern computer graphics. Able to withstand the test of time, The Fountain will definitely achieve a larger following when released to digital video.<br/><br/>Accompanying Aronofsky in this endeavor comes long standing friend and musician Clint Mansell, who decided to work with the brilliantly epic Scottish band Mogwai, on this progressively haunting theme. Although the film has a short running time, of only 96 minutes, Aronofsky and his crew live up to their last two films. The Fountain is nothing like his last two movies, which used hip-hop sounds and fast-cut editing in a music video style. In this epic, Aronofsky uses more traditional style camera work, and allot of overhead shots, simulating satellite photography up-close. Unfortunately, The Fountains release will most likely go unnoticed whilst in theaters proving once again that Hollywood's better films usually tread far under the radar, until Oscar season."

","Summarizing this movie from a plot perspective is almost pointless, though I'll attempt it, anyway. The Fountain spans one thousand years to capture the portrait of a man and his woman's quest towards immortality. While the woman, representative of the female energy of the universe, nurturing and open, is receptive and aware of the film's ultimate ending, the man, representative of logic and rationalism, must overcome his own intellectual ferocity in order to attain his destiny. The film is littered with geometric symbols that reflect the movie's thematic iconography; for instance, the Tree of Life--as described in the bible--represents divine order and purpose throughout the Fountain. However, what the average film-goer will miss in watching the movie is the geometric visuals that are actual representations of the Egyptian Flower of Life and the mathematical Phi-Ratio as represented in the nautical shell. There are also an overwhelming abundance of mandala-like entrances into rooms, artwork, and set design, which aid the viewer into looking toward the infinite. With an explosive soundtrack providing the final touch of ambiance, this might be my favorite movie ever made."

This is not a quickie get-in, get-out, eye-candy popcorn movie, which I actually rather expected. It's a deliberate, multi-layered, methodical masterpiece. It's somewhat inaccessible because it's visionary and unlike any sf movie we expect today. I predict that it will have a slow theatrical run and will probably disappoint at the box office. Over the next few years, it will slowly grow as a cult film. Then 10 years from now, it will experience a resurgence of interest, eventually claiming its place in the pantheon of classics. It will be under-appreciated in its time but will become surprisingly influential. Years from now, a much savvier generation will look back and wonder why the audience of 2006 neglected it in favor of Happy Feet and James Bond. That's the kind of movie this is.

","I went to see Darren Aronofsky's new film ""The Fountain"" the day before Thanksgiving. Knowing and seeing Aronofsky's two previous films, ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream,"" I knew I was going to be intrigued and blown away again. It was in instinct that I had learned while watching his amazing films. From ""Pi's"" mysticism and kabbalah-stock market-mathematics-nature thriller vibe going throughout, and in ""Requiem's"" addiction-over-reality's grim tale of four interconnected people fighting the fight over the enemy known as addiction, I knew ""The Fountain"" was going to be Aronofsky's greatest hit to date. It took six years in the making, and has gone through several lead cast changes, from brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett to B-movie stars Hugh Jackman and Rachael Weisz, but Aronofsky finally finished it.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" is a low-budgeted sci-fi romance movie that spans over thousands of years. Starting from 1500 A.D., we start to view the story of a Spanish conquistador named Tomas (Hugh Jackman) who is sent by Queen Isabel (Rachael Weisz) to find the eternal tree of life. Cut to present-day 2000 A.D. Tommy Creo (Jackman, again), a modern-day scientist, and his wife Izzi (Weisz, again), a writer, try to save their relationship as man and wife. She is writing an epic story about the Mayans and Xibalba, a dying nebula in space that is suppose to be a symbol of death reborn, is most likely a metaphor for what her relationship with Tommy is like. Tommy quickly realizes that Izzi is beginning to show odd signs of cancer, through Izzi's loss of sensitivity to hot and cold and a seizure she suffers while browsing through a museum. While Izzi is on bed rest at the hospital, she realizes that she won't be ale to finish the book herself, so she asks Tommy to help her ""finish it."" Tommy agrees.<br/><br/>Using a special concoction (that is suppose to heal the cancer and make the person live forever) made by him and his medical research team at the research station (which he ultimately also used on a test monkey named Donovan), he thought he could cure Izzi forever. Unfortunately, Izzi dies before Tommy could get the cure to her. Cut to 2500 A.D. Tommy is now Tom Creo, an astronaut traveling through space in a special transparent sphere-like space ship with a tree in the middle (it resembles much like an ecosphere). The tree itself is the future Izzi. Through a series of story cuts and flashbacks to each time period, the movie itself unfolds and spits out pieces to the epic puzzle. And I cannot leave out the special effects  the effects were absolutely amazing in this film, considering Aronofsky used no computer generated images (CGI)  but micro-photography inside Petri dishes instead.<br/><br/>Eventually we see how Tommy finishes the story, if Tomas finds the tree of life, and if Tom can get Izzi to get ""reborn."" This is the thing about ""The Fountain"": If you are not the type of person who likes to ponder and try to solve the puzzling story (using logic) of the movie, you will not enjoy this movie. ""The Fountain"" is an epic love story that uses a great amount of logic in order for you to enjoy this movie. Most of the ending is up to you to decide what happened.<br/><br/>I give much kudos to Aronofsky for making a gutsy movie as such ""The Fountain."" Leaving the film in development hell for five years and writing a graphic novel from the original screenplay Darren had wrote (with co-writer Ari Handel) made it seem like the movie was dead. But that all changed when the graphic novel artist Kent Williams wowed Warner Bros. Pictures to revive the film. The movie is very much ahead of its time. A lot of people will downright hate it. A lot of people will regard the movie as an instant cult classic that should never be ignored. But one thing's for sure: ""The Fountain"" will be loathed from years to come. As Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was to the 1900's, ""The Fountain"" will very much shape the future of the 2000's. I guarantee it."

","I can understand why a large number of people would not like this movie. This movie is not escapism, which turns many people away. There is nothing wrong with escapism: after working or studying all week many people just want rest their brain for 2 hours on the weekend, and escape from seriousness. This film takes itself seriously, but because it isn't merely a character drama or a political film, people find it pretentious. Finally, the movie is filled with religious, philosophical, and holistic symbolism, which may come off as silly to some. If you think those points I mentioned would not detract you from seeing this film, then keep reading. This IS one of the better Science Fiction films since ""2001"", mainly because it thinks beyond telling a simple hero story with gadgets. While it does have a bit of neuroscience and astronomy laced in there, the themes are more about philosophy's biggest questions, and it does not ask them in a simple or patronizing way. The acting is also very powerful from both leads, the visual effects are gorgeous, and the music is great. I also don't think those who call it a jumbled mess are giving it a valid critique: like Kubrick, Aronofsky uses an unconventional narrative structure to give the themes more coherence than the story, and does this with skillful technique much like ""2001"" or ""Eyes Wide Shut"". I have never seen ""Pi"" or ""Requiem for a Dream"", so I really can't compare it to his previous works.

","I agree with another reviewer that this is unlike any film I have ever seen before. It is beautifully crafted, acted with award-winning performances, and is visually stunning in many scenes. The scenes are tied together with creative transitions that move us between various time periods, as if we were weaving in and out of traffic on a busy highway. ""The Fountain"" is a masterpiece--one I intend to own once it's available, and I am not a movie purchaser. I look forward to future viewings in order to appreciate all the nuances I could not take in from my first viewing. ""The Fountain"" is a keeper, a film to cherish, a reminder of what and who we are. This movie literally moved my heart, and I offer it a long, low bow of respect."
"pleramorphyllactic","9","6","12","24 November 2006"," Supersaturated Hyperrealism
","The popular media reviews could not have been more wrong on this movie. This one is a gem. It reminded me first of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, except here, Aronofsky seems to have dedicated himself to some supersaturated form of hyper-realism. The entire conceptual draw of time in this movie forms a sort of multilinear canopy over some strange scaldic fluid. It's amazing how seamlessly this occurs. The past, the future, the present, all possess a strong sense of dislocation from the ordinary; which is to say, ""which present could this possibly be?"" It feels as though you're floating through the abstract debris of a consciousness unfolding about itself, only to find that its location spans four dimensions.<br/><br/>The heart of the film is a mediation on death, love, time, and the relationship of these phenomena to genesis and life. A wholly apropos treatment, in a day and age when the biological sciences name immortality as the ""magic bullet"" that they so desperately are seeking. Aronofsky appeals to these sensibilities on enormously subtle and yet deeply profound levels. He seems to want to raise the question, what is life? Does it have meaning without death? And perhaps most importantly, is this endless struggle for immortality really nothing but an almost adolescent misunderstanding of the very nature and meaning of life, to begin with?"
"Hybrination","10","6","12","24 November 2006"," What film-making should be striving for...
","The Fountain has been a movie many, including myself, have been greatly anticipating and hyping for the past 3 years. Both of Darren Aronofsky's previous films have been indicative of real talent. With Pi showing a nack for thought provoking subject matter, and depending on the viewer, a profound or pretentious nature... I found it profound. Requiem for a Dream proved he could pull of a very compositionally, and stylistically sound film, and also really get our guts churning. The story was fairly simplistic(which isn't exactly a fault in itself), but the characters, cinematography, and acting really made up for this in spades. Therein lies the buildup for his newest film. Being a proved talent with two great features under his belt, he announced his biggest project yet, ""The Fountain."" My personal reaction to first reading the synopsis three years ago on IMDb were both of excitement and of reservation, was he being too ambitious? Finally, after 3 years in the making, and much trouble production side, the movie is finished... does it succeed? My answer is a resounding... YES! I am of the personal opinion that 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest films ever made. Its heavy reliance on visual storytelling, and sheer ability to spark the imagination captured me through repeated viewings. In much the same way, The Fountain has captured me. I have only seen it once, so this review may reflect a very sudden, and rash view on it, but a day after the fact my mind is still mulling over the movie's subtleties.<br/><br/>When first starting out, the movie didn't exactly woo me right away... The Conquistador portions leading into a space exploration portion. The Zen Buddhist imagery was interesting, but came off kind of cheesy at first. I kept watching... I allowed it to unfurl before my eyes, and was left with a most satisfying conclusion. Yes, this movie requires one to think, yes this movie isn't straightforward... But it isn't pretentious. I have read in other places that this movie requires one to look into themselves to make sense of it all, and I agree. I connected fully. Now, I will take into account that not everyone will, and while saddened at the idea, I accept this. So, much in the vein of 2001: A Space Odyssey, this movie comes along and captures the imagination, and the mind, and unlike 2001, it also captures the heart. Both Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman put in wonderful, and emotionally charged performances. Also arguably unlike 2001's ""trip-out"" scene, I felt that The Fountain had more easily understandable visual imagery, and those who are detracting it for being nonsense, are really missing the point. I urge everyone to see it, but they should know before going in that it may not be for them.<br/><br/>Also, even afterward the Zen Buddhist imagery was kind of cheesy, but it served a purpose which made much more sense later on."
"superduperspit","10","6","12","24 November 2006"," A miraculous film achievement, a story so beautiful it must be seen to be believed
","""Our bodies are prisons, for our souls. All flesh decays... death turns all to ash. And thus, death frees every soul..."" <br/><br/>The Fountain is the closest I will get to having a religious experience in a movie theater this year. It is a miraculous film achievement, a testament to the hard work and dedication that Director Darren Aronofsky has poured into his passionate project over the last several years. His wife, a beautiful Rachel Weisz, stars with Hugh Jackman in a love story that transcends time, space, and body. Three different tales taking place over one thousand years intertwine into a story so bold and so beautiful, it must be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>In the first of the stories, Jackman is Spanish Conquistador Tomas, a warrior in 1500 A.D. who travels to the Mayan ruins in search of the sap from the Tree of Life, in order to live forever with Queen Isabel (Weisz), whom he is in love with. In the second story, which takes place in the present, he is Tommy, a surgeon who may have stumbled on the key to immortality by accident, when the rosin used in a surgery on an ape brings unforeseen result: complete healing. He must race to find the cure to his wife Izzy's sickness, which is claiming her life quickly. The third is the oddest, and the most brilliant. It takes place in an orb of sorts, which is traveling through the universe. In it, Jackman is Tom Creo, a mix of both of the last two incarnations and a new man. He is alone, except for a tree, perhaps The Tree, which we are lead to assume is the re-incarnated Izzy/Isabel.<br/><br/>What is The Fountain about? I've been trying to figure that out ever since I left the theater a few hours ago. I think above all, it is a look at how beautiful an undying love is. It is no coincidence that Aronofsky shoots Weisz as if she is a goddess; she is his wife, and she is beautiful. Jackman's performance is passionate and emotional, which complements the calmness of Weisz's. Izzy knows that she is going to die, but she is not afraid. It is tragic in a way, but blissful in another. It doesn't have a definitive end point because the story unfolds in a completely un-chronological way. When it does conclude, the ending is simultaneously maddening and perfectly fitting with the rest of this visually and thematically orgasmic film.<br/><br/>Review posted by James Chapel on www.boxofficefanatic.com"
"MulhollandRob","10","6","12","24 November 2006"," A lyrical and ethereal meditation on love and death!
","The Fountain<br/><br/>Last night while I was watching ""The Fountain"" a large obnoxious crowd of young college students were laughing during powerful moments of ""The Fountain"", maybe they were to daft or ignorant to appreciate the genius of it, or just possible they went in expecting X-Men 4 or something, after the film ended and the credits were running they were criticizing the film and saying the most immature insults I think I ever heard in a movie theater. It then clicked to me that while that crowd thought they were superior to the film, Darren Aronofsky is already five steps ahead of them.<br/><br/>There are also apologies from film critics indicating that that ""The Fountain"" is too confusing, and complex. What the hell, are we getting to that level now where we have to apologize to audiences because a film isn't straightforward enough? Darren Aronofsky's bold and beautiful film ""The Fountain"", is quite negative on rottentomatoes.com at the moment, I feel as if the audiences have transformed and hi-jacked film critics. It may be non-linear, but it's quite a philosophical, ethereal journey of memory, loss, and regret. <br/><br/>Let's not forget such masterpieces as ""2001: A Space Odessy"", ""Eraserhead"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Peeping Tom"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", and most recently ""The Passion of the Christ"", ""The New World"", were all poorly received by many critics in their release, but are now considered classics. If ""The Fountain"" admirers join together, and the elite critics stay together (Chud.com, Glenn Kenny from Premiere also loved it) and if the film receives a cult following it will reach that status. <br/><br/>It's been six long years since Darren Aronofsky has directed a film, and let me tell you, the wait is worth it. ""The Fountain"" in many aspects is like a sci-fi Terrence Malick film, the lyrical direction, the visual poetry, the inaccessible storytelling is all there. The result is a beautifully heartbreaking, visually sublime, hypnotic meditation of nature, love, and identity. It's a film where you avoid to make sense of it, and just surrender yourself with the rhythm and flow. <br/><br/>More of an experience, then a film; ""The Fountain"" will you leave you speechless from start to finish, and when it's over you'll be perplexed by the experience. Director Aronofsky, in his third film, is by far the most ambitious project of his career. In 1998 Aronofsky made the most explosive film debut since David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"". It was strikingly shot and artfully maddening film debut that put Aronofsky on the map. Aronofsky has always had sci-fi elements throughout his work; ""Pi"" invoked the paranoia of Franz Kafka within high-contrast black and white, within fuzzy framework. ""The Fountain"" like his other films are demanding works of provocation. <br/><br/>Aronofsky's second film was absolutely remarkable; ""Requiem for a Dream"" was an intense, and disturbing film that perfectly captured the horrors of drug-addiction. Aronofsky proved with ""Requeim"" that he was a first-rate filmmaker of intelligent ideas, subjectivity, and style. <br/><br/>Aronosky has done it again, his direction in ""The Fountain"" is nothing short of extraordinary. Like a Terrence Malick film, it transports you in a world of beauty, and despair. More of a film that relies on imagery, and visual storytelling instead of linear narrative, ""The Fountain's"" powerful imagery speaks for itself, Aronofsky philosophizes the process of life, death, existence, nature, reincarnation, and how true love and life can never decay. <br/><br/>Chronicling three centuries spanning from the 16th, the present, and 26th century, in the midst of 500 years separating each story. ""The Fountain"" is essentially a love saga; each story is a repetition of one man's passion, destiny, and love that lies in a tree of immortality. In the present story, Tom (Hugh Jackman) is a scientist in which is wife Isabel (Rachel Weisz) is on the verge of dying from a severe brain tumor. Tom struggles to find a cure out of a monkey that can save her life. Meanwhile in the 16th century a conquistador Tomas (also Jackman) is ordered by the Spanish Queen Isabel to voyage to the New World of South America to search in a Mayan temple that secures the everlasting fountain of youth, which is the tree of life where its later revealed that Isabel is writing a novel titled ""The Tree of Life"". <br/><br/>In the third and most visually stunning story in the future has Tom (Jackman) again as a bald, despondent longing and meditating in a bubble flying through space and cosmos with the decaying tree inside the bubble. Tom is on a voyage to a star named Xibalia where the Mayan's believe is a heavenly, gateway world of rebirth. <br/><br/>The sound of this might sound silly, or absurd, but it's ravishing. The multi-layered, meta narrative is actually balanced with its visual language. The use of camera angles, motifs, zoom/dolly outs, and saturated colors, Aronofsky astonishing direction perfectly creates the melancholy atmosphere. It's a visionary work, that is highly imaginative, lavish, and ambitious. It's going to be an overlooked classic in the making. <br/><br/>Aronosky's ""The Fountain"" has already been compared by a few to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and rightfully so. In both audacity, and ambition, Aronofsky's vision is both cerebral and dazzling in execution. However, Aronofsky is more sincere, where Kubrick was more of a cynic. Overall with its poignant, and sentimental ideas of love and life, ""The Fountain"" is the ultimate fragility of hope. <br/><br/>Rating **** out of ****"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","6","12","23 November 2006"," Living with Grace
","The opening sequences of ""The Fountain"" are disorienting, even having a clue about the movie. In one scene Hugh Jackman is conquistador Tomas battling fierce warriors before a Mayan temple in the service of his Queen Isabel (Rachel Weisz). In the next, Jackman is Tom Creo traveling in a spherical globe to a distant nebula in 2500 A.D. with what looks like the remains of a tree. My clarity comes from having seen the entire movie. Director and Screenwriter Darren Aronofsky is bold and daring in ""The Fountain"". Though flawed, Arononfsky's ""The Fountain"" needs to be acknowledged for its ambition and nobility. ""The Fountain"" is worthy of view and thought as perhaps one of the year's best. Granted the movie is not for everyone. On the surface ""The Fountain"" is about the search for eternal life. As poignantly pleaded by Tommy (Jackman) in the present day, he wishes to ""stop dying (death)"". ""The Fountain"" is a reference to the Fountain of Youth. From Genesis, when Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden after tasting from the Tree of Knowledge, the Tree of Life was forfeited and lost forever. Or perhaps it was not.<br/><br/>I believe that Aronofsky is really interested in coming to terms with one's mortality and making peace with that. In the present story setting Izzy Creo (Weisz) says to Tommy (Jackman) that ""In death there is creation."" Hers is the romantic conceit. With powerful performances from Jackman and Weisz, ""The Fountain"" is about eternal love, without attachment and acceptance of fate. What resonates for me is that in the end ""The Fountain"" ultimately is about one's life being whole and complete. In Aronfsky's and Ari Handel's story ""The Fountain"" is a story within the movie, set in New Spain of 1500 A.D. written by Izzy. The dying Izzy tells her husband Tommy, ""Finish it."" He replies, ""I don't know how it ends."" Izzy has made her peace, but Tommy can't let go. Aronofsky touchingly asks: How does life end? ""The Fountain"" has one of the most bizarre narratives of any movie, at times even vexing. The story spans 1000 years with three interconnected story lines. One is a fable of Tomas's search for the mythical Tree of Life in the New World. In the present day, Tommy (Jackman) is a brilliant and impetuous medical researcher consumed with finding a cure for his dying wife Izzy (Weisz), who suffers from a malignant brain tumor. The cure may lie in a botanical sample from Central America. In the distant future Tom (also Jackman) is on solo trek to the nebula from a Mayan legend on a mission to return the Tree of Life. Aronofsky darts back and forth between all stories at will, culminating in the compelling catharsis. Here I thought he went a little nonlinear and tangential. However, the final resolution is moving and poignant.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is absolutely amazing. Though ""The Fountain"" mandates concentration and effort upon viewing, Jackman's performance is effortless. I don't think anyone else could have pulled off this role. The strikingly handsome and physical Jackman has the charisma to realize the brave conquistador Captain Tomas. As researcher Tommy he is the compassionate and driven husband caring for his ailing wife Izzy. In the future as Tom, a head shaved Jackman embodies a lonely and haunted man full of regret as he looks back upon his life. Jackman is that rare combination of powerful presence and gentle compassion. Rachel Weisz is inspiring as Tommy's eternal love over several lifetimes. Weisz commands a quiet strength and a natural ease. She gives Izzy a tangible nobility. She and Jackman have beautiful chemistry. Their touching love story endures the provocative narrative shifts throughout.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" promises a story about eternal life, and instead delivers a moving and touching story about our mortality. Perhaps, ""The Fountain"" is about living with grace. Darren Aronofsky does not cleanly resolve everything. I guess much like life, we have to kind of work it out for ourselves. Acknowledge Aronofsky and story writer Handel for making a movie dominated by grand ideas. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz give inspiring and resonating performances in this eternal love story. ""The Fountain"" is not the easiest movie to watch, nor is it the most black and white. However, it will make you look upon life. And that is a noble thing."
"rcolgan","9","4","7","1 June 2014"," Monty Pythons Meaning of Life Part 2- The Serious Version
","Aronofsky is one of the most innovative filmmakers in Hollywood today. With each passing film he tries different stories and styles that makes each distinct and memorable. His films won't always be for everyone, but like many great filmmakers he will constantly try new ideas for both his stories narrative and their visual style. Luckily in the case of The Fountain his style flourishes exploring themes of death and immortality. Whilst it did not originally get its money back on release I have no doubt that in time this will go on to be one of his best remembered films. <br/><br/>Largely this is because the way the film is shot has a timeless feel. Just like you can watch something like 2001: A Space Odyssey and feel that it could have been made today, through this films practical effects and unique visuals it feels as though it is unlikely to become outdated over time. Each passing visual is a pleasure to look at with the films vivid use of colour and varying set pieces ensuring each passing shot has something new to interest us and no two shots feeling alike. <br/><br/>This visual style is effective within the film as it follows 3 different narratives, which the shooting style separates through different styles and set pieces to better distinguish the stories that are set across a thousand years. The only thing that does link the stories are the themes of escaping death, the lead actors (Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz) and the similar symbols such as trees symbolising life in all three stories. <br/><br/>All of these stories are done in a similar style to something like Cloud Atlas, in that the plots are mixed with no real sense of narrative with events happening non linearly to better build upon the themes of the story. The first of the time lines sees Jackman travelling to a Mayan temple during the renaissance, attempting to become immortal through the tree of life spoke of within the bible. The second follows him as a doctor in the modern day attempting to find a way of curing his wives tumour using a tree that has been found to reverse the ageing progress. And the third is set in the future where he transcends to the stars as just like the Mayan gods intends to become a seed on which the planets may grow. <br/><br/>In each of these stories Jackman searches for immortality in a different route. Whether he looks for it through journeying through the forest, through science or travelling the stars, Jackman demonstrates the ways in which a person may search for meaning in life. It's a difficult thing maintaining all 3 different roles, but luckily Jackman's perfect for it using an effective emotional and physical change for each story. It's these distinctions that ensure the story works because we can contrast the different pains that Jackman goes through in each story with each one seeming original rather than just a rehash each time. <br/><br/>These different stories can be seen in many ways, with Aronofsky deliberately being vague of its meaning so just like any other great piece of art may be interpreted in many ways. Personally, whilst watching it, I realised that whilst he has been searching for a way of escaping death, he has barely had any time to be with his wife and thus by the end is left with only a few fleeting memories. Furthermore in various scenes we see his attempts at immortality backfire and cause him great pain and suffering, with the entire hour and a half seeing him experience little joy. It thus raises the question of why extend life if it cannot be enjoyed. <br/><br/>But this is just my interpretation of the film.The way the film is done it is very open to interpretation, which is one of the main reasons it is so great. I've only just watched it but I know that I'll be wanting to watch it again soon to see what else I can learn from it, because the film seems to have that much to say that I feel I can gain even more from a second viewing. There's so much in the film that I couldn't possibly explain it all in this short review and would strongly recommend watching it to see what you can get from the film. As long as you're open to the depressing tone of the story, you should be able to enjoy the interesting themes and stunning visuals of this underrated masterpiece."

While she dies daily before his eyes, he loses his own health and sleep experimenting on apes.<br/><br/>Weisz keeps a diary concerning some mythical Fountain of Youth, which Jackman's other characters pursue in other realities. I'm sure that the metaphors of the ""imaginary"" realities are profound, but it will require more than one viewing and probably about ten viewings of the ""Making Of"" reel to untangle those metaphors. The three ""realities"" are linked by the two main protagonists appearing as various characters in those realities; Jackman as a conquistador, Weisz as a Spanish queen, Jackman as a shaved-headed recluse in a space-bubble  wha-?

You have to sit through a lot of dull moments to finally get to some sort of action, and if you're also not in the mood to think deeply about a film after it's over, than don't even bother.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" Takes place in three different time eras, with the same two main characters.

The visuals are stunning, he acting first-rate. The title of the movie, which is the title of Izzy's book, is a reference to the Fountain of Youth, or the biblical Tree of Life.<br/><br/>The core of the story is in present time, Hugh Jackman is Dr. Tom Creo, experimenting with tumors in primates, trying to find a cure for cancer.

Every day he is torn between spending more time with her, and spending time in the laboratory.<br/><br/>Izzy decides to write a book titled ""The Fountain."" Part of the movie is set in 1500 Spain with Izzy as Queen Isabella, the same one that commissioned the 1492 expedition of Columbus, and Tom as conquistador Thomas. It is the acting out of her book.

"L. Lion","6","4","7","15 December 2006"," A story about love void of humanity
","Darren Aronofsky is not what one would call a clone of Tom Shadyac. His films are challenging and intellectual, but not funny. In fact, in three features, I hardly recall a humorous moment in any of them.<br/><br/>That didn't stop Pi and Requiem For A Dream from being excellent films. But something is holding back The Fountain, Aronofksy's ambitious third feature. In brief, it is about a scientist (Hugh Jackman) working on a cure for a brain tumor that is killing his wife (Rachel Weisz). His wife is writing a book called The Fountain, about a conquistador's quest for the Fountain of Youth in a hidden Mayan temple in 16th century Central America. The story in the book is also told using Jackman as the conquistador and Weisz as his obsession, the queen of Spain. At a critical time in his wife's illness Jackman may not only have found a cure for the tumor, but for aging itself, using a compound from a Central American tree. Fast forward to an undetermined time in the future, when a bald Jackman, seemingly the now immortal scientist, is on a space trek with the tree to a star called Xibalba by the Mayans. Xibalba is a golden hued star, its color due to the fact that it is dying and wrapped in a nebula of dust. Xibalba represented to the Mayans the place our souls go when we die. ""How interesting the ancient Mayans should have chosen a dying star to represent the doorway to the afterlife"" Izzy muses to her husband as she approaches death. Why Jackman is going there is not yet clear, and will (presumably) be explained as the stories about the scientist and the conquistador unfold.<br/><br/>The story is not linear, opening with the conquistador's quest, with all three time lines jumping back and forth. Visually the film is beautiful. The golden nebula, and Jackman's isolation with the tree in their spaceship on his lonely journey is especially striking.<br/><br/>I found a couple of elements missing, however. For one, although Weisz performance is fine (and she is not asked to do much other than be beatific and look beautiful) Jackman's character is so obsessed with his cure that almost all of his interactions with other people involve anger, including when Izzy wants to go for a one last walk with him in the snow. Since the bulk of the story is scientist Jackman's quest for a cure, for most of the movie we are watching an obsessed and humorless man barking at others who are trying to help him. This reduces the interest and sympathy for the main character.<br/><br/>Second is the aforementioned lack of humor. Even in 2001's clinical darkness, Kubrick manages to inject humor (in particular Bowman's haggling with HAL after he has been locked out of Discovery, and the Hal's pleading when Bowman gets back on board). In The Fountain everything is so deadly earnest that the humanity drains away. We see Jackman's obsession more than we feel his love. Even in the one scene where he winds up in the bathtub with Izzy, it felt like he was in a hurry to get back to the lab.<br/><br/>The ending is ambiguous. What does Jackman hope to gain by visiting Xibalba? Why must the tree go? Is the tree the representation of Izzy or is it actually Izzy? Is it his regrets over not taking that last stroll in the snow with her that drives him? When he does reach Xibalba, what is the outcome of the action? Is he there for the star, or for him? I will not spoil the ending by saying what actually happens, but it is never fully explained.<br/><br/>However I have to respect Aronofsky's ambitions and skill, and his persistence (this project was shelved more than once, for years, especially after Brad Pitt walked out only a few weeks from shooting). Aronofsky is a talented filmmaker, and the Fountain, if not a classic, is certainly a welcome addition to his oeuvre."
"mikeinpgh","3","4","7","28 November 2006"," ""The Fountain"" is too confusing!
","Everyone has a right to their opinions of course but for the life of me, I can't understand all the enthusiastic reviews this movie has received on here. I love sci-fi adventures, enjoy a good romance and don't mind having to actually use my brain to help figure out the twists and turns of a good movie but....""The Fountain"" was way ""too far out there"" for me! <br/><br/>First the good news: ""The Fountain"" is a romance, sci-fi and action/adventure movie all rolled into one! Now the bad news: ""The Fountain"" doesn't do any of these very well. More good news: the cinematography (A+), costumes (B+) and acting (B) are all pretty good and deserve high grades. Unfortunately, I thought the biggest drawback of this movie was, very simply, the screenplay (D). It was way too confusing for me, my date (and we are actually rather intelligent people!) and it seemed, most of the viewing audience. When the movie ended, we all seemed to look at each other with a confused look on our face, shrug our shoulders and say ""What the heck was that about?"" <br/><br/>I followed the general gist of the plot...(without giving away too much info)... Man searches for The Fountain of Youth throughout time and space to try to preserve his and his love's life. OK, easy enough but was the whole story really happening or was it only his reading of his wife's novel? And as I was debating this in my mind I realized one important thing...that I didn't really care. The story never grabbed me, sucked me into its characters and into its life. It never made me care.<br/><br/>And the final straw for me and my sweety was this...what the heck was with ""Hugh-Jackman-in-the-future"" floating in that stupid bubble?? I kept hoping it would burst and put an end to this weird movie that in the initial 15 minutes had burst for me. Ugh...stay home, rent ""Somewhere in Time"" and make some popcorn!"
"LamontSmith","10","4","7","28 November 2006"," The Fountain Is Truly A Masterpiece
","Pi was very deep. With twists and turns and a very interesting message about spirituality, organized religion and the inner workings of the human mind. Shot intensely and with the flair of an artist, it was great.<br/><br/>Requiem For A Dream descended us into the pure nightmare of addiction in all its forms. Drugs, love, attention. Aronofsky's vision highlighted many things wrong with our instant gratification society but with a visually innovative style that was unprecedented. His use of editing and visual/story suspense are unmatched. I remember sitting in the theater when this film ended and never before seeing an entire audience not move. Stunned and what they had just witnessed then rise up, one by one disoriented and moved, exiting the screening room. That is the power only a true artist wields.<br/><br/>Now, with the Fountain, Aronofsky's progression as a filmmaker and as an artist have taken the next evolutionary step. This film has too many layers to fully digest with simply one viewing. From the first few frames down to the last few, you're imagination and intellect are engaged and running at top speed to keep up with his constant in-references, visual clues and allegory. This work is simply a masterpiece. A true film fan's thanksgiving feast fusing the concepts of pure love, spiritual folklore, life & death, science and suspense and the very nature of creation. It will hopefully take me another two screenings to fully comprehend everything I saw last night but I haven't looked forward to re-watching a film as much since The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>His use of color, editing, audio cues and dynamic performances elevate this tale from the story of one man's undying love for his dying wife into a metaphysical, time-bending metaphor for life itself. Most people won't get this film but I think that's a good thing. It doesn't pander and it doesn't give up one inch of artistic integrity for mass appeal. <br/><br/>It is a true work of art."

""All is lost, so deal with it"" is the movie's theme, which it successfully conveys by causing you to loss to two hours of your life.<br/><br/>This movie through an esoteric and eastern mystical lens tries to convey with beauty and repetition the desire for a tree or fountain that grants eternal life (while I would be satisfied with a tree or fountain that gives me back the last two hours of my life.)

Not long after that I had the feeling that the director was trying to make a film that had the essence of ""2001, A Space Odyssey"" but it just wasn't happening. It has been a long time that after watching a film for 45 minutes that I have felt like I have been semi tortured but ""The Fountain"" certainly had that effect on me. I stopped watching it midway and was glad that I hadn't wasted more time on it than I did. Others seem to have loved it but frankly I can't imagine why.

"claudio_carvalho","4","13","34","9 September 2007"," A Deceptive Trip of a Promising Director
","When ""Requiem for a Dream"" was released in Brazil, Darren Aronofsky became a sensation among the lovers of cinema. The cult ""Pi"" was immediately released on the trail of the success of ""Requiem for a Dream"". I confess that I had great expectations with ""The Fountain"" and I usually categorized Darren Aronofsky, together with Alejandro Amenábar and Alejandro González Iñárritu, the three best new directors of the cinema industry. However, the visually beautiful ""The Fountain"" is a boring mess, actually a deceptive trip of a promising director. Individually, the story of the scientist researching the cure of cancer to save his wife Izzi using a South American tree and a monkey is nice; he spends more time in the laboratory than with his beloved wife, and when he finds the cure, it is too late to recover the lost time that he could have spent with Izzi. The story in the medieval Spain that Izzi is writing is also attractive. However, the story of the man in a bubble in outer space is surrealist and seems to be the inner feelings of the scientist trying to save his love. Unfortunately the interconnection of the three stories never works. I hope that Darren Aronofsky has a different fate from M. Night Shyamalan, who made the successful ""The Sixth Sense"" in the beginning of his career and deceptive movies later on. My vote is four.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Fonte da Vida"" (""Fountain of the Life"")"
"secondtake","5","5","10","2 December 2010"," Cloying, superficial, grandiose and weirdly empty for a movie trying to be so profound
","The Fountain (2006)<br/><br/>A superficially ambitious, fantastical film that throws clichés like peanut butter--sticky, oily, uncooked bits of Profundity. I love deep, romantic, obsessive movies, and I couldn't stand this one. <br/><br/>I think young people (or my younger self) might soak this up, especially people looking for meaning in their lives. For pure inventive fantasy, the Lord of the Rings movies are far better, and less pompous, and the Harry Potter movies have better plots and characters. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has more magic and imagination. In fact, any number of movies in these kinds of fantastical realms have more going on. Because half the movie occurs in a modern hospital (with all its own clichés--the heart monitor, the dying people, the rush of medical workers to save someone) and because it's about true love that cannot die, the closest parallel might be ""What Dreams May Come,"" which has the life/death struggle and the investigation of what our souls are, what a spirit is, what life is. <br/><br/>For me ""The Fountain"" was overstuffed with overused ideas of what serious, epic, mysterious, meaningful things are. It is equal parts wishful thinking and self-importance, with quasi-inventive set design (modeled after other fantasy films in its endless darkness, unwashed hair, overgrown trees, misty landscapes). It is also photographed with almost painfully consistent symmetry across the wide screen aspect ratio. I think this is meant to imply something grand and important, something with Eastern religious overtones, but it also makes the scenes static, even ones where characters are going through hugely physical, violent, or emotional events.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman? He's not my idea of an actor with depth (watch ""Australia"" for proof)--but then, this movie isn't really about depth, it's about the appearance of depth, the kind of depth a Hallmark sympathy card has. It's not like really weeping, it's about watching what weeping should look like. Rachel Weisz is only a pretty face here, which only cheapens the movie more, as there is no real reason for the Jackman character to obsess over her. Call it love, yes--it's a love story, technically--but you won't see any real love at work. There's better obsessive love with spiritual overtones in Coppola's ""Dracula"" fantasia.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" is not without interest, but it will have to be up your alley, to get into it meaningfully. Good luck."

It made M 25 USD compared to M 40 USD that went into the making of this movie. Even more surprising is its rating of 7.5, I've generally agreed with and used as recommendations for movies I ought to watch. But this 7.5 is a joke! Really is, try to concentrate real hard on the movie or watch it over a few times of think about it, but its a beautiful movie!In fact it has changed, or reminded me of my opinion on what is good and what is not again (...good is what is liked by many ...blah..) Its an extremely difficult theme and topic to deal with, and I can still not believe that Darren could thought of it all and put it all together. He deserves to be called a genius for this piece of art. The acting is brilliant, especially when looked at how little time goes into building characters, cause there are so many other things to be said. Expressions that Hugh puts up can move a receptive person to tears.<br/><br/>What the story is about? Take your pick, its about Xabalba , about Hindu philosophy of life and death or even about Karma (the oft used & frequently misused word). But its also about how one behaves in a given moment - and the timeless huge explanation for each action and how one action can determine so much and in turn how everything gives rise to that particular action. So it is also a philosophical expression to one word.<br/><br/>I would suggest you go watch the film, even if you don't understand or like it a lot."

","The Fountain is a weird and disappointing mess. The film is incoherent and confusing and it's a shame because U.S. movies should be more adventurous and experimental, but I came away with no clear idea what the film was about. Although, Jackman's strange, intense performance did make me laugh.<br/><br/>There are three intertwined story lines and the film weaves in-and-out,back-and-forward in time and space. Hugh Jackman plays two characters: Tomas, a 16th century Spanish conquistador, and Tommy Creo, a present day scientist. Both are humorless, driven, unsympathetic obsessives who seek immortality to protect the women in their lives. The lovely Rachel Weisz plays Queen Isabella of Spain, who is under threat from the inquisition. Adam and Eve were exiled from the Garden of Eden to prevent them from eating from the Tree of Life and achieving immortality. Isabella sends Tomas to South America to find the Tree which is located on top of a Mayan temple. On contact Tomas turns into a plant. <br/><br/>Centuries later, Isabel (also Weisz) is dying and her husband, Tommy (a scientist), tries to find a cure for cancer to save her life. Later, Tommy loses his hair and spends eternity floating around far flung galaxies seated in the lotus position. He looks like a Buddhist monk or Hare Krishna devotee and talks to a tree on a barren asteroid. The tree could be Isabel, but we don't find out if the tree talks back to him.<br/><br/>Jackman plays a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown, he is very angry and obsessed . Weisz looked beautiful and radiant but seemed to belong in another movie. The Fountain obviously has intellectual pretensions but literal interpretations of the Book of Genesis are out of fashion and speculation on the Biblical notion of immortality seem somewhat irrelevant. I originally assumed the director must have a real vision and something important to say given the work involved in making this ""epic"". But the film's ideas seemed more like pretentious mumbo jumbo made under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs."

I recall a few very nice visuals, a handful of interesting moments, and some intriguing concepts that were introduced and then left undeveloped, squeezed out in favor of the same teary, dreary terminal illness / love story melodrama we've all seen a hundred times before.<br/><br/>I might have enjoyed it anyway if any of the characters were particularly likable or compelling. They weren't. The very wonderful Ellen Burstyn was wasted in an underwritten role that could have been played by anyone. My Name is Earl's goofy brother kept lurking around in the background and throwing off my concentration. Rachel Weisz, who demonstrated no acting skill other than the ability to look luminous, was nearly insufferable as the earthbound angel / saint. Wolverine seemed semi-conscious and totally confused (not that I could blame him), except when he was blissed out and tumbling through space in full lotus (impressive).<br/><br/>I didn't really care one way or the other what happened to anyone, who died or who didn't (it was hard to tell). The non-linear presentation of the 3 timelines / stories was frustrating and incoherent; the attempted spiritual revelations and insights were trite and fell flat.<br/><br/>I generally enjoy being challenged by movies that play with time, space, presentation, the rules of reality, and the conventions of storytelling, but The Fountain was so short on substance that it was almost entirely empty of meaning for me as a result. I don't anticipate ever watching it again, or even thinking about it again once this review is posted."

It's an awkward story telling, especially since most people are used to a linear perspective. One plot for one movie. Some suggest this movie is about the past, present, and future. I think they are wrong. I believe this is more about three uniquely different ways to explain one concept. Two plots are metaphors, and the one is the basis for the others. All three stories tell a different side to both main characters. Take a step back during this movie. It's a lot to take in. So I suggest you sit and watch. Follow but don't try to make assumptions. Let your mind just take it in. When your finished. Think about what you just saw...still confused, then give it just one more try. It's deserving of it.

","Two thousand six has been a year of phenomenally ambitious cinematic excursions, and Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain belongs right up there on the top of that list, in my opinion, along with The Illusionist.<br/><br/>It is astoundingly difficult - nearly impossible - to portray the unportrayable, but Aronofsky succeeds in doing just that in The Fountain, and he does it with breathtaking purity of vision and the surehandness of a master.<br/><br/>In his supremely down-to-earth interview with Capone from aintitcool.com (see link below), Aronofsky says, ""The Fountain of Youth is one of our oldest ancient myths--if not the oldest myth--that people have been telling, because people have been coming up with stories how to deal with the fear of death. And, trying to find out the reason of why we're here and what is life and what is love. And what happens when you die. These are questions that people have been asking since the beginning of time. So, there's absolutely no way that this schmoe from Brooklyn is going to be able to answer them. That's not the reality here.

The journey of the two main characters/souls, portrayed magnificently by Jackman and Weitz, is indeed at the center of the film, which must have been excruciatingly hard to edit - a miracle in itself - but they got it right: it flows, from beginning to end, like a fountain, in a sublime, indescribably perfect circle.<br/><br/>The rest of the interview: http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30768"

The lovers are played by Oscar winner Rachel Weisz and Xmen's Huge Jackman, who both give terrific performances and i think both will be nominated for Oscars for their amazing work here. This is not your average wide eye love story, its a raw look at human frailty and emotion that has not been on screen for quite a while in cinema. Rachel Weisz gives another superb performance here as a woman who has to accept her tragic fate while her lover can't let go and she plays her cards to the chest while trying to give her lover the strength to go on. Her raw and human performance is her best ever and it even out does her work on The Constant Gardener"", that's how good she is here. Huge Jackman has never been as good anywhere else than this movie and it proves to his naysayers that he's more than just a matinée idol. His performances matches Rachel Weisz Mano to Mano and compliments her as well. he gives a touching performance that is laced with grief and hope while he has to watch his the love of his love slip away from his fingers. Both there performances are the heart and soul of this film."
"daniel-1255","10","5","10","26 November 2006"," An unexpected lightness of being ...
","I made a last second decision to see this film instead of the film I had scheduled for myself (""Flags of Our Fathers""), as its starting time afforded me extra time in the co-resident shopping mall to locate a present for my Sweety. I located the present I was seeking and found another, ""The Fountain,"" which I also hope to share with Sweety before it leaves our theater market, likely as it is all too quickly to be replaced by a popular holiday blockbuster.<br/><br/>In short, the trailer I had seen on TV did not nearly do justice to this film. It showed what seems to be a superficial and fantastic tale, with wooden and emotionless dialog (sampling, as it does, some of the universally quieter pronouncements of its actors). And the sampled visuals make it seem almost like a sophisticated, but empty, CGI animation.<br/><br/>In reality, the film is a sublimely timeless, visual and aural poem, a meditation on life and death, and on human acceptance of both. It presents a three-part story, layered in both time and space across what appear to be several thousand years, beginning in the 15th century. As such, the three parts proceed as one, with a deft inter-cutting from one to another, not always in a consistent sequence, but in a sequence that reveals more and more about each part as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>The central tale passes circa the present day, where a research doctor (Hugh Jackman, as Tom Creo) is seeking a cure for cancer. His wife (Rachel Weisz, as Izzi Creo) is also ill, a major cause for Dr. Creo's urgent intensity. And the story unfolds in past, present, and future as both an epic reflection on the nature of good and evil, and the most fundamental struggle for meaning in mundane matters of life and death. The entire film is suffused with a powerful musical score from beginning to end, played almost entirely by the Kronos String Quartet, and which perfectly matches the visual poetry unfolding.<br/><br/>The principals appear in each part of time and space as different people on similar missions designed to solve their respective and timely problems of existence, yet, somehow, as the same people throughout, almost reincarnated. Jackman's Tomas/Tom/Tommy represents the single most consistent character, really the ""I"" of the multi-layered story. His character seems to answer the question posed by the trailer: what might it really mean for one to find the secret of eternal life? And the secret of the answer seems to lie in the reality of a universe in which death, paradoxically, is an integral part of eternal life.<br/><br/>The bigger questions, which might otherwise drift as if in a drug-induced haze, instead stand in a bold relief set off by the intensely emotional relationship between Tom and Izzi. Weisz's Izzi is as intense as Jackman's Tom, but she boils with a passion that is as precocious at finding final peace as is Tom's relentless seeking for eternal life. And the course of his and her struggle seems to nail the weight of these larger questions to some unseen cross, of which we glimpse only the slightest allusions. Ultimately, only the most necessary requirements for life survive to support the ultimate end, our own imagined, or rather Tom's, destiny. And, yes, love is also at both the beginning and the end.<br/><br/>All of the acting and cast is superb, and the roll of midwife to the birthing of both Tom's and Izzi's difficult destiny receives a splendid performance from Ellen Burstyn.<br/><br/>In sum, this movie comes the closest of any film I have seen to creating a contemporary cinematic mandala. If it works, and I think it does so nobly, it is, like a mandala, the symbol in which each of us finds something of our own reflected life, and that of the hopeful, yet deeply troubled, world around us."

I heard all about it at the urinal in the movie theater before I left.<br/><br/>Me? I'll be over in the other crowd talking about how some movies don't connect all dots, that sometimes the canvas is meant to contain your own perceptions of what you saw and how it worked. I could also be talking about a mirror as canvas and how it contains different images for everyone. That is one of the incredible things about the movie...that when its over, your take on it is different than anyone elses (although mine's pretty close to Harry Knowles' take over on Ain't It Cool News). I loved it and wished it hadn't ever ended and how it is both gloriously beautiful and very familiar.<br/><br/>In The Fountain, there are three stories revealing themselves gradually. There is a Spanish Conquistador, asked by his queen to seek a mystery. There is a modern man who is looking to save his wife, dying of cancer. And last, there is the same man, far flung in the future, performing t'ai chi sequences in a bubble beside a tree in far away space. Oh yes, and there is the glorious Rachel Weisz. Trust me...Rick O'Connell's love for Evelyn in The Mummy movies is NOTHING compared to Hugh Jackman's adoration for his wife here.<br/><br/>How are they connected? What do they have in common? Is it worth the 2 hours you're going to spend going somewhere with these characters? Oh yes, clearly. Although half of you will think it sucks and half of you will see brilliance.<br/><br/>I'm still dazzled....great movie."

","You don't get all the answers in/to this life, the best one can hope for is to create art that lifts the veil. This film needs no answer to qualify it's existence. Good art works when the viewer no longer ""sees"" the art. But is transported from the physical to to the vision. I am amazed and awed by this film's ability to lift the veil. Beyond the directing, great music, acting, sets and editing lies a dream of what life/death are/could be/might be. One can pick it apart to to try to locate the keys to the doors of reality but it won't help in the end. The lack of linear thought and plot progression is not meant to confuse but to enlighten ones perspective. The answer is the problem and the problem is the answer."

","When I see a movie in the theater, i usually glance at my watch once or twice to figure out how much longer until the story reaches its end, but not during The Fountain. I felt so attached to the characters and their struggles against fate that when the movie ended, I felt a sense of enlightenment take the place of closure. The Fountain is just that amazing.<br/><br/>All three stories are fixating and each comes to a fantastic end. The whole movie is so heartfelt, I felt drained by the time the movie reached its amazing, perfect conclusion. Hugh and Rachael deliver fantastic performances and Clint Mansell re-invents his Requiem talent when he creates the best film score ever (in my opinion).<br/><br/>All in all, it is the best movie I have ever seen.

"ineedaguitarist","10","5","10","24 November 2006"," Awestruck
","The slack jawed yokels of America and the world might not get it, the critics might not get it. The movie is interpretive and until there is a definitive director's cut and commentary maybe the exact message can not be deciphered. Regardless the movie is visually amazing especially with the budget and as a work of art, art mind you, the film works on that level. Is there more power in something that leaves you thinking, I believe so. I am a visual artist myself and in that respect this is what a artist can do with a movie. This is a believable love story and I left it wishing I had something similar in my life. This film deserves more attention, but I think that those who can truly appreciate it are in the minority."
"jamiegalgana","9","5","10","24 November 2006"," spoilers and just my thoughts/reflection/opinion
","I perceive the movie as 1/4 Traditional Literature>Religious Stories and 3/4 Fantasy. Image- pleasing and audio-amazing, I honestly watched half the movie either nodding in agreement to choice of direction or with jaw loose and hand covering, wanting to smile the largest grin ever. I asked Jake a couple of things that he liked about the movie and they didn't exactly coincide with what I liked, showing that I just want to see it again. I don't often get that feeling. The moment that Izzy dies and so does the tree of life was a jaw loosener. And every frame from that point forward was also quite amazing. I found it beautiful in its religious text and also mysterious in its curious beginning and first half. It's funny that I watched Deja Vu right before this movie and it was more about time travel, but as I was considering it more, I felt like this movie was more like space travel. It was unique in its aspects of integrating about three stories into one. More. His choice in the second instance when she leaves to take a first-snow walk and following her, to me, shows that he was ready to be with Eve and forget his life and live the eternal life. In my eyes, when he saw the tree the second time, in the past life, it was the honest tree of eternal life as opposed to the tree of life. Eternity. She just wanted him to finish it, and in a way, I suppose he did but in a really far off way... but not really. Dang. OK, so that side story and him versus that human beast and that beast praising him after he has realized his greed and the sap and his longing. I am blabbing. She was ready and in a way I think he was trying to convince himself too early or just realized too late that he was ready to join her too. The deliverance of the new scientific revelation was the mayan death that just brought life to a whole concept of new birth where he can finally rest. I feel that she was way ahead of him, despite her sickness. The power each had, however, was one that I sensed they had for themselves(character) and not necessarily for the moviescreen. These are all of my opinions. Please feel free to respond, disagree, agree, share or whatnot. There were more moments of awe that I did not reflect here."
"midgar2110","10","5","10","23 November 2006"," Insightful, attractive, and stunning
","Probably the best film of the year. Thought-provoking, enigmatic, and insightful, it provides great spiritual and physical outlooks into our existence and inevitable death. The visuals are beautiful, although at times, the lack of lighting in some scenes is somewhat aggravating. Regardless, the story that takes place in the 1600's is particularly interesting, and is quite beautiful. Like previously stated, this movie is not for everyone; it requires thought and begs to be interpreted differently for each individual. If you bought the Collector's DVD Edition of ""Road Trip"" and went to see ""Jackass 2"" with your buds and their girlfriends who don't even know you, this film probably isn't for you.<br/><br/>Regardless, this is a film to be remembered for years, although it's sketchy topics and uncommon directing techniques may make it difficult to fully embrace by some."
"jaredmobarak","10","5","10","22 November 2006"," Death breeds creationThe Fountain
","I never thought I would ever thank Brad Pitt for causing the utter failure of The Fountain launching principal photography three years ago. However, his leaving the production to do Troy may have resulted in the finest film-going experience I have ever had. Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece could only have been ruined by the doubled budget and lack of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz's stellar performances. The epic scope this film has is that much better due to the small-scale effects honed and enlarged to full utilization. Much like this, Tom and Izzi's quest for eternal life spans mankind yet could be found inside themselves if they only looked hard enough. The Fountain is definitely a fantasy for adults and helps show the world the lengths we will go for love and how it can blind us to what truly matters in that most precious of unions.<br/><br/>One can't truly explain this film; it is an experience that must be seen firsthand to even begin to fathom the effect it can have on the viewer. Aronofsky has crafted a tale of love through the pain of death. Hugh Jackman is a neurosurgeon desperately trying to discover a way to decrease the growth of tumors. While on a mission to help prevent death and disease in the world, he also must find a way to save his dying wife from the cancer that has begun taking its hold on her. The looming death set before Izzi, played with pure emotion by Rachel Weisz, has been accepted, yet can't be by her husband who knows he can cure her if he just had more time. Jackman is a shattered man on a quest which once started together, but now finishes alone. The futility of his situation cannot sink in and as a result he must continue on while his wife lays dying, trying her hardest to let him understand what is to come in the future. She shares her novel about a conquistador on a journey for Eden's Tree of Life, telling him that he needs to write the conclusion. The quest along the road to awe has been laid out for Tom and it is up to him to decide what he will do when he comes face to face with destiny. This surgeon will come to a choice where he will have to either choose finding the end of death, planting a tree to gather his wife's spirit for an afterlife through an ancient Mayan tale of Seebalba, or allow himself to accept that finality and hope for a continuing to life beyond it.<br/><br/>While at first it may seem a bit convoluted and pretentious, this story is a simple one. Love binds us to each other and pulls a veil over the big picture when it does not concern the survival of our union. Instead of cherishing the time we have together on Earth, we would rather waste it all in desperate attempts to prolong our stay. Much like Adam and Eve being thrown from Eden for wanting more than each other, Tom and Izzi are at the point of their journey where they can eat the fruit and risk losing everything, or they can take a step back and live for the moment. We all face this challenge throughout our lives, and will continue to as the years go by. Darren Aronofsky shows us the problem as far back as the Spanish Inquisition, as far forward as the end of time being pulled into the nebular entrance to eternity, and at the present day, here and now. Izzi relates to the beauty of ancient Mayan tales of the afterlife and through her writings on a past life, sparks her husband's mind to imagine the journey through time and the road of disappointment it will lead him on. That road needs to be taken, however, for without the knowledge of pain and failure, one will never see that he must look inside himself for the answers that will bring him back to his love. When Jackman finally realizes what must happen, he expresses sheer joy and relief that his story has come to close, yet his life has been reborn for eternity.<br/><br/>After his genius with previous films Pi and Requiem for a Dream, it is hard to believe that Aronofsky could enhance the medium of cinema even further. While others take from past visionaries and apply their findings to their own work, Aronofsky creates those new ways that will be adopted in the future. He is an innovator and with his work here takes another step closer, if not to totally justifying the call by some that he is the new Stanley Kubrick. Each step of The Fountain is orchestrated to the utmost detail and the symphony is one for the ages. Along with Clint Mansell's haunting score, Badalamenti to Darren's Lynch, this tale is one for all senses. The palpability and lushness of the effects in the future scenes are a feat to behold. Crossing between three time periods is daunting in itself, yet in the final minutes, going through each at breakneck speed leading to the tale's culmination is brilliant. No one else has the eye to make every banal, static shot seem magical and full of life. With seamless dissolves and gorgeous compositions, The Fountain is a feast for the eyes, intriguing at ever turn. However, the true magic lies in the story being told, one that will break your heart while simultaneously breathing a hope for everlasting love inside of you."

","What an original movie that was deep and imaginative. This is not your average brain-dead herd 'em in like cattle Hollywood movie that leaves you feeling empty and shortchanged. This movie is full of stunning visuals & mind-blowing sci-fi images, brilliant acting & music, and well, wow, it was a pretty wild ride. I don't know quite how to describe it because I have never seen a movie quite like this one. Hugh Jackman gave an Oscar winning performance. I mean, his acting was INCREDIBLE in this movie and he should win best actor in 2006, for sure. Rachel Weisz (I Love her) was also very good, but the movie focused more on Hugh Jackman's character. The movie, for me, was kind of like a timeless epic journey of a man and a woman and their sacred bond of true love and marriage, life and death, the past, the present, and the future, and the struggle not just to cope with death, but a race to overcome it through science and meditation. It's definitely not a kid flick - leave them at home - they might like the visuals but they won't understand the movie at all really. Heck, I'm not even sure I fully understand the movie. It's definitely a film for a more mature audience. If you like a good epic tragic love-story full of symbolism and sci-fi, then you'll love this film. If you're like me, you'll want to watch it a few times on DVD to really ""get it"" since it was so deep on many levels. This is truly a movie like nothing you've ever seen before."

","This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. I sat in the theater with my mouth hanging open at the amazing visuals. The tag line (What if you could live forever?) may seem kind of cliché, but the story holds itself up, and fits well with the visuals. I saw this at a preview screening and Aronofsky was there to answer questions, the number one question: How did you make such great looking CGI? His Answer: It's not CGI, there are only two CGI shots in the whole film. The special effects were done by an English guy (I don't remember his name), who shoots chemical reactions under a microscope, that are then composited to make the beauty of The Fountain. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie, even if you end up not liking the story which some people have been complaining about, seeing this visual masterpiece in a theater will be well worth the money you pay for the ticket."

","The Fountain is a mover and a shaker. Okay, so maybe not the best description, but it certainly warrants a gander... maybe a goose. The previews and trailers did little justice for this film which was insane and kept me wondering until five to ten minutes before the end. I just kept repeating the wtf mantra until some kind of closure was given. You won't see it coming. During his Q & A, Aronofsky explained something that delighted me to no end, this is a film with no CGI computer animation. See there Lucas-type people, beauty can be made by hand rather than by mouse. Since I didn't and won't label this as a spoiler type review I won't go any further.

"antonio_janelle","10","5","10","17 October 2006"," A film about Humanity's obsession and rejection of Death
","Last night I saw the Chicago International Film Festival premiere of Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"", and I have to say, this is not only the best of Aronofsky's films, it is easily the best film I have seen in the last few years. In my opinion, the film is a trip through the obsession, and rejection, that Humanity has for the concept of death.<br/><br/>I actually walked in not knowing what to expect, I even had forgotten I was going to see an Aronofsky film, even though I have enjoyed his previous films. I realized who the director was before the film only because he was there to present his work.<br/><br/>The first and biggest word of advice for anyone about to watch this film, especially fans of Aronofsky's work, is that you are NOT going to see Requiem for a Dream part II, nor anything resembling the director's previous work. I haven't seen the previews, but my second word of advice is: try to avoid them! This film has to be seen with a completely open mind.<br/><br/>Having said that, keep in mind that this film is not for everyone. It is a true art film that requires from the audience to meet it halfway in order to connect with the ideas the director is trying to convey. It is visually stunning, but the images are more than just eye candy. They have a very profound meaning behind them. But what meanings and ideas you will carry with you after the film is over will depend on whether you can ""connect"" with Aronofsky's conceptual images.<br/><br/>Jackman and Weisz performances are very contrasting and Oscar-worthy, with Jackman's being especially intense. His character reminds me of the obsessiveness in Sean Gullette's character in ""Pi"", and that is probably the only connection you will find with that film. Some might even find it a bit over the top, but in my opinion, it is absolutely required for the subject of the story in this film, and Jackman delivers with credibility.<br/><br/>Here's hoping that Aronofsky gets a well-deserved Oscar nomination for this film!"
"Mental_Butterfly","1","10","25","20 November 2006"," Overly abstract and metaphorically heavy-handed.
","Rather than bothering with creating a story around which to establish his themes, Aronofsky has instead chosen to ignore character and instead layer metaphor upon metaphor in what becomes a muddled illustration of the path to immortality through the embracing of death. Instead of leaving the film with a clear concept of the director's intent, the viewer is left confused by the film's mix of Buddhism, Mayan creation myth, Christian creation myth, its three interwoven and only vaguely defined plots, and myriad unresolved subplots. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz give solid performances considering the material they are dealing with, but the film's cartoonish depiction of the Mayans as bloodthirsty savages is, frankly, offensive. While the film is at times visually stunning, its self-importance and lack of coherence makes for an unsatisfying experience."

When the movie was over...and by over I mean they just quit filming...I sat and said ""what the heck was that supposed to be about?""

Even when the movie ended and the credits started rolling you could tell that people were befuddled, like ""is that all?"" It was like watching 3 really bad ""film student"" movies that had all been rolled into one. I got the premise, but it was just so slow and really not very thought provoking. It had the appearance of a low budget movie with too much emphasis on computer graphics. I wish I could say it was worth going to see just to experience the concept of the movie, but I can't. I just kept sitting there saying, ""it will get better"". It didn't. Maybe I just wasn't into a long, drawn out, boring session of fiction. Yes beautiful graphics,but too much going on in one movie about the same thing. I fought to stay awake, and I just kept saying, ""God, please could this movie end, I want to go home.

","All right. I can appreciate artsy, intelligent films as much as anyone, but ""The Fountain"" was incredibly disappointing. And the sad thing is, everywhere I look people are giving it wonderful reviews and raving about its genius. Perhaps I'm just not smart enough to comprehend said ""genius,"" because when I came out of the theater, all I could think was, ""What...?"" The entire film was an incoherent mess. I was confused from the moment the movie began with only small glimmerings of comprehension throughout. I had hoped that everything would neatly tie together in the end, answering the questions that had accumulated in my mind throughout the film, but I got no answers. I could find only vague parallels between the three story lines present, if any at all. Granted, the visual effects were lovely, and the music was as well, if a little repetitive after being played continuously throughout the movie. But overall, the movie was dark (not that I mind dark films, but the lighting itself made it literally so), confusing, and just an utter waste of my time and money. Sure, if you're a teenage artist looking for a film that no one understands to make people think you're smart and to portray the ""fragility of life and humanity,"" then this is just the film for you. But if you come to me and sing praises of this tangled yarnball of a movie, I might just have to resort to physical violence. I am that sorely disappointed."

Requiem was great because it was written by Hurbert Selby Jr. ""The Fountain"" however, was written by Aronofsky. Seems like he was trying to emulate David Lynch to me. This movie is filled with great special effects and stunning visuals, however, that is not enough to save this horrendous film. Where was the story? Did I miss it? For those people who claim this was a ""love story,"" well it was a pretty crappy one at that. I have a feeling we wont be seeing too much more from Aronofsky after this flops.

There is a central plot which attempts to connect with two other ongoing stories however the connection is not only never explained, but Aronofsky tries mystifying you into caring for an entire hour and a half. By the time you get to what should be the resolution he just shows you some cool special effects, and a message about death which resembles a $3.99 Hallmark card. However the Hallmark card takes only 30 to 40 seconds to read and doesn't waste your afternoon. This movie paints a great portrait of how any screenplay which seems confusing and dark will land you a budget from warner brothers. Aronofsky, try again!

","I went into this movie with no real ""expectations"" per se, as I'd never seen the ads on tv for it. In my divorce in 2013, pretty much EVERYTHING in the house ""disappeared."" Even now with a tv, we just prefer movies to the sadness and negativity of news and topic shows. I'd seen 2 of my favorite actors were in it, and decided to give it a chance! Now in all fairness, I have an IQ in the top 1% of the world, when I was younger the schools brought in Mensa to test me. You'll understand why this is important for me to tell you as we get into this next section.
This is a story of a great love between a man and a woman and the man's devotion being so deep and real that he loses track of maybe what's most important in his quest to save her life. There are two plots in this movie. Think of it as parallel dimensions. In the real world, the wife is dying of cancer and the husband is a cancer researcher. He is so committed to finding a cure that he is literally spending every waking moment at the lab and away from her.
When one starts talking about the parallel dimension, that is where things get very confusing and convoluted. I wish I had written this review right after I saw the movie. Because I am extremely disabled and I am on medication that makes me forget things. But if memory serves, in the parallel dimension it is a man and a tree. And the man so loves the tree that he's constantly with the tree and nurturing the tree but the tree bark is damaged by disease. So he starts peeling away the bark and eating it! That's just kind of sickness to me. You're in love with this tree like you would be a spouse, and it's week and the bark is dying, so you peel it off and eat it? You're going to take your Lover's flesh and eat it that's true sickness. But yeah this movie gets really confusing really fast and it was a very touching loving movie, it had me crying but half the time I didn't even understand what was going on and as I said I have a very high IQ and I love things that challenge me and make me think, but this movie Just had too many questions and the twist in the ending was just really unsatisfactory. I'm giving it a high rating because this cinematography is amazing! The actors are incredible! Literally perfect for their parts! Most of the script is really good but the parts that are bad are really bad and it resonates even in the good stuff it's sort of a disease that just stinks in in like a bad gift just keeps on giving. Definitely don't watch this movie if you are looking for something to entertain you, watch it only if you seriously want a challenge and want your brain to hurt and be stressed out. If that's the case then this is a really good movie."
"johnlundmolfese","10","3","5","8 January 2017"," Polished
","Everything Aronofsky touches turns to gold. The Fountain is much more polished than Requiem for a Dream or Pi, but still retains his signature short takes and visual design; the film reminded me of Beyond the Black Rainbow toward the end. I also found it much more easy to follow than Pi, maybe because the characters are more expressive, and the soundtrack is less tremulous.<br/><br/>If you understand the basic history of Spanish conquest of the Americas, and the way Native Americans were treated at the time, you'll have a much better time watching the film, but it isn't strictly necessary. Really a great movie though, I think that Arenofsky will be much more appreciated in the future, after his work has had some time to age."
"leaangelinachen","4","3","5","23 March 2016"," Bof. Watchable.
","It's not terrible. Definitely watchable for the stunning visual and audio. Here, Aronofsky tried to be a hipster by making something ""original"" and ""different"". Not with a great success if you expect good and coherent storyline. He just muddled everything up. The foundation of the whole plot is feeble that one doesn't even know what the focus is about. <br/><br/>Yeah yeah it is "" romantic"" and everything but I didn't find it touching at all. Pretentious. Tried to market itself to the hipsters and cinema connoisseurs but actually only people with mediocre taste find it ""fantastic"". <br/><br/>I gave it a good 6 because I really enjoyed the beautiful imagery.

","For the first time I feel compelled to share my view of a film, so here goes... It is a masterpiece. Beautiful visually, such a rich and warm colour palette, thoughtful and careful direction and design, all the symbolism and visual symmetry balanced in each frame flowing through the film underpinned by a subtle and emotive musical score that carries you through this experience. The dialogue is also very well written and serves the plot very well indeed, with very clever devices used. The performances from the leads are outstanding, particularly fearless on Hugh Jackman's part. This film is truly cinematic art, leaving you to interpret it's meaning for yourself. I shall never forget it."

"grintemcstinger","Null","3","5","16 February 2014"," Not for everyone
","""The Fountain"" is indeed a very difficult movie to review. It's one of those kind of movies that doesn't explain much of what is happening, and lets the viewer come up with its own explanations.<br/><br/>For me, the balance is crucial in such movies. It doesn't want you to tell too much, but if it doesn't tell enough, it might end up being too hard to follow or incomplete. As much as I love movies that challenge the viewer, I always felt that ""The Fountain"" is too demanding for it's own good and ends up explaining too little. It goes overboard with cultural and religious symbolism, so much that I felt left out because I simply don't know what it is referring to. I admit that I have little knowledge about these things, but despite that, halfway through the movie I thought it'll be one of my all-time favorites. After all, the build-up is promising, the scenery and visuals are beautiful and the music is fantastic. It sets the right mood. <br/><br/>But when the movies goes about to resolve things it becomes very hard to understand why its suddenly happening that way. It felt like an absurd twist, one that could be argued to be either brilliant or lame. I tend to lean more towards the latter.<br/><br/>It's a movie that probably anyone will experience differently, and if that was Aronofskys goal - then he obviously achieved it. I can imagine that someone who likes symbolism or has enough knowledge about this movies thematic will find much joy in it. But the average viewer might get the impression that it doesn't give him enough to work with in order to tell a complete story."
"nicko_i18","10","3","5","16 April 2011"," Underrated masterpiece
","A beautifully-told tragedy with a modern twist. Truly among Aronofsky's best, it intertwines a love story with mythology and concepts of life and death. It definitely takes more than one viewing of this film to really appreciate every nuance, but that's one of the reasons that this film is brilliant - you can notice something new every time you watch it. It is such a shame that the director's original vision couldn't be accomplished, but with what resources he had, he has made something incredible in ""The Fountain"". It's the kind of film which will make it's audience wonder about not only one's own mortality, but the ability, or lack thereof, to deal with a dying loved one and the prospect of an afterlife. These often touching and self-questioning themes coupled with breathtaking visual effects created with natural micro-photography, as well as the emotionally-enthralling score produced by Clint Mansell and Co. leave all of the viewer's senses seduced. Throw in a tragic love story delivered by some of Hollywood's finest talent and you have yourself a very intelligent piece of art with multiple layers, which is not to be brushed aside as ""pretensious"" or ""outlandish"". I ask the critics to watch again and think about these themes some more before judging this piece."

","When I read the script for THE FOUNTAIN in late 2005, I found it to be a fairly low calorie film. There's the central conceit of two characters named Thomas and Isabel who share a love that stretches across time and space but, otherwise, it was something of a one trick pony. Three tales of Thomas (Hugh Jackman) and Isabel (Rachel Weisz) are branches of the same (literal) tree.<br/><br/>Tomas and Isabel are a conquistador and Queen of Spain. The loyal Tomas journeys to Central America on the quest to locate the Tree of Life; cutting his way through as many Mayans as it takes to get there. The central Thomas, a doctor, appears to have access to part of the Tree which he uses on terminally ill monkeys in hopes of curing his terminally ill writer wife, Izzy. The third Thomas may or may not be a later version of the second. This one floats in a bubble through space with his ""giving tree"" of a wife. He's headed to Xibalba (not to be confused with Three Dog Night's ""Shambala""), the Mayan underworld - a place of redemption and rebirth. The stories wind and wander around each other like wild vines. Dialogue and images echo one another throughout the ages. The past and future may simply be the different writings of Isabel and Thomas who begin and end a story called ""The Fountain."" My expectations were incredibly low for this film between the script and the last experience I had watching a film starring a tree (Kiyoshi Kurosawa's CHARISMA). Luckily, the performances and direction made THE FOUNTAIN palatable. I wouldn't go so far as to recommend the film to anyone and I'm fine never seeing it again but it was an unobjectionable way to spend two hours."

If you try and figure out what is going on you will only be frustrated. Imagine taking three separate and totally unrelated movies and then editing them into one film. The results would leave everyone bewildered and shaking their head in disbelief. That is ""The Fountain"" only worse. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.

Even the music, which is generally very good in movies was very repetitive and substandard, sounded like something a computer would have put together (sample a violin at 3 notes, play them slowly, repeat forever) The movie being so bad was a surprise to me, since I have always liked both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Wiesz.

Having set out the time-shift connection between the Spanish conquistadors of Queen Isabela, and the contemporary / present scenes, plus the (potentially after-death and nirvana-like) future scenes, the film - both its premise and screenplay - completely fails to deliver. <br/><br/>I have no doubt that Darren Aronofsky had a pretty good original idea for a film here, but somewhere along the way the directness and simplicity of his story got lost. I suspect he, and the editors, where not quite sure how to end this film. The beginning of the film is a bit slow, and some patience is needed to stay with it.

Yikes. <br/><br/>I enjoyed Aronofsky's last film Requiem for a Dream, despite the fact that it too was full of life lessons, but after seeing The Fountain, well, I will be thinking more than twice before I see another film by Aronofsky. He seems like a young arrogant director who is full of himself and self-indulgent but who is not really all that interested in entertaining an audience and is more interested in teaching an audience about his vast wisdom.<br/><br/>There's a lot of excessively glowing positive reviews about this stinker here at IMDb, so, just so you don't think I'm bonkers, you can get some more bad reviews, readily accessible to everyone, for free, on the web, in USA Today, Philadelphia Inquirer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Christian Science Monitor, San Francisco Chronicle, and Los Angeles Times, to name a few. <br/><br/>You'd be better off using the time to see some other movie that is actually entertaining to watch and not so full of pretentious BS."

Aside from that, I can't reveal much else of the plot, because it truly needs to be experienced.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie was jam packed, but I think it's more because ""The Fountain"" was just released. I think attendance will drop as soon as people hear the news from naysayers, and I think there will be plenty of those.<br/><br/>Some people definitely left early, and you could hear them complaining that they didn't get it (this sorta thing always confuses me, because you know you'll find out soon enough if you just stuck around). The guy beside me told his wife midway, ""I'm not getting this,"" to which she responds, ""Me neither."" At this point, I didn't understand the movie, either. However, it was still compelling, with so much to absorb and all these little visual and spoken connections, I was quite content absorbing everything. Speaking of visuals, ""The Fountain"" is indescribably beautiful--I don't doubt that I'll remember some of those images forever (just so you know, a lot of it wasn't even CGI; they were chemical reactions filmed through a microscope, and applied to green screen). In addition to that, the acting from Jackman and Weisz is incredible--great chemistry, sensitivity, and emotion. Score was brilliant also. Since everything was working together so well, I was happy to let the answers reveal themselves.<br/><br/>In the end, there wasn't an answer, but a message, a bit of wisdom that anyone can and should understand, hard as it is. This was lost on some; when the credits rolled, the first thing aforementioned husband said to aforementioned wife was, ""That was a total piece of crap,"" and she concurred.<br/><br/>Sigh--did they get it? Maybe they got it and still hated it, which to me would be hard to fathom, but his reaction was so quick, I'd like to think not.<br/><br/>Then again, someone behind asked ""Is that the end?"", to which the addressed sagely answered, ""That is *a* end."" So there may be hope still, despite the fact that it should have been ""an."" ;) If you're into movies great for discussion and reflection, then ""The Fountain"" is not only candy for the eyes, it's candy also for the soul."

","I loved Aronofsky's prior movies. ""Requiem"" is a work of demented genius. And the trailer for ""Fountain"" excited me no end.<br/><br/>I just saw this movie this evening.<br/><br/>Oh. My. God.<br/><br/>No, that's not a GOOD ""Oh, My God."" The first movie I ever saw at the cinema was ""2001""...my uncle, for soem demented reason, took me to see it when I was 4. I have vague recollections of the Stargate, but wouldn't really fall in love with it for another decade.<br/><br/>I champion ""A.I."", ""Phase IV"", ""Silent Running"", ""Solaris"", and many more.<br/><br/>But I draw the line at ""The Fountain."" I KNOW what Aronofsky's trying to say. I would LOVE to read his original script, and I'm dying to know what the big set-pieces were that were cut after the big ""Brad Pitt Turnaround Budget Slash"".<br/><br/>But, honestly: this film has high ambitions, and fails spectacularly on every single level. I *understand* what Aronofky's trying to say, and because I understand, I can only shake my head in bewilderment wondering how he managed to screw his own story so badly. The screenplay could have been fixed in less than a week: as it stands, it's patronising (not pretentious) and fuzzy.<br/><br/>I was less than impressed with the FX (oh, big deal: a smattering of FX in ""2001"" were done the same way...not an excuse to consistency bludgeon is with them as a theme-poem); I hated Rachel Weisz (and I was starting to like her in other movies); and it was a MASSIVE mistake using Kronos again for music.<br/><br/>I came out of the cinema to something I've never encountered before: an angry audience. We all knew we'd been duped. It wasn't saying anything special. And, I can only wonder at Aronofsky's comment that he wrote it after coming out ""The Matrix"". Coming out of ""Dark City"", I could understand..."

","Definitely one of the worst movies I have seen this year. The whole way through I kept thinking it reminded me of ""The Cell"" or ""12 Monkeys"" because it was using fancy visuals and flashbacks/forwards to cover up for it's horribly pretentious plot. It seemed like the director wanted to touch on every genre without doing any of them well. The action scenes were ho-hum, the love story was boring, the sci-fi was not very well thought out, the plot was thick and slow and had a horrible finish, The visuals were pretty but nothing spectacular and the filming was way too tight for a film that was hyped as visually stunning. If you want to make a big visual movie then don't have every character framed in superclose-up. All the scenes seemed to be taped in a small room. Even the stupid tree scenes were in a bubble.

","I consider to myself to be an intelligent person and I consider myself to be a fan of Darren Aronofsky but the Fountain is absurd, pretentious, boring and uninvolving. Lacking the visual impact of his earlier films it tells the story of two people throughout the ages played confidently by weisz and Jackman. What it comes down to without giving anything away is the film is about creation through death. Which is understandably a powerful and intriguing idea but never has it been done so creatively and uninvolving. The characters are hardly developed and though they are not the main focus they should be. Because without an emotional attachment in this type of film it just doesn't work. The film is confusing at best but not because of its intelligence or coherence but because it tries to be different when it probably would have been more effective played straight. What seems to be leading up to a powerful plot revelation is something you already attained within the first third. There is a lot of symbolism and subtext but the film is very repetitive within its limited themes. Aronofsky has some important things to say but doesn't know how to say them. The film's pacing makes it seem hours when it's just 96 minutes. The performances are good but the characters are poorly written and underdeveloped and the cinematography is acceptable but cheap looking. There are no other words but to describe this movie except to say it's a waste of time. maybe my expectations were to high after his previous two victories but this films wreaks of studio meddling, whats left has nothing to say and should only be seen by extreme art-house fans who like something just because its different and no one else likes it and by insomniacs looking to finally get some sleep."
"frankjohnstone-1","6","9","24","16 September 2006"," Monumental Disappointment
","Pay for Quicktime, download the trailer, and keep it in your archives, because that's as good as it gets for this movie. I waited for it to be good all the way through, and then it was over. There was no Indiana Jones meets 2001, which the trailer clearly suggests. The movie is basically set in the present, with characters in the past and future taking part only as metaphorical allusions to those in the present as Weisz' character has written them down in a book. And the handling of some things was just clumsy. For example, why do the Spaniards all speak English, but the Mayan Priest apparently speaks Mayan? Either you're making a movie for the English Market like Gladiator, or Kingdom of Heaven, or you're trying to be accurate and you have all of the characters speak their proper languages. And the bald Jackman floating in space? Those scenes were so poorly conceived that I didn't know whether or not he intended the audience to laugh. Not only that, but the only part of the quest we see is the present day Jackman looking for a cure for cancer. In the past, we only join the quest when he's already found the location of the tree and in the future portion of the film, he's just floating aimlessly and looking insane while he waits to arrive in Xibalba, with Weisz' character showing up every now and then and telling him to 'Finish it'. Even though the film is such that it's worthy of ridicule, the visuals (the 30 second sequence at the end that you see in the trailer) could merit an Oscar. But the film itself should probably win the Golden Raspberry as worst of the year. I've been telling everyone I know that this was the film to see this year for the past 3 months, and frankly I'm embarrassed to admit that now. So, save your money, and let's hope that whoever owns the rights to Lone Wolf and Cub comes to their senses and kicks this guy to the curb. There's only one phrase from the movie that I will take with me. ""Death is the road to awe"". I imagine Mr. Aronofsky's career is feeling pretty awe-struck right about now."

In doing so they doubtless prevented millions of people seeing, and understanding this remarkable raw exposition on love, timeless, undying love and selfless commitment to a cause greater than the self.

The acting by Jackman and Weisz, is fine, and the visuals are stunning, but it just doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>The movie abruptly jumps between its three timelines, but it is easy enough to know what timeline you are in, just by looking at How much hair Hugh Jackman has. But I actually think there is only one timeline, the modern day one, at least it's the way I viewed it.<br/><br/>Too many blinding lights. Too many transitions for their own sake. Abrupt changes of tone. I believe I have not seen the real film. When a $75 million production goes into turnaround and is made for $35 million, elements get eliminated. When a film telling three stories and spanning thousands of years has a running time of 96 minutes, scenes must have been cut out.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky initially cast Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the central leads of Tom and Izzi with a budget of $75 million dollars. During pre-production, Pitt and Aronofsky were having major creative differences, so Pitt left and Blanchett followed. Warner Bros cut the budget to $35 million dollars, both Weisz and Jackman agreed to work on the film at a reduced rate, to ensure the movie went ahead.<br/><br/>Warner Bros. refused to do a director's commentary for the DVD release, so Darren Aronofsky recorded one in his living room and released it on his website. I think I will need to listen to that, as there could be some great insight in there.<br/><br/>The Fountain grossed $10 million at the domestic box office to be the first Hugh Jackman movie to lose money, since he became a star."

The message it sends and the way it makes us feel? The journey is full with joy and suffering but the final point would be understanding death is not only inevitable but also the natural and the only way of life itself. We are talking here about the stubbornness of Tommy, who can not accept death and the wisdom his wife, when facing it.

I was impressed in different ways by ""Requiem For A Dream"", ""The Wrestler"" and ""Black Swan"", less happy with ""Noah"", and put off by ""Pi"". ""The Fountain"" is definitely worth seeing - an innovative work which he wrote as well as directed.<br/><br/>It tells three stories across vastly different time periods: a Spanish conquistador in a Mayan civilisation on a quest for his queen, a contemporary scientific researcher struggling to keep his wife alive: and a future space traveller in a bubble with a tree on the way to a dying star. The three tales are introduced briefly and enigmatically at the very beginning of the film and only as the work unfolds do the meanings and connections become apparent, strengthened by the repeated appearances of the same actors Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz.<br/><br/>This is a philosophical work about love and loss and about mortality and immortality that is beautifully composed and shot with a limited budget eliminating the use of any CGI. It is not totally comprehensible but it is thought-provoking."

","...it's messy and beautiful, it fights against its modest budget so it can preserve its message, it's intent on obfuscation in order to hide its depth beneath its lapels, it's clearly a very personal film to its Director and it's very raw and in some ways direct.
It portrays male emotion and the denial of those emotions in an open and candid way in a way that surprised me upon first watching.
I find I can look past it's messiness and see the very simple and very powerful message it's trying to put forward. When viewed as a film that exquisitely simply is an examination of what immortality means to man, told through three stories, exploring if memory, symbols, nature, medicine, enlightenment, or story can preserve someone. The truth is that some of these are a form of immortality, and some are not. To explain too much of it is to kill its magic. But I think it's trying to say that enlightenment is shedding the fear of death.
The Fountain is a very bold sort of cinematic poem, something from Homer or something as derided on release as Moby Dick, where depth and meaning are held within the journey and not always in view. It's rewarding when you understand it, and so what moreso because others do not, but hey may yet."

","The Fountain is drenched in misery and misfortune. I regularly find myself led to this type of films. What makes films that emanate such sadness appeal so much to me? Is that the same reason why people listen to sad songs? Perhaps so. Well, The Fountain isn't your average pessimistic film, it's allegorical, visually lurid, and psychedelic. The film jumps mercilessly from scene to scene, and the overarching climax behind the narrative progresses with an intensity far beyond the fathomable. Hugh Jackman (Tomas) so far-removed from reality he drags the audience with him, on a metaphysical journey remarkably grand and ambitious it tips into abstract thought.<br/><br/>Yet, the themes it rubs on is by nature not a subject matter considered delicate. Death is experienced by everyone but at the same time, it's not. How strange is that? How do you explore a theme that nobody alive has gone through? Hence, it's no grand fault of the film to turn to abstract ideals, it informs the audience that this is something to trifle with. Ideas of life amidst death are contrasting and contradictory. Similarly, the film is contrasting and contradictory if three highly distinct backdrops play side-by-side in the movie yet spelling the same narrative. The film is hard to judge, and take that what you will. It depends on how you as the audience react to the visuals, sounds and story of this movie. It's not easy to swallow.<br/><br/>But I don't want to watch something digestible. If life is so short, I want something to challenge my beliefs, educate my sensations, and strive for the lofty goals. Esoteric, austere and unforgiving. It's a film on tragedy and how we overcome it. As humans, we are fortunate to possess a medium that supports the sharing of ideas. While the idea isn't new, the delivery is one of a kind. If you aren't interested in looking at abstract pictures that resemble the incomprehensible, that's fine. Most people don't. But it's tough to admit that, when gazing at it, that it doesn't offer to your imagination."

","Unfortunately, whether due to lack of sleep or the movie, I fell asleep during part of the movie. Personally, I think I was tired. The closest movie that can be contrasted with this movie is Slaughterhouse-Five (1972) but without the lighter and more action-oriented thrills. This experimental looking, somewhat uneven movie is one of the few widely released fresh and innovative attempts at film-making in years. The ending is consistent with the more esoteric, but quality films. The possible interpretations and the whole look and approach to the theme of life and death is refreshing and bold. Confusing and slow in places, this movie doesn't shy away from its attempt to conceptually and visually fuse the concept of universal holy grail. Possibly an excellent movie, but one that requires a second look, like Solaris. 8/10. After almost 12 years and thanks to VUDU, I was able to see The Fountain for a second time (with ads of course) on my laptop (but with noise-cancelling high-quality Sony headphones) while fully awake. In the interim though, I've come to really enjoy Rachel Weisz as an actress so that I've also developed a personal, emotional bias into liking many movies in which she is in. I would place this movie into the esoteric, imaginatively photographically gorgeous film experience incorporating the universal immortality, morality tale along with infusing the movie with love and life and death themes that can impact the audience on the a deeply emotional level. Oddly enough, this movie doesn't really add much in the way of new material, and yet Darren Aronofsky created a film that is better than its separate movie elements parts and plot points. As to whether, this movie can be considered a major breakthrough movie like a classic, still remains to be seen (as a timeless period of this art media may tell). Reviewed 12/3/2018. 8/10."

What was Hugh Jackman & Rachel Weisz thinking when they read the screenplay for this film? 2. Did the Director give each of them a hit of acid and then handed them the script? 3. Should I give myself a slap for not turning it off after 10 minutes into the film? I know one thing for sure, I refuse to go to the ""message board"" to find any comments about possibly putting this movie into perspective.

The movie tries to lace itself between three corresponding stories and a fourth one overlaid for reflection. It makes no sense whatsoever. If the Director was trying to elude to the circle of life concept; within the picture there were several instances of this symbolism, in case you did not understand the script.

And yes there CAN and be artful ambiguities in a novel or movie, and no, not everything has to be explained -- but there has to be at least some grand narrative link that binds all together. And this film lacks that in spades! Oh, but I suppose the ""meta-narrative"" is simply a pagan idol worshiped by pre-postmodern cavemen. . .<br/><br/>Admittedly, the film has a few visually interesting segments (i.e., the conflict with the Mayans at the film's beginning and the nifty space bubble scenes) but they are flung about without any context. In between, there are tons of artless, grey, slow-talking', mind-bogglingly mundane scenes that beat you over the head repeatedly with some of the most ridiculous bathos you've ever seen.<br/><br/>Just when you think this trash couldn't get any worse, the resolution totally destroys and then reconstructs your conception of trite and uninspired imagery.

If the director of this lousy film is the ""next Kubrick,"" then German crap-artist Uwe Boll is the second coming of Fritz Lang. English-language cinema is far more troubled than I ever imagined. And on another note, I am really distressed to see this film praised as ""a shining example of what science fiction can be."" What an insult to such a wonderful genre! You want good science fiction? Read William Gibson, Jack Vance, Philip Dick, Arthur C. Clark, Robert Heinlein, Ursula K. Leguin, A. E. Van Vogt or countless other great authors! Watch ""Ghost in the Shell,"" ""Blade Runner,"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (but there really aren't very many good Sci-Fi movies, truth be told)!

","There are those will call ""The Fountain"" ""heart-breakingly beautiful,"" or ""exceptional film-making"" or ""absolutely fantastic"" or even an ""outstanding sci-fi drama full of action, suspense and love."" Others will describe it as a confusing, boring, pretentious piece of claptrap that leaves one more confounded after they leave the theater than when they entered.<br/><br/>Put me in the latter category.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie, but like most other films I have had to preview this year, I came away extremely disappointed. To counter one of the above-mentioned descriptions, this picture contains neither science, nor fiction, nor suspense nor love; and it certainly does not contain one iota of action.<br/><br/>And, from director Darren Aronofsky (""Pi,"" ""Requiem for a Dream""), I expected more  a lot more.<br/><br/>Now many smug, self-styled intellectuals  who blur confusion with artistic merit and illiteracy with charm  will chastise me as a Philistine, but I'm not THAT stupid. Call me an idiot, if you will, but I do know what a good, compelling film is. I know what intelligent, quality entertainment is (I mean, my favorite movie is ""The Bicycle Thief,"" after all).<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" is not one of those motion pictures.<br/><br/>To make my point, please allow me to describe what happens, if that's even possible. The movie begins with Hugh Jackman (better known as ""Wolverine,"" playing three roles) as a conquistador trying to find the Tree of Life in South America. He's soon killed by Mayans.<br/><br/>Next we jump to Jackman (better known as ""Wolverine"") made up to look like David Carradine in ""Kung Fu,"" talking to himself and making out with a dead tree inside a snow globe - which is floating through space.<br/><br/>Finally, Jackman (""Wolverine"") is a brain surgeon who tries a new cure (from a South American tree) on a baboon. Conveniently, his wife/girlfriend/lover, Rachel Weisz (Oscar winner for ""The Constant Gardner"") has a brain tumor, too.<br/><br/>It's here that the plot begins to meander like a 757 with a missing tail stabilizer. It goes back and forth from the Spanish Inquisition (nobody expected the Spanish Inquisition, and I didn't, either) to the Hare Kirshna inside the snow globe to current times and back and forth, again and again.<br/><br/>By the way, Weisz also plays Queen Isabella, who sends the conquistador to the New World with a crazed friar to find the tree; while her modern-day alter ego has written a story called ""The Fountain,"" which tells us what is going on in this movie (if that's even conceivable).<br/><br/>Friends, the bottom line message of this film is we are all going to die. Yep, that's basically it; we are eventually all going to shuffle off this mortal coil. I needed 90 minutes of time I'll never recover to tell me something I knew way back in one of my first lives? Yes, the reincarnation theme weaves through this story, as well.<br/><br/>Another problem self-important movies like this have is that no character speaks above a whisper, making it seem like everything they say is of the utmost importance (see ""Lake House"" for the most recent example); it isn't.<br/><br/>Even the Grand Inquisitor (Steven McHattie) speaks in low tones, preaching to tortured prisoners that ""the body is a prison for souls; and Death frees us all."" No kidding. I was praying (just like they probably were) for the sweet release of Death myself several times.Also, Academy Award winner Ellen Burstyn (""Alice Doesn't Live Here, Anymore""), is completely wasted, which is just one of many sins Aronofsky commits.<br/><br/>Still, many will be swept up in the facade and believe they are actually seeing the best movie of all-time. One critic on the Internet Movie Data Base even gushed that ""Hugh Jackman's performance ranks among the greatest male screen performances in cinema history."" Yeah, I guess Jack Nicholson's work in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" or ""Five Easy Pieces""; Robert DeNiro's ""Raging Bull""; Marlon Brando's ""On The Waterfront""; Humphrey Bogart's ""Casablanca"" Al Pacino's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and Jimmy Stewart's ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,"" among many, many, many others, all come in behind Wolverine's portrayal in this movie.<br/><br/>I suppose Aronofsky (who also wrote the story and sceenplay) had a very valid and compelling point for this film; and I'm sure he didn't mean to pull a heavy black curtain over that meaning, obscuring any relevance for the audience. It just sort of happened that way.<br/><br/>A wonderful soundtrack (the Kronos Quartet, the rock band Mogwai and Clint Mansell) and somewhat competent cinematography (Matthew Libatique, ""Phone Booth""), does not make this a great, a near-great or even a good film.<br/><br/>I would tell patrons to skip this one and see ""Bobby,"" instead, but that movie is even worse than ""The Fountain."" Go figure."

With a descent start, a good momentum and/or an interesting story, and a proper ending (hopefully a good ending, but I can settle for a bad ending too, if it's done well). This movie has nothing of that.<br/><br/>Instead, it contains three different stories...and it tries to tell all the stories at the same time, time-hopping between them a lot more than is healthy for any story (or audience, for that matter). The ""expedition story"" is a little interesting but of no real importance to the movie. The ""love story"" is...well, lame and boring (I'm totally okay with love stories, but this one is just bad). And the ""future story"" is just...confusing. Now, piece those stories together and you have 90 minutes of confusing and boring CRAP.<br/><br/>It's beyond me how anyone can actually LIKE this movie, since there's almost nothing GOOD with it!

","""Requiem For a Dream"" was a powerful, shocking and original piece of storytelling, but anyone expecting something similar from ""The Fountain"" on the strength of Aronofsky's earlier project is likely to be astonished at his latest film's ineptitude. In an attempt at epic scale the director has conceived a trilogy spanning light years and millenniums, but none of the three narratives from three different eras possesses a shred of credibility or vitality - and the end result is meaningless blather about the deathless nature of love.<br/><br/>A Conquistador quest set in Inquisition Spain and South America plays like a mash-up of Conan and Underworld. A frantic search for a death-cure in a near contemporary laboratory is a hackneyed Twilight Zone melodrama drowning in tragic sentimentality and bad acting. A metaphysical space odyssey segment resembles a tired Star Trek episode directed by the Brothers Grimm.

","Darren Aronofsky is one of the most original and talented directors of his generation. I'm saying that even though I didn't like his first movie ""Pi"" very much. I could appreciate the visual aesthetics, but the story was just too heavy headed for me to enjoy. The follow-up ""Requiem For A Dream"", however, left me very impressed. It's one of the most shocking movies I ever saw and got me even more interested in this inspired director.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""The Fountain"", penned and directed by Aronofsky, is a bit of a misfire. By now the director has enough loyal fans who will argue passionately that this is a great movie with a lot of depth, but the truth is that there is very little to enjoy here, if you're not forcing a message into it. Aronofsky seems to arbitrarily connect three story lines in ""The Fountain"". There's no proper dramaturgy, everything stays vague, too vague to keep the viewer interested. Aronofsky tries hard to emulate the symbolism of Kubrick, but he fails horribly. Everything is flamboyant: the colors, the acting (with the characters always squeezing out a theatralic tear just as the dialog is supposed to be at its most dramatic), even the music by Clint Mansell, who did such an amazing job for ""Requiem"", but flushes this movie with his overly bombastic score.<br/><br/>In the end ""The Fountain"" is a big, empty and boring mess. Aronofsky is daring and pushing, but he needs to tone down the symbolism in his movies, become less self-indulgent and more straight forward. We'll see what the future brings. Hopefully it's not a meditating bald guy that eats a tree in space."

It's very claustrophobic - the lab, the hospital - there's never a sense of where they are and the outside world.

The version I saw was fairly short anyway at 90 minutes, but even in that there were scenes repeated two, three times over. Taking the three timelines individually - even within them, the scenes did not run chronologically and I cannot see the reasoning behind that.<br/><br/>I would hope a 2nd or 3rd watch of this would enlighten me on how the three Tom's linked each other.

I didn't care for it, but I may watch it again to see if I draw anything from a second viewing. I've seen plenty of intelligent art house flicks that did make me think and that I still love to this day but this is definitely not one of them.

"roland-104","5","4","9","24 December 2006"," Cheesy mysticism and an implausible love story make for mediocrity
","Aronofsky's long awaited third feature is a bloated, ungainly, pretentious excursion to nowhere in particular. The film is billed as a love saga about the same two people (Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz), played out in three stories spanning 1,000 years  past, present and future. That's quite a laugh, since there's plenty of evidence that Jackman's character, Tom, is only capable of self love, pushing his agenda of violence, inattention to his wife, and bullish pursuit of his research, playing by his rules alone.<br/><br/>Tom's misbegotten roamings into time travel, parallel worlds and reincarnation are overwrought and largely incomprehensible, especially scenes from the future story in which Tom sits lotus style alongside a gnarly old tree, inside a giant bubble, floating around outer space among lurid animated montages, as if part of some New Agey detergent ad.<br/><br/>The proceedings in ""Fountain"" recall films like ""The Illustrated Man"" and Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" But those films at least were adapted from works by good storytellers: Ray Bradbury (""Man"") and Arthur C. Clarke (""2001""). Unlike ""Fountain,"" ""Illustrated Man"" is a convincing love story. ""2001"" iswell, I'll resist going off on that tangent for the moment. ""Fountain"" was written by Aronofsky and Ari Handel, and the screenplay is not well constructed. (A graphic comic book version, written by Aronofsky and illustrated by Kent Williams, was in fact spawned by the film.) <br/><br/>Why is it that otherwise sensible people can sometimes be so thoroughly bamboozled by the cheesy, showy varieties of mysticism served up in films like ""Fountain?"" We see this in the enduring cult adoration of Kubrick's film. More recently we saw it again in the acclaim given to ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"", a sophomoric infomercial for a religious cult up in Yelm, Washington. Are we simply curious about the paranormal? Or does our materialistic, overly politicized culture breed a hunger for the spiritual and mystical? Conversations with smart friends who fall for these puffed up films convinces me it is the latter.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's first film, ""Pi"" (1998), was brilliant: the taut, claustrophobic, plausible story of a mathematician's descent into delusion and paranoia. His second feature, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" was messier. An aging woman gets addicted to diet pills trying to become more attractive, while her son and his girlfriend live a heroin junkie life together (in a fashion derivative to earlier, better works like ""Drugstore Cowboy""). Aronofsky's definitely not proceeding in a desirable direction.<br/><br/>The best two things in ""Fountain"" are certainly not the principal actors, whose turns are undistinguished (though Aronofsky favorite Ellen Burstyn does a nice cameo as Tom's research supervisor). Nor is it the high tech, high cost animated montages making up the nebula in which Tom's detergent bubble floats about.<br/><br/>One good thing is a brief, stunning dance scene in one of the flash forwards to the future, when a dark figure makes slow movements against a starlit but otherwise blackened sky. The other is the pock marked, ferocious Mayan Chieftain in 1535 who looks and acts every inch an ancient bigshot. (In English & Maya) My grades: 5/10 (C) (Seen on 12/22/06)"

The style of shooting and usage of match cuts is really top notch. But the reason that it is a shame is because it was a film that, before and during production had many problems. Mainly with finance. Actors were changed frequently, and it went from a $70 million budget to $35 million. It is very understandable that this could shake up the pace and overall flow of the film. Personally, I enjoyed it, I found it challenging and extremely thought provoking. But I feel that, had it been more fortunate during pre-production and production it could have easily been one of the greatest films of the decade.

","The Fountain. Ninety minutes of overly pretentious, pompous nonsense that tries to convince you it is art. Well, it sure does look very nicely filmed and many scenes are very artistic.<br/><br/>Sadly, that is where it also fails the hardest. It's as if so much attention was paid to trying to make it look good that they failed to really do much of anything with such movie staples as plot, script, dialogue etc.<br/><br/>Yes, I know. It IS supposed to be an art piece. But that's the problem. Some movies can be art, but not all art can be a movie. In this case, this is a clear instance of the latter, rather than the former.<br/><br/>The Fountain comes across as directionless and shallow fairly early on. It isn't really anything like so poor, but by the time you are supposed to be thinking hard about what is going on, you've already switched off. Almost nothing is explained with any clarity and, in fact, the whole thing comes across as a self-indulgent mess.<br/><br/>Only the current day section is real, which is what most people miss. The rest are flights of fancy by either Izzy or Tommy. However, this isn't immediately apparent from the movie. I understand that the budget was slashed in half, which can't have done it any favors. A little bit more kindness in the cutting room might have made things a little more obvious, but that isn't what happened. As a result, the entire movie feels disjointed and rushed.<br/><br/>My problem with the film stems entirely from the poor way it is presented to audiences. Most people should simply not watch a movie like this, but, obviously, that does not rake in the dollars for the studios. So the movie was mis-represented prior to release to make it seem appealing to a wider audience. It doesn't, and never will have, mass market appeal.<br/><br/>Does it appeal to me? Not really. I like movies that make you think. Here, however, even I met my limit. It just tries too hard and gives very little back to its audience for their efforts.<br/><br/>At the box office, it failed even with a budget cut. $35 million to produce and only $16 million in worldwide receipts. How this one slipped through test-screening results is anyone's guess, but Aranofsky got away without it damaging his career too badly. I guess Black Swan redeemed him in the eyes of the studios, too, since it had such a massive profit margin. However, I hope he learned something from this film's failure.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Overblown nonsense, too cerebral for most audiences, art masquerading as a film when, in fact, it should have been a film all along. Really a movie for those who want to name drop to make themselves look clever."

","Well what can I say. When I first watched this film, I literally cried almost all the way through. It's a visual phenomenon and deserves far more recognition. It's a story of Tommy trying to cure his wife Izzie who is dying, but we see him in 3 different timelines: the past, the present and the future. I hate to pick favorite but Tommy in the future are the best parts of the film. He is portrayed as an astronaut on the way to Xibalba, the Mayan underworld which is a dying nebula which is shown on such a massive scale as a golden galactic whirlpool. What saddens me about this film is it's message, that death is inevitable. You see, throughout these timelines, Tommy is trying to save whom he loves. In his past, he is a conquistador trying to save his queen Isabel by finding the Tree of Life in a Mayan temple. He drinks from the tree and is buried alive by its roots. In his present, he is experimenting to find a cure, but works so much that he fails to see Izzie enjoying the last pieces of her life, and then she dies before he finds a cure. In his future, he is taking a tree to Xibalba (the tree contains the spirit of Izzie) but the nebula goes into supernova and explodes, killing Tommy; his ashes then fall gracefully onto the tree. The message given in this film is that death is not a cure, death is a curse and a gift and Rachel Weisz highlights the character Izzie with her amazing ability to see past the morbid aspect of death, and sees it as freedom. Izzie is not afraid of death, Tommy is. However, these 3 timelines are all entwined in some parts of the film, for example when he is a conquistador, he appears to the Mayan priest as the astronaut and at the end, when Tommy is burying present Izzie, he picks a fruit from the future tree. It all sounds very complicated, I'm sure but to understand, you have to watch. It's more than a film, it's a masterpiece riddled with Mayan culture, new age special effects and some deeply moving performances from Hugh Jackman as Tommy. The film itself, however, would be nothing without the amazing soundtrack conducted by Clint Mansell, especially in my favorite scene which is the end of the film: Tommy learns what death meant to Izzie, and how he cannot avoid it and so Izzie dies in every timeline in the film. The song is called Death Is The Road To Awe and it's so chilling yet passionate, that I had to look it up. 10 stars. Breath-taking film, highly recommend."
"KnightsofNi11","9","3","6","29 July 2011"," Transcends the medium
","Darren Aronofsky proves his immeasurable talent by making a film like The Fountain. It is such a large departure from what we normally expect from the auteur, and yet the results are still incredible. The Fountain is a film that spans three time periods and one man's quest for eternal youth and love through each time period. It is essentially three parallel stories, spanning one thousand years, that deal with love and death and our fragile existence in this world. The film is something that can only be grasped by watching it and no synopsis could do it justice, so I'll just move on.<br/><br/>The Fountain demands a certain sophistication while watching in order to understand. There isn't much to grab on to and little is explained as the film progresses. You have to keep up with and even interpret events as they occur in order to get the most out of the film. It's a film that is so far out there that I think only Aronofsky himself can fully understand it all, but what we can make out of it is still satisfying to the mind and soul. I was entranced by this film and trying to keep up with it all wasn't a burden, but an adventure that transcended the cinematic medium and pulled me into the film in a way few films are able to do. I was personally mystified and awestruck by this glorious film loving every minute of its bizarre nuances.<br/><br/>However, it really all comes down to the audio visual experience which The Fountain is at heart. The highly original and overwhelming beauty of the film makes it one of a kind and extremely gripping. Clint Mansell scores the film beautifully, as is to be expected from the man who scored the all too memorable Requiem for a Dream theme. But these two elements weave together so perfectly that The Fountain becomes an experience unlike any other. It is something so original and so magnificent that I could hardly take my eyes off the screen. This isn't just a film, it's pure magic in the most glorious and shining fashion imaginable.<br/><br/>It takes some effort to enjoy The Fountain, but if you give the film the benefit of the doubt then things will come together and you will end up with a very satisfying and empowering experience. This is such a strikingly beautiful film that is filled with great moments and moving scenes. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are incredible and they highlight all of the moments where the intense visuals aren't as relevant. If you enjoy bizarre and highly original films then you should love The Fountain. It is a truly astounding film that only some of us can appreciate and fall in love with."

","OK, try to start with a positive: Aronofsky's Fountain was a much better film than Aronofsky's Requiem For A Dream. He always seems to be straddling the line between arty indiscipline and sincere message, and to me usually falling between both points.<br/><br/>Grief-struck surgeon's wife is dying in the present, meanwhile accidentally saves tumour-ridden monkey's life with extract from Tree Of Life, while man and metaphor get mixed up with storyboard inclusions from the past and future. Well made, sometimes messy, but with some astoundingly deft emotional imagery, a laudable refusal to use cgi cartoonery and reasonably believable acting by the main characters played by Jackman and Weisz, it moves swiftly to the confusing finale. And with eye-cutting cinematography. Nearing the various ends you can only hope for the last pieces of the jigsaw, however none are given, but ""everything's OK"" anyway. It's arty all right, but personally true Art has to make some/any kind of sense for an afterlife – this will probably join the heap of stuff that is interesting and gorgeous to look at but ultimately fluffy and superficial. On the comparable thematic level I'd lump it with Buster Keaton's forgotten Three Ages – no one digs that out nowadays, and only dedicated film historians would look up Griffiths' Intolerance. The Spanish story reminded me of a true Art film, Hertzog's Aguirre. It's only going to be a Revelatory Experience for the young, inexperienced, heavy or intoxicated, the rest of us have too many problems. I eagerly compared notes with my daughter - but (thankfully) she was as confused and much less impressed than I was. We're dealing here with a fantasy that strives for authenticity but apparently with Mayans who speak Mayan with English subtitles and with Spaniards who speak English fluently. Those dazzlingly sparkling images of Weisz's full face as the Spanish Queen are the money shots!<br/><br/>I enjoyed it to a point simply because I don't think that there is a point – it's a romance with lots of panache and dignity and very little swearing, sex and violence, which are always bonus points in my unfinished book. I can enjoy a Mars bar without having to know its chemical composition. He's a markedly talented director so I expect Aronofsky will one day eventually make a meaningful movie without trying so hard to be something completely different."

","Leave it to me to love this often trashed film even more than Aronofsky's strong 'Requiem for a Dream' . (and a solid minority of critics went for it too). <br/><br/>Just as experimental as 'Requiem' and 'Pi', but with a more complex, humanistic, metaphysical message. <br/><br/>Here all Aronofsky's visual pyrotechnics (and the film does look amazing) feel like a means to an end not an end in themselves. <br/><br/>A love story that takes place in 3 time frames (the 1500s as a conquistador hunts for the source of life, the 'fountain of youth', the present where the same man, now a scientist tries to find a cure for cancer before his beloved wife dies and 500 years in the future, where the same man again is with his love, who is now a tree, still looking for eternal life. <br/><br/>(possible spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>The fact that the past and future segments are part of a fairy tale book started by the dying woman and finished by the scientist seemed very obvious to me, but seemed to leave a shocking number of critics scratching their heads,confused as to which story is 'real'. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weitz are terrific, and I the score is creative and effective. Ultimately a very moving look at the nature of life and death. Yes there are a few pretentious moments, but I'll take slightly flawed grand ambitions to explore something in a new way over the same old same old every time."
"howard.schumann","10","3","6","22 April 2011"," A meditation on mortality
","""Whenever a profound experience of change is about to take place, its harbinger is the motif of death. This is not particularly mysterious, since it is the limited view and appraisal of oneself that must be outgrown or transformed, and to accomplish transformation, the self image must dissolve.""- Lawrence E. Sullivan<br/><br/>Framed against the background of Mayan culture, its themes connected to the symbol of the Maya sacred tree, Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain conveys a simple message that may only become clear after a second or third viewing - that immortality cannot be won by living forever but is experienced only when one fully embraces death. This is what is meant in the film by Izzi Creo's often repeated refrain ""Finish it."" As author John Major Jenkins put it, ""The message is that the specter of death does not have to breed fear, it invites, rather, a meditation on mortality and a fuller appreciation for life."" <br/><br/>Spanning thousands of years in the relationship between Thomas (Hugh Jackman) and his dying wife Izzy (Rachel Weisz) and wrapped in a complex visual tapestry, The Fountain interweaves three different temporal levels. Along the way, the film looks at the nature of death, the search for enlightenment, and whether our true essence is human or divine. In each story, there is a quest for immortality represented by the symbol of the Tree of Life or the Fountain of Youth, but it is only in the end that the basic truth about death is understood. It is a beautiful work of art that received little appreciation when it first came out but has grown in stature over the years. <br/><br/>Film critic Joseph Belanger (Black Sheep Reviews) expressed the film's message in this way, ""Aronofsky attempts to show in an hour and a half that we as humans are not of our bodies but that the soul, life and love are eternal; that the death of our physical bodies is both a natural and necessary part of what we know as life; that we should neither fear it nor fight it but accept it as peacefully as possible."" The Fountain begins in 16th century Spain where a conquistador, Tomas is sent on a mission by Queen Isabella of Spain to find the Tree of Life in New Spain (South America) in order to stop an inquisitor named Silecio (Stephen McHattie) who is planning a coup against her. <br/><br/>Tomas must fight hostile natives to reach the top of the temple, the high priest telling Tomas that ""death is the road to awe."" In the present day, Tommy Creo is a research doctor who is experimenting on a monkey, using the bark of a South American tree to desperately try to find a cure for his wife who is dying of a brain tumor. Thinking she is going to die soon, Izzi leaves Creo an unfinished manuscript for a book she has been writing called 'The Fountain"" about a conquistador's search for immortality in New Spain. <br/><br/>Because she wants her husband to realize the futility of trying to save her life, she tells him to ""finish it."" Ultimately, Tommy finishes the book with the conquistador dying, completing the cycle of his own life. In the third sequence, Tom is a 26th century Astronaut grieving over the death of his wife. He is traveling in a space bubble as he transports the dying Tree of Life to a distant galaxy that the Mayans identified as Xibalba, the home of the dead awaiting reincarnation. It is a symbol of his acceptance of both his wife's death and his realization that we should not spend our days trying to avoid death, but embrace it as a lover."

","The Fountain is a good example of why, I think, Darren Aronofsky is one of the best directors working in Hollywood today. I guess it was something of a pet project of his. The film doesn't have a clear narrative. Instead it features three stories that tackle the themes of life and death. Russian and Asian influences are evident in these stories. The special effects are spectacular, but the film's greatest strength is the acting. Both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz provide excellent performances. The Fountain is an unusual film so it's not meant to be entertaining. Still, it's an absorbing fantasy drama that shows what cinema is capable of nowadays. Some of the film's scenes are simply stunning. Love is rarely portrayed this well on the big screen. The Fountain already has a cult following because it's one of the most daring films of recent years. I'm thinking that film buffs will enjoy it more than the average moviegoer. I highly recommend The Fountain."

","I don't think it was one of the worst movies ever like some people posted but it was pretty bad. And for those who rush to say ""you didn't get it"" well, I'm sorry guys but I did! Religion is just a s..t load of cr.p to me and the creators of this film tried to make a co-operational s..t load of cr.p. They should have had their facts straight though. Like the fact that there is no ""Shababa"" like the character Tomas said. There is though: Shamballah which is the chief city of the Agharta, mythological land of advanced races and knowledge living at the center of the hollow earth (in Hollow Earth Theosophy); Shambhal is a place where one gets peace and security (hinduism); and also Shambhala which is a mythical kingdom hidden somewhere in Tibet (buddhism). I suppose Thomas and Izzi were (are) hindu and Tom had so much peace and security that he just spelled wrong the name of the place he was going. Moving on.<br/><br/>When Adam and Eve were exiled from heaven it was indeed to keep them away from the tree of life. But in the new testament Jesus said that he came to give us the gift of the previously mentioned tree. Don't ask me the exact quotation, chapter, verse etc, I'm not one of those who actually memorizes this cr.ap and I no longer keep a copy of the bible in my house. I suppose this is the Jewish part of the film (kind of a back door, don't you think?!). In all fairness I should say that christians ignore this message from Jesus as well although, one would think, it's pretty damn important. The franciscans or the catholic inquisition in the film also didn't think it was of any importance as well.<br/><br/>Finally let's analyze how the creators of the film see the tree of life. For the hindu Tom it's his love and a ladder to ""Shababa"". For the scientist Tom it's the source for curing death thus saving Izzi. And for the Spanish Tom it is also the source for eternal life but with a fine print: TREE OF LIFE, DRINK FROM IT AND YOU WILL HAVE IMMORTALITY!!! fine print: immortality as a tree.<br/><br/>Now, I don't believe in religion of any kind and it's not like I don't know anything about it and don't believe. And I can appreciate a good film which has little or more religious fiction using facts as foundation (even if I don't think there are many actual facts when it comes to religion I can accept them as such when they are used to drive a plot- like ""Stigmata"" which is a great film in my opinion). But this film is dumb to its foundation. It just says the same sh.t every religion says: that death is the path to something else. And the reason why this is so incredibly dumb (leaving aside all the false knowledge) is that it replaces things like heaven, another life, Shambhala etc with Shababa and AWE. Are you kiddin' me?!!! A 3/10 from me."

","I rented the movie in DVD cause i watched the very high IMDb rating (7,5 when im writing this), but i had a great disillusion watching it.<br/><br/>First, I do not like the religious-mystic way of the approach to death that movie shows, it is vain and futile. perhaps its cause i am not religious at all, i prefer other movies that talk about death taking other philosophic ways, not with mysticism or idea of eternity (Blade Runner, The Sea Inside, Beguin the Beguine, Hannah and her Sisters...).<br/><br/>And i see that people tend to talk this film as ""sci-fi""... well i think its more a fantasy movie. (if you accept this is part of sci-fi genre, then you would have to call sci-fi Harry Potter films too...) But the film has good things too: for example, acting of Huhg Jackman and Rachel Weisz (i can say she is the Queen Isabel more beautiful that the movies showed us ever).<br/><br/>And there is a very irritating thing that some films as this one tend to do nowdays: the fact of show you, many times during the movie, little ""flashbacks"" of things that have happened or still not happen in the plot... but Don't MEAN ANYTHING AT ALL... i am talking about the fact of repeat the phrase ""finish it"" and mix images of the ""past""(you know, the novel she wrote) and the present. well, it can be a good exercise of screenplay in a videoclip-way, but it don't contribute to the movie plot and say not anything to the audience at all... just shows to you , when you finish the watching, that those pieces didn't mean anything at all... the director was fooling you, and were, as the 80% of the film, completely vain and futile.<br/><br/>P.S.- a film that do not deserves to be watched several times, do not deserves to be watched any time."

The Fountain will wow you with its acting and a story that seems to mature every time you watch it.

It also has great acting, Jackman and Weisz both give great performances as they portray their different characters throughout the film. Another thing that helped me enjoy the film was its direction and pacing. Some directors might have stretched the runtime out longer to make it seem more ""epic"", but I think the shorter length actually helps this movie out a lot. He focuses more on the main characters instead of chasing pointless subplots that just add length. This is an amazing film that hasn't got the credit and attention that it deserves!

He finished her last will to complete her unfinished novel.<br/><br/>In his wife's unfinished novel, She was the ancient Queen of Spain and he was her most loyal fighter, he was assigned to find the immortal tree for her but finished by becoming the green grass and melting into the ground around the tree.<br/><br/>In another unknown space and time, he was an abbe with piety, he accompanied with the immortal tree and they were in a flying bubble which aimed to the dying star to pursue immortality. And in the end the tree diminished while he realized the insight of eternity.<br/><br/>The storyline seems simple but difficult to have apperception of the symbolic and metaphorical notion especially for the third story. It's a way too big proposition, it's nearly beyond the essence of life and death, it questions the whole universe of entity. This film needs to be watched several times and we will gain different comprehension each time.

It doesn't hold your hand with bland exposition and it doesn't give you all the pieces of the puzzle so you can neatly fit them altogether and go away with answers to all your questions.<br/><br/>What it does give you though is a deep and thought provoking experience surrounding the issues of mortality and how we deal with it. There were a lot of things in this movie that I didn't really understand but it managed to touch me at a level I can't quite define. Like 2001:A Space Odyssey I think there were parts of this film that were deliberately left ambiguous in order to give the story some mystery and wonder.<br/><br/>The cinematography was absolutely beautiful as well and I can't believe the movie was made for $35m dollars, it looks far more expensive.<br/><br/>It has to be said that the acting across the board was exceptional too with Hugh Jackman being of particular note although I really can't take Ethan Suplee seriously in the kind of role he had after seeing him in My Name is Earl but thankfully his part isn't too distracting.<br/><br/>I don't think Brad Pitt would have done half the job Hugh Jackman did in this movie. I heard he left because of creative differences and I can imagine Aronofsky saying ""Look Brad this is my movie, I'm gonna do it my way, if you don't like it then f**k off."" and Brad being the ego his is couldn't let someone else have control so left, the big wuss. Well our gain since I think ""The Fountain - The Brad Pitt cut"" would have been crap quite frankly."
"sjeng","2","3","6","9 April 2007"," overrated & pretentious but great visuals and score.
","Consider first the rather daunting tagline of 3 parallel stories spanning 1000 years, life/death/love/spirituality...neatly packed into a 90min film. A tall order indeed, and yes the visuals are amazing and the score is superb. If you've ever watched MirrorMask(2005), its like that, pretty amazing. I can definitely appreciate the huge amount of work it must have taken to make this film, and that said... <br/><br/>The story however, is where the movie falls short. The plot here is rather rushed, convoluted, and at times, incredibly repetitive. DoubleDare you to count the number of times you hear/see a line/scene recycled. Sure the characters emote & acting is fine, but since little is done to introduce or develop them, the viewer struggles to care why. If you would humor me for a sec to imagine Kung Fu (Carradine), Resident Evil(the 'science'), Stargate (sci-fi/indigenous peoples), and the Da Vinci Code (religion, overrated) mashed up together into a whiny moaning cryfest, you have a basic idea of what to expect for 'The Fountain"". As for being a deep film, its about a thought-provoking metaphysical awakening as 'Kung Fu, The Legend Continues'. Definitely nowhere close to the stunningly depressing masterwork of Requiem for a Dream. alternatives I'd rec for sci-fi/fantasy fans: Pan's Labyrinth, City of Lost Children, Ghost in the Shell, Miyazaki/Amenabar films.<br/><br/>For a parallel to the most recycled scene in, 'The Fountain"" see 1986 Eddie Murphy flick ""The Golden Child""."

","Darren Aronofsky has always been a little weird, his directorial debut µ was a crazed black and white drug filled trip through the mind of a mad scientist and no less weird but a tad more mainstream was the equally trippy Requiem for a Dream, well he's done it again and he is here to baffle us once more with the fountain. It's a film about a book that is the film and the book; oh forget it I can see I'm losing you already. Lets just say it's a very messed up love story that spans a thousand years and the universe and involves living forever but eventually dieing, am I making sense? Well the film hardly does either. Visually it is stunning as we fly through space and visit dieing stars, jumping backwards and forwards in our pursuit of answers to death, disease and eternal love, it all looks very pretty indeed its just that doesn't really help us understand it anymore. Science, fantasy, Mayan pyramids, yoga it all sounds a bit like Tom Cruise's belief system and yes at times it is that bizarre and just when you think there's going to be a revel or you've kind of got a handle on what the hells going off whoosh it spins of again into eating trees and self tattooing all while having flashback from several periods in history that are miles apart, am I losing you again? You see the thing is The Fountain is one of those films that you have to submerge yourself in; you have to live with it, feel it, and even become it. The first half of this review was written by me straight after seeing the film, this bit is nearly two weeks later and the film has taken that long to sink in, to imbed itself in my brain, it is a complex beast and one you will need time to tame. If people aren't getting it I guess they don't want to or its too much effort, where's the explosions and car chases? What is being presented here is a film with intelligence and a challenge to the audience if you go with it you will be rewarded if you don't you will miss out on one the most amazing cinematic experiences you could possibly have. I for one need to see it many more times to really appreciate its ultimate beauty. I have heard it being compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey and that is maybe stretching it but I can tell you it's not far off. A time spanning timeless masterpiece of modern cinema, a shame that people will probably not start getting it for years to come."

","This is a tragically flawed film, and one of the key criteria of successful dramatic arcs is not respected, i.e., 'make me care for the characters'. Well shot, well acted, with splendid production values, all lost in an incomprehensible mishmash of New Ager mushiness that goes absolutely nowhere. The letdown is immense. Culprit: the third set (future), and ultimate plot resolution, which is so abjectly corny as to register among the highest on the wince scale this year. It painfully jars the mind out of all suspension of disbelief, alas. So strained and far-fetched as to nullify the whole movie. Definitely three gobble-gobbles."
"tobi-45","2","3","6","6 January 2007"," Superficial
","The film aims to go deep into philosophical and ethical questions, but has somewhat the problem of some Prokofjew operas: It has no peaks at all.<br/><br/>It is a really a good piece of art in terms of visual effects, just like the film music is really great. But the message that the film delivers is clear within the first two chapters. A love beyond all boundaries, questioning the meaning of life and dead, a struggle for sense illuminated from religion, philosophy, ethics and science.<br/><br/>Good idea, but why does the film have to pay tribute to so many things in such a superficial way, and why are there no changes in the general mood of the film? It's the same atmosphere while conquering the tree of life and during the burial. No contrast, everything smooth and silk.<br/><br/>It leads to some fantasy-religion-scifi cocktail that was really, well: boring. On top the film needlessly repeats many scenes, I started to feel I was took for a fool when I was shown flashbacks to earlier scenes where it was obvious why sth. has to happen at this point, not to mention scenes that brimmed over with pathos. <br/><br/>The beginning of the film suggests it could lead into a really nice multi-layered plot, but actually the hidden layers are revealed too early such that the viewer does not even get the chance to think on his own, you get everything served on a silver tablet.<br/><br/>You may also like this film if you like the funny visualization stuff that a certain media player offers while playing music.<br/><br/>Of course this reflects my personal impressions of the film, but it is certainly a film capable to divide the audience."
"brodie_kashmir","9","3","6","31 December 2006"," A visual experience unlike no other
","Modern science fiction has been greatly influenced by George Lucas. It's become this big grand production of epic proportions. New age auteur Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream) has dared to scale back the genre, falling more in tune with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Oddity, making The Fountain, starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz one of the more intriguing sci-fi films in recent years.<br/><br/>The base story of The Fountain is about Tommy and Izzy Creo (Jackman and Weisz, respectively). Tommy is a contemporary research scientist trying to figure out the cure for cancer, which his wife Izzy has. He believes he has found it in an ancient Central American tree. Meanwhile Izzy is finishing her novel set in 1500 Spain about Queen Isabel, who sends Conquistador Tomas on a mission to find the tree of life in New Spain (Central America). The third portion of the story is set in 2500, where Tommy has lived for the past 500 and is waiting for the tree to enter a nebula and be destroyed.<br/><br/>I could spend the entire review trying to explain the plot, but it's too intricate to do so. Jackman is still trying to prove his worth and talent as an actor to the general film going public, and after this and The Prestige from earlier this year, I don't think he has anything left to prove. He's a very capable actor, and his scenes as present day Tommy were some of the most touching I've ever seen in a sci-fi film. Weisz continues to push herself as an actress, taking on challenging or different roles than what she could take, and thus stretching her dramatic range, making her that much more appealing as an actress.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is of the new generation of film-making, the millennial generation. Where Kevin Smith, Quentin Tarantino and David Fincher led the pack in the 90's, Aronofsky is in the company of Christopher Nolan and Richard Kelly on the front lines of 21st century film-making. He retools a genre that's become known for being bombastic, goofy and out there. He evokes drama and emotion from the genre and it's simply moving. I can't wait to see more of his work The primary reason Aronofsky is so engaging as a filmmaker is his visual style. It's not enough for him to present a beautiful and wondrous tale; he does so in a beautiful and wondrous way. The scenes set in the future take place in space in this sort of, bubble. The tree and some of the surrounding earth is floating in a bubble towards the nebula that was believed by the Mayans to be the afterlife. It's one of the most beautiful effects created. The Queens palace in the 1500 set scenes is just as stunning. The room was lit by an amazing series of suspended candles, and it provides some of the most aesthetically pleasing visuals I've seen all year.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's gift for making an intriguing web of a film is a curse upon his talent that sometimes he gets so far into his own world that he forgets that the audience isn't inside his head with him. The futuristic scenes aren't made clear in their narrative intentions till about halfway through the film, confounding the audience to their impact on the story. But it's a treat to look at, so you almost don't even mind.<br/><br/>It's a welcome step outside the generic mainstream, which I can only assume is Aronofsky's intention."

Yes it's esoteric and difficult......thank you Jesus! Not another damn spoon fed concept. Difficult is good, that means you get to watch it again in order to sort things out. It's a masterpiece because it is bizarre yet you will be suspended from disbelief enough to become immersed.<br/><br/>Now if it were longer I would have gone 10 stars, but then maybe I'm greedy. On the other hand, this film had tight editing which logically leads me to think that the director could have fluffed it up to lengthen it. Perhaps you could compare the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To me LOTR seemed excessively fluffed in that the edits weren't fast enough for my tastes.<br/><br/>By the way, don't waste your time with a cheap, *ahem*...copy; obtain the DVD in order to get the genuine sound quality and the difficult to reproduce dark qualities of this uncompromising cinematographic gem ."

","Tom is devoted to finding a cure / the tree for Izzie, but is that truly what he wants or what she wants for that mater? I don't really think so. In fact, I don't think either of them really cared all that much about each other at all. <br/><br/>They try to portray this movie as some kind of love story, but let's look at the facts. Tom spend all his time away from Izzie in the past and present, while in the future his ""love"" is nothing more then tree. A tree that is suppose to allow you to live forever and dies. Which leads me to believe that this whole story is actually about selfishness.<br/><br/>The plot may be complex for ""The Fountain,"" but the story itself sucks. Explosion, martial arts, and gun fights may be the norm, but just because there in the movie doesn't mean there is no plot.

","For a film that had such potential, what a complete disappointment! Aronofsky had it all, Oscar-caliber actors, incredible direction, beautiful sets and a cinematographer to die for...He had everything but a plot. ""The Fountain"" certainly had the build up -- for two hours, yet it never delivered. There was never a connection. It was completely incoherent, plot points SELDOM connected and when they did, it was anti-climatic, pointless drivel. Such a shame. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weiss both gave superb performances, and the images were like works of art. Yet, I cannot remember the last time I almost walked out of a movie...until last night. I know there are those who will say the plot was SO deep that many people can't understand it. I could not disagree more. The premise was easy to follow, and a good idea, but this movie TRIED to be ""Brilliant"", instead of just letting it happen Aronofsky tried to force it, and failed. I can understand now why this movie faced such hardships in getting produced. It was unremarkable in the worst way. Don't waste your money on ""The Fountain"", but more importantly, don't waste your time. For, as the movie reminds us, time is something we have little of to spare."

He just isn't sobbing for the movie, it seems like the scenes are real....which means that's good acting.lol. The concept of the movie is amazing too. Some parts of the movie are ambiguous and open for interpretation. Even if you don't get those parts of the movie though the main story line is very easy to grasp and awesome.

First of all , there is no hip hop montage , so its a totally different tone . Second the narrative structure is not straightforward and it is probably the reason this movie received bad reviews . But the emotions you feel during that movie are incredible . To me , it felt as if someone was reading me a poem and the images were the visual representations in my mind . Clint mansel did an amasing job in scoring the music for the film with the Kronos quartet(same team than from requiem for a dream) . If you love cinema in general and have liked other films than james bond or rob Schneider movies , go see it , its one rare masterpiece that really is worth your ten dollars , otherwise , go see borat or something else .

"cbode","10","3","6","26 November 2006"," The Fountain Is A Work Of Art In Every Sense Of The Word
","The Fountain, with the tag line, ""What if you could live forever?"" stars Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz and the incomparable Ellen Burstyn and is directed by Rachel's brilliant husband Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For A Dream). This absolute MUST SEE is now playing in Kingston, Ontario at The Screening Room. The Fountain is a Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Drama that is ultimately about the power of everlasting love  the film takes place over the course of 1,000 years within three parallel stories  but is also about life, death, life after death and the quest for the Fountain of Youth. It's intelligent, full of spiritual symbolism, visually stunning and emotionally devastating. You won't stop thinking about it for days.<br/><br/>The immensely talented and handsome Aussie, Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Someone Like You, Swordfish, Kate & Leopold, Scoop, The Prestige), who has been in no less than six films this year, has never acted better. He made me cry with his performance as a doctor/scientist who is obsessed with finding a cure for death because his beloved wife is dying of a brain tumour. Hugh, in his triple roles as Tomas, Tommy and Tom Creo, was intense, heart wrenching and utterly believable and Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz (Best Supporting Actress for The Constant Gardener) nothing short of subtle perfection. This profound film is laden with luscious special effects and glimmering gold, black and white colours but never for a moment loses its heart and humanity. I will not give away too much about The Fountain because it's one of those movies that you just have to see and more than once at that. It's a work of art in every sense of the word."

","Those for whom eastern philosophy is a part of their world view will find the concepts of this movie to be simple (perhaps simplistic) and familiar. Those who feel science has the potential to significantly prolong life or even defy death, may be annoyed. <br/><br/>This film does address our aversion to terminal illness and death itself. Past lives, dharma, alternate realities, death as a necessity for life, Christianity, Buddhism, New Ageism, are all here.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is in its images and color, the weaving of different realities and times into one fabric. Textures are used to visually illustrate the feeling of the characters. There is a continuity of the candles of a Renaissance throne room being as the stars of heaven; a nebula as the neural network inside the brain. <br/><br/>There is the perpetual juxtaposition of differing religious/scientific viewpoints. Overall a satisfying film. Is it like 2001: A Space Odyssey? The comparison is too glib and I, personally, would say no. This film is not about existential angst and the isolation of man; it is about death being an integral and beautiful part of life. Eastern philosophy has overcome the fear of hell and the hope of heaven and become mainstream."

A great tale. Anyone who has a great imagination can easily fall in love with this movie on the special effects alone. But as for the story it seems as though it was side tracked at some point, I personally thought the whole idea of the story was absolutely amazing, as for its presentation i wasn't too impressed. It seems as though the idea ran off the tracks towards the end of the movie, Some would take it as 3 separate reincarnations, I took it as more of them writing the past and the future, and all that was real was the present, because otherwise the star in the nebula dieing would make no sense what so ever, as it takes time for light to reach earth and it would've died long before they saw it die on earth, and not 500 years in the future. Overall I loved the movie though and hope that We can see more like this in the following years."

I consider myself to be fairly able to pick up on nuances and threads...but there wasn't much to connect any of the 3 stories. If it was about reincarnation...what's the point...since they didn't realize they were intertwined souls. If he was the immortal...that never came out, and obviously she wasn't. There was a great premise here...but as usual with ""art films"" someone from the real world should have been in the process. Was it Buddhist? Kaballah? Existential? Mayan? Christian?

","""The Fountain"" is unlike any other film ever made. When a director takes this many chances, he is going to alienate a lot of people. But if you want to see something original, this is the film to see.<br/><br/>If you have seen the other films of Darren Aronofsky, you know he never does anything halfway. This is a film of excesses and vision. If the story makes any sense at all, it is a bonus. If ""The Fountain"" is actually coherent, you will need to use your imagination.<br/><br/>In some ways, this is Aronofsky's most assessable film because it is about undying love. On the other hand, it is not linear and could lose a lot of people. The ending is open to interpretation and a lot of people are just not going to get it.<br/><br/>Performances and photography are great. Visually it reminds me of the David Lynch version of ""Dune."" The music was okay but could have been better. The film would have been better if they had gotten Phillip Glass.<br/><br/>I question the studio's decision to release this in wide release during the Fall holiday season. This is clearly not a movie for the masses. This film really belongs in the art houses.<br/><br/>If you like experimental cinema, you are likely to embrace ""The Fountain.""

"MovieMates","10","3","6","25 November 2006"," intriguing, rewarding, & profound!
","The Fountain is a wonderful inspiration, and not so perplexing once the segments become clear to the viewer. Despite the initial impression that we are jumping between different time periods (as per the book), it makes more sense to accept that the action actually ALL takes place in the Present. All of the years of 'incarnations' tattooed on Doctor Tom's arms are best depicted as his long spiritual journey to peace with himself and with death. <br/><br/>Doctor Tom, a researcher, is in a frantic pursuit to find a cure for brain tumors before his wife dies from hers. His inspirations, ideas and dreams are made into tangible, fully dimensional creations for us. His scientific work is occurring in the Present, as is his coming to terms with the outcome. The inspiration and ideas appear to be in the Future, yet they are as our own spiritual dimensions might be visually displayed if they were to be unveiled at varying moments in our day-to-day lives. His spirit is maturing through the trials that are his Life. <br/><br/>What at first appears to be the Past, or even a ""previous incarnation"" are, as we come to see, the book his wife is writing, about the hope and eventual triumph they both will come to have experienced. Yet while we think the movie is about her, it is really her writing about him. It is his fight for her Life, torment, Grief (amazing visual portrayals here, without words) and ultimate Salvation. Even the music is a subtle metronome of time: heartbeats, time ticking <br/><br/>AND he is experiencing regret and guilt regarding how he had not spent his Time in the Present with his wife. As many cancer patients are trained today, visual imagery can be a powerful tool in helping to battle and HOPEfully overcome a diseaseShe writes a book. She has come to Peace in her Journey; only her 'Conquistador' can write the ending on this one. This book represents the Past for Dr. Tom; this is where he has come from spiritually on his journey. <br/><br/>Allusions and symbols abound: the Inquisition, conquistadors, the Tree of Life (also symbolized by the Catholic Eucharistic vessel ), reincarnation, and even a Hugh Jackman that in once instance bears a striking resemblance to Jesus down to the spear in his side, and in another appears as an Eastern holy man. There is a direct visual parallel between living with a brain tumor and a beautiful nebula (a dying yet gloriously Living star); The uplifting (literally!) visualizations incorporate both the Western Christian and Eastern religions as a holistically, universal part of each of us, even though we, in our own Journey, may not ""have eyes to see"" yet. <br/><br/>Dr. Tom finally comes full circle in his Journey when he finally 'finishes' the book his wife began; he learns to accept the inevitability of death, and thereby becomes able to live. Even if you are not familiar with the Bible or Eastern philosophy, you too can find Inspiration here."

It is cinematic excellence with its imagery, both visual and thematic, its cinematography and its inventive camera angles, shot sequences, and unique editing, its mesmerizing soundtrack full of classical but updated melody, its acting prowess: Hugh Jackman delivers an Academy Award winning performance as far as I can see, and Rachel Weisz is fantastic and incredibly believable. Most importantly, The Fountain is the vision of a true auteur director in the model of Stanley Kubrick himself. Aronofsky not only directs, but also has such a huge influence on the score and editing, and is responsible for writing these stories for the screen.<br/><br/>But that's merely what make it a cinematic masterpiece, its story is an incredible blend of culture, philosophy, technology and science, and religion. But in line with what it means, for me, to be a great film, the story illuminates a variety of possible interpretations and hidden metaphors. This film, succinctly, is the magnum opus of a genius who might only be leaving us glimpses of his future potential. Truly, Death is the road to Awe."

Granted to those previous reviewers who warned that there are definitely spatial displacements in the time line of this story, the film is substantially over before a viewer can understand the esoteric opening introductory clips which are united with the closure. Rather than concentrate on cosmic special effects, the filmmakers should have attempted to produce a film with better clarity to the story line.

It's epic non-linear narrative spans the centuries with Hugh Jackman delivering an absolutely unforgettable performance as Tomas, a Spanish Conquistador in the 16th century who pledges his loyalty to Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz) to find the mythical Tree of Life so that Spain will hold the key to the Fourth Paradise, Immortality, denounced as heresy by the Grand Inquisitor. Tomas' quest is interleaved between three converging narratives across time and space. As a modern-day neurosurgeon, Tomas struggles to find a cure for a tumorous disease that threatens the mortality of his beloved wife Izzi who is writing a fable called ""The Fountain"" chronicling the odyssey of their 16th century quest which can be interpreted as either a fictitious or biographical account of Tomas and Izzi's lives who have endured the centuries together or simply as mythical characterizations of Izzi's unfinished allegorical manuscript representing her husband's obsessive quest to find a cure for her terminal ailment that she has left for him to finish (the past representing Izzi's tale and the future representing Tomas' as he struggles to ""finish it"") both of which could be argued with equal measure. One of the beauties of The Fountain is its open-ended narrative construct left to speculation and interpretation and can be viewed from an entirely different perspective with each consecutive viewing. Tomas' quest ultimately takes him to the distant 26th century where he has projected himself and the dying Tree of Life across the great void of space in a transcendental bubble to reach Xilbalba, the name of the Mayan underworld given to a dying nebula the brings the creation of new life from the wake of its destruction like the yin and yang of the cosmos and beyond the confines of this mortal coil. ""Our bodies are prisons for our souls. All flesh decays... death turns all to ash. And thus, death frees every soul... "" <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's poetic film blossoms with rich cultural, biblical, mythical and spiritual imagery that speak the common language spoken by all religions and cultures that have asked the boldest philosophical questions about our place in the universe since time immemorial. For anyone who has ever looked to the heavens and stared in the face of mortality and beyond, The Fountain holds all of the answers to life like an epiphany raditing from the heavens. Drink from The Fountain and achieve the knowledge of truth and spiritual enlightenment on the road to Awe. One of the truly great cinematic masterpieces of this century and last, The Fountain will transcend the test of time and eternity."

","I had to view the The Fountain twice, because after a first viewing it was haunting my mind, and knew it would drive me crazy if I had to wait for the DVD release. I have decided it is brilliant in concept and in visual execution but flawed, in the sense of being so ambitious it comes apart at the seams. I can see that Aronofksy is melding many different elements and ideas here, even if the fit is awkward at times. At least there are real ideas, and a real aesthetic vision, which is more than I can say for 95% of the commercial garbage out there. <br/><br/>I think people have gotten it wrong in interpreting the message as some new age mumbo-jumbo. Certainly it is drawing from mythological sources, but the real meanings seem to lie more in the universals of love versus obsession, the struggle with mortality and the incomprehensibility of death. Then again, I am of the belief that spirituality has to do with the formation of meaning and needn't imply anything supernatural. And why should an empirical viewpoint preclude us from indulging in fantasy and allegory, especially at the service of exploring those things which make us human? As ridiculous as complaining that The Lord of the Rings is unrealistic.<br/><br/>I grant that it is not the kind of thing easily palatable to mainstream audiences, that people primarily see movies to be told a story and be entertained, not to view a piece of visual art or be required to (gasp!) think. While those are perfectly legitimate, and I also see most movies for the same reasons, the ones that really stick with me are, like The Fountain, ambiguous, disorienting, and even absurd on first viewing. But if I challenge myself to give them another look, they open up new possibilities to me. On the level of plot this film is extremely simple, even simplistic (even if the way it is told is extremely nonlinear and convoluted), yet on the level of interpretation it is multi-faceted, though I fear few will bother with that. Aronofsky took some serious risks here and such are the consequences of daring to follow one's own vision.<br/><br/>This is another example of why I hate film criticism (and the same goes for any other medium), because it prejudices people's perception before seeing something for themselves. I say when viewing this film try to forget everything anyone has said. You may love it, you may hate it, but neither of those reactions is right or wrong. This is art, not hard science."

","I totally agree with the last comment. The cinematography is truly splendid, full of golden dust-scattered stars and other such metaphors. I cried three times watching it; there was so much beauty and sadness. Most people are not going to get it. I overheard some ladies in our audience discussing 'The Fountain' afterward, and they clearly needed certain elements of the movie shoved down their throats. Thank goodness that Aronofsky does not do just that. Just to reiterate, the movie is indeed difficult, and because of this will undoubtedly be under appreciated for years. But if you come in with an open mind and quite uncertain what to expect, great things will occur."
"Schism462","10","3","6","23 November 2006"," The best film of the decade
","My friends. I had the extreme honor to go see The Fountain yesterday evening. Silence, Beauty, and Intelligence have all returned to the movies with this film. Everything that I admire about films was realized with this film. I didn't think that could be possible in this age of movies. Especially one produced by a major studio, but it has been done and done well. Let us start with the core element of any movie, the story. I wont give anything away so don't worry. The story is about ideas. Love, Death, Life are all central to the story. The ideas are presented straight forward but the nature of them makes them hard to swallow. The story was not boring or too brainy. There is action, love and intelligent scenes throughout. You want to know what is going to happen to these characters. The characters themselves are believable and the performances some of the best I've ever seen. Visually the film is the greatest achievement of the year and quite possibly the Decade. Every shot seem like it could have been a painting in a fine art museum, something that has not been achieved since Kubrick's Eyes wide Shut. Finding out that there were only 87 shots that were worked on by a computer is astounding. The use of the microscope slides for everything else blows me away. The music is top notch. The score was performed by Mogwai, one of the premier ambient bands in the world. If you like music from, Explosions in the sky, Godspeed you! Black Emperor and A Silver Mt. Zion, then you will love the music. Silence is also important to the film. There are long stretches of film where all there is no dialog, but just the ideas and events before our eyes. Please go see this and be amazed. Lovers of fine film will adore it. The average movie goer will not be able to deal with the film. It is not typical. It is extraordinary and The Fountain gives me hope for the future of movies"
"ajw323","10","3","6","23 November 2006"," An Intelligent Film, A Masterpiece
","I have read through the assortment of comments and I have to be brutally honest in saying: most of them are perfect examples of the mainstream mind. So sorry if that offends anyone, but I do believe that most reviewers have neither the emotional stamina nor the intellectual capacity to thoroughly understand and enjoy Darren Aronofsky's film.<br/><br/>I have been waiting for nearly two years to see this film, suffering through endless uncertainty concerning script, actors, budget, release dates, and after seeing the film finally I will admit it is one of the most beautifully poignant films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I believe that Jackman and Weisz are much better choices for leads than Pitt and Blanchett. Jackman's intense, extremely personal acting made the character of Thomas believable: the pain you see in his eyes is essential to connecting with his 'eternal' struggle to save the love of his 'lives' Izzy, played by Weisz, who's acting is also another picture-perfect example of poised understatement. Their fragility is effortless and they impart a humanity to the characters that makes them immortal and almost iconic.<br/><br/>This film contains a certain serenity that will completely go over the heads of most viewers. The ability to truly connect with someone and to love them throughout eternity is a rare one and Aronofsky puts forth an interesting example of how two people can live and love forever. We are expected to immerse ourselves into their love and I believe that might be one of the most contentious parts of this film seeing as how the majority of people have not and most likely never will be loved in such a manner.<br/><br/>I will wrap this up by saying Clint Mansell's score with some help from The Kronos Quartet was almost like a third lead actor. The desperation emanating from Jackman's Thomas was translated into a steady stream of muted yet at the same time, brilliant music. The film effects (which are not CGI by the way) are utterly metaphysical and they carry that certain touch of eternity that Arnofsky was aiming for.<br/><br/>If you can release your inhibitions and clear your mind of the expected, this film will be a breath of piercingly fresh air. And if you want fast action, pointless bloodshed, ridiculous sex scenes and reworked dialogue from a thousand other mainstream films, go see something else and leave the intelligent films to those who appreciate them.<br/><br/>Cheers to Aronofsky for breaking the mold and making cinema worthy of the title 'art'."
"pham121","10","3","6","23 November 2006"," Truly, A Painting In Motion
","The Fountain (2006) directed by Darren Aronofsky is by far the most captivating, soul capturing, enigmatic movie of the year. For my friend and I that watched the movie together, the fantasy was too close to realism. The lessons that Tom (Hugh Jackman) went through with Izzy (Rachel Weisz) was painstakingly real. As presented in the trailer, three parallel stories intertwined with each other presenting innumerous metaphors and symbolisms. Once the story starts to slowly unravel, you are left with many questions in your head. For me, the questions still serve as an inspirational mystery that sustains the essence of the movie. If I say too much, then the peculiar depths of this movie will be ruined. Go see this movie with an open-mind, and leave a better person.<br/><br/>Before watching The Fountain, my expectation of this movie was another Sci-Fi quest for knowledge, but the fragility of humanity presented in this movie has shattered my perspective. Portrayed by a desperate conquistador (Huge Jackman), and his beloved other-half (Rachel Weisz), you will see what great lengths of love they will cover (all depending on the vision you saw). If you appreciate life, go watch this fully elliptical ""painting in motion."" As for me, it is a movie I am destined to watch more than once. The cinematography, visual effects, and organic feel has taken my breath away. I waited a gruesome three months for this movie to come out (four years, but I have recently been endowed ever since the trailer), and once it came out, I was not disappointed at all, even to the last expectation.<br/><br/>If you read my whole review, then you should watch The Fountain, then you will know my true perception of beauty, and this movie is it. Might I remind you that this movie is not for every audience. As confusing as it may seem (which in fact it is), you should thank Hollywood that this is not your ordinary clichÃ© movie. And with no further a due, I leave you with the film: the 1500ad, the current, and the 2500ad, enjoy it.<br/><br/>*** Truly deserved, 10 out of 10, the first ever in my life."

","The fountain simply does two things that no other movie in history has done.... 1. Break new ground by talking about life...and how people perceive it. and 2. Mix a sci-fi like future with the present and past...and done quite well.<br/><br/>I know that The Fountain is one of those movies you will either like or hate, but the reason people are going to hate this movie is one reason: Understanding it. This is not one of those straight forward movies that doesn't require a lot of thought. If your looking for that, go watch Bond or something... This is a movie about life and how we as humans go about trying to understand it when it hits the stage of death. Now, I have to say that Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weis were INCREDIBLE! They really feel like lovers, so you respond to what happens to them since they are so....human. All I have to say is this: If you want to watch the best movie of 2006, and your ready to try something different, go watch this movie ASAP!"

Both give great performances that make the movie the great film it is, even though the story goes far out there at times. Their passion is the reason you go for this film and what passion it is.

"TheLester","7","3","6","22 November 2006"," Three plots are one, the path to eternal life
","+Cinematography 9/10 +Acting 8/10 +&- story & editing 6.5/10<br/><br/>I watched ""The Fountain"" at a free screening yesterday in the local theatre, so I almost feel the obligation to write something about it, and do my part.<br/><br/>Not spoiling the plot here is quite easy, as the film does, as is the intention of its authors, make you think, and experience--there is much to talk about. The plot itself is quite simple, but the message is complicated. I'll try to recap my thoughts on the film the way I thought about it when I left the theatre yesterday.<br/><br/>My first thought: truly beautiful cinematography. This film really had some wonderful scenes and compositions, great (absolutely great) lighting, good effects. These were luckily not too overdone, perhaps a bit towards the end, but the film did stay true to it's intention of separating itself from the bulk of Hollywood(esquire) films these days. This section gets a 9/10 from me, and should be enough for you to make a trip to the flea-pit.<br/><br/>Then, acting: surprisingly good. Surprising, as I haven't seen too many films starring Jackman and Weisz. These leads were very good, solid actors in this film and really drove the storyline ahead. Thank goodness Brad Pitt was not chosen for Jackman's role. Not that I am a Pitt-hater, however he would have stolen the show, and taken the focus away from what should be paramount: the film. Ellen Burstyn was an amazing supporting actress, and as far as I am concerned should get some award for that (I won't call Oscars, etc., but something should be in for her). 8/10 for acting<br/><br/>The story & editing: This is where it gets a bit iffy, and one rating for this section does not really do it justice, but I'll go for it anyway for the sake of simplicity. As the story is layered, it is always interesting to see how the director handles it, and how the authors push it forward. I would say that through roughly the first half of the film they were very successful in doing so, as this viewer is taken through a mildly-tempoed plot, where s/he really gets the feel for the actors and the cinematography. While the storyline does become clear quite fast, it is not intrusive. As this film has three plots (which are all one, see it to understand), it became rushed towards the end, as they are brought together. I am an advocate for making long films if the plot demands it to be so, and this one to me could have gone on for another hour easily without losing its viewers. <br/><br/>Due to the not so strong second half of the film, only 6.5/10 for this part.<br/><br/>The message of the film is an interesting one, and this is where I think the 'controversy' comes from. I personally do not think this is a 'love-or-hate' film, but you be the judge. I'll have to go see this one again to understand it fully, and before making up my mind on the final rating. For now ""The Fountain"" gets a <br/><br/>7/10"
"mrutherford-3","10","3","6","17 October 2006"," Outstanding
","I echo the kudos in other comments to the nth degree. A little trim here and there might have held a less enamored audience, but I was so drawn in that this didn't occur to me until a friend made note.<br/><br/>Here's another viewpoint for those who have seen The Fountain. Consider the idea of this being three worlds, two perspectives, and one man's enlightenment. <br/><br/>I'm reading comment after comment about their love ""trancending space and time"". It seems the consensus is that this is a story of two people or souls living the same love and loss in the past, present and future.<br/><br/>However, to my mind, this is exclusively his story. Their deep love is the catalyst for his journey. His wife has already come to the end of hers, as evidenced by her acceptance. His denial leaves him alone in with his grief. <br/><br/>The three worlds we experience are comprised of: 1) his reality (The grim truth as told from the outside. That his immense love for his wife leads to obsession - which causes him to neglect her in her final days.); 2) her romantic vision of his journey through her death (A conquistador's quest for an eternity together with his queen.); and 3) his spiritual vision of the painful and desperate efforts to save her (Isolation and desperation in that lonely bubble).<br/><br/>A final wish, she leaves him to write the last chapter of his story when she is gone. She knows the ending is his, and only he can write it.<br/><br/>As he resigns himself to ending the story, the three worlds become one. His final chapter (Remember, in my mind this movie is three versions of his journey: resolve for his wife, the tree, the queen.) throws open the doors of his agony. <br/><br/>His resolve to give her life. His failure to save her. His desperate and painful grief. All come to life on the page. And finally, in images beyond words, he finds true enlightenment, giving himself over, at last embracing and understanding her ""journey to awe"".<br/><br/>Just one more perspective on an immensely complex and beautiful movie."

While I have enjoyed the films of the three major actors, I felt this movie did them a terrible injustice and their careers could suffer because of it. I can not think of any actor who would want to be associated with such a hodge podge of story lines.<br/><br/>The over ambitious goal of spanning 1000 years should have been able to be accomplished without so much repetition. I would have expected better from a first year film student. There was no building of story lines, the acting was adequate, but seemed contrived and the plot became so bizarre that it was almost unwatchable.<br/><br/>The finale for the movie was more like something from a TV ad. It will be a long time before I step into a theater to see a movie by this director."

That Hollywood continually green-lights projects that are of poor writing quality is a testament to the fact that in this so-called business, the basics still elude most of the so-called professionals. Imagine GM making a car that just didn't start, or didn't have wheels, or didn't have lights. Yet, the so-called movie business continually produces films that don't even cover the basis of sound storytelling. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE...and it stunk."

"sarastro7","6","5","13","2 October 2006"," A homage to life - but not to human dreams and ingenuity
","The Fountain is undeniably an immensely beautifully filmed movie, but it is also a difficult film to understand. The other day, also at the Copenhagen International Film Festival, I saw Renaissance, which was about how we should not strive for immortality because that would dull and dilute mortal life. Funnily - and a bit anti-climactically -, The Fountain was about exactly the same.<br/><br/>It was about a dying woman coming to terms with death by looking at it from the somewhat philosophical angle that every end of life is also the beginning of life. When you die, everything that was you continue in some other form. Your carcass will give nutrition to a tree. Your atoms, molecules and the very complementary bases of your DNA will become part of other life. It's one big cycle. And because of this, there is no need to desire continuous, individual immortality.<br/><br/>I am not very satisfied with this rather simplistic message, wrapped in a bizarrely impenetrable wanna-be art movie. It may intend to be life-affirming, but it is also a conservative and resigned form of nature romanticism. We should just accept nature's ways and not desire anything more or better. Dalai Lama might well agree, but I do not. Humanity is meant to continue to interact ever more complexly with our environment, and adapt both it and ourselves to our preferences. Of course we should strive for a scientific understanding of our genetic make-up and do all we can to extend our lives. Buddhist self-abnegation is just another religion that will die out in competition with a scientific lifestyle which actually changes both our environment and ourselves.<br/><br/>Based on the story and the deceptively obscure way of presenting it, I am forced to say that this disappointing movie deserves a 4 out of 10 rating. But because of the visually spectacular aspect, I will raise that to as much as a 6 out of 10. More than that I cannot grant it. This is not a timeless classic and will be no proper sci-fi fan's favorite movie."

","Okay, this movie is not very good.<br/><br/>I mean, I understand that it has a strong foundation in a philosophy of death and he's showcasing a theory that he wishes us to think about, but there are serious issues here in character development and plot.<br/><br/>The characters in ""The Fountain"" (Izzie and Tommy) are only interested in one another and as an audience it is hard to see why because we get no background on either character, all we know is that they love each other. We are also told their emotional position on Izzie's tumor. I really wish I could have felt for either of these characters, but I could not because I did not know enough about them to care for their loss and their pain.<br/><br/>Imagine a line that most developed characters go through that looks like this: A - B - C.<br/><br/>The character starts at A, hits a revelation at B, and winds up going with C. Something like that. In ""The Fountain"" the characters start in the middle of B and C.<br/><br/>Sure, Aronofsky is trying something new and you have to credit him with that. I am just saying it does not work. Maybe he should stay away from writing because once again you can see he has the technical aptitude to make a solid film, there were just too many problems in the foundation."

Sometimes, it just means that it's a terrible movie!<br/><br/>The whole guy in the bubble floating in space was a terrible idea to begin with, and yet it's a third of the plot!<br/><br/>In a list of my 5 least favorite movies (again, i have seen a lot) this is close to the top.

It starts out good and looses it some were. Darn, the preview look so good to. First there search for the holy grail, with only five guys. then he's in a bubble with a tree.

","This film is visually beautiful. If you put a lot of stock in cinematography, this will be a delight for you.<br/><br/>If you put a lot of stock in understanding the story, this film will be a big disappointment.<br/><br/>If I were to compare this film to a painting (which I think is a fair comparison, since both are works of art), it would be abstract modern art. The Fountain is truly one of those movies that leaves a lot for your mind to ponder, and I generally like that. Unfortunately, I felt this film was too disjointed. Most people don't stare at one piece of abstract art for 2 hours as this movie asks you to. I needed a little more explanation about how everything fit together. I fully believe that there is a wonderful story to go with this eye candy, but this movie did not tell it to me.<br/><br/>In good movies, an hour into the film, I'm hoping the story will go on forever. In this film, I couldn't wait for it to be over."

","Much disappointment and a severe dosage of boredom is what I felt after watching this. I don't know what this was supposed to be, I don't know what it's called, and I don't care whether it belongs in a subcultural branch of art called avantgarde or whatnot, but this was simply ridiculous.<br/><br/>I generally love puzzling thrillers, dramas and movies that make you think. I love being left breathless after one finishes, having to rethink it, and I love the goosebumps some give me. But this was not it.<br/><br/>If someone thinks a mix up of these three stories (a conquistador in New Spain looking for a Mayan pyramid, a scientist trying to beat death by injecting root juice from African trees into monkeys with tumors, and a monk in pajamas traveling through space in a bubble with a tree tattooing himself and believing the tree won't die if they reach a dying star in time, in a friggin' bubble!) is entertaining, heartbreaking or amusing, or all three, fine by me, I'm not here to point fingers and judge, but I didn't see it that way. The story is ridiculously stupid, and this whole movie is generally liked by the big-shots because it has to be. It would be unpopular and uncool if it wasn't, kinda like it would be uncool for Mr. and Mrs. Smith to be unpopular simply because it's Pitt and Jolie who play the protagonists.<br/><br/>About performance... Jackman failed miserably. This is out of his league. No, it's more like.. he's out of this story's league. He can do better, this was just humiliating. As for Rachel... well, I've never been a big fan of hers, but this role suited her... no emotions needed to be shown, and most of the time she was quiet or in bed. Meh...<br/><br/>Anyway, honestly, I know the exact kind of people that would adore this movie... so... if you're bisexual, like wearing sweaters or scarfs even when it's hot and sunny or in closed spaces, if you looove to smoke but you're totally a vegan and love the nature (!!) and if you frequently engage in conversations about god and/or yoga, this is the movie for you. If, however, you're a mean bitter individual who demands an understandable and effective story that took more than a week to write, like me, don't watch this.<br/><br/>Cheers"
"NoLittleLamb","3","3","7","17 May 2007"," Eternity Indeed
","The FountainI'm not even really sure I could accurately tell you what this film was about. There was probably all sorts of symbolism in it that went over my head, and while I'm not adverse to symbolism, many movies use it in quiet beautiful and powerful ways, when it's used sorandomly, and seemingly without rhyme or reason as the fountain did, the audience is lost and therefore the movie loses any potential it had to really effect it's viewers. I quickly became bored and confused by this movie. The main idea behind the film is a quest for immortality and trying to find eternal life, which if I'm not mistaken, in the end we realize is never truly possible.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's performance was elevated only by the skill at which this films' costume team pulled off some terrific looking outfits. I think he portrayed the part of a hopeless husband rather well; his crying was usually very believable, but the creepy bald guy and the practically mute Spaniard were dull and much too vague to connect with.<br/><br/>While I love Rachel Weisz in many of her films, Constant Gardener is one of my favorites, I however felt that her sickly, present-day character was fake and annoying, but the way she pulled off the Queen of Spain was quite beautiful. Well-spoken and emotionless, much as you would expect a queen to be. While roles such as these I am sure are a dream for any actor it seemed to me that they clearly focused more on one character than another and left us wanting more from their performances all around.<br/><br/>The Fountain just confused me, I feel that the purpose of film, in general, is to connect with the audience, and when filmmakers use their stage only to express their inner thoughts in completely vague and emotionally vacant ways, the audience feels abandoned and that's exactly how I felt. At the end of this film I was confused and bored, no connection was made.<br/><br/>However, this film did achieve one common goal of film. It made me thinkjust harder than I would like. It raised questions of immortality and eternal life, a common quest of human beings since the dawn of time. It questioned life and death and made me think about them more than I normally would. While the special effects were brilliant, particularly at the end, the substance wasn't there to back it up. Movie history can not be made on special effects alone.<br/><br/>My Website http://MarysMovieReviews.blogspot.com"

","I'll save everyone a huge whine session here and get to my gripe. I just don't appreciate the layout of the movie. There seems to be far too large of a disconnect between the main story (The Present), and the others (Past and Future). I ""got"" the movie but feel as if the choices the director made created a more frustrating movie than it needed to be. By strategically placing scenes of past and future in the places they are within the movie; it (in my humble nerd of an opinion)just makes it harder to follow in the first half and thus a much LONGER feeling movie than it really needed to be. I assure you I understood the movie and got the undertones, I just think it could have been laid out in a much more enjoyable fashion. This is the first review I've done on IMDb so don't bust my onions."

","This movie was hyped to be one of the best of our time. But if this is the mark of one of the best movies of our time then our time is seriously lacking.<br/><br/>I can see what the director might have been trying to do but he spent so much time setting up the three stories that he had nothing left for the end. He built them up and built them up and then just dropped the ball. It is like he didn't know how to end the movie so he gave the script to a five year old and let him do it.<br/><br/>The movie starts out by having us accept the fact that there is this mystical tree of life. This tree according to the movie is tied to Christianity, the Mayan religion, and Buddhism. We are also supposed to accept that the main character found it and it magically cures this tumor in a monkey. There is more time spent developing the story around the disease of this monkey than of the main characters wife.<br/><br/>Also the story is supposed to be taking place in three different times. Yet the future there is no actual explanation of how it happened or why it happened.

I was expecting to see a film about eternal life and love but instead I saw a film that seemed to be extremely disjointed and confused about what it wanted to do. Now I must say that I have to disagree with some reviewers in that I felt Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz did great jobs with what they were given but they can't be expected to perform miracles. Both of these actors and the director were at the screening I was at and it is very telling when Hugh Jackman says that he was never really sure what the movie was about even while making it.

","I can't think of sentences to describe this movie that don't include 'amazing.<br/><br/>The visual scenes are simply breathtaking - some of the best I've ever seen, which is impressive considering it's not even the main point of the film. <br/><br/>The acting is superb, with the two leads creating a romance I felt deeply. <br/><br/>The themes are pretty obviously metaphysical. It's about death, and facing up to death. It draws from a lot of places, but in its conclusions I'd say it's very Eastern Mysticism. <br/><br/>The loss that our hero faces (without spoiling anything) was devastating; the combined impact of the film left me deeply moved and I'll admit, feeling very sad. I guess you can't ask for more than that."
"IndridC0ld","10","2","4","24 April 2015"," Behold!
","The Fountain is a film that has a LOT to say. Its scope is nothing less than those two enigmatic topics, love and death. Since these topics really get down to the essence of what it means to be human, we do have some familiar reference points. The girl, the loving husband, and a clock that is quickly winding down for one of them. Then there is the symbolism. It's all over this film. The irrationality of hope when there is none, the desire to cheat death. Those are just some of the more ""in your face"" symbolic images. There are at least eight or nine more. This film pulls at you from so many directions, that you can feel like you're drowning in it all. The superb acting by all of the characters makes it so effortless to identify and empathize with them. I'll confess that this film made me weep several times. The thematic score is some of the most heart touching sound ever put to music. All of these elements combine to create a sensation of viewing a ""very important"" film. However, to extract all that this film has to say, it is essential to view it multiple times. Thankfully, there is nothing tedious about this requirement as the film is so hauntingly beautiful, you'll find new dimensions at each viewing. In any case, this is a film that should be watched by anyone with a mind that enjoys a proper challenge."
"bebezno","9","2","4","11 February 2015"," Great drama highly recommended
","One of the most peculiar and unsettling directors of the current scene, Darren Aronofsky, poses in The Fountain a narrative supported by three existential planes that intertwine to shape a declaration of love beyond death. Somewhere between reality, fiction of a novel and a spiritual journey to the edge of space and time, this allegory about eternal love should not leave anyone indifferent by its narrative richness, the visual component and the excellent interpretive work of the cast. Hugh Jackman, whose career (launched by the role of Wolverine) is in his zenith after works of great commercial push as The Prestige or X-Men: The Last Stand, delight us with an excellent dramatic register that is, probably, the most demanding role of his career. Meanwhile Rachel Weisz, who stole my impartiality in The Constant Gardener, maintains the high level of the film and captivates with her pale beauty. Dazzling us with an amazing colorful photography and an excellent soundtrack by Clint Mansell (in his 3rd collaboration together after Pi and Requiem for a Dream), we are in front of the 97 minutes more sensitives i can remember in a long long time on a cinema seat. The one who sees the most striking images of the promotional trailer and waits an epic film, probably will be disappointed. I recommend going to see it without preconceptions and every nerve predisposed to feel; you will like it or not, but you must recognize the extraordinary intensity of the film and you can not deny that is an unusual concept. Aronofsky has again done it with a usual tale told like never before."

The photography and the scripts are incredibly beautiful. I watched when i was a younger and was kinda hard to get all the movie but still get the whole idea, so totally recommended for any age.

"oceanic_osprey","8","2","4","20 October 2014"," The fountain of brilliance
","Greetings all, <br/><br/>So the order of the day is a story that transcends intertwining time lines, and by Jove does this film do it in such accomplished manner. If that wasn't enough, each separate story may be portrayed in a nonlinear fashion, much to my delight, as I do love that which is not run-of-the-mill.<br/><br/>When it commences one may question the ambiguity/vagueness of the three short stories, as little explanation is provided for each. But with the progression of the film will come an admiration for this style, which will endear the viewer no end to the six main characters, all of whom are played wonderfully by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz respectively.<br/><br/>Complemented further are these scenes with their beautiful transitions through general motifs that overlie each set piece, and gradually build on each character's history. Another standout aspect for me.<br/><br/>Clint Mansell does a good a job as ever, matching the tone of each scene with perfection, leading to a greater immersion in the subject matter. A very memorable score indeed.<br/><br/>My only slight foible would be that for the general viewer this may prove a little too complex, if not given enough of a chance. And some of the residing biblical connotations may be out of favour for some.<br/><br/>This film is more than just spectacle, it delivers on so many levels. I must say with great confidence that this is perhaps Jackman's career-defining role. And although I don't find Aronofsky to be a consistent high performer, I'll say without a doubt that The Fountain is my favourite film of his. I cannot advise watching this enough."

"radoii_87","8","2","4","6 February 2014"," Aronofsky's baby - loved but frustratingly misguided
","I stumbled across my notes for this a couple of days ago and finally managed to allocate the time to write up a review. I saw this twice when it came out in 2006, not much has changed from then, as I remember the movie quite vividly still. Aronofsky had a real passion for this project and was desperately searching for funding for almost 10 years. I can imagine that the story must have changed in his mind multiple times as he matured as a writer/director during the beginning of the new millennium. <br/><br/>Considering the circumstances and the fact that he had to cut a lot of material because of a ""low budget"" production, it's understandable that the movie did not completely work for me. It was frustrating because,on paper, it was all there: 1. A multi-layered parallel/reverse narrative spanning across time, involving 3 stories of faith, fear, love, and a recollection that ""finishes"" them. 2. A number of metaphors-tree as life, death as rebirth, fear as obsession etc... 3. Inherent passionate love stories for the project and between Darren and Rachel coming from the outer reality. One of which, I assume was as equally obsessive as Dr.Creo's pursuit. I believe this was unintended and only in hindsight.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, however, these were not connected with each other. The passion and love that permeate the whole project had to be the core that everything else was built around. Instead, the narrative devices and other themes get in the way, obscuring our vision of the couple making love.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this, if solely based on the passion you will feel. You are likely to be inspired yet somewhat frustrated. Be careful with some of the ideas that Aronofsky planted, the movie seems to be celebrated as a ""cult"" classic.<br/><br/>4/5 - Worth a watch"

","This is an exquisitely beautiful, mesmerizing movie that just gets better every time I see it. One of those rare films transcend ""movie"" and are best described as an ""experience"".<br/><br/>Some viewers apparently found it difficult to absorb, to me it was much the opposite, drawing me in and immersing me in the storytelling and hypnotic soundtrack. Sadly, it seems to have gone over the head of most critics.<br/><br/>Smartly bridging between spirituality and science fiction without getting caught in the silliness of fantasy or trappings of religion, the tone is always somber and the non-digital, organic special effects are appropriately warm, earthy, and subdued.<br/><br/>The Kronos Quartet soundtrack is equally masterful, and the Clint Mansell piano solo through the end credits - accompanied by a stylized depiction of the universe forming after the big bang - is nothing short of ethereal.<br/><br/>It was apparently conceived as a big-budget epic before the studios axed the project. Aronofsky retooled it into an intimate, solemn masterpiece and it is now utterly impossible to imagine it in any other form. <br/><br/>This is definitely not a movie for everyone, but if it's up your alley, it may haunt you for life."
"Benthuusi","9","2","4","10 January 2013"," Not for everyone
","As this site demonstrates The Fountain is a movie people either love or hate, although personally I think most people are left pretty confused by it, whether they liked it or not. It really is a movie you should watch at least twice and also have a good think about between the viewings. The visuals are very impressive in all the three parts of the story being told; the main part which features Tom/Jackman trying to invent a cure for his dying wife, Izzi/ Rachel Weisz; a renaissance part which features him as a conquistador searching for the Fountain of Youth on behalf of her as the Spanish Queen, which is the novel Izzi is writing, perhaps intentionally as an allegory of their ""real"" struggle; and a third part which is possibly his subconscious interacting with some form of tree of life, although various New Age/religious interpretations are, I'm sure, plausible as well. Some striking cinematography at least makes sure The Fountain doesn't look like any other movie. Overlaying this is some very evocative music by Kurt Mansell, and although I am usually pretty iffy about movie music in general as a cheap way to manipulate an audience more than something you specifically need it works great here. Tired as I am of this American movie convention, I never got my customary annoyed thoughts of ""where the hell is the 60 piece orchestra seated in this medieval battle and had the cello even been invented yet?"" moments while watching The Fountain. Perhaps it helps if you like the music though, which I generally don't in movies. When it comes to the plot there really isn't much of one, and what I wrote above is basically all there really is to it externally. However it is full of depth as well, and invites symbolic and allegorical interpretations. Naturally this is the part of it that won't appeal to everyone though, since most people generally prefer simple, linear narratives to exposition and symbolism. Some people will dismiss it because of this and think it's pretentious, which perhaps it is. But then it's arrogant in my view to insist that movies must be made in a specific way, with simple narratives and no depth to the viewing experience of any kind. Who's to say there needs to be linearity or even real people in movies at all? Why not archetypes and representations of time and space telling something different instead?<br/><br/>Not saying they should be but for people who like it simple and ""unpretentious"" there are about a billion other movies to watch."

"elshikh4","8","2","4","11 July 2011"," The right way to be immortal !
","Sometimes a movie is so good to the extent of not knowing how to write about it. (The Fountain) has many reasons to be one. But I think 2 pieces of info can provide an intro to speak easily about its beauty. The first is that its writer / director (Darren Aronofsky) loves classic movies. And the second is that he, as a teenager, spent time doing graffiti art.<br/><br/>Now this man could evoke a meaning about the importance of faith and accepting death as a step in life. It's where the awful clinging to life mirrors a wrong understanding of love. So lastly, thinking that he overcame death and reached immortality, the lead invented none other than a way to distance himself from his love for longer time. Hence he should surrender to death as fate that will re-gather him with his love; namely believe in the divine law. Clearly meanings like these have been lost in the Hollywood movies lately. You must remind the old classic ones, especially when it comes to faith. Then, the artistic vision of (Aronofsky). Oh my god. He could make a very sophisticated image yet in a lovely way. Aside from being good looking movie, it managed to be a book of signs, dealing with life, death, and love by symbolic forms, as if it makes its own artistic dictionary.<br/><br/>The chromatic personality of the film was precise. The brown and black for most of the events, as long as the desire for immortality is on, a dark desire for that matter. The golden yellow for moments like the drug's discovery; since it mirrors – in the film's conscience – a sick thirst to delaying death but ending it. The too glaring white for the true love or going to death. See also how the scenes of the husband and his dying wife are natural yet in a black frame or depth. Then, the green triumphs eventually, when the Spanish knight sees the fountain for the first time, however to assure that the immortality in life may be given for things, not humans (the nightmarish moment of the plants grow out of his body, burying him as the answer to his eternity).<br/><br/>While not having a huge budget in his hands, (Aronofsky), in a way that dazzled me personally, didn't use any CGI. Instead, he chose to do the special effects by using micro-photography of chemical reactions on tiny petri dishes. A very old way, but it worked, being no less than any more costly way. And most of all it didn't look fake, be hyped up, or feel made for itself. <br/><br/>The performance is sensitive and truthful. A scene like the one of the bath fascinated me indeed. Makes you somehow hate the action and comic movies that worn out stars, like (Hugh Jackman), (Rachel Weisz) or else, to a degree where true characters and feelings become rare to find, and the actor, inside of such stars, fades out !<br/><br/>The problem remains in the script's third act. It's confused. For instance, how come that the lead is the last man on earth ? He, one way or another, found a drug to lesson the ageing, however why there isn't any other human alive with him ? How nobody drank it but him since it must have been gone public ? Another, more dangerous, matter which is the 3 stories' meeting point. The line between the past's Spanish knight and the present's doctor was a bit blurred. Some would be pushed to think that they're one, not a fictional character / the knight in a book which the factual lead / the doctor completes. Anyway, something was rushed about that third.<br/><br/>By watching many of (Darren Aronofsky)'s works, I believe he has an obsession. Nearly all of his films are bout the human lust. The addiction, of drug and fame, in (Requiem for a Dream – 2000). The desire of being immortal in (The Fountain – 2006). And the complete opposite, yet the same extreme, in (Black Swan – 2010) where the lust is terribly suppressed. For him lust, without balance or real love, is a fertile source of horror. And the original maker of hell is the human self. <br/><br/>(Aronofsky) seems not interested in Hollywood blockbusters, so he directed only 5 movies in 12 years. While being not so smart choice from his side, which may change soon, he had a great opportunity to be interesting, different and unique with a few movies, I see that (The Fountain) is their most perfect yet, whether intellectually or visually.<br/><br/>An enjoyable thought-provoking film, with maybe the greatest message of them all. How many times you could say that about a film ? In a word : immortality can be won by work like this."
"iik71","10","2","4","29 June 2011"," Perfect
","It is rare to find a movie so meaningful, interesting and beautiful altogether. The music is perfect. It really can give some idea of the reincarnation, karma and eternity - the process that all we are involved in this world. Although it does not go far than this, to the questions as ""Is there anything beyond karma, and incarnation"", and ""what is it?"",or ""How to go there"". The conclusion that the eternal life in this world is impossible, or even if it becomes almost possible is meaningless, is another marvellous insight. The movie does not give the way but it can help for certain realizations for the real seekers. Serious movie that is a must to see. The real average rating should be over 8."

"chatoyantgaze","10","2","4","15 June 2011"," Underrated Success:
","Not only is ""The Fountain"" as visually stunning as it is conceptually innovative, Hugh Jackman isn't half-bad as a Spanish-Conquistador/Doctor/Futuristic-Cosmonaut protagonist; Rachel Weisz as Queen Isabella, well...<br/><br/>... I'll let you decide that one.<br/><br/>This isn't the kind of film for typical movie-goers, nor is it something fully appreciable in a single sitting. You're not going to 'get it' the first time: no-one does. And I think it's open to interpretation. Whatever you might garner from its bland synopsis - about 'The Tree of Life' as its paramount feature - are limiting and obvious. Envisage instead The Tree as a sort of underpinning axle to which three parallel stories - involving a Spanish Conquistador, a Contemporary Physician and a Spiritualistic Cosmonaut - intertwine.<br/><br/>Whatever can be said about The Fountain's structure remains debatable; and is probably the reason for anyone's initial confusion. Favouring a non-linear approach, we are torn as to whether the past is in fact the past, and not the (fictional) 'past' of Izzi's book which Tommy frequents; and if the future Tom is in fact the previously mentioned Tommy, whose research into 'immortality' was in fact, perhaps a success. And if you thought that was a mouthful, then this probably isn't a film for you...<br/><br/>It's an eye-opening feature with vast room for exploration and interpretation. Sometimes its capacity for philosophical as well as spiritual conceptions become clouded in contextual obfuscation: the less you know, the less you'll know the film. The Bible is a start, but the subjective references to this are as endless and far-reaching as Eliot's ""The Wasteland"". You'll only get as much out of this film as you put in. Don't be fooled by any characters' outwardly-appearing shallowness, everyone and everything has a place in this film to great symbolic effect.<br/><br/>I don't really want to tell you definitively, what this film's about - when you're watching it for the first time, (hopefully) open-minded, you'll experience either one of two responses: 1. Epiphany 2. WTF And if you're really lucky, both...<br/><br/>If you like to think while watching a movie, The Fountain is a mental, Olympian-workout."
"dawn-clover","10","2","4","28 April 2011"," Absolutely Mindblowing
","""The Fountain"" is a movie like no other. A powerful spiritual and organic voyage into the unknown abstract. This is, by far, one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>The movie tells its story very subtly, perhaps in the vein of Kubrick, but a powerful tale about love and death non-the-less. I won't speak more of the plot in fear of spoiling anything, but it is amazing.<br/><br/>The cast did an outstanding job, especially the main actors, bringing these characters into life, making us feel them, believe in them and go through the feelings with them. The love between Tommy and Izzi is palpable. Tommy's sadness is so unnerving and upsetting, it makes the whole trip that much touching.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is absolutely perfect. Mind blowing eye candy visual effects. A fantastical vision that contrasts itself with the theme that surrounds the movie. So pretty yet so sad. So simple, yet so powerful. Photography is top notch as well, very dark and morbid at times, portraying the scenes perfectly.<br/><br/>The music is hauntingly beautiful. After watching the movie I felt obligated to buy the soundtrack. Clint Mansell, together with the Kronos Quartet and Mogwai, created one of the most stunning and beautiful soundtracks I've ever had the pleasure to listen to. As powerful as the movie, touching, just absolutely beautiful.<br/><br/>I can't really fit this movie into any genre... If you're in for a very visual, touching and powerful drama / sci-fi movie you have got to give this a try!<br/><br/>The way the last few minutes of the movie made me feel, summarize the movie very well: Goosebumps.<br/><br/>Flawless 10 out 10."

"Christian_Dimartino","8","2","4","25 November 2010"," Doesn't make a ton of sense, but I admire the ambition,
","Darren Arronofsky is a director of vision. He's directed nearly five films(with Black Swan coming out next month) and most of them have been visionary. Though one man's vision could only go so far. Critics hated Arronofsky's 3rd vision, The Fountain. Probably for the same reason they hated Vanilla sky. You know what... I liked Vanilla sky. And I liked this movie too.<br/><br/>I will do my best to comprehend the plot. Hugh Jackan and Rachel Weiz play a couple. Jackman's a scientist, Weiz is a writer. Jackman tries his best to keep her alive when he finds out that she has a tumor. Going on around the time of the Spanish armada or something like that, Jackman plays a conquistador who's trying to save the princess(Rachael Weiz). And going on in heaven or something, Jackman is trying to save his wife(Rachael Weiz).<br/><br/>I tried my best to summarize the plot. I think I got it wrong. I understood most of the film while I was watching it. I couldn't fit some things together. Such as""What is going on?"" It took me about an hour out of 90 minutes to figure out the actual plot of this film.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of spectacles. The effects are dazzling. The film is trippy and weird. Just like something Arronofsky or Richard Kelly would come up with. Critics shouldn't have bashed this film. Arronofsky had a vision, he brought it out, not many people got it.<br/><br/>I understood the majority of it. The film probably needed to be more clear than it was. Instead of just presenting these things on the screen. The fountain looks great. It is a success visually. It, in my opinion, works as a film. Give it a chance.Visualize with Arronofsky.<br/><br/>B+"
"spaced_89","10","2","4","16 February 2010"," Best Film of the Decade
","Death is a subject that most people do not feel comfortable discussing and probably never will. That is why when a film that touches on death so intimately is released that is something special.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky initially came up with the idea for this film when reading about a prisoner who was in the prison of a small Latin American town. A volcano erupted and killed everyone in the village but the one prisoner in the new prison. Then the idea of being the last man alive became the main crux of the script. Of course when writing about immortality, the issue of death comes up instantly, and Aronofsky incorporated that into the story. The obsession we as a culture have about remaining eternally young and dismissing death in its entirety is a major part of the tragedy of The Fountain. That while we care for our loved ones we are never really spiritually there for them when the time comes.<br/><br/>The story begins at the foot of a giant temple in 1500's Spain. Tomas is one of three men remaining on a journey that started with the search of the fabled Tree of Life. The natives come out with spears and our three conquistadors have realized they are in a trap. The other two men are killed instantly, but Tomas fights like a caged animal and eventually is knocked down and carried by the mob to the steps. At their beckoning Tomas climbs the pyramid and once at the top sees a glimmer of what so many lives have been lost for: the Tree of Life. However the tree is not unguarded and Lord of Xibalba is there with his sword of flame to protect the gift of First Father. Tomas engages him and is stabbed, the Lord goes for the death strike and with the sounds of Tomas's scream we are transported to the year 2500.<br/><br/>Tom Creo is suspended in a bubble colliding through space at a rate of speed one cannot even imagine. Tom shakes off the dream that frightened him so and moves to the tree encapsuled in the bubble. He kneels close to it and whispers, ""Through that last dark cloud is a dying star. And soon enough, Xibalbia will die. And when it explodes, it will be reborn. You will bloom...and I will live."" A figure appears out of the dark of the screen and it is a woman standing outside of Tom's vision. ""Take a walk with me,"" she coos but Tom shakes his head, ""I have too much work."" She prods again, ""It's the first snow, we always..."" her voice softens but Tom can still not go. We don't know what work he is referring to as he is the only man alive with foreseeably nothing around. And then again with an utterance we are transported back to the year 2005. Tommy is sitting at his desk going over research and waiting on the word to go to surgery. Tommy is a neurosurgeon and his wife Izzy has a brain tumor that is terminal.<br/><br/>I cannot give enough credit to Hugh Jackman who plays all three characters in The Fountain and also delivered another captivating performance that year in The Prestige. Nothing emotionally in this film was handcuffed by a fake display of anguish, Jackman delivered it all, from the soul. Could you imagine how this line, ""Death is a disease, it's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure - and I will find it."" could have been butchered in lesser hands? Rachel Weisz really makes for compelling viewing as the cancer-stricken wife of Tommy. Forced to come to terms with death on her own Izzy is the heart of The Fountain and the foil for Tommy, who refuses to accept her ailment and races to find a cure. Even at the risk of his own sanity.<br/><br/>Perhaps what is most amazing about The Fountain is that 98% of the film was done without CGI. All of the space seen around Tom are micro-sized photographs of chemical reactions. The cinematography is the hands-down best I have seen in film ever. Matthew Libatique (who has been Aronofsky's cinematographer since Pi) reigns in your interest and keeps it while never resorting to distracting the audience with cheap parlor tricks.<br/><br/>The Fountain arrests the mind, breaks the heart and is the best film of the decade."
"callanvass","7","2","4","12 January 2010"," Incredible Surrealistic imagery, fantastic cinematography and spellbinding performances, can't compensate for an often sluggish movie.
","The Fountain is a very well done movie, no doubt about it. The cinematography is fantastic, the performances by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are absolutely spellbinding, the imagery is absolutely wonderfully surreal, and the story is at times very interesting. It's just even for just over 90 minutes, the pacing is often very sluggish, which made for a very trying experience at times. You have to pay strict attention to this film, you can't miss one little detail, or your pretty much screwed. I think I got a lot of this movie anyway. They are all inter wined together, all the three stories, anyway. The most interesting one for me, had to be the one where Hugh plays the scientist. It felt the most real, and to me was by far the most heartfelt. The least effective was the one in Midevil times. The imagery near the end made my jaw drop almost literally. I have honestly never seen anything like that, in my entire life. It was beautiful, haunting, and surreal all at the same time. The Fountain is far from a failure, and there is a lot of interesting stuff on hand, but it's just too sluggish a lot of the time, for my liking.<br/><br/>Performances. Hugh Jackman is utterly incredible here. His multi layered performance is something for the ages. Each character he played, he poured his whole heart into. His chemistry with Rachel is what chemistry is all about. Together the two bring realism, and pure love, I was often amazed by the two. Rachel Weisz is excellent. She is charming ,vulnerable, yet strong at the same time. She has a hypnotizing face, and I often couldn't take my eyes off of her. Ellen Burstyn is very good here, per usual. She didn't have much screen time, when she did though, she added a lot of class to the part.<br/><br/>Bottom Line. The Fountain is a movie I was very much half and half on. I enjoyed a lot of the experience, I was floored by the imagery, and the ending was one of the strangest, yet most incredible things I have ever seen. It just is much to slow for its own good sometimes, and ultimately that's what killed it in the end for me. I do however recommend it for an evening watch, just make sure you pay strict attention, or you will be lost."

","I want to start out by saying I'm 22yr's old. I liked this movie a lot. It has great cinematography and fantastic acting. But thats not what fascinates me. Its the fact that from the start this very ambiguous jigsaw puzzle is presented to the viewers with only a few pieces in place. It makes no sense yet visually its beautiful. This puzzle represents what the film is trying to say. It is distorted and made harder to understand by the three different story lines, which work excellent in conveying the different types of courage and determination of the martyr played by Hugh Jackman. I like how the movies uses other times in history to convey to same ambition, just different ways of trying to reach his goal. This makes the movie interesting and really reflects this nearly plot less movie something with direction. I see a spiritual aspect to this movie as well. I can't help but think this is a lot more deeper than what people really understand. I think this movie is about the one soul replaying the same life over and over again until he finally realizes what he really should be focusing on, (Sorry to go all Carlos Castaneda) that accepting death and not living in the shadow of the thought opens your perception to new thought and possibilities. When he finally accepts death and doesn't fear it he ascends. To me the puzzle still isn't complete because I cant fully comprehend a fair bit of this movie. I like to think thats what its about."

"DrNordo","10","2","4","22 June 2009"," A fascinating and enchanting film!
","Well, ladies and gentlemen, Darren Aronofsky has done it again! He is one of my favorite directors and screenwriters but this movie, in my humble opinion, completely transcended his other gems Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and more recently The Wrestler. This tale takes its audience on a breathtaking journey through some of the most enthralling visuals in cinematic history (almost all done without any CGI at all! Unprecedented in today's era of lazy film makers!) Aside from the breathtaking eye candy, the story this movie tells is very touching, heartwarming, and thought provoking and tells the story of love, loss, devotion, and obsession in a very unique and powerful way.<br/><br/>And the cast! Brad Pitt was originally slated to play the role of Tommy/Tomas but for some reason he left the project and was replaced with Hugh Jackman. Honestly, I truly believe that this movie is all the better for it! I admit that I was never a huge Hugh Jackman fan before watching this movie but I was an instant convert after watching this back in '07. And I frown very sternly at anyone who says that Rachel Weisz only got her part because she's involved with Aronofsky. She was brilliant and has incredible chemistry with Jackman! Add onto this a stellar supporting cast with Academy Award winner and Requiem for a Dream alumni (and ever lovely) Ellen Burstyn at its center.<br/><br/>Lastly, but certainly not least, is the soundtrack. Clint Mansell provides a genius accompaniment to this movie. It sets the tone in a way words cannot describe. I am normally one who doesn't pay much attention to a film's musical score. But this one is impossible to ignore or forget. It is a masterpiece of movie music.<br/><br/>My only disappointment about this movie was that I was unable to see it in theaters where I believe it would have been all the better. You will understand after you see the movie and hear its music.<br/><br/>I don't want to say much else about the movie in order to avoid spoiling its magic.

","As a fan of Darren Aronofsky's work since it all began with Pi, i was eagerly anticipating this film; a long time in the making.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for me, it was pulled from theatre's just weeks after it first aired, and the reasons are so painfully clear.<br/><br/>This is not a film for the average popcorn flick cinema goer. whilst seemingly complex the basic premise is simple; ""love conquers all"". However this theme seemed to elude casual cinema goers with an at first awkwardly strung plot line between what appears to be three different characters.<br/><br/>Upon subsequent viewings one can safely say that the plot line is much more tangible and not as difficult to follow as first presumed.<br/><br/>A man tortured by the memories of a love he lost, and his gradual, painful acceptance of death. Jackman is fantastic and this film really shows off his theatre background. Seldom has a performance moved me like this, the last i can recall is Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br/><br/>Weisz is fantastic in the role of Izzi, she has a certain glow to her in anything she does, and her and Jackman's chemistry is quite unique and above all, believable.<br/><br/>The emerging themes of death as an inevitability coupled with the age old formula of mans struggle against immortality make for something truly special. Visually stunning and emotionally articulate The Fountain delivers something that Hollywood should be striving to do more often.<br/><br/>Clint Mansell's soundtrack is sublime. Working closely with the Kronos Quartet and Scottish rockers Mogwai (a personal favourite of mine) the sound produced from this dream trio is something utterly indescribable and without this musical input, the film would not have had the impact that it had and still has. Even after viewings in the double figures.<br/><br/>A film that i'm sure will become a cult classic in many years to come, but sadly misunderstood and unfortunately labelled ""pretentious"" by many casual cinema goers.<br/><br/>The Fountain is a film you have to watch as it is difficult to define in words, make up your own mind, and we'll see where this film is in ten years time..."

","Darren Aronofsky's name will almost exclusively be linked with the amazingly awesome REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, and in his latest offering, Aronofsky's genius once again comes to the forefront in an impressively ambitious Motion Picture that is full of atmosphere and emotion, but eventually will be described as a film that one appreciates but does not really 'like'.<br/><br/>Part of the problem was its running length of about 90 minutes, which I felt was too short a time to convey what Aronofsky wanted to accomplish. For the first half-hour or so, I myself was unsure of what the film's overall purpose was. A lengthier, better-paced movie may have been better suited to an undertaking of this magnitude. My other problem was that the three stories did not intertwine as well as they should have at many times, and themselves felt like separate short stories.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I applaud this Motion Picture for its ambition, its vision, its story, its acting (Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz were quite spectacular), and its breathtaking and mood-setting score.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid 8/10 and 3 stars (out of 4).

"minucher","8","2","4","3 January 2009"," beautiful movie , a potential killer - slightly spoiled by melodrama
","I made the mistake and read about this movie on IMDb before watching it actually, and had higher expectations. Although I was not completely disappointed, I had a feeling that it could be a killer movie if it was slightly less over-dramatized and more subtle in storytelling. The film has some memorable, haunting moments with beautiful visuals, and some unnecessary nearly-pathetic twists which spoiled the overall feeling for me.<br/><br/>The main theme of the movie is the inner struggle of a man with the idea of mortality, and a spiritual voyage towards the affirmation of life through accepting death. The story is told in three threads. It captures the viewer's attention with unusual settings (a Conquistador in Mayan world, and a translucent sphere floating among stars - I would not call it a spaceship as it is often described by reviewers here, but more like a depiction of the voyage trough the inner universe of the main character. This is the most fascinating scene in the movie in my opinion.) The movie switches between these two ""fictional"" worlds and the third ""real"" world of a doctor and his wife (although I think it is futile to discuss which one is the ""reality"" because this is absolutely irrelevant for the main theme and message of the movie). There are a few interestingly depicted archetypal images (man trying to conquer death for his queen, tree of life, death giving life). Initially the warmness of the relation of the doctor and his wife contrast nicely the odd and surreal feeling of other two realms, but then it suddenly veers in to a melodrama. This distraction is not enough to ruin the movie though, and it still remains a remarkable piece of cinematography. It should be viewed more than one time, and for the first time, if possible with someone close to you. Not recommended for impatient/instant fun and action/instant answers/must be happy end/is this real or not/ types."

Writing gets a 1 out of 10."

","I read the baronesses comment earlier and i felt her dry and negative review of the ending. She talks about the movie not supposed to just seen as a story but felt and that, i think, she did not do. The ending, she says, was nothing but a golden crescendo over the top of which ruins the movie a bit. I on the contrary feel that the ending is one of the most beautiful parts in the entire production. As the film should be felt i felt the ending. I did not see (spoiler) a man in space in a bubble, i saw a mans final destination on a road, traveled through pain and denial. The way he finally meets his end and receives the peace and love he so long struggled unfruitlessly for to remain within his grasp moves me in a way not many other films have and I'd like to extend my gratitude's to the producer.<br/><br/>So baronessa, i see his journey through his wives death in the metaphors which are shown in different ways.

","I remember seeing the previews for this movie in theaters, and saying I want to see that, but when the film came out I completely forgot about it. Then the other day I saw it laying on a store shelf at my local DVD store, and I decided to pick it up. Now Darren Aronofsky is in my opinion one of the finest filmmakers out there right now. His works sport unique concepts filled with endless imagination, that you never really find in American films nowadays. Aronofsky got his start doing low budget Indy films; and finally with the Fountain, Aronofsky has the money to just let his imagination run free, and he delivers his best film to date.<br/><br/>The story of the Fountain is about one man's search for immortality over the course of a thousand years, resulting in a story that is both about the meaning of life and death.<br/><br/>As mentioned the film, which was both written and directed by Aronofsky, is simply amazing. The direction is crisp, the cinematography is a wonder to behold, the score is magnificent sound to go along with the visual splendor, and the acting from this stellar cast is terrific, in particular the performance from Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>The Fountain is simply one of the best films I have seen in a long time, it is heartbreaking and emotional, while also being terrific eye candy; and just like any other film from Darren Aronofsky, you must be willing to go into unexplored territory. If you are wanting a safe movie that follows all of the typical guidelines for drama films, then this isn't for you; but if you want a movie that takes you places dramatically that no other movie has ever dared to go, then you will love the Fountain.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has outdone himself here with a true classic for the ages.<br/><br/>I give the Fountain a perfect 10 out of 10!"
"kts6866","10","2","4","26 July 2008"," Simply Amazing
","There has been no movie which has moved me enough to write a review, except this one. This film is one for the ages and as some may say way ahead of its time.<br/><br/>First off it is not for everyone. It is an art film which has great acting, amazing visual, and a beautiful score. The story is complex and emotionally driven. Now I must say this again it is an ART film and not for everyone.<br/><br/>This film dares to be different and does it with an emotional roller coaster of love and death. Its has a minimal amount of CGI which elevates the film. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz deliver captivating performances in this thoughtfully written story. In short it is a wonderful piece of art which brings pure and true emotion."
"campbellz","10","2","4","24 July 2008"," Spirals of divinity
","In the last decade, I can say that no movie has been more horribly underrated than this gem of dramatic film-making. The Fountain is, in essence, a tribute to our vulnerability and our fear and simultaneous acceptance of the unknown. Jackman and Weisz don't create chemistry so much as they attempt to tear out your heart strings. They're ability to communicate the ocean of love, bewilderment and trepidation in Aronofsky's story is something that borders on magical. Admittedly, the story telling is labyrinthine and incredibly high on its demands, but the giving in is the great reward in unlocking the message running intravenously through the film. And while critics may claim that the film reaches to high, for too much, it's over-thinking the Fountain's core message that can sour its taste. I'm confident in saying this is one of my favorite films of all time. It speaks through loving, universal tongues and goes places few are comfortable in exploring in film. If this film doesn't send you away with stars in your eyes and the human condition heavy on your mind, then you need to take a breath and give it another shot. It's nothing short of a marvel, one that unwraps differently each time you come back to it and like any film worthy of timeless distinction, you can never watch it too much to not feel moved."

I have always been into Sci Fi/ Fantasy films and for those of you into those kinds of genres, this is the movie you'll enjoy. I remember seeing the preview and the preview looked great but my biggest regret is I didn't catch this film while it was in theatres. That would have been an experience. Everything about this film is extraordinary: The acting, the directing, the special effects, cinematography, make up/costume, and of course, the story telling. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz give the performance of their careers in my opinion. Not just that but all the actors and the extras did an outstanding job. And after watching the extras on the DVD, they should have garnered more awards especially the Academy Awards cos a lot of hard work was put into this 5 or 6 year making. So go watch this film. Rent it, buy it, trust me, it really gets you emotionally."

I am not a total fan of today's movies so this is an exceptional recommendation for me..It is a beautifully constructed film. The shooting angles are exceptional.

"cforartist","10","2","4","27 March 2008"," Charlie's Review of The Fountain
","""The Fountain"" is Darren Aronofsky's visual poem about life, death, eternal life, love, obsession, hubris, belief, fear, and truth. If this strikes you as a lot to deal with in the context of one film, you're right, it is. Nonetheless, I have never seen a director present this much profound thematic material in a more artistic and economical fashion than what Mr. Aronofsky has accomplished in this film. For only having directed two previous films (the excellent ""Pi: Faith in Chaos"", and the harrowing yet brilliant ""Requiem For A Dream""), it is amazing that Darren Aronofsky has already proved himself to be one of the best artists working in the medium of film by creating a provocative, balanced work that demands as much of an intellectual response to it's themes as it does an emotional one. <br/><br/>In his third, and most mature work yet, Aronofsky uses the idea of ""the fountain of youth"", along with the imagery of ""the tree of life"", to meticulously establish the theme of humanity's desire and journey to find the means of achieving eternal life. Aronofsky, who is scrupulous in his design and composition of every shot (one of the elements of his approach to film making that merits strong comparisons to Stanley Kubrick), infuses the film with recurring imagery of circles and rings that articulate the theme of eternal life and (with the use of a wedding ring) eternal love. This repetitive structure in the film also allows the movie to generate an emotional sensation from the audience that is more analogous to the effect poetry creates, opposed to the resulting sensation produced by a narrative. It is this daring decision by Mr. Aronofsky that makes this film so unique, as well as so misconstrued by critics and audiences alike. <br/><br/>""The Fountain"" introduces the audience to three characters, all played with superb power by Hugh Jackman, and who all bear a variation of the name Thomas. The central persona of the three, or at least the character that functions within a world that the audience can most readily identify with, is Tommy Creo- a doctor trying to discover a cure for cancer, ultimately to save his wife who is dying from a brain tumor. The last name ""Creo"" is similar to the Spanish word for ""I Believe"". This is an interesting connection, not only thematically, but also because it links this modern day ""Tom"" with the other character Jackman plays, Thomas- a Spanish Conquistador in search of the Fountain of Youth. The third semblance Jackman takes on is Tom- an explorer of the stars who is traveling through space in the 26th Century with a tree (the Tree of Life?) that he repeatedly eats the bark off of; an action which Aronofsky clearly associates with the Christian practice of the Eucharist. This trinity of Thomas's is driven by their love, or obsession, with Izzy or Isabel, played luminously by Rachel Weisz. All three ""Toms"" are seeking to find a way to overcome the reality of death and live eternally in their love with this woman. The sequence of events that take place around these characters function as an emotional catalyst that propels the characters and themes toward a breath- taking montage* sequence which delivers a climax that presents many questions and answers that will require each person who views the film to interpret and understand the symbols, events, themes, and characters with whatever worldview or experiential framework they bring with them when they see it. This allows the film to change and grow with every viewing, as well as with each new viewer. Herein lies Aronofsky greatest achievement with this film. The postmodern foundations that permeate the entire film, as well as it's poetic nature, makes it possible for anyone to bring an interpretation to the film that is representative of the viewer's background, and yet still be a valid elucidation of the sequences that occur within the film. Aronofsky's inventiveness in creating this type of philosophical and poetic vision makes ""The Fountain"" a work of art that can be clearly felt by anyone who can cope with its logical elusiveness. <br/><br/>""The Fountain"" also boasts a transcendent yet melancholy score by Clint Mansell that saturates the film with even more emotional complexity. The cinematography by Matthew Libatique is another amazing achievement that portrays a visual motif of golden lighting and textures that seems to direct the viewer to contemplate man's lust for gold and the material world. This film only grows stronger the more I see it, so for those who have yet to experience ""The Fountain"" here is your invitation to discover ""the road to awe""."
"billpeter","9","2","4","25 January 2008"," Agood-looking film that makes you think
","Firstly, I won't attempt to describe the plot, as, frankly, even after reading the Wikipedia article, I didn't fully understand it. However, I'd like to make a few comments:<br/><br/>1. It's a very good-looking film, which reminded me of the early films of Ridley Scott - from The Duellists (a personal favourite) through ""Someone to Watch over me"".<br/><br/>2. My main problem with the plot (or losing it!!) was what I now understand to be ""the astronaut"". I thought he was Buddha, or a Buddhist priest, and was completely confused. However, the working title of the film - The Last Man - suggests he maybe is the last human, and, like in ""Sunshine"", is on a mission to save humanity and, also like in ""Sunshine"", sacrifices himself to save The Tree - and humanity. Also, I think I remember him walking on water, after killing the Mayan priest, to reach The Tree. Another Jesus allusion?<br/><br/>3. All through the film there is a scene of the researcher refusing to go for a walk in the snow with his (terminally) ill wife. Robert Burns put it far better than I in his poem ""Here's a bottle"" with the verse:<br/><br/>""Catch the moments as they fly, and use them as ye ought, man; believe me, happiness is shy, and comes not aye when sought, man.""<br/><br/>By the end of the film the researcher regrets not going for the walk.<br/><br/>4. Hugh Jackman plays the multiple roles - from ""Buddha"", to a swash-buckling conquistador, to an obsessive doctor like Jeremy Irons' dual role in ""Dead Ringers"" - brilliantly. Rachel Weisz, as the Queen, has never looked more beautiful. <br/><br/>I'll definitely watch this film again and, probably, again."
"amalthea-7","10","2","4","21 January 2008"," Achingly beautiful and genuinely moving
","Firstly, I do not know how Darren Aronofsky was able to direct this film with his partner, Rachael Weisz, as the beautiful, captive queen and dying wife, without crying every few minutes whilst working on the film. Actually, did anyone on this film manage a day without being touched by its aching emotion particularly its representation of desperation felt when faced with the dying of a loved one? And this emotion is not simply played out, but the marvel and originality of the film is seeing this horrible reality explored through such highly imaginative story lines and symbolism.<br/><br/>The key to the film is to understand that one storyline is a present reality, whilst the other two are imaginative explorations (written by the two characters in the ""present"" reality) of the themes of dying, seeking life and holding onto a loved one.<br/><br/>The film is absolutely stunning in its original vision with dense, poetic and symbolic imagery linking each of the stories together. Certain images such as the tree of life, the nebula and Weisz herself as the Spanish queen, are so beautiful they will remain with me forever. You need to pay attention as rewards come when you can recognise even certain camera angles repeating themselves throughout the three stories, unifying them.<br/><br/>Because the film is unconventional in its storytelling and daring in its other-worldly imagery, it requires actors whom you immediately relate to, and Rachael Weisz and Hugh Jackman are perfectly cast in these roles. They convey a real conviction in their acting and genuinely seem to convey heart-breaking fragility, strength and pain.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone with sensitivity, empathy imagination and soul."
"alexisreaver2132","10","2","4","7 January 2008"," Road To Awe
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS OR QUOTES.<br/><br/>'What if you could live forever?'' The Fountain is one of the deepest movies I've ever had the pleasure to witness. If you follow it through to its conclusion and are open minded, a deep thinker then it becomes gratifyingly mind-blowing. As for the tree of life and Izzi's book, is it real? Is she the tree? Or maybe Tom and Izzi are both a combined element of the tree in the end, the Tree representing or being their eternal love in essence them.<br/><br/>Guess the main message is accepting death and its hard to lose a loved one. I could watch this film over and over, and still pick up different ideas from it. People will understand this film one day, maybe when were more evolved mentally, we've all closed our minds.<br/><br/>I think to the best of my ability I understand The Fountain now. I accept what other people think because end of the day I'm in awe of something that is unlike most material, that isn't afraid of being hated by a religious or material obsessed public. Always seems whatever card you play, the more stupid people become. The tree she is, he is, entwined in love. Some people think this film is about death or life, that it is sad, the truth is in between, death is the road to awe.<br/><br/>Death as a means of life, falls on deaf ears in todays zombie-like society. All in our little boxes or one track thoughts. We want a movie that has a basic plot, simple characters, that forever keep changing titles but in essence end up all the same. Well I don't want that, thats why Fountain is so special to me because it explores the whole notion of Death, Rebirth and Love, not to mention the difficult process of losing a loved one and how we would do anything to save them. In essence sometimes we can't change something that's destined to happen, which begs for the old acceptance and to let the river run its course which remains the real message. The Fountain is neither stereotypically happy or sad to me, in the end its resolute, a simple Zen-like fable bordering on rebirth and love eternal.<br/><br/>The parts played beautifully by Hugh Jackman and Rachael Weisz and the love they feel for each other is for me genuinely believable. One scene near the end where he is looking at her like an embodiment of memories, of realities where the Queen Isabella and Izzy merge, is wondrous to behold. Which begs me to wonder if the book Izzi writes isn't something made up from her imagination but one where she has remembered a previous life. Queen Isabella being one of he incarnations. Aztec beliefs also strangely mirror Buddhist ideas in a ''Death is the road to Awe'' sacrificial sense, underlining First Father and Rebirth. Which also makes me think the future Tom, is he not Tom at all or the embodiment of First Father. In essence is he First Father? Darren Aronofsky has a talent for looking at things that I think is so close to my own reflection and thoughts on higher things. Upon reflection Fountain is very similar to Requiem but does it in a more spiritual approach.<br/><br/>Darren's fascination with Mortality has always been there, just go back to Pi with the conversation at that Coffee Shop concerning the Tree Of life. The Fountain will cut Movie Lovers down the middle one half thinking it's cult inducing hippy trash about some bald guy in a bubble and the other half truly seeing it for the deep visual entrancing Journey of one man's struggle with Death, in a race against time to try to save his wife.<br/><br/>A masterpiece of Film Fountain belongs with 2001 and even Requiem for it's higher meaningful depictions. Each time I watch it there's always another piece, another juicy mesmerizing question raised that I didn't see before."

I found some of the comments about this movie being gobbledy goop upsetting, because they didn't really interpret the film at all.<br/><br/>The story main focus is on Hugh character Tomas. And has one reality (Dr. Tom Creo trying to find a cure for the cancer which is killing his wife) and two subplot fantasy realities (The first being his wife's story about a Spanish Queen sending her conquistador to find the 'tree of life' in South America. And the second being in the future where he has found the 'tree of life' but it is dying *It represents him trying to fight the truth of the situations which are happening in his life, and his eventual acceptance*).<br/><br/>The tree is symbolic - it is his search of the cure, but it also represents his wife. He is obsessed with finding a cure to save her life as opposed to spending the time loving this wife with the little time she really has left.<br/><br/>Well, I think it's brilliant movie and if you have ever lost someone you know the inner turmoil and guilt that eats inside you, and even thought it is hard accepting the fact that they are gone."

The completely different prospective of life and death, as presented, is something that will make you think, and make the ""nonbelievers"" of afterlife reconsider.<br/><br/>The director must have been influenced by the recent findings in the field of physics, and the connection that is drawn between religion and astronomy-physics.No matter what your taste in movies might be, the ideas in the script will certainly leave you subjects for discussion, provided of course that you use mind for thinking as well."

And every time Rachel Weisz hit the screen, her presence was magnetic and my eyes were glued to the screen.<br/><br/>I feel very fortunate to have watched the ""baby"" of this director, Darren Aronofsky. It's like experiencing a musician's favorite song or a poet's cherished words; the imagination and creativity questioning mysteries are boundless and how the movie processes that is effective in the story it chose to create. The simple life and death question is put into a dream like perspective here that I can totally relate to despite the disjointed narrative it is presented in. This movie is art, the kind you want to mount on the wall and have it displayed. This artistic movie is poetry with flawless rhyme, rhythm and flow - short and profound. It is one of a kind."
"bLuR-7","10","2","4","27 August 2007"," A fountain worth visiting
","It took filmmaker Darren Aronofsky six years to follow up his ferociously brilliant tour de force, Requiem for a Dream, so anticipation for The Fountain was justifiably stratospheric. Internet sites were abuzz with fanboys salivating over the snazzy visuals from the film's promotional material, which is to be expected from the man who brought us the trailblazing editing technique of his previous films. But these sites were also rife with speculation about the film's story itself. Was it a metaphysical exploration of a man's self-discovery? Or was it a time-spanning journey through different historical epochs while attempting to solve a religious riddle? Whatever your interpretation of the film's deliberately ambiguous trailer, there was no denying you were in for a mindblowing ride. So you can imagine the disappointment of critics and filmgoers alike when the movie turned out to be exactly that -- an obfuscated look at life and death which asks more questions than it answers. The Fountain, however, unlike Aronofsky's previous relatively straightforward films, demands to be reviewed in order to be appreciated. Just like the tree of life guarding the titular fountain of youth, the movie grows and evolves with each viewing, as if taunting you with the prospect of ultimate enlightenment which you suspect will never arrive. Mixing together the trippy experience of Kubrick's 2001 with the cryptic philosophical pretensions of Zardoz, The Fountain simmers forth as a steaming plate of meditative reflections with very little in the way of a narrative obstruction. You will marvel at the film's pensive visuals, you will admire the artistry of the film's lead actors (Jackman & Weisz in brilliant form), and you will be encapsulated by the majesty of Clint Mansell's evocative score. This fountain is well worth the visit."
"turner_cinema","10","2","4","18 August 2007"," Aronofsky: America's Most Brilliant Director
","Some would argue David Lynch as America's art house hero, but I would beg to differ, I have to say that Aronofsky is the new man of the hour. Lynch is a talented director but I feel his work is too often recycled (even his recycled work is brilliant though, mind you). If you look at Aronofsky's short list of films you can't help but to be impressed by his diverse efforts. The only similarity between his three films is that they are all beautifully inventive.<br/><br/>First off I have to say, not everyone is going to want to take the trip that is The Fountain, and a lot of close friends didn't find it to be enjoyable because it is not at all easy to process. The Fountain is an unusual film, jerking you between different points within a one thousand year time frame. More than anything what impressed me was the fact that this was such a DISTINCT film, you won't find anything like this out there, if you are in desperate pursuit of NEW cinema then this is it.<br/><br/>The premise is simple, the pursuit for immortality, and the failure of man to attain it. The Fountain is a trip, its an experience, do not expect a typical film or an easy ride, but this is film is ultimately rewarding and fascinating."
"deaken-1","9","2","4","17 August 2007"," Much better the 2nd time
","I saw this in the theatre and wanted to berate Aronofsky for what I thought was a completely pitiful plot and in general a piece of garbage. In fact I posted a review on another website after seeing it originally, that was very similar to most of the people who have given it a 1 star rating.<br/><br/>When it came out on DVD I decided to see it again because - to have despised it so much I thought there had to be something that I identified with but was rejected for some reason. Similar to the overly zealous homophobe who's really just a closet homosexual and doesn't yet know it. That actually turned out to be the case as I picked up on quite a few things I didn't pick up on the first time and saw what I thought to be a pretty cool story line. I guess you could say - in coming to like this movie, I metaphorically came out of the closet. With this movie you either love it or hate it.<br/><br/>In seeing it the 2nd time I have to say I appreciated it much more. Visually it's a stunning movie and although it does not use dialogue to explain the plot it does use imagery and metaphor quite a bit.<br/><br/>This is my belief on the story line. The past was simply the story Izzi had written and that Tommy finishes in time. There were many symbols that overlapped from the present and the future which makes me believe that the future is a real story line. It starts off with Tommy in the present finding a cure to cancer but just a bit too late. Devastated he vows to cure death because it's a ""disease"" and so he gets to work in the lab. I mean in his mind he's thinking - well if I can cure cancer I can cure death. This is where everyone else leaves him in the lab and in turning off the lights leave him in darkness. He plants the seed over her grave, which - in line with the Mayan belief melds with her body.<br/><br/>Next we find him again in darkness - in his space bubble. He has with him of all things a tree - which as I see it is most likely the tree that once grew over Izzi's grave - now melded with her body. It even has the little hairs on it that stood up when he got close and spoke to it - just like Izzi. We find him in space with - interestingly - the same tattoo ring mark that he had in the present and at the end his ring. The ring tattoos up his arms are the accounting of years or maybe decades. This journey is from my best guess an attempt to die and be reborn with her in the explosion of the star. Full circle. He had to die to live again and possibly find Izzi again.<br/><br/>I can't leave out the possibility that I'm just reaching for meaning in these story lines and that this movie could be what I originally thought it to be - as 3 disjointed stories that go nowhere. Although now I do believe the story to be cryptic one cloaked in beautiful imagery and metaphor."
"ChungMo","7","2","4","11 August 2007"," Interesting story about fighting a loved one's impending death gets the ""Wow, I'm deep"" treatment
","Aronofsky has a great talent at depicting the human condition in time of extreme emotional desperation. The modern day scenes with Jackman and Weisz are absolutely excellent, the dramatizations of the unfinished Conquistador story are good and the man in the space bubble sequences are interesting but conceptually flimsy. While the space settings may get labeled ""Sci-Fi"", it isn't. It's apparently a representation of Jackman's character's mental state as time runs out for his sick wife. Beautiful and ugly at the same time. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the attempt to combine Mayan imagery, Tai Chi Chuan and a basic Yoga posture comes off on the level of a second year film school production. And the scenes of the man peeling human hair covered bark off the space bubble tree and eating it seem out of a David Lynch film. Weird and needlessly disturbing.<br/><br/>After the great ""Requiem for a Dream"" I had hoped that director had these sort of self- indulgent mistakes out of his system. While only 90 minutes long, it could have benefited with about ten minutes edited from the space bubble sequences, especially at the very end. Like his first film, ""Pi"", Aronofsky seems to have a problem cutting to the chase, so to speak.<br/><br/>Regardless, it's a very interesting film if you are prepared for it."

The main message is to accept death, because it is the beginning of new life and you don't have to fight or fear it. And also that death is a necessary part of life itself. Okay, that may be one way to deal with death. But: Well, first of all, I think the best way to deal with death is with humor and a grin on my face.

","Hugh Jackman-Jackman does one of his best performance ever in The Fountain. It's the most touching and moving role I've ever seen him in so far on the Big Screen. I read all the stuff he did for this movie, a lot of emotional and physical preparation, and I think it definitely payed off. Nothing can top this performance...not even whoever won the Oscar for Best Actor.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky-Aronofsky does it again with another touching and moving movie. It may have had failed attempts, but Aronofsky always pulls through. He pulls through again with another of his great films. There's nothing more than a director/writer who can put together a great film like this. Movies that are emotional and touching haven't been this good in years! All Together Now-The Fountain together might have its flaws, but if you look at the big picture, it should have been the Best Picture of the Year. It should have been a lot of things, but it's because this movie is different. And if you like different movies that aren't all action filled or just plain old romantic, this is it. The movie of a lifetime with so much meaning and so much power that I could write and write about it all day. Best movie by far!"
"max8791","10","2","4","23 July 2007"," Moving, beautiful, and nothing like you've ever seen before
","""The Fountain"" is by far the most beautiful, original, daring piece of work to come along in decades. By now, you know it stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz as two lovers who span a timeline of over 1,000 years. It is very difficult to describe plot beyond this, but know that it is as close to pure art can be to a movie.<br/><br/>I saw this after a great Thanksgiving, and had little to no idea of what to expect, and absolutely no idea of what a profound effect this movie would have on me. It made me think about themes of death, love and reincarnation. The movie is filled with great mysticism, tons of thought-provoking elements, and beautiful, Buddha-inspired scenes. The Itvisuals are just stunning. The use of chemical reactions for the backgrounds, especially in the future scenes, are just beyond describing.<br/><br/>It is a very sad movie. The loneliness of Jackman, stuck in this space bubble with a dying tree, is heart-wrenching. The acting is pretty much flawless because it is so convincing. It is not supposed to be a plot to be dissected, rather a movie about the themes I previously mentioned. Just go along for the ride.<br/><br/>The score is incredibly moving. Hours after seeing the movie, I listened to the score, and surprised myself by crying. I can count the number of movies I've cried at on one hand, let alone crying at a movie HOURS after I've seen it. The movie simply would not be the same without Clint Mansell's brilliant score.<br/><br/>I really can't describe the story any more. This movie (not surprisingly) didn't make a lot of money, mostly because Americans are too lazy to be challenged and to actually think about a movie and try something different. There are 1000s more adjectives to describe this movie, but it can be summed in 3 words - GO SEE IT."
"khemass","9","2","4","20 July 2007"," A film so unique, so fascinating
","I am going to buy this film in DVD very soon. I want to keep it. This is a film unlike anything I have ever seen. It's like a beautiful picture that is partially abstract but carries deep meaning. Without a good director, this kind of film could totally flop or lose its focus or become a very, very confusing film. Fortunately, Darren Aronofsky knew what he was doing.<br/><br/>The film captured my attention from the beginning to the end. The computer graphic is so beautiful, especially the scene of the tree floating in the space with millions of stars surround it. The music is beautiful and haunting. The performance of Hugh Jackman is excellent and Rachel Weize also did a good job in her two roles.<br/><br/>This is a film about mortality. It talks about the truth of death and birth, how these two things cannot be separated. It talks about what eternity actually is.<br/><br/>However, for those who does not want to watch something philosophical or complicated, don't go for 'The Fountain'. You may not enjoy it. It's a film that you must think a lot while watching, not pure entertainment."

"kragshot-1","10","2","4","18 June 2007"," A Visually Stunning Commentary on Life and Death....
","I viewed this film without seeing any detailed trailers, or reading anything really about it. In other words, not really knowing what to expect. I had seen Aronofsky's ""Pi,"" so I knew that there would be some sort of profound inner voyage involved, but beyond that; nothing.<br/><br/>I was not ready for what I saw...in fact, I had to watch the last 15 minutes a second time to be sure that I got it.<br/><br/>As my summary/title of this post states, this is a visual commentary of Aronofsky's views of life and death, and IMHO, his comment is that they are one in the same. One cannot exist without the other; only death can truly open the way for new life and without life, there is no point to death.<br/><br/>If you have not seen the movie, then do not read any further, as my comments will explore the three story arcs in the film. <br/><br/>Each of the story arcs evolve from one universal concept; somebody struggling to save something that is dying. Tomas is trying to save queen and country; Thomas Creo is trying to save his wife, and Tom is trying to save his soul (in a matter of speaking).<br/><br/>In each case, the death in question is required for new growth. The tree is the ultimate symbol of that, as it is the target of Tomas' quest by the queen, it's sap is the catalyst of the serum in Thomas' research, and the dying tree itself is Tom's companion in his journey through the stars to Xibalba.<br/><br/>In ""The Conquistador's Quest,"" (I sort of came up with names for each of the sub-stories) even if Tomas was able to return with the sap from the tree, he would not have been able to save his queen or Spain. This was demonstrated by what happened when he consumed the sap himself. In addition, Tomas' own death clearly demonstrated that fact when the blooms erupted from his body, as he writhed in his death throes. Finally, history shows that the Spanish empire had to fall and as a result, the western world could move on and grow beyond the fall of Spain as a world power.<br/><br/>In examining ""Can True Love Die (Thomas and Izzy Creo's story),"" several points are illustrated. Thomas fretfully fights to prevent Izzy's death, while Izzy strives to assure that there is meaning to her life. The film shows that Thomas worked hard; almost to the point of forgetting what was truly important in his drive to save Izzy. However, it was her death that galvanized him to move to finish his final work. Izzy wrote the book as it has been said that writing books is a path to immortality, as written words will often outlive the person who wrote them. She asked him to finish the book, as this gave him a stake in her immortality and as such, he too would live forever, and they would live forever together as having written the book. Another point of immortality was illustrated when Thomas took the seed pod and planted it over Izzy's grave. He got the seed pod because he took the time to spend the day with Izzy, despite the fact that his colleagues were waiting for him to operate on the monkey. Some say that one never dies as long as the living keep that person's love and memory alive in their hearts. Sometimes, it is the special moments in one's life that make the most difference and impact in how a person has lived. From what I saw, this happened after future Tom reached back into time and influenced present-day Thomas not to rush off into the operations with the monkey.<br/><br/>Then with ""The Journey,"" there is Tom, who it is assumed is now the immortal Dr. Thomas Creo. He is drifting through space toward Xibalba with a dying tree encased in a force bubble. When Izzy is still alive, she shows him Xibalba and explains its relevance as the Mayan underworld (or ""Infra-world"" which is the literal translation). I assumed that he was successful in his quest to end death, and at this point he discovered that it did not end the pain of being parted from Izzy. His strive toward ultimate meaning allowed him to touch the souls of both the queen and Izzy, eventually transcend himself, reach out to his past life, and touch his own personal past to see where he went wrong. Upon seeing this, he realized that death is not an end to life, but simply another stage of it. When the star inside of Xibalba reached critical mass and went nova, he died and the two events together caused the tree to bloom with new life.<br/><br/>That is what this is all ultimately about; rebirth and new life arising from death. This film clearly illustrates this in the three conjoined stories. All things are linked by the acts of living and dying."
"grzelakc","10","2","4","17 June 2007"," The greatest story ever told
","Many people are confused about the meaning of this movie but it is quite simple. The story of this film has been told to you by your culture regardless of where and when you were born. You may have heard it as the story of Jesus or the story of Krishna or the story of Osiris but it is the same epic battle of life and death that is depicted both in The Fountain and in all kinds of religious myths.<br/><br/>The cinematography of this movie is beyond awesome. The movie is beautiful and poetic, the acting is superb and the message is presented extremely well. We humans all share the same fear of death and a hope of resurrection that the myth of a dying and rising savior is ingrained in virtually every culture that ever existed. It takes all types of forms but it is always with us and we can often trace its roots to the eternal cycle of nature's birth-death-rebirth. That fact was captured very well in this movie. Darren Aronofsky captured it so well that I can't imagine anyone ever doing a better portrayal of a dying and rising savior story on film. Perfect rating for this gem."

"mcsheehey","9","2","4","16 June 2007"," A Fountain of Artistic Mastery
","Aronofsky is an artist, and ""The Fountain"" is his latest masterpiece. It's a work of art and a film at the same time, and the art element of it deserves a perfect score, while the film aspect deserves probably an eight star score.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" tells three parallel stories in no particular order, often melding them together. The core story is the tale of Tommy (Hugh Jackman), a determined scientist who tries desperately to find a cure for his wife Izzy (Rachel Weisz), who has a serious case of cancer. Izzy is almost finished writing a novel called ""The Fountain."" the plot of this novel is the second story, which takes place in Span in the 1500s, and chronicles the journey of a conquistador named Tomas (Jackman) to find the Fountain of Youth. He does this in the service of the lovely Queen Isabella (Weisz). The last story takes place in the distant future, in which an astronaut (Jackman) journeys to the dying star Xi'balba in a bubble in an attempt to save the lovely dying tree that inhabits the bubble alongside him.<br/><br/>Jackman is very restrained in his three roles, but he still gives a very solid and realistic performance. He allows the audience to tune in on hi desperation and feel it with him. Weisz is beautiful and puts in a grade-A performance, selling us with her irresistible charm and tangible affection. Still, the real star of the film is the look and feel.<br/><br/>The visual effects used in the space scenes are beautiful and entrancing. The subtle ones used in the other two stories are not at all cheesy, but rather express the desired feelings of the characters. The art direction and set direction are breath-takingly gorgeous. The set pieces are all masterworks in themselves, and the nature scenes and bubble sequences are beautiful as well. The entire film is rich in earthy colors which complement the themes in the film well. Aronofsky also includes minor motifs everywhere.<br/><br/>This film is beautiful and amazing. The plots are brilliantly rendered, the sets are amazing, and the effects are very good. This is a great film that is also incredibly deep and insightful."

","The three plots interwove flawlessly,which makes the film coherent and powerful.somebody said the explanations to the film is open.For my part i think the story actually started at modern world,followed by the future when tommy had managed to live for 500 years,kept searching for the way to save his wife,who became the tree in the future after died in the present.As for the story in 1500 A.D.,personally i think it was just Izzy's novel""the Fountain"",which transformed tommy into believing the Mayan myth and take Izzy(the tree) to the nebulous as he believed Izzy would reborn according to the myth.Conquistaor Tomas finally died and lived as part of the tree of life ,that was the ending of Izzy's novel .The end of the novel was written by tommy ,since Izzy entrusted it with him before she died .When tommy finally realised that the only way to live together with Izzy was to die,he made the novel's ending this way,which was Tom's' death.In both the ancient plot and the future plot,tom died to live with his love,both death,ancient and future,reflected the motif about love and mortality.this is a hard movie to watch ,but one of the best i've watched so far."

"Robert_duder","9","2","4","3 June 2007"," A rare and odd cult classic that brings out some hard core fanatics
","When I read that some people considered Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain as one of their most anticipated titles ever I laughed...even mocked them because I had no idea that The Fountain had such an intense following or fans. I also had my doubts as to whether or not The Fountain would really impress me. Most of the write ups, descriptions and trailers really don't explain what the film is about at all. The most common description I read was something to the effect of a man traveling through time to try and save the woman he loves but that isn't what The Fountain is at all. The Fountain at it's heart is this moving love story about a medical researcher who has found in his heart and soul in his wife Izzie. Where The Fountain gets it's odd if not beautiful twist is the fantasy aspect based on the book being written by his wife. Following her death he is left with the quest of finishing her book and launches a dream like sequence that is unusual and mind bending and opens up a world of interpretation and discussion for this film.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman turns in an absolutely stunning performance as 'Tommy.' Jackman's performance is so incredibly emotional and moving and the entire film rests on his persistent state of desire and love and the drive to find the cure for his wife. I think Jackman's performance is in fact award worthy and moving!! Rachel Weisz plays Jackman's wife Isabel Creo. The immediate and established charisma between Jackman and Weisz is astonishing. Aronofsky doesn't bother to try and show a back story between the two, or establish this incredible romance but rather does it so easily and you just feel the emotion between them. Weisz is also very, very good and emotional and looks lovely in the role. The two of them single handedly carry this film and do it flawlessly. You could watch them act off of each other four hours because they are that brilliant although Jackman ultimately outshines. The supporting cast does include some great actors including Ellen Burstyn, Mark Margolis, and Sean Patrick Thomas.<br/><br/>The Fountain is such a deeply intelligent film and as mentioned earlier it's the type of film that can be dissected and discussed and debated and is so complex and obscure but never takes away from the heart of the film which is this intense romance. The Fountain is really something to be experienced and I wish I had paid more attention to it when it was released in 2006. Anyone wanting something a little different, complex and deeply intelligent will find The Fountain just about perfect. 9/10"
"richard_sleboe","3","2","4","25 May 2007"," 96 minutes of mental muscle ache
","We tend to be twice as hard on those we love, simply because we care. With ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"", Darren Aronofsky has raised the bar of our affection to high heaven. But with the affection comes the attention, and with the attention comes the scrutiny. ""The Fountain"" doesn't pass the test. By comparison with his early works, this feels like a polished, feature-length yoga class, but without the uplifting effects of fitness or relaxation. Drawing on a crude mixture of biblical, pagan and new age imagery, Aronofsky gets triple side-tracked in his debut as sole screenwriter. Tom, an obsessed neurosurgeon (Hugh Jackman), and his monkish alter ego set out in pursuit of the tree of life. In the meantime, Tom's lovely wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz, aka Mrs Aronofsky) is busy penning ""The Fountain"", the book of *her* life that will reveal all the mysteries. Quite frankly, we don't give a rat's ass at this point. To muck things up yet a little more, the book features Tom as Spanish Conquistador Tomas, and Izzi as none other than Queen Isabel of Spain. My take is that Aronofsky was so high on surrogate hormones, overflowing with affection for his pregnant wife, that he simply lost it. Rumor has it that Rachel Weisz went into labor as she was watching the final cut and gave birth while the closing credits were still flickering. Good for her."
"Jeff-123","8","2","4","19 May 2007"," Beautiful and Sensible
","So some of you hate it. That's understandable...it's slow and it's obscure, and a bit ponderous.<br/><br/>But it is perfectly comprehensible, I assure you. There was no point in the film where I found myself more than a little bit lost. And the resonances between the three stories and the themes and refrains were quite plain to see.<br/><br/>Izzy has written a book: about a Queen (herself), being surrounded by an evil Inquisitor (cancer). She deputizes the Conquistador (Tommy) to find the key to eternal life. It doesn't make 100% sense for the Queen to do so...you'd figure she'd prefer to have the Conquistador spirit her out of the country. The fact that she *doesn't* should alert you to the fact that she can't leave, because she's Izzy and she's stuck in her body.<br/><br/>In the present, Tommy cannot let her go. He works like a dog to try and save her. He's traveling down a dark and narrow road. You see this echoed throughout all three story lines, which feature linear, sparsely lit environments (this was pointed out in the featurette) -- code for his difficult path and his monomania, code for his journey to the light.<br/><br/>Since he discovered this fountain of youth drug as a serendipitous accident while searching for the cure to Izzy's cancer, the future Baldie could be (with his ring tattoo) Tommy himself -- but it's better understood metaphorically, which is how Aronofsky presents it. The tree, the tree of life, the same magical tree which cured the monkey and which the Conquistador sought, is Izzy -- Tommy feeds himself off the tree, ensuring his continued eternal life, just as he fed off Izzy herself, which indicates he feared simply the extinction of his own heart when she died. That Izzy is the tree suggests he felt Izzy rendered him immortal, and we all, who have loved, have understood that feeling of immortality.<br/><br/>In the end, Tommy, in ""First Father"" mode, sacrifices his body for the creation of a new universe -- both in the dissolution into vegetable matter, and in the disintegration by the supernova -- which is seen as the final letting go of Izzy and of his pain.<br/><br/>Beyond this for me it gets a little fuzzy, for I only saw it a few days ago and still processing it. But as a writer of symbolic weirdness myself I know when something is comprehensible and when it's just weirdness for its own sake. This is the former, not the latter. And you can be angry and feel cheated because you didn't get it, but you can't say there's nothing to get. Aronofsky clearly worked to provide a well-realized and resonant narrative which is actually more integrated and finished than Pi and deeper and more authentically personal than Requiem."
"tzuik","10","2","4","11 May 2007"," The Road to Awe
","The Fountain is a great movie, definitely one of the greatest movies of last year. It's a shame it didn't get the appreciation it deserves, and it's destined to become, like many other great movies, an underrated cult-classic. <br/><br/>Despite all the difficulties encountered during production, Darren Aronofsky managed to realize a superb movie, a unique experience which you can't really say if it's a love story, a sci-fi movie or a psychological one. The style of the movie is clearly different from the psychedelic one of Pi and Requiem for a Dream. The casting is also great, this is Hugh Jackman's best performance yet, Rachel Weisz makes it clear once more that she is a talented actress and she deserves her Oscar, and Ellen Burstyn although she doesn't have the complex role from Requiem, she still manages to pull out a good performance. In some way, I think the current cast (Weisz and Jackman) have done a better job than the originally intended Pitt and Blanchet would have.<br/><br/>The images are stunning, and so is the overall cinematography of the movie, especially the scenes in the future. Another admirable thing is that Aronofsky, despite preferring not to use much CGI, managed to realize incredible imagery with cheap and traditional methods. Also, the soundtrack is mind dazzling and superb, Clint Mansell once again proving that him teaming up with Aronofsky really does pay off. <br/><br/>As it treats quite difficult and philosophical subjects such as the eternal and transcendental status of love, the importance of life and death as an act of creation, the movie can be quite difficult to understand and requires several re-views in order to fully be understood. But this doesn't imply that it's a bad movie, and the contrary  that it's a great and intelligent one. To a certain extent it can be said that it's a symbolical movie, a visual poetry if you like.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes The Fountain so good is the fact that each person can have its own understanding of the movie. And that is why the whole movie is so abstract and confusing, so each one can develop his/her own explanation of the whole plot, according to his/her personal beliefs. <br/><br/>Overall, The Fountain is definitely a great movie, one of my all-time favorites and not only do I recommend you to see it, but I suggest that after you see it for the first time, you should see it again, as you really get to understand it better after a second viewing."

","... as Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself for it. Oh that I had seen this movie before I married the woman of my dreams! Oh that I had spent more time walking with her! loving and cherishing the best thing who ever happened to me! Alas! . . . The Tree of Life is yet guarded, still safe - safe from the amateurish story of a delightful, beautiful woman with a fatal brain disease who writes it for her love. My wife, too, thought to build her fantasy world in her career; but her love for her husband was not as strong as the love of Izzy Creo (short for CREDO - ""I BELIEVE""?)for Tommy. The quote from the Book of Genesis at the film's beginning is in her careful hand, and the book is never finished. Aronofsky asks us to finish our own chapters.... I actually saw this movie hot on the heels of ""Apocalypto"". The same night! Mel Gibson's take on the Conquistadors chimes perfectly with this one. Izzy's fictitious hero is frustrated by the Tree of Life as guarded by the Xibalban priest with the flaming sword. To me this symbolized the misguided passion to connect with non-Christian religions which falsify and pervert the original Mosaic revelation.... Izzy and Tommy represent Humanism in rebellion against Divine Providence: fiction and science make no inroads on mortality - they only help us poor dying souls cope. The hapless lab monkey represents Nature itself - manipulated for man's feeble, selfish ends. The barren tree in the ascendant bubble represents the purgatory of waiting for the transfiguration of Xibalban - which will never come. A naked tree 'sprouts' in the body of the conquering hero - myths need men to give them life. ... The lotus pose represents the atheists' religion - a contemplation of nothingness, of infinity, but no escape from the self... the Bubble? the created universe of the Tree. We are all destined to move out of it eventually and into immortality... the Conquistadors in Mel's movie, represent the Roman Catholic Church which, for all its militancy, has failed to lift any nation or people above barbaric superstition and poverty of land and resources for two thousand years... I suspect that Mr. Aronofsky felt compelled to make certain concessions (the title should have been 'The Tree') to his financial backers in order to get the movie made, but hey - that's what we all do; life is a series of compromises... but to get back to the symbolism: the RING to me was the heart-breaker. See, I still wear my wedding ring in fading hopes that She will come back to me - back from the Dead, as it were. The ring will not come off, and I have no desire to take it off. It symbolizes a promise and a vow made in deadly earnest to my God before many witnesses. Tommy tattoos rings on himself as punishment - he wants the permanence of matrimony - of monogamy - of a woman's unconditional love. So do I , Tommy; so do I... this is an evangelical film, to me Aronofsky is searching and his script shows it, but I have hope that, bringing whatever world-view one will to this movie, that the powerful performances of Hugh and Rachel will absorb you as they did me. I left the theater in tears of lament, but willing to 'bury' the last symbol of the woman I love and to move on, my world-view of Divine Providence intact... Thanks to brother DAaron for a wonderful picture."

","Most of the time people go to films to see a neatly packaged story move from a catalyst action to a climactic resolution. But sometimes you go to a film not simply to explore a story so much as to explore an idea in such a way as to see it within yourself.<br/><br/>The Fountain is one of those introspective films that makes you examine yourself as much as examine the characters. Whether you relate to the conquistador who would die for his Queen and country, or the scientist who is so busy trying to save his wife's life that he is missing it, or the space traveler who simply wants to find peace with the person he loves without reconciling his loss, there is something for every audience member to explore if they are willing to do so.<br/><br/>The film does not fully render itself in such a way that every element is to be perceived as embodied in a rational, physical reality to the storyline itself, but that is not a criticism in the least. Just as Kubrick did with 2001: A Space Odyssey before it, writer/director Darren Aronofsky allows the Fountain room to breathe so as to be both a story and a visual, cinematic experience. In that, The Fountain moves along subtly and with grace, allowing the viewer to see the tragic circumstances of the narrative but also partake in a unique feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>Bringing life to this film are a stream of wonderful performances led by Hugh Jackman who must portray three very different characters with similar circumstances as if they could be one and the same. His masterful precision as an actor shines in his trio role and the depth and range of emotion presented is spellbinding. With fantastic support by Rachel Weisz, Ellen Burstyn and a host of fantastic character actors, there is not an unconvincing moment in the performances.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Darren Aronosky must be commended for his fearless nature as a filmmaker. He is easily setting himself apart from his contemporaries as having an intelligent and wholly unique sensibility in modern film, and the relationships he is able to draw together amongst the actors he employs is only getting stronger with every film he makes.<br/><br/>As a single caveat, The Fountain is easily not a film meant for everyone. If you can't tell from my review already, it is a film that will frustrate those who need a clear cut narrative path. Trying to take in this film with the expectation of neat and tidy resolution will only leave you puzzled. But, if you are willing to explore a film in the way one must explore the complexities of a John Coltrane composition (meaning repeated viewing and a relaxed, open mind), then you will probably appreciate it for both what it is and what it attempts to be."

","The six stars are for its imagery.<br/><br/>Found a_lester_t (1 December 06) and tyler_schuett's (28 November 06) reviews to be very much on the mark as to the meaning and description of this film. The story takes place within one instant, rather than 1000 years. And the futuristic Tom is actually all in Present Day Tom's head, as is the 16th Century Tom.<br/><br/>Main Problem with this film: With all the ""spirituality"" in mass media today, it's really hard to feel moved by The Fountain. That path towards enlightenment, confrontation, acceptance with death - it's really pretty much a cliché in cinema, in writing, in the arts. So the problem isn't the quality of the ""message"" here, but its wow-factor. There has to be something that supplements this ""message"" to make it very special to the viewer. And while the movie is visually absolutely beautiful and original, it just doesn't deliver. It may present itself to be profound, but the viewer might just as well think, well, didn't Deepak Chopra just say the same thing on Oprah the other day? <br/><br/>And contrary to what has been said about the film by other reviewers, it is not ambiguous or mysterious with its message. It is all neatly drawn out, albeit with a lot of passion by its maker/s. Having said that, much credit has to go to the set designers/art direction/production people, Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz and Ellen Burnstyn and the rest of the cast for great performances. Especially Jackman, who does ""dark and tortured"" as well as ""light and frothy"" so well!"

","This movie is just unbelievable. It is so good. The way the storyline weaves three completely different time periods together successfully is incredible. I love the Sci-Fi elements involved in this movie. The overall plot is really good. I'm normally not into the romance genre of movies, but The Fountain has so much more to it than just Romance. I mean yeah, if you break it down to the nuts and bolts, it's a love story. But there is so much more around the central plot that enhances this movie: Drama, Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, etc. This movie has it all. Grant and Weisz did amazing jobs. Weisz is really surprised me lately. She has come a long way from her Mummy movies(which I didn't really like). First with A Constant Gardener and now this. She is really turning into a great actress. Also, in my opinion, the scenes with Grant in the Nebula are visually the greatest scenes I have ever scene. All in all, I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who really enjoys good, thought-out movies."
"flamingobill","7","2","4","30 November 2006"," Pretty, but not much of a movie
","While I found the movie entertaining, I was disappointed by the film's structure. The film is about the fear of dying. The emotions were all there and terrific, with acting solid. But, the film is more of a metaphor/allegory for trying to come to terms with death, than a filmic story. I guess if you go into the film expecting to get a filmic poem, you may not be disappointed. I personally felt they could have kept the poeticism and lengthened the movie into a cohesive narrative story. Perhaps that was the original intent, as I heard the studios had the filmmakers shorten and completely change the original script. As it stands, the ending happens suddenly, and is a let-down. The message it sends isn't surprising, and maybe fleshed-out more could've been effective. It looks like the film could've been amazing. Still, the visuals are cool, the ride, while bumpy here and there, was neat fun, and it was never less than entertaining. Maybe there'll be a director's cut on DVD or something, I'm not sure. I'll keep my fingers crossed."

","Without giving anything away, I would just like everyone to know what to expect from this movie. You can't go into this movie expecting a standard. You must go into with your mind and your heart open. Let it work its magic on you. You will be rewarded with a mind-blowing excursion into human nature and probably your own psyche.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has compiled a masterpiece that examines the themes of life, love, death, and rebirth. It is difficult not to identify with Tommy Creo, and you spend the entire film feeling everything Tommy feels.<br/><br/>The spiritual journey is portrayed by amazing cinematography, and very little (if any) CG work. Instead, Aronofsky utilized macro photography to represent outer space, which was not only visually stunning but symbolically important (i.e., you can see infinity even in the smallest particles, and you can see the divine by looking inward). The entire film was accompanied by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet, who delivered a spot-on performance by exaggerating every emotion.<br/><br/>In short, this film was beautiful and thought-provoking. Some have referred to it as ""poetry on film"", and I quite agree."

","It is my attention to state that ""The Fountain"" is a masterpiece of art. As a visual artist living in New York I can finally say that there is a director in the 21st century who brings the energy and creativity of film into the fine art realm. I saw this movie last Friday and since then it has creep ed into my brain without submission. It is an inspiration to see something inspiring in the world of commercial film. I can honestly say that this is one of the greatest movies of all time. And did I mention that the music is amazing!!!. The message of the movie is too transcend time and allow for the great moments in life to overcome the glutinous consumer beast of our normal everyday existence. Please take note that this movie is not for everyone. If you do not seek to enhance your life and strive for your creative passion, then I think you would be better off seeing another movie. I would not like to impose this movie and everyone. But any creative person out there is going to take a great deal of enjoyment out of this movie"
"ClaytonDavis","7","2","4","29 November 2006"," Too much water in the Fountain
","The Fountain Symbolism, metaphors, more symbolism, and more metaphors can't even begin to encompass Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. Aronofsky helms the picture as if he were Pablo Picasso constructing his most personal portrait to date. Unfortunately, the director does not make things clear enough for the viewer and it took several conversations with a friend following the film to even grasp any concept of what this film was ""suppose"" to be about. Aronofsky's heart is in the right place and it's very probable personal experience fueled his hand into writing this intimate portrayal of love and death, both lost and found.<br/><br/>Trying to give a synopsis of the film is like trying to give the explanation of heaven and God. Spanning over a thousand years, the film tells three intertwined tales of love and our fragility of life in this world and the inevitable confrontation of it. Technically this film is an achievement on its own. Visually stunning from start to finish, the eclectic director who doesn't fail to surprise viewers or tap into something we haven't felt before like his previous works Requiem for a Dream and Pi; the film becomes so incredibly frustrating but at the end leaves you gasping for breath with its cunning, yet overwhelming finale.<br/><br/>In 1500 AD Hugh Jackman portrays Tomas, a conquistador searching for the tree of life that God banished from the world in order to live forever with his Queen Isabel played by Rachel Weisz. In 2000, Jackman plays Tom Creo; a medical researcher whom is exceptionally gifted yet cannot seem to handle to concept of losing his very ailing wife, Izzy. Izzy is very charismatic and wise in her thoughts and words and has begun writing a personal symbolic fable to her husband. In 2500, a very cosmic and Yoga-like time to say the least, Jackman is some type of being standing by a tree having several visions of Izzy and talking repeatedly to the tree.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman gives his most impressive and broken performance to date. With his inner conflict and slow and steady realization of losing his wife, he shows us ""Wolverine"" has more talent than ever anticipated. He delivers us three authentic and genuine characters whose tortured souls are evident in their actions. Rachel Weisz is restricted and reserved in her portrayal of the two women Izzy and Isabel. As Queen Isabel she exudes the grace of any Spanish Queen in the 15th century, although how Aronofsky allowed her to keep her British accent but is a Spanish Queen is beyond me. In present time, her American accent is on point and she has the same on-screen presence that carries Kate Winslet in her films. Critics and average viewers are constantly comparing the two but they are two of our finest actors working today that resemble each other in structure and performance.<br/><br/>The idea that Aronofsky presented to the viewer was a thought provoking one, but not everyone will ""get"" nor appreciate the picture. The visual spectacles are a marvel but the carry through wasn't smooth rather than being dragged through a thorn bush, screaming ""leave me alone, I don't want to know that badly."" The best parts of the film are Clint Mansell's potent score that always adds to the aura of Aronofsky's films. The cinematography is authentic and unique in pulling us through but leaves a rather dizziness in the system. And of course, Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz seem perfect for their roles. The screenplay however lacks very poor character development and not giving us enough background to fall in love with the couples. The director keeps us at a distance and doesn't invite us into their devotion to one another. The Oscar-Crystal ball tells this critic that some technical nominations may be in order but none other with the critics entirely split down the middle. You will either hate The Fountain or want to drink from it until your pores seep of love.<br/><br/>Grade: **1/2/****"

","We live in an upside down world. I don't know of a better way to put it. A fecal mass film like Bond has met with near universal critical praise, while an unabashedly sincere, heart-felt, courageous film like The Fountain finds itself not only fighting market convention, but the very people who should be in a position to champion creativity and risk.<br/><br/>The Fountain is a masterpiece, and a film the likes of which we haven't been gifted with in years. Aronofsky treats the audience with a respect that seems beyond reason given the parameters the marketing machine of Hollywood generally allows filmmakers to work with. The film isn't concerned with thrilling the audience; it's precise rhythmic and thematic cutting lulls one into a state of contemplation. The film has greater aims than thrills, it aims at holy wonder and awe, that encounter with the luminous that Richard Otto speaks of, an encounter that is overwhelming, all meaningful and beyond words and reason.<br/><br/>We are constantly in touch with the immensity of the cosmos in The Fountain, when gliding through the nebula towards a star on the cusp of going nova, in the quiet of a softly lit bedroom, in an operating room, or in a royal court - everywhere the pattern of stars that enwrap us, illustrating the struggle for life against a vast and empty nothing.<br/><br/>That nothing is what Tommy (Jackman) is grappling with. We are presented with three entwined threads, all dealing in some way with the love between Tommy and Izzy (Isabel in Spain, the Tree of Life in the future, Izzy in the present), and in all three, the incarnation of the ideal love is at risk, and the story of the man is the story of the love, the end of which will snuff out both. But the relationship is subtly out of balance. It's not about love or the end of love; it's about singular, personal mortality. Tommy's inability to cope with Izzy dying, his drive to cure cancer, all of it has little to do with love, and everything to do with the things that portend his own inevitable end. Izzy lives in the moment, is there for him, but his fear keeps him from truly connecting, and so he fails to capitalize on the living woman, and the enjoyment they could share in the time allotted. His love breathes only in a realm of abstractions and ideals. We sense this in Izzy, her need for him, her desperation and fear at facing her death alone.<br/><br/>The rings of an aging tree, the ring of marriage, the rings of stars scattered through space, spiraling forever, The Fountain is tightly packed, and cross-references itself and portions of itself constantly through the cutting, always seeking to elucidate its themes.<br/><br/>And if the point of a film is the search for capturing new images, as Werner Herzog states, then Aronofsky has succeeded admirably - the film is beautifully captured in soft sepia/amber glows and greens, and there's some awe inspiring stuff here, the walk to the tree of life, the final moments of flight towards the dying star (little touches like the small bubble breaking off from the larger one, and leaving a droplet in its wake is particularly effective), and the conquistador Tommy facing down a Mayan priest with a flaming sword.<br/><br/>Certainly ego goes into the making of a movie like this (as it goes into any movie), but despite that, a filmmaker still has to accept the limited market, and the unlikelihood of celebration and acceptance, and thus, it is greater parts sacrifice than career building, and I accept these sacrifices as gifts. There is no reason that anyone seeking to make money should make a film like The Fountain, and yet every so often we're still given these pearls, and that in itself is a miracle.<br/><br/>This is a different kind of film, one that I suspect American audiences in particular, are not ready for."
"thornswrath","10","2","4","27 November 2006"," Stunning, Beautiful, and Sobering Meditation On The Dream Of Immortality
","Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain is truly brilliant. I now believe Aronofsky to be the one director alive today that has slipped comfortably into Kubrick's shoes (and it's not just because of the trippy visuals.) Here is a director who truly perceives the medium of film as an art, and who fearlessly creates original motion pictures regardless of their box office potential.<br/><br/>The Fountain is a beautiful movie. The music was enthralling -- I noticed during the end credits that Kronos Quartet played some of the music, which was composed by someone I never heard of. I even saw Mogwai mentioned! In any case -- an absolute must -see film for serious moviegoers. It is the real thing. The cinematography is stunning, and there is not one sequence or bit of dialogue wasted. Hugh Jackman is simply perfect in his 3 roles.<br/><br/>There is no doubt in my mind that The Fountain is the best of the 3 Aronofsky films thus far. He is really maturing as a director.<br/><br/>By the way -- ignore the critics who allege this movie is 'flawed' because the director doesn't supply any 'answers'. It is actually part of the reason the movie is perfect.<br/><br/>It is a stunning, beautiful, and sobering meditation on the dream of immortality. The director knows exactly what he's doing. Audiences who can't keep up w/this film have no right to place the blame on the filmmaker; rather, they should place the blame squarely on their own shoulders for being largely ignorant of the various minutae that the movie is grounded upon.<br/><br/>What we have here, essentially, is that glorious & quite rare achievement to come out of Hollywood: cinema analogous to poetry (particularly for the futurist -scenario wherein our protagonist is captured in a clear bubble travelling deep through our galaxy): these sequences are pure cinematic poetry because unlike the 16th-century sequences & the present-day ones, which clearly are based on known historical and current trends, the future is a big question mark and Aronofsky pulls out all stops in envisioning his own set & setting to capture the inner mental universe of the protagonist.<br/><br/>The results are a truly mind-expanding glimpse into the inner & outer worlds of human being's passions and foibles. Yes, the movie is a love story at heart - - something that may throw off the cynics & bitterly jaded amongst us, but for the true romantics at heart, it is pulled off miraculously.<br/><br/>Here is a a truly important American film pulled off with style and intelligence by a director fated to be recognized as that true anomaly in Hollywood: a genuine artist.<br/><br/>If you go see movies to escape or witness formulaic chase scenes, macho posturing, and all the rest that comes with the fleet of franchises spouting out of Hollywood's anal cavity, by all means don't bother with this.<br/><br/>If you want to appreciate a true work of art that does not bother to ""provide answers"" but rather, challenge the audience with the real, staggering implications of what it means to be alive and in love in this reality - - look no further than The Fountain."

","Coming out of the theater after seeing this film, I found myself thinking that I wanted my money back. One of the only thoughts I had while watching the film was that it is a gorgeous piece of art. At the time, I found myself seemingly unmoved by the experience. I came to understand that it was because I was too busy trying to figure out the story. But I couldn't get the film out of my head (and still can't). Like some sort of brain teaser or a Rubix-cube, I thought and thought about the film from every possible angle. I understood the themes and the thesis of the film, but still I didn't understand the story (from a sequential standpoint anyway). What I found to be the most intriguing aspect of the film was that I could actually contemplate it and have intelligent discussions about it. For that I feel I wasn't ripped off. And the conclusion that I have drawn about the story is that it isn't one that can be deduced in a logical sense. To me, at least, the stories that take place in the past and in the future are metaphors for the story taking place in our time. The book Izzy is writing reflects her inter-most interests in Xibalba, the Tree of Life, and her desire to face death with hope and fearlessness. As Tommy reads her book, he and we, as the audience, are transported into these worlds where he is perpetually questing to save Izzy from death, be it in the form of a queen or as a tree. Throughout the film, Tommy holds on to her almost obsessively. As the events in the present time unfold, the events in the other two time periods evolve, as well. The title, ""The Fountain"" refers to the book Izzy writes as well as the cure (in three forms) that Tommy hopes will save her. The film is about a man learning to understand and deal with the loss of his beloved wife by delving into what comforted her on her path to death."

","Profound. That would be the word I would use to describe ""The Fountain."" I believe that only 10% of the population will ""get"" this movie and that will be a shame. Somebody wrote that this movie was neither Sci-Fi nor a Love story and that is true. I think that the story was about acceptance, acceptance of Man's ultimate destiny or fate.<br/><br/>The film also reminded me of a quote from Chuang Tzu, ""To let understanding stop at what cannot be understood is a high attainment. Those who cannot do it will be destroyed on the lathe of heaven."" Hugh Jackman's character, Tom, has a real hard time letting go of things.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman & Rachel Weisz deserve an Oscar for their performances, but Hollywood has a habit of not acknowledging works that are this deep with little box office draw. It is a pity that a lot of critics have a problem with anything not spoon fed to them a la Bruckheimer that is full of explosions and exposition.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" is a great movie, visually stunning and really not that tough to follow. And even though it was ""Aronofsky Dark"" it was also ultimately transcendent, quite unlike ""Pi"" or ""Requiem for a Dream.""

"nived84","7","2","4","22 November 2006"," ""Death is the road to awe.""
","Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain is a film I've been waiting quite awhile to see and now that I've seen it I'm not really sure what to make of it. Yes, I am very much scratching my head over it, because the film could be interpreted in a few different ways. For those expecting to see a love story that spans a thousand years you'll probably be surprised to find that that isn't really the case with The Fountain. The film is set in the present where Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) a neurologist, is obsessively and desperately searching for a cure to his wife's (Izzi) brain tumor. As her health is withering away she begins to write a novel calledyou guessed it -- ""The Fountain""; about a sixteenth century Spanish conquistador's dangerous quest to find the biblical ""Tree of Life"" (go read Genesis folks, Chapter 3, verse 24) found in the Garden of Eden.<br/><br/>The majority of the film is set in the present day as we watch Tom try to find a cure for brain tumors and comfort Izzi; who's pretty much accepted her fate and is no longer afraid of dying, while Tom tries to save her he struggles to accept defeat. The film cuts back and forth between three parallel stories; the sixteenth century Spanish conquistadors, the present day search for a cure and the future, where Tom is encased in a large bubble moving through space heading towards a dying nebula. It is my own personal interpretation that this ""future"" storyline is really just a visual representation of what Tom is thinking inside his head during the present day events as they unfold. But I could be wrong, that's just my take on it. Aronofsky attempts to turn modern cinema into an artistic expression of poetry, only on a visual medium. It may be too much for some to handle, but it's nice to see somebody try hard to make something bold and different for a change.<br/><br/>Visually it's a grand film, which as surprising as it may seem consisted of little to no CGI or computer effects. Those scenes taking place in space are actually chemical reactions filmed up-close in Petri dishes (cool, huh?). The film strives to be nothing short of a masterpiece, but I don't think Aronofsky's latest quite reaches the same heights of emotional power and sheer thrill as his last film; 2000's soul crushing opus, Requiem for a Dream (one of my favorite movies of all-time). Yes, The Fountain isn't bulletproof, it does have some flaws. Sometimes it can be a challenge to overlook some of those flaws, but they're worth overlooking in order to take in the film's vastly more important and awe-inspiring ideas. It's artsy, maybe just a little too much, and at times perhaps pretentious, but the themes and emotions running throughout The Fountain are so raw and fully exposed they cut deep to the core of every person, especially if you've ever known the pain of losing someone you held deal.<br/><br/>When I first came out of the theater I felt disappointed, then confused, then fascinated, then confused again. There's no doubt in my mind that you'll either love this film or hate it; it's just one of those kinds of movies. But at least one thing's for sure  The Fountain is unlike any other movie you've seen this year or last or the year before that. It's more of an experience, a state of mind, and an exploration of the soul. Director Darren Aronofsky's film doesn't provide any answers, but it does raise a few questions and will most certainly get you thinking. This is an excellent conversation starter and I could see this as being in someway the ultimate date-movie for those looking for a unique challenge. I didn't quite love this movie (even though I desperately wanted to), and I didn't quite hate it either. I was fascinated by it, hypnotized by it, and even puzzled by it. And with a sensational musical score by Clint Mansell layered on top it's probably the closest you'll ever get to having a semi-religious or spiritual experience at the movies. Don't go into The Fountain trying to understand it using your head, instead try following through its multiple story lines by following your heart."
"irabovsky","10","2","4","22 November 2006"," One of the best films I have ever seen.
","The Fountain is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. After seeing Pi, and Reqiuem for a Dream, I had high hopes for Aranofsky's latest flick. And wow, what a film! To me, it no longer became a movie, and became a work of art I couldn't stop staring at. Also, Mansell's music = brilliant. The movie is easier understood after reading the graphic novel.<br/><br/>But, I cant critique a movie without saying what it could've improved upon.<br/><br/>So, what can it improve upon?<br/><br/>The characters backgrounds seemed a little thin. Hugh Jackman was a little over-dramatic at parts, which at times made it unconvincing. Ending was a tiny bit confusing. There was none of Aranofsky's signature 'Hip-Hop' montages. (Although, not a big problem because he makes up with plenty of stunning eye candy what he lacks in montages). I wish there would have been a little more gore. Some scenes should have been done in slow-motion.<br/><br/>Mm.. thats about it. Truthfully, this movie is perfect. And I can't stress enough how well the visuals go with the music. Very inspirational."

For instance, haters lambaste the film for being ""pretentious"" or ""weird"", while its supporters compare it to the spirit of films like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", but I'd say it's both. This film is pretentious in that it's gutsy enough to be structurally, stylistically, and philosophically unique and forward-determining in the same manner that ""2001..."" was and is. That's a pretty damned arrogant thing to do (especially on a limited budget), but I suggest we applaud the originality open-mindedly rather than reserving our support for films that fit comfortably into traditional mental molds for cinema.<br/><br/>Here's a breakdown of what I liked: 1. the music score was dazzling without taking away from the film 2. the visuals were startlingly beautiful. The only exceptions worth noting here were a few limits (not enoughs splendor, honestly) in the scenes of antiquity, but they were still good. stunning use of color. 3. camera placement and movement was quite good, though sadly (to my taste) not quite as experimental as I had hoped for in some of the more dramatic scenes. I suspect most viewers will think Aronofsky's approach to the lens is a bit too experimental, though. 4. The acting was superb. I did not go in expecting to be impressed by either Jackman's or Weisz's ability, but I sure left with a lot more respect for them. I recall thinking only once or twice that a performance could have been more subtle, and those were my only criticisms. 5. Also, I *very much* appreciated a few very, very minor natural human details that Aronofsky includes in some high-emotion shots; it's so rare to see some of these details included in the film that it almost felt like I was watching it live. 6. Plot breakup and syncopation, which really gave the film a special feel and forced me to reflect on past scenes while I was still watching the film. <br/><br/>I would be willing to bet that the willingness to thoughtfully and critically engage the philosophical and emotional content of the film WHILE watching it the first time is going to determine whether or not most people love or hate this movie.<br/><br/>If you refuse to think about the logical, moral, and emotional consequences of the plot, situations, technology, and characters portrayed in this film, I suspect you'll find it very boring and confusing (though, I hope, still visually and aurally stunning)!"

","I've read a number of professional reviews stating that the film is difficult to follow and that the ending is way beyond anything we lowly movie-goers might be able to grasp. I went into the film prepared to leave utterly perplexed-- but this was simply not the case. The film is not difficult to follow, and the ending is quite satisfying. Yes, there are three concurrent plot lines, but they are not so complex as to be beyond one's understanding. Certain parts of the film may be interpreted differently, but as a whole it has a rather straight-forward and powerful message about love and death. The visuals and acting are great. The music was appropriate. I feel that today's reviewers are seriously underestimating the movie-going public. Or perhaps they've gotten so used to reviewing such utterly thoughtless movies that when they're forced to think just a little bit it blows their minds. The Fountain does have some flaws, but overall it's a great film, and definitely worth checking out."
"mltwitchell","8","2","4","22 November 2006"," The Human Life Is Fragile
","This film was not made to be enjoyed or understood by many people. Therefore, I seriously doubt the people who love Hugh Jackman from the X-Men are going to enjoy this movie. And it's about time that an actor as talented as Hugh Jackman has been getting good parts to show what he can do (see 'The Prestige'). <br/><br/>However, this film just might be one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. And the best part of it is that the images that you would think are special effects are in reality real chemical reactions magnified and recorded. The director, Darren Aronofsky wanted it that way so that his film could stand the test of time. No doubt that this film in its own extrordinary way spans three centuries but also is centered around the idea of living forever. A very creative, heart-wrenching tale of love between a woman plagued with an unstoppable illness and the man who will stop at nothing to cure her disease known as death.<br/><br/>Not exactly what I expected going in the theater and I don't necessarily agree with the whole message its sending. The dialogue could have used some work too. However it does make a point, the human life is a fragile creation. 'The Fountain' definitely left me scratching my head and leaving me in awe about the beauty I just witnessed."
"nightswatch","10","2","4","22 November 2006"," A moving treatise on life and death
","Aronofsky's thoughts on the nature of life and death certainly do not disappoint. I'm shocked, however, that the studio chose to release this film on thanksgiving weekend to little fanfare, where it will almost certainly get slaughtered. At any rate, the film is great and flirts with being tremendous. Matthew Libatique's cinematography never fails to be anything less than breathtaking, and it certainly is here. There are striking, majestic images, and the film truly does look amazing. The film uses silence to great effect, but when Clint Mansell's score does show up, it is fitting and powerful as well. Jackman's performance I thought was strong, and is certainly light years away from his turn as Wolverine in X-men. After seeing the film I can't really imagine Brad Pitt playing this part, as he was originally intended to. That being said, this certainly isn't a movie for everyone, and is probably less accessible than either Pi or Requiem. For those who might not quite ""get it"", the following is my interpretation of the film, with **SPOILERS**. <br/><br/>The film's theme, at it's very heart, is that holding desperately onto life can lead only to death, while accepting death as a form of life and creation, can make life come alive. There are three story lines, the only one that may really be ""real"" is the one in the present, but it doesn't matter much as they all end up saying the same thing. In the present, Jackman's wife Izzy has brain cancer and is on her way out, and he is a doctor studying cancer treatments, desperately trying to find one that will save her. All through their interaction in the present, he is obsessed with holding onto her, with finding a way to make her live. He ignores things that she says in conversation, focusing only on the things that he think may allow her to live. He is absolutely terrified about her impending doom. At one point while he is in a hospital room with her, he even exclaims ""I just want to be with you!"" and her reply to this is ""You ARE with me, right now!"" But his obsession with finding some way to prolong her life blinds him to most everything else (one notable scene illustrating this is when he walks down the road to a completely silent audio track, even as ambulances drive by with sirens flashing), even to his remaining time with her. What leads to his eventual liberation is what Izzy found so fascinating, and even wrote her story on, the Mayan mythology. Their creation story contains the ""first man"" who sacrificed himself in order to create the world. It is a common theme throughout all mythology across all cultures, life out of death. There cannot be life without death. We come from the earth, our bodies are built out of it, and when we die we return to it so that new forms can be created. Stars are formed from accumulations of gases and dust, and when they explode with unbelievable grandeur, they spew these components out into the void, where they will form new stars. Izzy was able to find peace in this notion, that her life and death were part of the great mystery of life, and she was able to identify with this great cosmic energy that pervades everything. Jackman's character cannot accept this, and he decries death as a disease, which he will work to cure. But in the end, this is fruitless. Man cannot live forever, and what's more, even if it WERE possible, it would serve only to rob life of its meaning. He realizes this, as in the final chapter of Izzy's book, he has the conquistador taste the sap of the tree, and he then immediately returns to the earth. In this sense he can ""live forever"", but not in the way that he had hoped as his consciousness perishes. In the future (which to me seemed like a generalization of the present storyline, i.e. the tree of life dying wasn't JUST Izzy dying, but represented life in general) the Jackman character laughs when, after the tree has died, he realizes that he too will finally perish. As the star explodes, we see him rise upwards, identifying with the fact that he will die, and thus transcending it, even AS he dies. And the tree of life blooms, again, life out of death. I would like to quote one of my friends who I think summed the concept up brilliantly: ""these things point the way to reveling in and revering the passions we experience in life. In the spirit of these revels, we are engaged, connected, conscious, and wholly (and holy-ly) participating in the moment rather than scheming on how we can prolong, guard, or perpetually keep the moment, all for ourselves (eternal exclusivity being the province of ego), never allowing change to transmute these pinnacles of human-ness we are fortunate enough to find ourselves experiencing. In the words of another wise teacher, ""Love is the middle way between attachment and detachment."" If we are living from, in, and with love, where will we find the need to hold on, to form an attachment, when we are surrounded, enveloped, and fully part of an energy that is exponentially more powerful?"" and thus, why should we be afraid of death. This is why Jackman goes back, and chooses to spend time with his wife, choosing to life his life NOW. This is, in the end, all that we can do, and by recognizing that we WILL die, and identifying with that, EVERY moment that we DO have, necessarily becomes so important, becomes truly alive.<br/><br/>Definitely check this film out, and if you enjoy it, spread the word. Pi and Requiem signaled the arrival of a major talent in Aronofsky, but after The Fountain I positively cannot wait to see what he does next."
"gregsrants","7","2","4","13 November 2006"," An absorbing tale, Aronofsky style
","To know Darren Aronofsky's films is to love Darren Aronofsky's films. Unlike a Stephen Spielberg whose films are visually stunning without offering much in way of surprises or M. Night Shyamalan's attempts at cinema that have you sitting in your plush uncomfortable theatre seat trying to get one step ahead of the projection in an attempt to figure out the ending 90 minutes before the great reveal, Aronofsky is a talent that deserves to be savored both visually and in a conclusion that is usually unforeseen.<br/><br/>His two previous efforts, Requiem for a Dream and Pi are two of the more complex yet wonderfully absorbing films of the past 10 years. Each film dealt with addiction  one with drugs, the other with mathematics  and the consequences of these obsessions.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's new film, The Fountain also deals with obsession  the obsession for life and the journey of one man's path through time in an effort to resurrect his everlasting love. In the film, Aronofsky uses his celluloid brush to paint a picture of a man obsessed with life while dealing with the eventual death of his wife. Hugh Jackman - who very convincingly sheds his Wolverine persona - plays Thomas and Tommy and Tom, three individuals spanning over a thousand years each on the same quest. The quest to find the source of everlasting life. What is interesting is that in each story, his quest is not to find the answer to immortality for his own gain, but in each case, he is attempting to find the cure for death to save the life of the object of his affection which comes in the form of a queen, a wife and a tree (two of the three are played by Rachel Weisz, I will let you guess which).<br/><br/>The stories jump through time going from past to present to future which is usually annoying, but Aronofsky spends enough time and energy with each jump to give us time to relate to the characters and their surroundings while making an emotional attachment between the characters and the audience. That is if you buy into the film wholeheartedly.<br/><br/>When The Fountain first premiered at the Venice Film Festival, it was met with general hissing and booing from a portion of the audience. Then, in September of 2006, it was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival where again the audiences were mixed in their overall approval rating of the film. Having seen the film now twice, I scratch my head at the consensus response.<br/><br/>Maybe the paying audiences were there to see the two leads, (Jackman/Weisz) who play the central characters in the film, without an appreciation (or patience) for the styling's of Aronofsky whose mind can best be described as Tim Burton on acid. Or maybe they were drawn in after watching the film's trailer which has elements of science fiction and adventure and thought they were going to be given an absorbing tale that will include aliens and lightsabers.<br/><br/>Whatever the reason, few will argue that Aronofsky is an acquired taste that fails to transcend into the mainstream. For most, The Fountain will seem like it is going at a snails pace without any clear heading and can best be described like watching a Terrance Malik/Stanley Kubrick collaboration.<br/><br/>But for those who like to think outside the box and have the adventurous spirit that can be whisked through time and space, this film will be right up your 'Best of"" lists. It is a film that is intelligent, stimulating, demanding while offering some stunning scenes that were done without the aide of CGI. In fact, Aronofsky chose to do the special effects for the film by using micro-photography of chemical reactions on tiny petri dishes. But special effects are not what this film is about. It is about love, life and being able to let go. Aronofsky style.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"

"dasephix","8","2","4","17 October 2006"," Thought provoking and visually stimulating.
","I was able to catch a screening of The Fountain at the Chicago Film Festival and I enjoyed the film very much. Personally, I think Aronofsky did a great job integrating the multiple story lines into one film. In this particular film, I don't think a single cohesive idea was the point most likely due to the film's subject matter.<br/><br/>With the film's spiritual and mystical motifs, Aronofsky is playful with the viewer by crafting a story-line that is both complete and incomplete, something that mysticism encompasses. Also considering the existential perspective on eternal life, the movie takes a good look at eternal life by defying a specific time frame, a specific place, and specific identities. Aronofsky exemplifies this defiance, by interlacing the multiple perspectives of each of the characters throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The score accentuates the dramatic moments very well, and visually I think the people who watch this movie will gravitate towards the screen especially during the very organic scenes of hair, bark, and skin.<br/><br/>Some might walk away feeling a little dissatisfied with the film because it isn't a clearcut film with a definite beginning and end. In fact,looking back on the film, Aronofsky overall, did a good job of approaching the paradoxical themes of the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps because of its paradoxical content, it may have one of harder projects for Aronofsky to tackle, considering he stated that it took 6 years to make. To create a film that thoroughly approaches the paradox of everlasting life through death, Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"" will most likely leave you asking, ""What does it all mean?"""

"Leofwine_draca","7","0","0","19 July 2016"," Imaginative sci-fi from Hollywood
","Unwieldy and strange, this romantic science fiction film had plenty of production troubles that resulted in delays. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were originally fixed to star, but in the end they dropped out and Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz came on board. I think it was a good call. I'm no big fan of Jackman and Weisz and, let's face it, the films for which they are best known offer little to test their acting mettle (I'm thinking of the MUMMY and X-MEN franchises). However, both actors are actually very good here; Weisz is convincing as the woman diagnosed with a brain tumour who's come to peacefully accept her fate, and Jackman wrenches at the heart strings as the husband who just can't come to terms with his wife's illness.<br/><br/>The film starts off obtuse, as if director Darren Aronofsky is determined to get viewers switching off in droves. We're cutting between three periods of time – the past, present, and future – and none of the stories seem to make sense. I would have preferred a more linear style to get me into the story more comfortably, but it all makes sense around the halfway mark so from that point I was able to sit back and enjoy the story. What we get is a completely atypical exploration of some big themes – life, death, love, and loss – while other concepts such as the battle between science and religion are also explored. The 'past' storyline, of Spanish conquistadors invading the Mayan empire, is well-handled and the 'present' story is packed with emotion and sadness. The future storyline is a little weird, with a bald-headed Jackman surrounded by some shall we say 'different' special effects, but it all ends on a high with a clever ending that ties together all three of the story lines in an intelligent way. It's a shame Hollywood doesn't have the guts to make more films like this, instead of appealing to the lowest common denominator with stuff like TRANSFORMERS."

The fact that it's beauty and vision is lost on so many reviewers is a reminder that when mainstreamed so much high budget, Hollywood formula film, we tend to become insensitive and impatient so as to completely miss the deep pleasure of a rare and lasting treat."

","I agree with one of the above posts in that the trailer for this movie was a little misleading. I haven't seen any other films from this director so I didn't know what I was in store for. The cinematography was flawless. The beauty of the scenes were amazing. But as far as the story line goes I'm still confused. I thought back in the day Hugh's character found the Fountain and him and his wife would live forever and we'd watch them travel through each time period to see how they adapted and lived amongst life at that time. Then she gets an illness and he has to go back to the fountain to save her. At least that's what I got from the trailer and was hoping for. I did like it, besides being confused. Yes this movie is very warm and emotional."
"DiscGolferPro","Null","0","0","28 May 2007"," The cycle of Life and Death is a mystery
","The only thing I know for sure about The Fountain is that it was breathtakingly gorgeous. Forgive the capitalizations but I wrote those words to represent Archetypes on purpose. <br/><br/>My best interpretation of the story is that it is about the (re)birth of mankind through the actions of one Man who is ""chosen"" to sow the seeds of a new world. Accompanying this Man is the Woman who acts as his Muse and Great Motivator. Their stories span 3 different lifetimes that interconnect in the sub-consciousnesses of the Man and the Woman. It could be argued that the Present and the Future are the same lifetime (because the Man might be Immortal in these stages), but it would detract from the triumvirate that the story describes individually. The Man's wedding ring (a cyclical representation) is present in each lifetime and seems to be the Artifact (to use a Donnie Darko device) which allows him to briefly interact with real life at key moments in each of the 3 threads. In these (let's call them) moments of clarity, the Man is able to share Knowledge amongst the different time lines in order to facilitate that particular incarnation's Man and Woman to move the cycle of Life and Death towards its goal. His motivation and love for the Woman ultimately help him complete the cycle by guiding The Tree of Life to the nebula where the supernova will (re)create a cosmic event that will become the new (or perhaps an additional) cradle of life. <br/><br/>We've seen this before in other films (i.e: that Death begets Life; 2001, The Seventh Sign, Solaris) and this movie presents a good artistic interpretation of this plot device. Well that's my interpretation anyway based on a first viewing. My rating: 8"
"narbo","8","0","0","28 May 2007"," Unfocused but Ambitious
","It's boring for the first 30 minutes, doesn't set itself up properly, and it's hard to care about the characters on any real level, but I highly recommend this movie. An odd way to preface it indeed, but a movie this ambitious deserves respect. In the end I did enjoy this film, but its flaws are very evident. A large part of the reason I wanted to see this film was because of Aronofsky. I loved his first two films, and see this as a worthy if less focused entry into his body of work. <br/><br/>By now it's becoming clear that Aronofsky is interested in people and their obsessions. In 'Pi' we had a man fixated by math, 'Requiem' was about people obsessed with finding hope via drugs, and here we have the Jackman character who is obsessed with one thing across three different incarnations of himself. The themes of love and the life cycle are muddied by contradictory aspects of the central characters personality. On the one hand Tommy is an obsessed scientist, on the other he is a man in love. Aronofsky seems to want us to believe that he searches for everlasting life so that he may have everlasting love (sorry). However, do we really believe that his obsessions are driven by love? No. Tommy would be fixated on his ideas regardless of his love. These sort of contradictions exist throughout the film and weigh it down, ultimately preventing it from being a great film. All the characters outside of the two main ones are 2-D and perfunctory at best. Burstyn seems to be the only other real character here and her only role is to agree with Tommy that Izzie is indeed wonderful. <br/><br/>If you like the ambition of films like 'Wings of Desire' or 'Donnie Darko' see this movie, but know that the final product here is less successful than those two films. But it's a worthwhile disappointment."

This movie was a brilliantly conceived and you need to be of proper mind for this which I was not in. There is not really a plot save a man has been struggling to find a cure for his dying lover/wife over a span of 3 different lives of which the third life is very bizarre. Beautiful acting by both stars (Jackman, Weiz), haunting music and depressing mood tells you a tale with a moral: You have to let the dying die so they can live, and beautiful special effects keeps this movie aloft the mediocre line to amazing. Its a movie about musing and so confusion is common. Pick a good time to watch this movie and let your mind think beyond the materialistic threshold."

The audience reaction didn't surprise me, but I can say it is a shame. I think Seekers will be effected, and if they are truly on the right path there is definitely something to be gleamed from this film as a signpost to Reality.

","My girlfriend and I were fortunate enough to luck out with an admission ticket for two to an advanced screening last night, with director Darren Aronofsky on-hand for Q&A.<br/><br/>Visually stunning and rich, the unrelenting and thought-provoking story is superbly delivered by a truly wonderful performance by Hugh Jackman. In three story lines spanning thousands of years, from Spanish Conquistadors exploring South America, to a minimalist space-traveling future unlike any you are likely to have experienced, Hugh's character(s) struggle(s) to come to terms with the age-old quandaries of life, love, death, spirituality, and the individual's place in existence.<br/><br/>Virtually every frame is a feast for the eyes, and I lost track of how many times I caught myself gawking at the screen, breathless and open-mouthed. What few criticisms I noticed were given only passing thought as I was continuously provided more beautiful and complex things to ponder.<br/><br/>One of the more interesting things gleaned from the Q&A was that no CGI was used. All of the amazing visuals were captured through a camera lens and film, utilizing footage of microscopic chemical reactions and natural processes, such as yeast metabolism and growth. Some digital painting was used, but only to enhance the captured footage. It might not sound beautiful, but you just have to see how the techniques translate to effects on the big screen.<br/><br/>Darren also discussed the universality of human myth that can be found across time and space. He discussed one particular scene that he had written using only his own creativity, and then came to find through his research that an ancient Mayan myth contained virtually the same ideas.<br/><br/>There is also a rich science-related storyline, largely contributed by Darren's writing partner, his roommate from college, who has a PhD in Neurobiology. The validity of the scientific detail adds a lot to the aspects of the film that are more tangible and rooted in our contemporary experiences.<br/><br/>I've never had such access to a renowned filmmaker. What a treat it was. Pretty much all of my questions were asked by other members of the audience. If there had been more time, I might've gotten the courage to reach for the mic an ask him if he'd consciously incorporated any of Joseph Campbell's perspectives into the mythological aspects of the film.<br/><br/>I highly recommend checking it out."

","Horrible and pretentious. Not even earnest acting by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz could save this film by Weisz's fiancé, writer/director Darren Aronofsky. Some woman in the cinema was snoring loudly and none of us bothered to shush her because it was understandably a snoozefest.<br/><br/>The main plot line is simple: Tom (Jackman) is a doctor married to Izzi (Weisz), a dying writer. Tom furiously tries to find a cure for her disease. He says, ""Death is a disease, it's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure - and I will find it.""<br/><br/>Then the story finds parallels with the story Izzi is writing in her book (in longhand, using old school pen and ink, for crying out loud, with no erasures!), where Tom and Izzi also play the characters. It also has a third subplot (?) where Tom is a bald, tattooed Zen-like monk-like man trapped in a snow globe. Lots of New Age mumbo jumbo, which was supposed to be visually poetic, tons of closeups of something that looked like yellow amber, and stylized cinematography. <br/><br/>The Fountain has terribly redundant and cheesy writing, too:<br/><br/>Izzi: Will you deliver Spain from bondage? Tom Verde: Upon my honor and my life. Izzi: Then you shall take this ring to remind you of your promise. You shall wear it when you find Eden, and when you return, I shall be your Eve. Together we will live forever.<br/><br/>Even hot, talented men like Jackman make mistakes. Imagine agreeing to shaving his head and chest for the worst sequence ever with an object (a tree). Tom Hanks and 'Wilson' in Cast Away did so much better. <br/><br/>That was 96 mins. of my life I will never get back. Don't make the same mistake I made. Watch something else."

Being in outer space, a giant tree, surrounded by a ball; it was plain silly. And why this movie did poorly at the box office. Was it supposed to be the exact same Tom as a conquistador and in the present or just his spirit the same? And what about Izzy?

","This is an intriguing but muddled and, finally, undernourished fantasy with biblical pretensions – one that’s undeniably visually arresting, particularly since it skips from one time period to the other (15th century Spain, the present day and the future). Another major asset is the evocative score.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz make up the affecting central couple: as a conquistador, he searches for the Tree Of Life (Weisz also plays the Spanish queen in this section); as a doctor, he races against time to find a cure for his dying wife – eventually obtaining immortality for himself (hence, the futuristic ‘episode’). Ellen Burstyn (who had been given a new lease of life by the same director’s REQUIEM FOR A DREAM [2000]) appears here as Jackman’s superior in the contemporary sequences.<br/><br/>The film’s non-linear structure results in confusion during the first hour – but, slowly, the various plot threads come together; however, the ending is rather abrupt. The conquistador ‘segment’ constitutes the best section of the film, while the futuristic scenes seem to be reaching for a 2001-like abstractness!"

","A brilliant scientist is absorbed by his work searching for a cure for cancer, whilst his artistic, spiritual wife is dying of... well, guess. A more trite scenario can hardly be imagined, but it is from this platform that Aronofsky delivers vacuous symbolism to make his case that religion is better than science because religion can make death more bearable, whilst science can't even find meaning in life. Whilst this may be true, it doesn't change the fact that religion is a load of made up nonsense whilst science has at least produced some cool toys like the cameras and computers Aronofsky uses to ply his trade. If you believe in some form of religion already, you may well enjoy this affirmation - otherwise, you might enjoy the pretty CGI but the banality of the film is likely to annoy."

","OK. I watched this movie, I read the remarks made by other viewers posted here on IMDb, and I have a VERY open mind about most everything. Both sides have valid points. The Fountain does attempt to open minds and make statements about life and death. However, it seems to me that the author is either unsure himself, or hasn't quite got a grasp on the art of storytelling. It's possible, however, that the book would make much more sense, as we all learned from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The books were excellent, but the movies were just pale images of Tolkein's imagination. But we don't rate stories or ideas here, we rate how well they work on the screen. The Fountain just didn't work. At all."

","I give this film 2 out of 10 for effort and special effects. The trailers lead you to believe this is a time traveling romance, which it is to a degree. It's also a non-linear nightmare. Is he in the future? Reincarnation? Is he in the past dreaming about the future? What's up with the bubble he seems to live in? Is this all just part of the book he has been asked to finish? Someone please tell me what the hell is going on! (please don't) I tried to enjoy this film. I waited patiently for it to grab me and take me along for the ride. Regretfully, the bus never came. Sci-Fi effects get an A. Story Telling gets an F-. If it weren't for the trailer you would never know he is supposedly in the year 2500.

"Polaris_DiB","8","3","8","27 November 2006"," A Long Half-hour
","Being a fan of something creates both expectations and leniency. As a fan of Aronofsky, I had both high expectations and the willingness to let him take me wherever he chose to go. I wasn't disappointed, but of all of his films this seems the one least likely to be universally appreciated, mostly because it puts a lot on the viewer.<br/><br/>Of course that means I love it. Anybody who's willing to let the audience figure the movie out for themselves has my appreciation because it's a lot more fun to observe. However, I think what really shows the power of this movie is that it feels like it's only a half an hour long... though probably one of the longest half hours you'll ever experience in cinema.<br/><br/>Mixing Buddhist, Mayan, and Christian theologies surrounding creation myths and the Fountain of Life, Aronofsky shows a man searching for eternal life in three different times: Conquistador Spain, Modern America, and some unnamed, emotionally spent, seemingly post-apocalyptic future. Thomas's search for eternal life involves his love of Elizabeth (Izzy) who haunts him with her plea to ""Finish it""... the plea that anyone versed in theological implications of eternal life understand immediately. Eternal life involves the acceptance of death, and the drama here is Hugh Jackman's second obsessive character of the year learning to look past his own arbitrary existence.<br/><br/>What makes this movie brilliant, to me, is the patterns. One of the difficult things about this movie is a huge saturation of overhead shots that feel distracting and needless, until one feels the pattern behind the movie. The movie is filled with patterns (even literally in the mise-en-scene, such as when Thomas looks at the wallpaper in the elevator or looks through the glass in the hospital), some that only reveal themselves in the third act. The overhead shots in the first act which seem so confusing are mirrored by the overhead shots in the third act which are visually amazing--the sweetest nectar for the eyes. If this movie has problems, it's that the first and second acts are entirely set-ups for the grand eloquence of the third act, a pretty difficult move to make and one that Aronofsky barely succeeded at. In this instance he could have toppled over, but he showed just enough reserve and foresight to hold the movie together with a strong emotional glue.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman helps with that glue. Hugh Jackman is one of the best mainstream actors out there, constantly rising in my opinion to greater achievements. The Prestige and The Fountain show what he's capable of, and I'm getting that contemporary directors are beginning to notice. We shall probably see some huge Oscar-centric role for him very soon.<br/><br/>On the other hand, we have Rachel Weisz. Rachel Weisz is very photogenic, has amazingly perceptive eyes, and is a terrible actress. She works best when she's not delivering or intoning, and unfortunately as the love interest of Thomas she gets a bit more close-up than she can handle. I think if anything ruins this movie, it's Weisz's acting. Her modern character, Izzy, was unfortunately the weakest written, and adding the weakest acting to it made it a little difficult to get through.<br/><br/>ON the other hand, one of the things Aronofsky seems much more interested in this case is the science fiction elements that tie everything together (and create one of the most breathtakingly visual cine-paintings I've ever seen). While the first act feels confusing and the second act can get a bit melodramatic, the sudden rending of space and time into a complete organism makes the third act change EVERYTHING. Suddenly all the difficulties with the movie disappeared. All of the patterns emerged, and the long plodding story suddenly shrinks to a half an hour in length. If a film has ever created time travel in the audience, it is this one.<br/><br/>The themes and story I leave for other people to appreciate. The visuals and construction of the narrative are why I stress that people should see this movie.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","Had this film been edited down to six to twelve minutes, I would have lauded it as one of the most brilliant shorts I'd ever seen. There simply is no story. I think Aronovsky is a brilliant thinker and shows great promise as a film maker, but this film is lost. I found it indulgent, narcissistic, intentionally vague (always a hallmark of missing story) and utterly pretentious. I have a sneaking suspicion that the entire concept of this film hangs on a somewhat arcane quote from Stanley Kubrick, that death is a disease and we will one day find the cure.

It's magnificently shot, directed, acted, everything - except when it comes to the plot. It has *potential* and it has it in spades. It has no end of *potential*.<br/><br/>But when you get down to it, at the end of the movie, what are you left with?

The movie can't even get that far. It raises great questions, but I can raise the same ones by holding a blade of grass before my eyes and contemplating lots of fascinating philosophical ideas by very old dead people.<br/><br/>However, no one pays me for such things, nor would I pay Darren Aronofsky for the same. It's like someone with all the talent in the world creating a movie, but at the last second noticing that he had only written 1/3rd of the script and stretched what he had to fit what he had shot.<br/><br/>It might be worth watching when they release the director's cut version, where they add the plot back in."

","Dull, boring, overproduced twaddle starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, the wife of director Darren Arnofsky. Originally, Brad Pitt was slated to star, but he bailed. Perhaps he realized he'd signed up for a stinker. I disliked Arnofsky's ""Pi"" and admired his ""Requiem for a Dream"", so I'm neither here nor there about his output. In a nutshell, a scientist/doctor (Jackman) is falling apart because his wife (who has written a manuscript called ""The Fountain"") is dying. His experiments on animals appear to be yielding results that may help her. At the same time, Jackman is a warrior in another time period fighting an unspecified enemy. Metaphors and parallel emotional journeys float about to confuse us and put us to sleep. There is another aspect of the film that reminded me of the strange, fascinating, superior sci-fi flick of old, ""The Little Prince"" -- Jackman hangs out on a floating asteroid talking to a tree and debating the meaning of his existence. ""The Fountain"" has a budget up the kazoo and is a handsomely mounted production. Performances are of the ultra-important, ""deeply meaningful"" tenor, and the pacing would bore a snail. I had no idea what was really going on and I don't care to be informed. The film is a mish-mash of long gestating ideas and ambitions that never involve the viewer or make you care. Jackman's character is so narcissistic and self-righteous you just want him to die a horrible death; Weisz is a bed-ridden dullard worthy of no less.

We missed the first 20 minutes...we could barely follow the story after that.<br/><br/>I'm sure you all know the story, 1000 years, tree of life blah blah blah. I thought that the film was going to be subdivided into 3 parts, which would have been more interesting. Instead Aronofsky (the director) thought it would be better to mix all of them into one big story. Thing is, when all of them got mixed up like this, NOBODY in the audience understood what was going on, NOBODY. I'll elaborate in a bit...<br/><br/>Firtsly, the music of this film is what was really captivating. Clint Mansell and Mogwai created such a beautifully well-put together soundtrack, i loved every second of it. It really helped with the movie, and grasped the audiences emotions. Without it, I'm sure to say that this movie wouldn't have been the same.<br/><br/>Some of Hugh Jackman's and Rachel Weisz' acting wasn't too great, didn't really convince me enough that what was going on was truly real. Jackson put on a few good scenes, but thats about it.<br/><br/>Special effects were top notch, I couldn't believe they didn't do any CG work on this, and all the effects were microscopic images digitally enhanced. It really created a unique way of looking at the film, and made it seem different...in a way that was pleasing. If you're a big fan of effects, this movie is definitely the one to see.<br/><br/>In the end, I don't know what to say. I actually enjoyed the movie, but when I saw it in that theatre filled with movie critiques and film owners, I got a really negative vibe from the general audience. Perhaps they're just full of themselves.<br/><br/>Some of the spoilers (which I wont reveal) aren't too big enough. The story was pretty good, the effects were amazing same with the music, acting was poor.<br/><br/>8/10 I'd recommend it, really good on the psychological part, and visually beautiful.

Sure Jackman and Weisz are great actors, but it wasn't about having the cerebral capacity or not to ""get it"" or having patience, the movie was unnecessarily slow.

I watched this and as soon as it started I thought Hugh Jackman was going to fight all these warriors but it later goes to the future and back to the past and I am already lost. But I have to say the absolute weirdest thing I have ever seen was when he is in the bubble... A BUBBLE with a tree. All I have to say is wow to be honest I was completely lost. The only thing I am sure about is the tree gives him eternal life please tell me I'm right because if I'm not I don't understand any of it. So if you plan on watching this have it in mind that it is confusing and weird but it was a beautifully made movie. The only thing I could say is this movie is weirder than a bunch of Republicans having a slumber party and watching Milk with Sean Penn."
"film-critic","8","2","5","12 June 2008"," Aronofsky's Homage to Kubrick's ""2001"" with a twist of LOVE
","Aronofsky has designed a beautiful cast to represent this story. In several interviews, he talks about his desire to make a science-fiction film, and at first I was skeptical on how well ""Van Helsing"" himself could voice Aronofsky words, but coupled with Rachel Weiss, the two are magic. Hugh Jackman is phenomenal in the role of conquistador, scientist, and finally explorer. His expressions are Oscar worthy, and his projection of honesty is empowering. He devours each of these three segments with enough force that accolades should have come his way. Coupled with the way Aronofsky framed this film, the two work hand in hand. There is little told of Tommy's love for Izzi, but what Jackman creates through his characters transforms this from a mediocre missed sci-fi romance to something bolder, and more determined. Jackman with Weiss create another fold in this story all together. From their initial meeting, the symbolism of the ring, the connections between the decades were subtle, but the two create chemistry with their whispers, their body language, and their obvious passion for this project. This was not simply a Aronofsky film, but a story that all actors, visuals, and gaffers embraced. From the opening shot you could tell that we were unprepared for this ride that Jackman wasn't going to be ""cute"", but instead determined and sad at the same time. We were ready for the science fiction, but the history, the honest love, the religious symbols were exciting and fresh. Again, Kubrick would have giving Aronofsky a standing ovation, his lessons have been passed to a new generation, and they don't believe in dumb blockbusters. This was a science fiction film second, a love story first, which reminded me further of Kubrick's ""2001""  perhaps this was a bit of an homage to that. This was a project of passion and all the cast embodied it.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's storytelling abilities continue to impress. From ""Pi"" I was immediately hooked and with his honest adaptation of ""Requiem for a Dream"", he proved that he could tackle anything from the absurd to the taboo. Science fiction wasn't going to stop him, but it wasn't going to be your average story. This was going to demonstrate the longevity of love and the secrets of our universe. His choice of edits, quick cuts, and powerful angles are more than impressive. He constructs a story that spans eras, but still feels grounded in one specific moment. It felt like listening to a remake of a classic song, while the beats may be different  the same message was being sent. His attention to detail was magnificent. I love cinema that forces you to remember other moments from earlier, small symbolic items, or details that may seem unimportant at the time, but as the focus becomes concentrated, it becomes clear. This is more than just a film, but an experience similar to that of fighting for the love of your life. To me, that is what transformed ""The Fountain"" from your average sci-fi experience to something larger. Aronofsky created an emotion, not just a visual reference, and you experience the film for the themes he created. This isn't a sit-back-and-relax film, but an emotional roller coaster of truth and honesty. Kubrick has done it, Aronofsky just expanded the premise.<br/><br/>With such praise for this bold new image, a comment should be made that it wasn't perfect. The small blemishes were nearly hidden by the epic scope of this story. The blemishes could be the lack of decibels during the whispering moments. Aronofsky creates the unknown when Tommy whispers into the tree or to his wife, clues that will bring us full circle soon, but I found myself using the subtitle button to ensure that I found the words correctly. The other small blemish could be the other characters surrounding Tommy and Izzi. Aronofsky brought a couple back from his other films, but their emotions were staged and wooden. They added very little to this story and the overall sensation of ""The Fountain"". While I see the value of them being around our characters (to build the world), this could have simply been a story about two people, their love, and their quest.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Fountain"" was a fresh new film experience for me. With the downtrodden nature of the Hollywood recycling bin, I was beginning to give up hope that imagination would still be used in today's releases. As always, audiences were not as forthcoming with this film, and a quick release to DVD was inevitable. This is a movie that is beautiful, poignant, and symbolic all at the same time  it forces you to think, use your mind, and find the hidden clues throughout. This is not a film for all, but many should experience it. The acting was superb, possibly the best we will see from Hugh Jackman, and Aronofsky's style and image stood on their own two feet. This was a well-rounded film with slight blemishes that would never been seen by the amateur film watcher. It took you all over the map without pity or remorse. ""The Fountain"" was like watching a disciple of Kubrick announce his final project. Aronofsky continues to impress with his films. They have huge depth and range, yet easily forgotten through the course of the year. ""The Fountain"" should have won awards, and in time I think it will, but for now it needs to be watched and recommended. This is one of my favorites of the year.<br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"

","First, a caveat. If you are not a man, knock off a point. If you are not a man who has been desperately in love, knock off another. If those above statements do not apply to you, then this film wasn't for you. You may still enjoy it, find it beautiful, and rave about it, but this film was not for you.<br/><br/>This film was for me.<br/><br/>I remember telling my wife that there were no words in the English language to describe how much I loved her, but that I'd spend the rest of my life trying to show her. That is a true statement, but somehow The Fountain manages to describe that kind of love. The only reason I rated this movie a 10 was because that's as high as the scale goes. For me this film so far surpassed every other movie I'd ever seen that it's in an entirely different league.<br/><br/>I've always been a movie buff. I spent years in a video store watching everything on the shelves. I thought I'd seen every good movie ever made, and several that were great. The Fountain, however, touched me; not only like no other movie ever has, but like no other work of art in the history of mankind has. I wept, nearly start to finish. And that has never even come close to happening before.<br/><br/>The dialog and acting are rock solid. This will probably stand as the finest role of Jackman's career. And if the dialog seems a little over the top, then guess what, this film wasn't for you.<br/><br/>I'd rate this 1,000,000/10 if I could. Darren has done something in film that to my knowledge no other work of art ever has. He's shown us, in painstaking detail, the anatomy of Love."

","Loved Pi and Requiem for a Dream. Read TIME's favorable review and rented this with lofty expectations. Sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>Looking over all these private reviews, most folk either loved or hated this film. I am sympathetic to both camps. The film was a visual beauty and sad even if you were struggling to figure things out. On the other hand, there were tons of plot details thrown in demanding consideration but making little sense.<br/><br/>Clearly, the Inquisition/Conquistador portion is Izzi's book and the space bubble travel is the end - or part - of the sequence. But did Tom write the ending?; i.e., ""finish it""? If so, why does Izzi appear in the bubble; e.g., she cannot be a character in her own book! When does Tom learn to accept death? Upon HIS death? He surely has no change of heart during his lifetime and shows no inclination to ""finish"" the book! Why does the Mayan priest, a character in Izzi's book see, acknowledge, etc., Tom the Space Traveler as ""Father""? <br/><br/>For the first two-thirds of the film, I was struggling with a plot idea that this was science fantasy or science fiction. Since Tom Scientist has found a magical South American substance I was justified in thinking the ""Tree of Life"" would become a physical plot devise and its transport in space was akin to the slab in 2001 Space Oddessey. Also that Izzi has actually been the Queen of Spain and lived 450 years before writing an autobiographical book and, finally, acknowledging that death is part of life and accepting such. Tom Scientist's discovery of the magical substance and his obsession with such supports this idea. This, ultimately, does not appear to be Aranosky's intent, though it is a no less cohesive take on what Darin DID have in mind.<br/><br/>I can believe some of the user reviews mentioning that film audiences audibly groaned at some points and/or laughed at parts were such was not intended. Mr. Aranosky should not dismiss such reactions, nor the cry that the film is confusing. That is poor film making. On the upbeat, this guy has made some excellent films and certainly will do such again."

"windypoplar","3","2","5","24 July 2007"," wow, that was pointless.
","The Fountain, with Hugh Jackman and Rachel Wiez sounded great to me, a film of depth and poignancy, Unforntunately, one had to actually watch it. Sigh. Sure the cinematic tricks are impressive and Jackman tries really hard, but the film is overwrought and stupefying. There aren't really three parallel stories here, just one Tommy and Izzy, with silly flashbacks and flashforwards to a tree in the stars. A great cast is wasted and given little to do. <br/><br/>Dr. Tommy Creo is a research doctor trying to save his dying wife, cancer is never actually named. She has written something called the ""fountain"" and while that sounds intriguing, nothing ever comes of it. Scenes play, repeat and end with no purpose and the viewer, at least this one, wishes they'd get on with it.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" purports to bring up the grand questions of life, death and immortality, but doesn't offer the answers or even reasonable suggestions. The scene in which Tommy turns into a tree is good and at the end he buries an itchy ball in Izzy's grave. Yep, thats it. <br/><br/>If you really want something adult and thought provoking try ""Solaris"" with George Clooney, that was adult, meaningful and moving, without being depressing and repetitive and dull. There is no story of conquistadors's here, no matter what the cover says, nor is there any glimpse into the future, even the story, set in 2000, might as well be anytime. Experimental film like this is difficult and needs careful execution and a satisfying end. This has neither. Save yourself and don't watch. Seriously, read a book or better still rent ""Solaris"" or ""Heavy Metal 2000"" this drivel belongs with the wretched ""What Dreams May Come"" or something of that ilk. Yuck!"
"gavin6942","10","2","5","7 June 2007"," This Will Go Down As Darren Aronofsky's Masterpiece
","Darren Aronofsky previously gave us ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"", both excellent films in their own right. Now, he brings us ""The Fountain"" which does the impossible -- ups the ante on what a good Aronofsky film should be. This is, beyond a doubt, his best film to date and possibly ever.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackson is a man in three parallel story lines: a Spanish conquistador in search of the Tree of Life, a cancer researcher who finds a cure for aging (while his wife slowly dies) and a spiritually reflecting man of the future, pondering the nature of life. He is almost unrecognizable as the same actor in these roles, which is a real credit to Jackman. He is often quickly seen as Wolverine (from the ""X-Men"" films), but he has finally escaped that here.<br/><br/>While the plot and characters here are not the deepest, they are some of the most emotional you'll ever come across. And the scenery -- my science, this is just breathtakingly beautiful. Using chemicals rather than CGI, the film overcomes the flaw of CGI (the cartoon look) and steps us up to a whole new level of expectations. How this film did not get an Oscar for cinematography or special effects is a mystery. No other film (not even ""Pan's Labyrinth"") could replicate this quality.<br/><br/>There are parts where the viewer probably won't know what's going on. The ending is very arty and open to interpretation. The first five or ten minutes won't make sense until later on in the movie and probably need a second viewing (if you walk into this film blind you'll be very confused for the first fifteen minutes). I could fault the film for this, but when I left the movie I felt I understood everything I had to: this was a visual representation of love, life and god. Which, I guess, isn't really that strange from Aronofsky.<br/><br/>I give the film a 9.6 out of 10 (rounded up to 10). I think everyone ought to see it. You might not like it. You might not understand it. But I think if you give it a chance, you'll be moved. My friend Jason, the biggest fan of the film I know, didn't really love it until the second viewing. Give it a fair shake -- this is one of those films you wait years for, and if you miss it now, you'll regret it."
"John_Q_Citizen","Null","2","5","10 January 2007"," Good Try But a Little Too Full Of Itself Despite Some Wonderful Cinematography
","Darren Aronofsky's third film, The Fountain, is an odyssey of love and the search for eternal life. Set across three different time periods, Hugh Jackman plays Tomas, Tommy, and Tom in a rather static performance. In the 1500s, he plays a Spanish conquistador Tomas, charged by his queen Isabel, to find a Mayan pyramid in the middle of the dark jungles. He enlists the help of three men--two soldiers and a priest (played well, as usual, by Mark Margolis)--to help navigate the dangerous jungles.<br/><br/>In the present, he plays Tommy, a cancer researcher using Rhesus Monkeys to study brain tumos. Tommy's wife, Izzi, also has a malignant brain tumor that will eventually kill her (and is also at work on a book called 'The Fountain'). His mentor, played by Ellen Burstyn in the film's best performance, disapproves with Tommy's studies of the baboon-using it as a guinea pig for a mysterious substance found in Central America. He finds the tumor in the baboon receding, getting smaller and smaller until it reaches permanent recession. Tommy rushes to his wife to tell her, but it is to late. She has a seizure and dies later in her hospital room.<br/><br/>In the future 2500, Tom (a completely hairless Hugh) is the Last Man. He floats through space in a bubble with a large dying tree. Over time, he has hallucinations of his wife appearing in the bubble, which apparently is a metaphor (or literally) his wife in the future with him. They are floating in the direction of Xhibalba (sp?), a large dying star nearing supernova. Xhibalba was worshiped by the ancient Mayans as their underworld--where their souls find their way after death. As Tom comes close to the star, it explodes, and he becomes ""reborn"", along with his wife. Together they will live forever.<br/><br/>This is a rather difficult movie to understand or to follow. I will admit that I still don't know exactly what has happened, nor will I be so arrogant to say that I will ever understand. This is not the best movie of the year, nor is it the worst. It lies in that vague gray area in the middle and doesn't lean towards either side. But my 'interpretation of the film leads me to assume that the future Tom is a struggle of Tommy's inner psyche trying to cope with his wife's impending demise. The Past segment would be the story that Izzi is writing (called 'The Fountain'), and that Tommy starts to read. Of course, this could be wrong, and it probably is...but I'll leave that for you to decide, reader.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are, for the most part, static. Hugh Jackman seems to have the same somber look on his face throughout the duration of the running time. Rachel Weisz never stops smiling pleasantly in the 'present' story. She keeps staring the camera down in the 'ancient' story. Mark Margolis and Ellen Burstyn give the two best acting jobs in the film, even for their small side-character positions.<br/><br/>But this is not necessarily a bad thing; Tom/my/as is a serious character and rarely has the chance to be happy, and who can blame him really? His wife is about to die, he is stuck in a bubble with a big tree (no sarcasm intended), and he is a fierce Spanish warrior about to meet his doom. As for Weisz...I need not say anything except that she plays an 'optimist'.<br/><br/>The cinematography of The Fountain is very poetic and beautiful. Its yellowish hue and underexposed look convey sadness to me. It's truly a beautifully shot film, and Mattew Libatique deserves some decent recognition. The music is done by Clint Mansell, who surpasses all of his previous work (save Requiem for a Dream). Very beautiful and Oscar-worthy score.<br/><br/>The visuals of the film are breathtaking and I still cannot believe for the life of me that extremely little computer effects were used.<br/><br/>The film may fail, though, on a scale that would use the expression 'It's a little too full of itself'. Its themes are portrayed in a heavy-handed fashion, and its fractured and confusing storyline may turn some people off.<br/><br/>I have respect for Darren Aronofsky, and I tried to like the film because he made it. But I know now, as a very amateur critic, that you shouldn't do this at all. I accept now that all directors make at least one bad movie, and, although it isn't necessarily 'bad', it will not top his previous two movies.<br/><br/>I apologize if I have been a little vague in my review, because I am an amateur. But this movie is a little vague to me and I can't help but give it a...<br/><br/>5/10"
"sasnak37","Null","2","5","21 December 2006"," Why do you think The Fountain is good?
","When I saw the preview for The Fountain, I swore to myself I'd never watch it. Of course, it was then assigned for one of my classes and I had to go.<br/><br/>The preview was misleading and makes it look like the bastard child of the Highlander and Sweet November. The Fountain is still a lousy movie, but for different reasons.<br/><br/>Before everyone flames me and accuses me of being a troll or an orc or a level-nine hobbit-smashing ice mage, I will say the movie had a great score and was pretty to look at (the effects are even better when you learn the space scenes weren't done with CGI but instead was footage of highly magnified liquids in motion), and the acting was solid.<br/><br/>Now my problems (possible spoilers): It's only 90 minutes and it DRAGS. On and on and on...<br/><br/>I can't see Hugh Jackman in the lotus position without laughing.<br/><br/>The movie has a hairless bubble-astronaut doing Tai Chi in his pajamas as he drifts through space...and it wasn't billed as a comedy.<br/><br/>Aronofsky took 90 minutes to say 'death is OK' and 'don't ignore your loved ones when they're dying.' (There's some debate among the movie's fans where people are unsure if the space scenes really happened or if Tommy imagined them. I hope to God he imagined it all because if it really took him 600 years to learn crap we all knew before we entered the theater then there's no way in hell he's smart enough to stop aging and cure brain tumors.)"
"IndySpirit","4","2","5","10 December 2006"," Profound Nothingness
","I found this film interesting but not enjoyable, and overall I feel it fails. I endured discomfort in hope of a satisfying conclusion, and was disappointed.<br/><br/>For those whose focus is on life as a physical experience (most of the audience), this film is ultimately about a man trying to accept his wife's death and her attempt to show him why she's unafraid of it. Because of some very fine acting, our interest is piqued and our emotions are stirred enough to be made uncomfortable by this man's tragedy. We feel his love, his fear, his desperation, and his poignant failure, and we are as depressed by it as he is - it isn't a fun experience. The film feels dark, not only emotionally, but physically so that you begin to crave light.<br/><br/>This is where the fantastical elements of the film should come in to relieve us, but they don't. They are just as dark as rest of the film, even parts which add a warm golden glow to the overall black, white and dead gray tones. The film actually begins with the fantastical story, depicting the middle of a manuscript the dying wife is writing. After a piece of that it moves on to a glimpse of the third element of the film (after the physical and fantastical) - a spiritual journey, which is arguably what the film is really about. I found this opening frustrating - you are being presented with all this dark intense action about to crescendo, and a vision of some sort, but you haven't yet been given any reason to care about the outcome or the characters. So it becomes something to endure, knowing that eventually you will understand, and hopefully care. It's not the first time this technique has been used, but I didn't find it to be successful here, just somewhat vexing.<br/><br/>So taking this man's situation and the story in the manuscript his wife is writing, as well as a depiction of what we are left to assume is the man's inner, spiritual journey - it's never made clear, the scenes are just there, without ever showing us when or how the man is having these experiences - the film asks the audience to shift its focus to the spiritual aspects of life, and then attempts to take us on the man's journey, calming everyone's fears and griefs about death. This is where it failed for me. We are shown that the man had an epiphany, and are very successfully led to feel it's powerful, beautiful, profoundness, but though an attempt was made to do so, we were not guided to share in his new understanding. We are left on the outside looking in, wishing we could understand why the idea sparked by his wife's unfinished story is so satisfying for him.<br/><br/>The film presents the idea that physically, one does not really die because our bodies become elements of new life - earth, trees, flowers etcetera, as well as vegetation that feeds other beings. Since a part of us then becomes a part of all things physical, in death we yet continue as all life eternally continues and renews, and it may be that our consciousness continues in a new way within all these parts of new life. The film presents a second idea that seems contradictory, or it may be that its connection is simply left unexplained, and that is that it's misguided to see seek a physically immortal life, because your immortality lies in what comes after leaving the physical behind. Given the ecstasy we are shown when the man seems to grasp this concept, we are led to believe that this immortal afterlife, represented by the Mayan myth of Xibalba, is something so wonderful that we should not cling to physical life when it's time to move on to this place.<br/><br/>These are beautiful ideas, but they are presented to the audience in an uncomfortable manner. There are unusual close ups and camera angles that jar you out of your comfort zone. They are probably meant to wake you up so that your mind will look around, and hopefully see something beyond the pictures on the screen, but that doesn't make the experience appealing. The lighting is depressing and there is some misplaced sensuality in the man's relationship with the tree. The tree seems to represent his wife, but also the tree of life in general, and the tree of her life which is dying, and his connection within the vision to the physical tree which might save her body. Because it represents so much more than merely his wife, the man's partaking of the tree and the constant close ups of the skin-like bark, with all the fine hairs responding to his nearly touching fingers is repellent.<br/><br/>In the end you still don't understand why any of these things makes the man's loss any less poignant. You've been given good reasons to feel that his beloved is safe and happy and not lost to him forever, which no doubt eases some of his pain, but we were not shown anything that gave him a reason to enjoy the rest of his life, since she's beyond his reach for the moment. The audience is shown his acceptance of her death and it's believable, but we are still left depressed. There is no implication of any future happiness for him, at least, not until he dies and joins her again. I believe the film was meant to be uplifting but I did not find it so - it left me cold, not warm.<br/><br/>The film might be worthwhile if life beyond death is a new concept to you, but if so you might also have a hard time deciphering the message. For me it wasn't worth the bumpy ride. I think the film ""What Dreams May Come"" presents a clearer picture and is much more uplifting."

","Although I appreciated the visual aspects of the film, I had absolutely no clue what it was about. I understood the story in the present but could not relate it to the Isabel or space traveler one. Basically I would not recommend it but then again, I was and remain no fan of Kubrick's Space 2001. Interestingly enough, I liked the soundtracks to both movies. Acting was fine for such storyline as there was. I suppose I am old fashioned but I actually want a semblance of a story. I realize that the film was supposed to create a thread between the three existences but the thread was way too fine to see. I simply was not drawn in. Pity because there was a film in there."
"andrius-mazeika","6","2","5","27 November 2006"," I can't believe anyone would want to praise Aaronofsky for this quagmire of a film.
","Honestly, for those of you who have actually seen this film... you need to really consider how this film played out.<br/><br/>1. This film was extremely disjointed.- I understand that the film starts off with the last chapter of the book, ""The Fountain,"" but in all seriousness it really disengages the audience from the film.<br/><br/>2. This film had way too much redundancy.- Seriously, this film was approximately 100 minutes long (1 and a half hours). When this film finished, I looked at my watch with great disappointment. I couldn't believe how many times they repeated one scene over and over and over again. It was almost as if Aaronofsky while writing and planning for this film was experimenting with the drugs that he featured in ""Requiem for a Dream,"" which by the way is a great film. This film is a great departure from that film.<br/><br/>3. Aaronofsky creates this claustrophobic atmosphere in the theater.- Aaronofosky basically pulled a George Lucas number with this film, and that pisses me off because virtually every scene was shot indoors; which means that they were either studio shots or filmed on actual locations, however they went nowhere. Not to mention his lack of lighting at times, which compounds the claustrophobia in the theater. Now, going back to when I say he ""pulled a George Lucas number,"" I mean he has to rely on the fact that he's in a studio for a number of his shots. Part of the reason George Lucas ruined the new Star Wars trilogy was that he hardly ever filmed on actual locations. In Episode IV he filmed quite a bit in Tunisia, and in Episode VI he filmed (don't quote me on this) in Northern California. It angered me that he couldn't find the fair balance between filming on actual locations and studio shots. It's almost hard to identify myself within these super-fantastical locations in the new trilogy, similarly with the locations in ""The Fountain."" I felt cheated in a way. Sure, the space scenes were glamorous and what not.... but that doesn't really explain for the other dark sets.<br/><br/>Sure, the film is somewhat dark. Tommy's wife is dying, etc.; however, there is more than one way to convey a dark tone. I felt like the film went nowhere, and nowhere fast. It was hard to understand what exactly was happening to Tommy towards the end of the film. It wasn't precisely clear within the context of what was going on. Did he die? Was he thinking suicide? If he did die, then I feel cheated because other than the fact that he was approaching Shebulba, there were no distinct signs in his real life that he was dying. I guess if you're a Buddhist you would've enjoyed this film. I suppose he was trying to reach a state of nirvana, which he eventually reaches at the end of the film (hence all the Buddhist archetypes and motifs throughout the film.)<br/><br/>But what about the trailer before the film came out?!?!? ""1500 AD. 2500 AD. 2006 AD."" I thought this was supposed to be a film about how Tommy searches for his love over a journey, or an Odyssey if you will, over a 1000 years. Suuure, that's the way it played out in his wife's book, but what the hell?!?! It had nothing to do with that.... I hope people really re-evaluate this film."
"leckscheid","5","2","5","26 November 2006"," Could have been better
","When I saw the trailers for this movie I was all geared up for it. Then I saw it, and it really was nothing like the trailers implied. It had a tendency to be slow and boring in certain parts. The whole point of the film is to try and deal/cope with death and life. There are 3 story lines, one is fiction, the other two may or may not be in ""real"" time it depends. I have never heard such silence in the theater after a film. It leaves you thinking ""what did I just watch"". While I think that this is NOT THE BEST film ever made like so many people proclaim, I'm glad I went and saw it during the matinée instead of paying full price...that would have been a rip-off. All and all go and see it or rent it, this film may or may not be for you, and don't worry, if you don't ""get it"", you are NOT stupid; regardless of what these crazy IMDb message board people say."
"awdrgfes13","6","2","5","23 November 2006"," gosh darn it
","First of all, I would like to apologize. I am a terrible writer but I think these things need to be said.<br/><br/>This is the reason why an epic shouldn't be 1 hour and 30 minutes. It seemed almost as if Darren Aronofsky assumed I gave a damn about the characters from right at the get go. Though the visuals were stunning and the acting was incredible I still had trouble connecting with the characters. BUT........... I will admit..........the second time I saw the film I was way more involved in the characters emotions...But when it was all said and done I was once again was met with an overwhelming sense of disappointment.............You see.............. My major problem was that to me, this film felt like an epic. Yet I was not given a chance to really connect and understand everything surrounding the characters and how they interact with their enviorment. SO essentially, I saw this film as an epic saga without its roots. It seemed as if the Aronofsky may have pushed his actors to perform so at such a high level knowing that he did not have the time or money to establish these connections in the traditional sense. I felt each individual story was in desperate need of a prequel........ when you have a plot that is as bizarre as this one, the only way to truly capture the audiences attention would be to set the film up with a slightly more traditional structure. I firmly each believe that each story needs its own 15 minutes prequel of quick story telling to help establish each character in a lighter way. Then after that you can pretty much throw us into what is already created and then I think we have a perfect film.............When it is all said and done and I can sum it up with this...................I WANT MORE!!! /sob /cry /pout /Iamgay /Iamsorry"

","The Fountain is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, and it stands as the crowning achievement of Darren Aronofsky's career. This movie is nothing less than an artistic and philosophical masterpiece. Language is incapable of conveying the depth of the ideas contained in Mr. Aronofsky's complex picture, and for that reason alone, many viewers might find the movie perplexing for its indirectness. Nonetheless, the superb direction, acting, and score will keep even the most confused viewers interested and entertained, particularly during the visually captivating space-flight scenes that transcend anything I have seen in cinema. Where the computer animation of most modern sci-fi tends to create a sense of sterile lifelessness, the Fountain's nebula scenes teem with life and motion. During the movie's incredible ending, I actually cried ecstatic tears as I sat in awe. Usually it is is the sadness in a film that brings tears to my eyes, but the emotion this film evoked transcended sadness. Truly fantastic. Bravo, Mr. Aronofsky, bravo!"

","this movie starring Mr. High Jackmen and his theatrics is quite unique. As it talks about this fountain that gives Immortality to whomever that finds it. Then there is a romance in the film that is tied in with the plot which is a good element to the overall plot. I am wondering why Mr. Jackmen has chosen this kind of a role. Quite different from his roles in Xmen or on stage. I would love to see this movie if I had the chance to. Unfortunately It hasn't opened up in Canada. Here in Vancouver we don't get a lot of Indie Films opening up. Or films with small release like this Fountain movie. So by all means go out and see this movie. I personally will when it comes out on DVD."

","As for many things in Aronofskys movies, the visual embodiment is always on the plus side. I unfortunately was awed only by THE visual prowess of this movie, whilst the storyline, character development, time of script, and plot were all sub-par. Alright, I must give credit to the WOW factoid when looking at the 21st century design of the scenes, but other than that, most all was lacking continuity and overall structure.<br/><br/>I definitely loved the jumping between centuries, overlapping imagination and reality, but the falseness and lack of depth within the characters was unnerving. There was absolutely no charisma between Wolverine (oopps) Hugh Jackman (whos emotional outbreaks made him look like he was going to kill somebody, instead of make you feel for his character) and Rachell Weiss. There love story was bland, confusing and relatively boring. As events unfolded, I had no care for her, or her status. I just wanted to see more visual effects. Sad. Reason being? Because no one else in the movie did either. She is ... oh well, anyways ... moving on .... Not powerfully emotional, or structurally, but the power from this movie comes from visual effects and the soundtrack. Both of which are extraordinary."

","Well tonight I saw The Fountain at the Film Kunst Messe in Leipzig. And what can I say, I was so anxious to see this piece, that it felt like Christmas and Eastern coming together, as I sat there full of expectations before they raised the curtain. After all, I loved every single bit of his two other movies, plus my best film buddy has filled me up with trailers, reviews and all that, for the last 10 months. So after the curtain rose, I did my best, to be a good boy and inhale every microsecond of The Fountain, to get a grasp of it all and let it move me to another place. But what can I say it did not always work. Why was it so, was it because I have seen In my Fathers Den yesterday, which gets everything out of little situations, by brilliant acting, a beautiful scenery, a lot of quiet scenes and slow pacing. Or was it because I felt it was all of a bit too much for only one hour and 40 something. In PI he managed to get all this serious distress and all the tension out of almost only one actor and all the beautiful sets and camera moves including a brilliant soundtrack. In Tha Fountain there is just too much and as has been said before, the characters are just not really with you or vice versa. But it's not seriously bad, what really makes me sad is just that a little more time would have solved almost all the problems, if you want to call them that. Since it still is a pretty far out and great movie, it just is not the masterpiece, it could have been. I hope there will be a long version on DVD, since that seems to be the case with most of the epic movies these days, that we get to see the real movie only on DVD. So the cinema-goers don't get bored since they seem to have a really short attention span, in the eyes of the studios and producers that is. I wonder why we even bother to go there in the first place, then. If not to beat up on idiotic munchers, eating noisy food all the way through and forgetting to turn their cellphones of. But I lost track here, Go see the movie and decide for yourself, whether it is the masterpiece, we've all been expecting and wanting it to be so much, till the end, believe me or just not quite."

After six years of directorial silence Darren Aronofsky is back with a combination of a New Age transcendental story and a Love Story (yes, that one) melodrama of a scientist confronted with the death of his dearest one. A script full of coincidences does not honor the career of Darren Aronofsky as a script writer either. The parallel lives story combines with mystic accents and worst of all, is filmed in a rosy video clip style with effects which seem to have been designed ten years before the last 'Star Wars' movies. Fair acting in the two principal roles cannot save the show. This was a real disappointment for me from a director I was expecting much more and who I still hope can do better in the future."

"Grosik_Stim","5","2","6","14 June 2007"," Thin and overrated (at least on IMDb)
","Aronofsky is no Tarkovsky... though it is painfully apparent, after watching this, that he would like to be. I am amazed that the debate surrounding this film (at least on IMDb... theatres and critics didn't feel a need to show it or talk about it for very long) can be boiled down to ""didn't like it"" vs. ""if you didn't like it, you didn't get it"". Well, I got it and I didn't hate it but can't say I think it's worth paying money to see. Far from being ""too complicated"", the problem is that it is too over-simplified. You understand immediately that you are watching a man hell-bent on curing disease and that he has a personal stake in it. It took about a minute to figure out that he will either succeed or learn that he is not god and that things must die in the natural order. Good, that's a 20 minute art film in the short film festival. Now what is the point of the other hour+? Feel free to dispute these points if you question what I am saying: <br/><br/>There is no sub-plot. Period, only 3 variations of the same thing that are not cryptic or obscured in any way. The simple primary theme is the only one you see. No greater allegory, no opposing opinion. Imagine how Cronenberg, Lynch or Kubrick would have handled this film's concept and you'll see what I mean. Watch Pan's Labarynth for an example of how to use dark realism and historical accuracy pitted against fantasy for an allegory with more than one layer.<br/><br/>There are no secondary character relationships. A supervising doctor= never explored, a Fransiscan monk = never explored, etc.. You never really know the story or motivations of anyone else but Tom and he's just not a well-enough-drawn character to sustain 90 minutes on his own (even if you change his name a couple of times).<br/><br/>There is no real conflict presented. This is the most serious flaw due to the fact that there is so much room to explore deeper themes relevant to today's society. How can your main character be an obsessed scientist experimenting on monkeys to find a cure for ""death"" without dealing with (at the very LEAST), issues of animal testing and the Republican party's recent hard line stance on right to die and stem cell issues. This film could have had an emotional impact in a relevant, current way and chose not to. The problem is it didn't do much in the way of a human love story to compensate either.<br/><br/>I know the back story of the filming so I realize that the budget was cut, casting was changed and the original location was scrapped all together. However, this was a story that didn't require a huge budget to tell. It strives for the atmosphere (and by that I mean direct plagiarism) of Tarkovsky, the skewed audio and sound style of Cronenberg and the ""universal theme through time"" that Lynch does better than anyone - but to compare Aronofsky's writing or direction to any of those three (or Kubrick who I mentioned earlier) is just embarrassing. It needed a better script and a deeper vision. This film wasn't complicated, it was far, far too simple to resonate."

","whoever writes a review on this movie making it out to be something special, needs to watch more movies.<br/><br/>quote<br/><br/>""It is true that The Fountain is mostly cinematography (a kind of 2001), but it is no ""vacuous"" film. For one, it is emotionally compelling not only owing to its visuals but also its cast. Tom/Tommy/Tomas is a demanding role for Hugh Jackman to inhibit, but he captures the struggle of his character aptly. Rachel Weisz, too, is appropriately emotive and likable in the story. Togethery they have bubbling chemistry that creates mesmerizing magic, although with splashes of melodrama. The latter can best be attributed to the faltering dialogue that sometimes contains more corn than Kellogg's. This shortcoming is however far from a fatal one (since the film is anything but dialogue-driven) and between the meaningful glances, the expert navigation of the parallel dreamworlds and the epic score, The Fountain stays afloat with assured direction.

Having my past encounter with the flowery reviews of Fountain here in IMDb.com my world in viewing this film turned incontestably up side down. No wonder I tried patiently to understand what the film is trying to convey to its viewers, but I got a hard time to discover its bewildering plotÂ—that eventually stayed to be a puzzle till the end, a complete mystery! Yeah it talks about the expression through artistic presentation the means here in the actual life, however I hate abstract presentation that would totally twist my brain nerves and finally would give me an intense headache. I would not want to be presumptuous to like the movie at all, I love Hugh Jackman all the time, he is a good pair for Rachel Weisz as well, I guess so the nature of the movie have inverted my taste in giving extravagant criticism. I like the simplicity of every character's gear and the setting seems to apply as well of its aesthetic moods. However the shift of the story continue to bother me and baffled my mind eternallyÂ—there was one moment were I thought the movie already ended but I didn't left my seat earlier because my attention was caught by the upcoming movie trailers, and after watching the movie trailers a part of the movie suddenly appears and started whole over again with another perplexing plotÂ…phew! Even this moment writing my commentary bores me as wellÂ…how tedious.<br/><br/>I could get a better understanding of the movie if I could seize an original copy in a right cheaper price, hoping I could entrust myself to what the film is really trying to expressÂ—or maybe forget it anyway."
"zetes","9","2","6","4 December 2006"," I may not have been entirely won over, but I certainly was wowed!
","May be a ways down from perfection, but with such an ambitious project, that's more than understandable, as well as forgivable. It's a poetic, impressionistic mood piece on the desperation of man to escape death, told over three intermingled, interrelated stories, one of a Spanish conquistador, one of a modern experimental doctor and the final of a man in the distant future, hurdling through space. I don't quite like what Aronofsky's solution is, that death is a new version of life. As an atheist, I have a more existential dilemma when it comes to death, and Aronofsky's new-age-y thoughts on the subject are no more helpful than Christianity's. I may disagree with the film's thesis in part, but what I cannot disagree with is how outstanding a film it is. I would take it over almost any other film released this year, certainly most of the best reviewed ones Â– it honestly kicks The Queen's ass. It looks and feels, and even sounds like almost no other film I've seen. The visuals are absolutely astounding (and done without an ounce of CGI, so they have a uniqueness to them). Even the non-sci-fi or historical parts have extremely beautiful visuals. The musical score, by Clint Mansell, is easily the best work of the year. The film really does engulf you in its remarkable aura, like the bubble in which Hugh Jackson travels through space. And the theme of trying to reverse a loved one's mortality is always a powerful one, and something that will stand the test of time. My prediction is, although this seems to be a colossal financial failure on first release, that The Fountain will become a favorite of a lot of people as time moves on."

Because, when you see it with a date, you can assume the role of ""intellectuals"", and produce good conversation about the ""hiddean meanings"" and ""sweeping allegories"" behind this surprisingly linear, straightforward movie. With ""Pi"", director Darren Aronofsky burst onto the scene. He is admittedly is an incredible talent with a deliciously oddball imagination, which is unfortunately is colossal disappointment. Aronofsky's dream project, the story of three characters (all played by Hugh Jackman) from three different time periods, who are searching for a miracle to save the one they love (all played by Aronofsky partner Rachel Weisz), was cut to ribbons by the studio, who sliced the budget and edited the film. This is supposed to be a thinking man's sci-fi movie, ala ""2001"" or ""Solaris"", but instead, it just heaps on layers of ""complexity"" so that you will come out of the movie with a feeling that the filmmakers pulled a fast one on you, when in fact the story is ridiculously simple. The acting is excellent. Ellen Burtsyn is Oscar-worthy as Jackman's boss, and Weisz infuses all of her characters with layers of heart and soul. As for Jackman, he gives an engrossing performance, and keeps a straight face during the movies final quarter, during which he ascends towards the stars in the lotus position, concealed in a giant bubble with only a dying tree for company. The film also looks magnificent, with luscious cinematography by Matthew Libatique. The score by Clint Mansell and prog rockers Mogwai is beautiful. But all the well-done odds and ends still add up to an average film. Maybe we will get Aronofsky's cut on DVD. Until then, this one is not worth your time."

","The Fountain (2006): Dir: Darren Aronofsky / Cast: Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz, Ellen Burstyn, Sean Patrick Thomas, Mark Margolis: Darren Aronofsky's followup to Requiem for a Dream about our inner desire to live. Hugh Jackman plays a scientist out to discover the cure for death thus giving birth to eternal life. He is fueled with the terminal illness of his wife. Although this is quite detail and compelling it must be noted that death is eventual to everyone and that eternal life lies beyond depending on one's choice while alive. There are Biblical references to the Garden of Eden although facts are scripturally warped. Requiem for a Dream is a masterpiece and although Aronofsky doesn't match it here, he does have fun with the visual elements that illuminate the screen. It seems to conclude that death conquers or that there are no answers. The difference is that Requiem for a Dream concluded with a reality check while The Fountain is far more depressing. Jackman is superb as a scientist out to reclaim his wife but only encounters the reality of death. Rachel Weisz plays his wife who remains uplifting despite her obvious destiny. Supporting roles are cardboard including Ellen Burstyn and Sean Patrick Thomas who are fine actors subdued with pompous writing. Strong theme regarding the mystery of death and one's desire to live.

With Izzi on her death bed, the couple imagines space traveler Tommy (Hugh Jackman) in a biosphere with the Tree of Life.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has created beautiful chaotic art in pieces. It is visually amazing. If the theme is the transcendence of love, then the movie is fine. There is some religious imagery that could go the wrong way especially with the Mayan holy man. The weaving in and out of flashbacks and flashforwards of the three timelines drains the blood from the body of the movie. It's a beautiful piece of art to look at but not a great story to embrace."

","Darren Aronofsky's movies are surely great in doing mood depictions and keeping the consistency on it. We see constant rebellion and self indulgence in Requiem for a Dream, constant reluctance within obedience in Noah, and here we see fervent strife even though there's no hope. As an atheist Aronofsky nicely developed his ideas and presented them to the screen and still keeping his sense of atheism. Yet this movie toyed with the sense of hope as the final conflict draws near. It presents the audience with disappointments at all levels of the story. Also I really like how the movie weaves the three sub stories together by using the back and forth story flow. The acting overall is a very nice job. Hugh Jackman proved here that he's not only great at action and superhero movies but also for emotional drama movies. Rachel Weisz did also great, especially in keeping the emotions at all those extra close zoom takes."

","Among its wonderful movies, this one an exception. And I believe if Aronofsky had shot Batman, we would be missing this one. Just like ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""The Fountain"" is an emotionally intense movie and Aronofsky perfectly defines ""love"" in its pure form in a strong manner. Although the movie highly refers to religious contents (I believe), it deals with the events, feelings and imaginations we find in a daily life. The topic of an ""eternal life"" is so well described that the movie shows we're missing what is in front of us, or behind us. The flashbacks from the very start gives you the idea how the movie/script will lead to, however it somehow surprises when it gives the key answer sought in the movie, or in our daily life. The book written in the film enhances the storyline of the movie while complementing the main ideas another simultaneously. Not to forget, in addition to the ones above, the acting was amazing thanks to the strong brand-names. Very strong, very intense masterpiece. A very well-narrated theme with a different perspective.

"rajatdahiyax","6","1","2","23 May 2015"," Despite its flaws, it's still worth watching.
","Requiem for a Dream director Darren Aronofsky switches gears from drug-induced urban malaise to abstract science fiction with this time-tripping symbolic tale of a man's thousand-year quest to save the woman he loves. Moving between representational stories and images, this meditation on life and death focuses on the concept of the mythical Tree of Life that is said to bestow immortality to all who drink of its sap. In one of the film's allegorical timelines, a 16th century Spanish conquistador played by Hugh Jackman sets out to find the tree in order to save his queen (Rachel Weisz) from the Inquisition. Another conceptual story finds Jackman centuries later, struggling with mortality as a modern-day scientist desperately searching for the medical breakthrough that will save the life of his cancer-stricken wife, Izzi. The third and most abstract concept finds Jackman as a different incarnation of the same character-idea, this time questing for eternal life within the confines of a floating sphere transporting the aged Tree of Life through the depths of space. Even more avant-garde than his breakthrough film Pi, The Fountain finds Aronofsky almost completely abandoning conventional story structure in favor of something more cinematically abstract. Though the film was originally slapped with an R by the MPAA, Aronofsky and co. re- edited it to conform to a PG- 13 rating."

","""What if you could live forever?"" - Every decade or so there are a few films that are so challenging, so intangible and so personally felt by their creators that they are often unfairly and ignorantly dismissed as ""too hard to understand"" or ""don't make any sense"". Nonsense. The joy for me in these type of films is exactly that, the deep contemplation and soul shifting thought and feeling that comes along with viewing something that makes you feel that certain way. Life itself almost never makes sense, so why should art? In any case, this is my favourite Darren Aronofsky film, and in my top five of all time. It is an undefinable tone poem which diligently follows the path of two souls bound to each other by cosmic love (Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weiscz). They cross cross each other's trajectories through 1300 Spain during the brutal Inquisition, through to 2002 Midwest America, and on into a future so far in the distance that consciousness has become a dreamy, spherical bubble floating eerily through a vast expansive universe. I myself don't understand much of what is going on, in any traditional sense, but that doesn't stop me from loving every frame of what I see, and letting the atmosphere, performances and themes transport me into the elemental, affecting way the film operates. Aronofsky has ingeniously avoided CGI by filming microscopic materials floating in Petri dishes, and superimposing the images over his scenes set in outer space. The effect is mesmerizing. Clint Mansell provides an almost holy score, which is just haunting to here alongside the images we see on screen. Jackman and Weiscz are the beating heart of it, and are both incredibly moving, especially in a climactic, impossible to describe ending which will glue your jaw to the floor. A true gem, doesn't feel as much like a movie, just the cosmic forces of nature and the universe at work."

","We all know Darren Aronofsky is a specific figure in the world of cinema. His movies are distinguished for their controversy, surreal plots, morality and just the way they are produced. I would say Aronofsky's films are for thinking people, for people who are able to see beyond the obvious things.<br/><br/>My first acquaintance with his production was the movie Requiem for a dream, 2000. I was shocked, impressed and confused at the same time by this film. It is not just a typical movie, it is more than that. It has a strong hidden message that you discover while watching it. Then I watched Black Swan, 2010. Since then I understood that I fell in love with this director. I heard a lot of The Fountain, 2006. There were a lot of both positive and negative reviews. I guess this is one of the factors that indicate the movie is not plain and has something that attracts people's attention and makes them talk about it. Finally, I watched it myself.<br/><br/>During the first scenes you understand you don't understand anything: you see a conquistador fighting against Maya tribe and his queen, then, you see a bald man talking to a tree, this scene is suddenly interrupted by an episode showing the talk between a husband and his wife. When, in the very beginning, you see the change of these episodes, you can barely find out what are they for and what is the main idea of this movie will be. And this is where you want to turn it off and do some different stuff. But if you continue watching, you start seeing what the director wants to show us and you understand all these episodes are connected to each other.<br/><br/>The central idea of the movie is that Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cure for his wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz) who is dying from cancer. He tries to fight death. While Tom is busy with his search, Izzy writes a book about Queen Isabella who loses her territories and influence, and her loyal conquistador Tomas Verde goes to the Central America to find the Tree of Life for his Queen. Izzy doesn't finish it. Before she dies, she asks Tom to finish the last chapter of her book. And the third story represents an astronaut Tommy traveling in the space in an enclosed biosphere with the Tree of Life. In all of these story lines the lead roles are performed by Hugh Jackman (Tom Creo, conquistador Tomas Verde, astronaut Tommy) and Rachel Weisz (Izzy, Queen Isabella, Tree of Life). And, in my opinion, these three stories represent Tom's search for the cure, and their message is that no matter how much you try to escape the death, you can't hide from it. The death of the Tree of Life, Conquistador and Izzy shows that very well. It's a natural process that you should accept and don't fight. The refuse of it doesn't make any sense. There can be other interpretations of this movie. It's individual. That was how I understood director's message.<br/><br/>I can't say this is the movie for a broad audience due to its complex and deep plot. If you understand Darren's work and like stories with controversy and hidden sense, you should watch The Fountain. Otherwise, you will be bored by it."

","Just kidding.<br/><br/>It is, however, a little melodramatic and preachy in places, and the same slow, mournful string concertos played over and over again in the background tend to overdo the intended mood of THE FOUNTAIN. Another thing: Most of the setting is in the darkness of a medical lab, outdoors at night, or in the depths of outer space. There are reasons for this, of course, but all the darkness requires the audience to adjust their senses and heightens the somber mood even more. Just a little more daylight and humor in key places would have been a plus.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, THE FOUNTAIN intelligently takes on some big heady concepts, most importantly, our desire for immortality. As medical researcher Tommy explains, ""Death is a disease, just like any other. There is a cure, and I will find it!"" Does he succeed? It's all debatable, and THE FOUNTAIN does a nice job of showing and telling us just enough while also leaving just enough for the individual viewer to interpret. There are a number of interesting hints regarding the possibility of reincarnation and, barring that, how we live on regardless of whether we continue to live physically and literally.<br/><br/>THE FOUNTAIN seems like another obscurantist trying-too-hard-to-be-brilliant film at first, but if you stick with it past the initial 10-15 minutes, the three interrelated past-present-future stories come together very well. A number of other reviewers have described this film as ""a poem,"" and I agree. That being the case, it should appeal to people who like poetry, but those who want a standard movie-film may be a little disconcerted by THE FOUNTAIN."

"Manal1987","9","1","2","11 April 2011"," An epiphany-like experience
","My second viewing of this hauntingly beautiful movie. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is a rare diamond no doubt! Because to be able to create a story that delves deep into the meaning of our existence, and laden it with heavy symbols, then turn it into such sensuous film, definitely requires a lot of genius. <br/><br/>The Fountain tackles the idea of life and death as a cycle; from death, life blooms.. just like a fountain. Thus, eternity becomes a possible conception through three parallel stories that finally come together in the end. I hate to think of these stories as past/present/future, although it is indicated they are so. The ""present"" is the main plot line which tells the story of Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) who tries to save his dying cancer-stricken wife Izz Creo (Rachel Weisz). Tom does not accept death and thinks of it as a curable disease, something which is reflected in the ""future"" world in which Tom sits by a dying tree wishing that he could cure it. This future plot line reflects the present Tom's mentality which evolves and comes to understand the truth with Izzi's death. As for the ""past"" plot line, it basically reflects Izzi's point of view; her understanding and acceptance of death and her search for spiritual eternity, just as the Queen's. And the fact that she left this story unfinished to be completed by her husband shows her desire to make him understand and join her in this spiritual eternity, that is why she frequently appeared in Tom's future/mental world to urge him to finish the story.. to understand. <br/><br/>The Cinematography was phenomenal that watching the movie felt like having a beautiful dream. Clint Mansell's epic music also helped to accentuate this effect. Rachel Weisz was amazing and angelic as always, and Hugh Jackman gave his 'best' performance so far! I was literally blown away by his overwhelming passion and his love for his wife."

","You can love or hate this movie - it's simply enough. There's no between. It's been almost 6 years since movie release, and I watched it few days back after my friend gave it to me on DVD as a gift. This is my thanks to him. I love you man.<br/><br/>Whatsoever, movie is not a love story as sold as in today's world; it is not a love story that have two characters who fight each other and at the end they realize it was all worthless and they live happily ever after. This movie is journey; journey to find yourself, your doubts and fears, your passions and what you really are. As far as my eye can see, this is one of the best love stories ever, even if focus isn't fully on the love story. Story is more realistic than 99% of the other ""romantic"" movies. However, through the film we follow three parallel worlds, three parallel totally different stories, yet so similar. A man who's afraid to die and who search a way for eternity is not a man; it's just a figure that will lead a man to final knowledge - there is no eternity. <br/><br/>Acting in this movie was beyond acting. Forget all world-wide famous actors and actress - Rachel and Jackson are two actors worth remembering. Their performance made this movie even better than it is. I often just leave my ""review"" on films I love, because I think that if I don't like something I cannot judge it. But that's just me ... As I said on very beginning, you can hate or love this movie. This is not a movie filled with actions or scenes that will scare the s*** out of you or something like that - this is movie that will emote emotionless man if he can understand the whole concept in this movie. These types of movies have been forgotten and that's what bothers me most. As as 16y old kid as me, you assume that I hated this movie because I love to see killing and stuff; no, hell no. Maybe I am different, maybe I am not - I don't care. I prefer reality above fantasy, for reality this is. Don't be fooled by the space and the flying bubble - those are just elements to make this movie better; this movie is reality of death, life and loss, and how we should embrace what life brings, for all that life brings we cannot just ignore. <br/><br/>The movie is full of passion, provoking thoughts and ideas - and yet it's so simple for people who're not blinded by what is sold today. It is not just a love story between two people, it's a story of human itself, about how we accept what will come, today, tomorrow or after ten, fifty or hundred years. As the one of final quotes in movie is ""I'm going to die"" says, we are going to die - and that's what bothers most our population, humanity indeed. <br/><br/>Without doubt, masterpiece. It should be in top5 movies of all time; it is, but those blind wouldn't allow."
"Theothervip","10","1","2","27 January 2011"," You just have to see it again!
","Rating: **** out of 4.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's THE FOUNTAIN was such a disappointment on his part that, eventually, it's bound to inspire a few defenders who think differently from the not-too-impressed critics and audiences. You can include me there! I just saw THE FOUNTAIN a few days a go and thought it was great; a movie that may demand multiple viewings for it to sink through and you can count on it, I will see it again! One of the things Aronofsky wanted for THE FOUNTAIN, like its own main character, was for it to remain timeless. People might look at THE FOUNTAIN today and find it confusing, difficult, and rather odd, but art is sometimes like that. A work of art is not evaluated immediately; a true work of art stands the test of time and I think THE FOUNTAIN could prove itself to be a future classic. Right now, it's an immensely underrated but lovingly defended film for a more thoughtful and patient audience. It's certainly bigger, in scale and budget, that Aronofsky's earlier efforts, but it packs the same punch and is bound to find more audiences in the future as those films had.<br/><br/>The story unfolds in three separate time frames. Dr. Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) is a scientist desperately finding a cure for the tumor that's slowly killing his wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz), but too much time working sets him apart from his already dying spouse. Rewind a thousand or so years, and an almost similar tale unfolds with a conquistador (also played by Jackman) searching for the Tree of Life in a hidden Mayan temple for his Queen (also Weisz). Meanwhile, in the far future, a space traveler (Jackman--with a bald head) protects the Tree of Life concealed inside a space bubble, taking it to the Xibalba Nebula where, it is said, stars go to be reborn. So it's part historical epic, part sci-fi, and all love story, or at least a story about love and a quest to save it that spans across time.<br/><br/>Jackman and Weisz may not be the most compelling couple ever, but they make their characters work and we believe that there is love between these two. Ellen Burstyn provides some excellent support (this is her 2nd time working with Aronofsky, after REQUIEM FOR A DREAM). Clint Mansell's score is alluring, mysterious and at time simply beautiful. The stunning cinematography and the use of lighting all play a significant part in telling the story, something that's best saved for more discussions to come.<br/><br/>So if you haven't seen it yet, give this underrated masterpiece a shot. Never mind the critics on this one and judge it for yourself. You might be surprised at what you get here."
"pontifikator","Null","1","2","18 January 2010"," A mystery: Why is the search for the Tree of Life called ""The Fountain""?
","Darren Aronofsky wrote the screenplay and directed this film. It's beautifully filmed, but a mishmash of a story. I believe the confusion arises because of a detail that is a spoiler, so I'll put that at the end. <br/><br/>The trailer and advertising of the film market ""The Fountain"" as science fiction, and that's dead wrong. It's an aching romance story hanging on a quest.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays Tomas, a doctor trying desperately to find a cure for cancer. His wife Isabel, played by Rachel Weisz, is suffering from the disease and has only a short time to live. She asks for more time with him and gives him a book she's written; he opens the handbound volume and begins to read as she sleeps.<br/><br/>We are taken from the present to Ferdinand and Isabella and the quest for the discovery of the Tree of Life in the New World, inhabited by the precolumbian, prechristian ""natives,"" and Tomas is now a conquistador, relentless and heartless in his search. Later we find ourselves in the far future, where Tomas still searches for the Tree of Life. Then we return to the present as Tomas plants a seed at his wife's grave.<br/><br/>Much happens despite my short description. This may be a film of the magical realism genre (or maybe not - who can tell?) where Aronofsky created a reality in which desire and longing can change reality. The problem is that the film remains indecipherable at normal viewing levels, and we're left with an experience more like 2001: A Space Odyssey - we leave breathless over the experience but clueless over what it meant. It's a great looking movie, but it may not make a lot of sense. I'd compare it to Donnie Darko - Aranofsky left too much out. But here's where my suspicion comes into play.<br/><br/>SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br/><br/>In the opening scenes, we see Isabel ask for time with Tomas, and he's too busy. He gives her short shrift and sends her away so that he can continue his research. His research fails, of course, and Isabel dies. But that scene is shown three times, and in the repetitions, the rejection is softened, then eliminated. At the end, Tomas plants a seed at her grave that grows into a tree. The seed he plants, however, is not a seed but a dead husk. It's planted in the dead of winter. It cannot grow into a tree. My suspicion is that the film is Tomas's restructuring of his memory of his life. His search for a cure failed, he failed his wife by devoting nothing to her when she was dying, and Tomas is creating a fantasy where he spent his time where it would have done good - in loving care of his wife.<br/><br/>The conquistador's search and the futurist's search for the saving tree of life are metaphors of course for the physician's search for a cure. The problem is that all three searches are doomed to failure. The search is for the benefit of the searcher, and Isabel is left to fend for herself. My final question is whether this ever sank in for Tomas, whether he realized his quest was better left undone, that Isabel should have mattered more. I think this is an issue broader than the movie, and if Aranofsky had been able to get this more front and center he would have had a great movie. When the quest becomes more important than the person, tragedy ensues."

The representations of stellar space and nebulae (together with a fantastic martial arts sequence, Jackman's silhouette superimposed onto a canopy of stars)is incomparable with most cgi, imaginative fantasy, not realism, being the aspiration. The movement through time and space creates brilliant parallels and manufactures the sense that the moral is a comment on the human condition as a whole.

"d-zegura","9","1","2","3 February 2009"," The ""Present"" as linear and real -- Not!
","I watched the Fountain recently to complete my Aronofsky phase. I enjoyed the movie. No doubt there are a host of important themes explored: timeless love, death, grief, acceptance, renewal and more.<br/><br/>I will watch the film again before I make a judgment about which, if any, of the three time periods is ""real"". But in skimming the many comments here (and in some select reviews from RT), I had a reaction to what seems to be the predominant interpretation of the film. Namely that the ""present"" in the film is the ""real world"" and the past and future scenes are fiction.<br/><br/>The commentators that argue that only the scenes set in the ""present"" in the Fountain are ""real"" (and the past and future scenes are all from Izzy's book as finished by Tom) are based on the premise that the present scenes are grounded in reality as opposed to the fantastic flights of fancy of the Conquistador and Space Bubble scenes (which are, again, all fiction from Izzy and Tom's pens).<br/><br/>I question that assumption.<br/><br/>To me, the ""present"" scenes are no less riddles and symbolic than the other time periods.<br/><br/>Consider that in the ""present"" the film returns no less than three times to a moment of choice: Izzy comes to Tom's office door to tell Tom that the first snow has arrived and invites him to walk with her.<br/><br/>The first time, Tom (ever the committed scientist) decides NOT to walk with his terminally ill wife (who apparently has only days to live) but instead brushes her off, somewhat brusquely. Hmm. Interesting choice. Tom is pretty obsessed, you say.<br/><br/>Tom does this because a monkey has its chest cut open awaiting experimental surgery and Tom just NEEDS to operate on one more monkey (at the rate he appears to be going through monkeys, it is unclear why he thinks this surgery will be any different from the countless ones before it). OK, well and good.<br/><br/>But what happens next? The surgery is going badly -- so Tom just happens to remember that strange tree bark sample in the lab (from Central America, no less. Interesting coincidence...).<br/><br/>With the precision of a supercomputer, Eureka!!! Tom intuits from thin air that the molecular structure of this forgotten tree bark will fit perfectly (like lovers ""top and bottom"") with the monkey's bio-chemistry. The computer instantly confirms what Tom somehow worked out in his head on a timely whim outside the operating room. Really?<br/><br/>So, like any other irrational (bordering on mad) scientist, Tom gives the wonder drug to the monkey -- which turns out to cure aging. But Tom's preoccupation with his dying wife is so strong that he dismisses the discovery of the single most important medical breakthrough in history. Why? Because, while the monkey is now hopping happily around having literally been restored to youth by the magical, mysterious tree bark (from Central America), the monkey's tumor is not in remission (no, Tom should have waited a day or two to find that the drug also cures brain tumors).<br/><br/>And, having discovered and then ignored the cure for aging, Tom's wedding ring disappears into thin air in a sterile pre-op room (a ring that we already know has heavy symbolism).<br/><br/>Yep, it's all reality in the here and now! <br/><br/>Later in the film, Tom revisits that decision point again, in an apparent flashback. To walk in the snow with my dying wife or conduct the medical experiment that leads to a miracle cure, but not soon enough to save my dying wife; that is the question. Tom makes the same decision -- open up that monkey.<br/><br/>But the third time, Tom makes a different decision. He pushes past the breathless co-worker yelling about the monkey on the operating table. Instead, this time Tom simply goes with Izzy for a walk in the snow.<br/><br/>If Tom takes this path, presumably there is no tree bark miracle cure for the monkey. And much of the supposedly ""linear"" and ""real"" story of the ""present"" (for example, the internal strife with the lab staff and his boss about the discovery of the miracle cure) goes Poof.<br/><br/>Indeed, why would Tom later rave at Izzy's funeral that he was going to cure death? If the first decision point was ""true"" then Tom has already stopped aging and brain cancer (at least in one monkey -- not a bad start!) I like the idea that Tom simply decided to walk in the snow with his dying wife. They spent the moment together and the ""miracle monkey cure"" branch of the story is just as much magical realism from Izzy and Tom's book as the past and future scenes.<br/><br/>Or perhaps Tom didn't walk with Izzy in the first snow, but only later wishes that he had.<br/><br/>I certainly would have preferred to walk in the snow with my soon to be deceased wife over brushing the dying woman off, then watch her die a couple of days later (and only then to find out mere moments after her death that a cure was at hand). That path leads to a very cruel ""reality"" -- as if losing a spouse to cancer was not bad enough.<br/><br/>I don't know which path Tom chose, but either way, the ""present"" is just as filled with trap doors and paradox as the rest of the film.<br/><br/>None of The Fountain is ""real"". It's all fiction.<br/><br/>In the end, the film may not be anything more than Aronofsky having some fantastic, but disparate ideas, which he melded together in a Romance/Sci Fi genre to explore the themes mentioned above. <br/><br/>A lot of acclaimed magical-realism novels are based on less."
"shannon-weiss","10","1","2","14 December 2008"," A Beautiful Symbol
","The Fountain compounds exquisitely beautiful visuals with a richly complex narrative in order to create a style that is entirely fresh and unique. Three parallel stories unfold, each following a separate plot line. The filmmaker allows the archetypal fear and mystery surrounding death to stitch the three stories together, even though they exist as separate entities until the very last moment. The stories cross at key points when the metaphoric importance of all three transcends the individual reality of any given story. The result is mesmerizing to the point of distraction but if careful thought is applied the three stories blend more closely and combine to illustrate the potential for beauty to be found in death.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays the lead role in each of the three subplots: Tommy is a medical researcher who searches desperately for death's cure in hopes of saving his wife from an anonymous and fatal disease. He utilizes elements taken from trees to formulate a medicine to counteract the aging process. Tomas is a conquistador who must discover the tree of life in the name of his queen at which point she will be released from captivity and her fears of being overtaken will subside. In the third story, Jackman travels through space in a bubble that carries both him and a dying tree toward a dying star. If his love can prolong the trees life until the star is reached than both the star and the tree will discover eternity. Rachel Weisz plays Jackman's counterpart in all three stories: Izzi seeks the answers to her unrelenting questions about death in ancient Mayan legends as her husband's research pulls him further away from her own spiritual journey. Isabel is a queen who beseeches her beloved conquistador to find the tree of life and to save her kingdom from destruction. And in the third story, Izzi appears as a figure from a memory yet it is also assumed that her spirit thrives within the tree.<br/><br/>In each of the three narratives, Jackman's character fails to accomplish his apparent goal. As a doctor he discovers a cure for his wife's ailment too late and is forced to bury her. The conquistador faces warring tribal forces that eliminate his men and kill his religious leader. The tree within the bubble dies just as the star is to be mounted. In each of the stories Jackman enters a period of mourning as he begins to doubt both himself and the stability of the world around him. At the end of the film, the conquistador fights his way into the temple where the tree of life is held captive. As he enters the sacred place he is consumed by the tree and is reborn as part of the earth. <br/><br/>In practical terms, the film can be viewed as the plight of two characters dissecting their feelings toward death. Each of the subplots conveys their perspectives, represented by imagined narratives that are easier for each troubled character to dissect. Izzi writes the story of the conquistador and queen as a gift to her husband that he might better understand her comfort toward dying. The story within the bubble metaphorically represents Tommy's desire to protect his wife as she dies; his doubts and fears are symbolized by the great emptiness of space. As Tommy reads his wife's book he battles his own demons so that, at the end of the film, all three stories are resolved at once. When the conquistador becomes a part of the world he fulfills the Mayan legend that Izzi was so infatuated with. All three of Jackman's characters are eventually able to overcome the fears that exist when one is faced with death as death is eventually viewed as a rebirth. The three stories converge at this point to illustrate that Tommy is finally able to accept his wife's death as something beautiful as it allows her to become part of the world for all time. The film is not merely poignant in terms of its honesty toward human emotions but it is a rarity in its metaphoric depiction of life. The three stories are shown to follow the same path since life and death are entirely universal experiences. The Fountain is a mesmerizing and thought provoking experience that is highly recommended although two screenings are suggested given the complexity of the film."

Another thing I appreciate about this movie is that it is completely original, it has almost no elements borrowed from other movies, oldies, newbies or such. It contains no clichÃ©s, and no sweet touches in order to be preferred by audiences with narrow minds. The Fountain's subject is quite a controversial one thus it is extremely hard to decipher.

","A Scifi drama film that is very unique and interesting. This film depicts a complex subject that everyone thinks about and talks about. Eternal life, and whether it is out there for us to have. The film at first was confusing because it went back and forth constantly from past to present and then future. The filmmaker is talking about the meaning of life in this film and eternal life. He sets up the characters trying to find eternal life searching for the tree of life. Plants have a very important role in this film and in real life. This character is looking for eternal life because of his dying wife. The director uses love to drive this film. He is saying love and life go hand and hand. Throughout this whole film the filmmaker tells this story effectively and it did have an impact on me. The filmmaker sets up three different unique worlds put into one. The way the story was setup it is believable that eternal life is out there. This film is a little bit of everything. Scifi, drama, action and touches a little on religion. This film really made me think about life, God and love."

It's worth wading through all the drek that's out there if once in a great while you find a film like this.The Fountain is amazing. Ambitious and truly felt it has a cathartic feel to it. Full marks to all involved. I can't say I'm surprised that Aronfsky was capable of this- it's just that I'm surprised anyone is this good. Not a film for everyone- it demands that you give yourself over to it. And you will probably find you either get it- or you don't...(you know, kind of like life)."

","This movie was pretty different from most I've seen - but in a really good kind of way. It was emotional, visually impressive and presented in a very unique manner. It was kind of a work of art.<br/><br/>The story is about a medical doctor/researcher whose wife is dying of a tumor. He is desperately working on finding a cure, when something else is discovered ... and the story progresses from there.<br/><br/>Given the setup, the movie has an emotionally intense / serious tone. It is presented from three different vantage points: the core plot, a visualization of what's going on in the doctor's mind, and a visualization of a book the doctor's wife is writing.<br/><br/>The visualizations in this movie are pretty stunning. When combined with the classical-type music the combined effect is very poetic. I will probably remember some of the haunting visuals for a long time.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good, serious and meditative fantasy/sci-fi movie - here it is.

","I had very big expectations when I rented the movie, partially owing to ""Requiem for a Dream"". He is definitely a great actor but I felt lots of things in the production of this movie is rushed. And I understand it considering the financial difficulties that they had producing it (see extras in the DVD version). First of all the ideology behind the movie and the atmosphere is almost perfect. The scenes are so perfect that you don't even need any motion. You could just take a snap-shot of any scene and hang it on your wall. Especially the decision not to use ""Computer Graphics"" was a very good one. I am interested in science a lot and the realism of this movie is astonishing (owing to the CG decision). And these two things are the only two positive thoughts I had and they are enough alone to rate this movie, an eight. However I felt a lot disappointed when I saw that: (1) The acting was almost terrible (with a feeling of insincerity) in some scenes, but very good in others. (2) there is a scene where they used a doll as the stunt and it is very obvious to such a degree that it ruins all realism for the next ten minutes. (3) i found repeats of the past scenes boring. (4) lots of scene connection problems, no logic whatsoever in switching between time frames. (although they are done artfully). i understood what was going on fully in the second watch. As a summary, this movie is great but i can smell the financial problems and the rush in it. Requiem for a Dream was perfect, this one isn't."

"annoman","7","1","2","16 July 2007"," An inspired article in an over-expensive, mostly uninspired, era of cinema.
","Darren Aronofsky, through his long and tedious struggle to bring his most cherished script to the screen, had accumulated some serious hype around what would eventually become 'The Fountain.' Just under seven years from its conception in the mind of the film's young leader, Aronofsky's richly imaginative story of everlasting love, biblical symbolism, mortality, and boundless metaphysical possibilities hit the Cannes Film Festival with divided acclaim.<br/><br/>'The Fountain' starts with a 16th century Spanish conquistador named Tomas (Jackman), who appears to have come across a hidden temple, which rightfully rests amidst the thick ripe foliage of the jungle's core. Subsequent to the slaughter of his miniature battalion, Tomas fights his way through a heavy pack of temple guards, then climbs a steep slope of stairs to reach his desired pyramid's peak. Upon scaling the tall side of the lost temple, the film takes a spontaneous turn into a world of wondrous nothing, where we find a clean-shaven Hugh Jackman in an ecospheric-like bubble, floating toward a golden nebula in the vast realm of outer space.<br/><br/>Just before the film could possibly become any more confusing, it swings back to a present day world, where oncologist, Dr. Tommy Creo, has been sleeplessly perusing the potential effects of the contents of a tree in Guatemala, which could stop the continuation of cancerous tumors and rejuvenate their victims. Of course, what would this ""love story"" be without the dying, cancer-stricken wife to motivate the tormented scientist-husband? The premise of the flick, being as dubious as would potentially seem, never reaches a melodramatic staleness; in fact, it prospers from its simple, yet intricate, story of undying love. In little time, 'The Fountain' saves itself from disaster, as it finally comes together, piece by piece, and finishes an open-minded work of art, rather than another box-office blunder. Aronofsky's intentions envelope in the thoughts of each viewer, as the journey closes with doors that remain open; and do so in a semi-satisfying quest to provoke questions and lengthy discussions with all movie-goers who shared its viewing.<br/><br/>The positives of the picture bask in their gorgeous surrealism, and flow through viewers with poetical sage. Captained by its veteran actor, Hugh Jackman, and supported well enough by Academy Award-winning actress Rachel Weisz, the ostentatious ship of visual wonders that was 'The Fountain,' succeeds as a summer trip to the movies with its unmatched creativity and fine direction; from the only director who could have pulled off such an inspired article in our over-expensive, mostly uninspired, era of cinema. To unleash one's intellectual inventiveness is to see 'The Fountain;' dismissing any flaws in film-conception and appreciating where it all came from."
"Gordon-11","Null","1","2","13 July 2007"," Visually rich
","This film is about a relationship that spans 3 different time eras: the past Mayan civilisation, present day and the future.<br/><br/>The Fountain is visually very rich. It has all sorts of visual effects, the most impressive being the final scenes of spirituality. The lights, the auras and the bubbles are mystic, and yet tranquil. There is a lot of imagery in the film that will probably take a lot of viewings to understand. At first, I found the film rather confusing, but slowly everything falls into place and I enjoyed the film a lot more than initially. It is not a traditional science fiction or romance movie. It is as groundbreaking as the previous Aranofsky films ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream""."
"dusty-windom","9","1","2","13 July 2007"," Very Interesting Way of Dealing
","I was very intrigued by the idea of this movie when I first heard of it, so I watched it. It's definitely a movie that must be watched a quiet, distraction-free time. Otherwise, it will become difficult to follow and understand. That said, I am glad I watched it.<br/><br/>I saw this movie as not a science-fiction, or a romance, as I have seen comments stating. It's not really about time travel, either. To me, this movie is one man's dealing with the death of a loved one AND his own death.<br/><br/>The use of the past and future lives is his way of dealing. In the past life, he is fighting death. Witness his fighting the Mayan priest. To the end, he fights death, even as he drinks of the tree. I found it rather ironic that, in his past life, drinking from the tree of life DID give him new life - just not in the way one would have thought.<br/><br/>In his future life, he is still fighting death, prolonging his life through the tree, but in the end he deals with it, and he comes to terms - not only with the death of his loved one, but his own death. As per the myth, he sacrifices himself (accepts death) to give life back to the tree.<br/><br/>The present life is the transmission from fighting death to accepting death. Tommy still fights it, but Izzie, who was afraid at first (bathtub scene), accepts death at the end, looking forward to it, and realizing that her death can create new life, as Tommy's unwilling death did in his past life, and his willing death did in the future life.<br/><br/>This movie, in its coming to terms with death, rings very true with me, as I have lost 2 of my close family members to cancer. It's a letter to watchers - death is not a bad thing. Death is not something to fight."

","This movie is COMPLETELY different then how the preview portrays the film. The preview makes you believe that this film is about the legendary fountain of youth, the tree of life and back during the Spanish Inquisition days a conquistador finds and an lives on and on... but nooooooooo... First, I pick this film out to watch with other people and this is a film that either you watch alone (first) or you watch with people who have opened minds. I show have known better because it is a film by Darrin Aronosky (directed Pi and Requiem For a Dream, both excellent films). The reason I say you watch with people with open minds, because you have to be ready to watch a film like this. <br/><br/>The film is very poetic and surreal. You aren't exactly sure what you are watching. You aren't exactly sure what is real and what isn't real. In fact when its over, there are several different interpretations of what you've seen. The film stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. And that is all I am going to say because by telling you what happens, gives away too much and things have to open for you on its on. I will say this, it reminds me of What Dreams May Come, mixed with Jacob's Ladder. Here are some question this film brings up for me. Do you want to live forever? What would you do if you could? How do you let someone go? What would drive you crazy? I gave this film a 7 out of 10 because the film is visually S-T-U-N-N-I-N-G!! And what else I like about the film is that its not obvious and it ABSOLUTELY requires a second view. The first view asks questions, the second view may answer those questions. I like that. Good luck with this one and be ready for something COMPLETELY different."

","Master of the camera Darren Aronofsky, again redefines cinema. Messenger and teacher to all humanity, he deserves the crown of 'Avatar of Filmmakers'.<br/><br/>Beginning in South America during the colonial conquest, Tomas Creo (Hugh Jackman) and two Spanish conquistadors are ambushed while looting a Mayan Temple. During the violent struggle which follows, we are thrown into the world of a seemingly spiritual man (also played by Jackman), who is a highly evolved version of Tomas. He has transcended spiritually and is now obsessed with saving the life of his wife Izzi (the angelic Rachael Weisz).<br/><br/>Future-Tommy is exploiting a unique resource to do this: the Tree of Life. From here we slide gently into the modern day laboratory of Dr Tom Creo (Jackman), a research scientist who discards friendships and procedure in his own pursuit of a cure for Izzi's cancer.<br/><br/>Aronofsky does not give us a coherent or linear story; instead he provides us with overwhelmingly beautiful images, subtle concepts and slices of events. The Fountain is an ambitious work-of-art. An open mind and acceptance of ideas such as symbolism, reincarnation, time travel, eternal life and shamanism would help you absorb the journey.<br/><br/>Even though it lacks traditional entertaining movie elements, it is easy to become entranced by The Fountain. It is more of a parable of our existence than a romantic adventure. There is a lesson in this film for everyone if you look, if you are willing to see it.<br/><br/>Fans of Darren Aronofsky will be charmed by his latest work. In PI he gave us numbers, in Requiem for a Dream he warned us against hope. In The Fountain he paints a complete specification of man and his purpose in a multi-dimensional universe.<br/><br/>Art 5 / Pop 2"
"boomdude-1","9","1","2","3 July 2007"," Can the human heart handle immortality?
","For those who dissed the movie, I can see their point. My 2 cents, this flick provoked in me strong emotions about a few concepts, but the most striking one for me was... if you could have immortality of body, could your mind and spirit take it? If you loved someone ""more than life itself"" (do we ever really understand what that phrase means?), how would you reconcile the loss of that purpose? Would it eat at you, and destroy you psychologically and/or spiritually?<br/><br/>** begin spoiler**<br/><br/>Tommy lost his purpose for living, in the person of Izzy, by a matter of hours. His driving obsession to cure his wife, brought upon himself his own immortality (a curse?) and immortality to the world (a gift, making him ""first father""?). But he couldn't bear to go on. Instead, he chooses to end his life in a symbolic and meaningful fashion (to him, via elements of his wife's book, ""the Fountain"").<br/><br/>He sees his life without meaning, so he seeks to create a meaning with his death, in a tribute to his dead wife, via concepts in her book ""the Fountain"", of which he was so dismissive of when she was alive.<br/><br/>And if you were in that bubble for all those years, alone... you probably wouldn't seem rationale either, which he certainly wasn't (hallucinating, meditating to keep a grip, etc).<br/><br/>I thought the end was amazing. You see Tommy finish the end of the book, and his life, in dramatic (thats an understatement) fashion, bringing his wife's remains and a tree of life and himself to the dieing and recycling galaxy. And then you flashback to when he planted the seed of that eventual tree on her grave 500 yards previous, and he looks up at that galaxy, as if Aranofsky is telling you that that is the moment he decides what he will do. At least thats how I saw it. hey. Its your journey, you walk it. See if I care. :) **end spoiler**<br/><br/>the musical score was haunting (Im still humming it, and its a day later), the visuals are amazing. I liked how much they are ever-present in the scenes, some would call it overkill. I think its well-acted. And Im still thinking about the end, and what it would be like to go thru what Tommy did."
"psamathos","9","1","2","2 July 2007"," A Humble Masterpiece
","Aronofsky presents the timeless interplay between life and death with this intricate but eminently personal story. It could be no simpler: a man is trying desperately to save his dying wife while she comes to terms with her fate. Yet this common event is not merely a focus of despair, but a magnificent inevitability echoed in every facet of The Fountain's engrossing metaphor: from the simplicity of a tree turning decay into new life as it grows, to the magnificence of the heavens where worlds are born from the dust of dying stars. It shows us death as it truly is, as both a disease and as an act of creation. I cannot call The Fountain a masterpiece because, while beautiful, it is so humble. It is closer to a meditation than a masterpiece, but this makes it all the more powerful. Open your mind and let The Fountain wash through you to bring a moment of inner peace."

Reality is just a word.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid of The Fountain.<br/><br/>Because of some reviews I read before seeing this, I had the expectation that I might be left a little confused during or after watching it. I was much more in a state of wonder and curiosity. And now I'm sure the word confusing shouldn't ever be associated with this movie experience. Only the word awe.<br/><br/>This is the sort of movie where the less you know about the story, the more you'll get out of watching it.

As the film progresses, one catches the intertwined stories. The film had the potential to be more. The Fountain is visually stunning. The transitions are fairly smooth between the different stories, and sometimes even seamless. I would've preferred the movie to take more of the sci-fi route.

Many movies have dealt with this topics in the past, and yet we see that the most popular ones are always somehow connected to the Judeo-Christian tradition and teachings. And what is wrong with that? There's nothing wrong if you're okay with vague messages and incomplete answers and tons of space for mental speculation and interpretation. Then everyone is happy because it is again!! left up to us to get our own answers. Like we have succeeded so far.(!) That's what happens when the message is relayed through the media of just one of the major teachings in the world. Now in this movie, there is a blend of different ideas from different traditions, but the main influence being Judeo-Christian, leaves this movie with quite a few important questions to answer. I tried hard, but still, none of my friends can figure out who, what, where and when...about this movie, and my question is why making movies that offer no answers or suggestions but confuse people more into delusion??? We can find that in both Testmants. <br/><br/>People need some solutions to our fears and questions, not some hodge-podge artistic expressions (good ones though) based on flawed philosophies that bear little or no respect among real modern thinkers of today.<br/><br/>Enjoy the entertaining part, tho.

I have read so many stupid reviews about it being 3 different stories about love or eternal youth or whatever. NO IT'S NOT! The guy lost his wife and is trying to understand death, understand our place in the universe, how everything is connected. The conquistador parts are him reading his wife's book, imagining the characters and settings like everyone does when they read a book. This is not even hidden in any way, it's not like a David Lynch thing where you have no clue where a dream sequence ends and what is real. In this one, you did not need to guess or anything, just watch. The whole story was about the doctor and his wife, her death and how he had to accept it and understand that we all die, but in a way we live on as part of the universe. The parts in the space bubble are just him going through all the emotions of trying to save her and finally accepting her death. He finishes her story, just like she wanted him to.

","It wouldn't be wrong to say that here in the UK ""The Fountain"" has had mixed reviews.<br/><br/>The Bad. The Metro called it a ""spectacular mess"". The Independent called it a ""towering, tumultuous folly"".<br/><br/>The Good. Empire Online called it a ""complex and gorgeous mini-epic"". Everybody on IMDb, who's bothered to review it, thinks that it's one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>I'm with the latter bunch. I thought that even in it's compromised form (there is a bit later about what ""The Fountain"" could have been), it was just wonderful. Absolutely fantastic. I was speechless at the end. (This has been a very difficult film to write about. I have started this pitiful review several times.) Forget the nonsense about this being a science fiction film about the search for the Tree Of Life. It's like saying that Soderbergh's ""Solaris"" (another film I really loved) is about George Clooney meeting aliens in outer space. ""The Fountain"" is way more than just a science fiction film. It's a beautiful and ambiguous meditation on life and death. Specifically it's about the all encompassing obsession, anger and frustration of a man unable and unwilling to accept the death of his wife and his eventual journey to acceptance and peace. It's easily the best performance, by a country mile, that Hugh Jackman has ever given. He should have been Oscar nominated. It's a scandal that he has been ignored.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" has had a troubled genesis.<br/><br/>It was supposed to have gone into production in 2002, with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the lead roles, but Pitt bailed days before the $70 million production was due to begin, citing that great old standby ""creative differences"" with Director Darren Aronofsky. Aronofsky went on to work on several other projects (a ""Batman: Year One"" film, that to be honest sounded fascinating because it would have been a realistic and gritty take on the Batman story, with much of the familiar back story jettisoned, and ""Watchmen""), none of which made the screen, before securing a much reduced $35 million budget to crack on with ""The Fountain"" It meant a compromised movie. Less on special effects, huge sets and set pieces.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" was probably never going to be a huge financial success. It is an art film. It was booed at the Venice Film Festival (which was strange) and it died on it's release at the box office in the States. It is way too strange and obscure and good for the multiplex audience."

","I quite loved it. It felt a bit too short, and as a result the story was a bit shortchanged, but the visuals were stunning and the theme was just as amazing. And Hugh Jackman, wow. I've thought he was great in everything I've seen him in - even the crap - but this could be his best performance to date. In three roles, he never seems out of place or over his head, and his character forms the emotional core of the film and makes it even more powerful. I think I understood most of the basic plot points, and I felt satisfied instead of confused at the film's end, but I really liked how a lot of it was left open to interpretation. And the visual effects, despite minimizing the use of CGI, are quite beautiful. Every scene of the ""bubble ship"" is quite lovely to watch. It's flawed, but it attempts to do something quite remarkable, and so it is a flawed masterpiece."
"dragonshield","8","1","2","2 May 2007"," Beautiful, captivating, unique.. Not enough words to describe this movie
","There is something in this movie. Something very powerful, which is the whole beauty of it. The movie tells about 3 different stories about love spanning over one thousand years and though it is complicated, philosophical, it's pure glory for your eyes.<br/><br/>The director Darren Aronofsky does something so beautiful it's really hard to describe. Images after another, your eyes flow into an endless void filled with pure beauty. To me the directing is excellent in this film and it's also so beautifully shot though many of the landscapes are made with computers. This movie also shines with amazing role performances; One of my favourite actors Hugh Jackman and the always beautiful Rachel Weisz have this chemistry between them on the screen which just makes my skin tremble. It's so real, yet so surreal in a some kind of a way. All the words spoken by Jackman are so powerful and so very important for the movie itself. The dialog between him and Weisz is just perfection in its purest form.<br/><br/>The movie is very unique, not like any other I've seen before. I already mentioned the cinematography; In its wholeness it's superb, the use of colors just amaze you and what you see from the screen is so special it makes you smile. The music composed by Clint Mansell just flows with the movie so well it's just magnificent. From the sad and depressive to the beautiful and harmonic compositions it just fills the gaps in a special way and it simply fits for the whole main theme of the film.<br/><br/>The film has this hook in it which keeps you concentrated throughout it and it's just so interesting that you want to see where it all ends. So much is left for the viewer, so few answers and so many questions, genius in its own way I'd say. I want to see this movie again, as I really think this is one of those movies you have to see many times through before you understand everything in it, if you even have to understand it all. Maybe it's the movie's purpose to leave the viewer sitting in amazement with all those questions rolling in his/her mind. If it isn't, well then I just may be the wrong person to review this movie. The word ""understanding"" will have a whole new meaning for it after you've seen this movie. Brilliant.<br/><br/>""Together we will live forever."""
"Cloudmeister","9","1","2","17 April 2007"," one of the most critically divisive movies of recent memory
","Darren Aronovsky's beguiling time-travelling hallucinatory love story The Fountain. You may have read some of the polarising reviews of this movie already. It has been described as everything from new age pseudo-intelligent pointlessness to a peerless cinematic beauty.<br/><br/>The plot is in three parts: the first of which chronicling Hugh Jackman's 16th century conquistador Tomas' journey into the heart of the Mayan empire to locate the mythical Tree Of Life and reward himself and Queen Isabella with eternal life so as to escape from a dying Spain, the second is set in the 21st century and sees Tommy as a scientist trying to cure his wife of her cancer and, with help from a strange South American tree, stumbling across a potential cure to ageing. Ageing, but not death. The third plot sees a futuristic Tom escorting a dying Tree Of Life (who would have thought that the Tree could die?) into the heart of a dying nebula where both the tree plan to be reborn.<br/><br/>The relationship between the plots is blurred and certainly open to interpretation. There are however certain constants throughout each act as it were. Not counting the obvious themes of life, death and love, there are repeated elements of tragedy and noticeable splashes of shared dialogue, imagery and colour (especially gold) throughout each different time period. The romance between Tommy and Izzy, particularly in the 21st century time period, is an heart-breaking portrayal of love and loss.<br/><br/>Jackman and Weisz both turn in the performances of their career and give even the more absurd elements of the film a startling believability and honesty.<br/><br/>The film is one of scarcely believable beauty. Practically every scene is the cinematic equivalent of a classic work of art and the whole thing is strengthened by the musical work of Aronovsky's regular composer Clint Mansell. The film is thought-provoking, debate-raising and jaw-dropping and includes everything from religious spiritual journeys, philosophical and moral realisations and scientific miracles. It remains a very divisive and polarising movie, but it is a work of absolute artistic passion and a fabulously beautiful movie to watch."
"pyrocitor","9","1","2","11 April 2007"," Cinematic poetry; haunting and beautiful
","There are many movies which the viewer leaves with a feeling of entertainment; their money has been spent on a pleasing distraction from the doldrums of real life. Then there are films which the viewer leaves with a sense of fulfillment, as if they have witnessed something meaningful or thought provoking, an intellectually stimulating passage of time. And then there are films such as The Fountain, which defy any sort of conventional description, transcending archetype and clichÃ©, and staying in the viewer's mind for months, even perhaps years afterwards.<br/><br/>In an age so depressingly soaked with more and more remakes, sequels and plots overdone to death, it is truly refreshing to take in a film so new, so unique, so poignant. The Fountain dares to overcome being a typically trite love story, and instead embrace themes so daunting and all encompassing few modern artists attempt to express them, such as meaning of life, the true value of love, the power of trust and belief. While these may come across as sap-ridden and over-glorified, rest assured that The Fountain handles its content in a truly intelligent and mature fashion. Because of the heavy subject matter of the film and the convoluted way its story is explained, do not be surprised if a second or third viewing is necessary to totally grasp all The Fountain is attempting to communicate. It may seem boggling or even downright confusing, but if the viewer simply accepts it as a cinematic poem, which even if not understood can still be appreciated for its obscure beauty, the film becomes much less alienating and the viewer marvels at the sheer scope of the film if nothing else. <br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky deserves mountains of praise for conceiving such an ambitious and remarkably inventive feat. While his screenplay may occasionally drift into being confusing or frustrating, with extensive use of stilted dialogue and cutting in between the story's three time periods, it never affects one's enjoyment of the film - there is far too much to appreciate going on for the occasional small irritation to affect. The film's visuals, if nothing else, are worth immense credit alone - never before have such dazzling effects, as well as brilliant cinematography, inventive, stunning sets and costumes been used to such superb effect. Aronofsky avoided using CGI effects for the futuristic sequences, instead superimposing microphotography of reactions in petri dishes, and it really shows how even in such a computer saturated world as today, stunning visuals can be created without spending millions on technological costs. As well as being one of the most philosophically daunting and thought provoking films of the decade, The Fountain also proves to be arguably the most visually sumptuous movie in recent memory. Clint Mansell's exquisitely moody score is similarly beautiful, and perfectly compliments the edgy yet beautiful tone of the film.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has been proving himself to be one of the most fearless, talented and charismatic actors of his generation, and he gives one of his strongest and most emotional performances to date. Playing three characters in radically different time periods simultaneously, Jackman captures our sympathies through his characters' mutual passion, drive and dedication - few other actors would have been capable of such a moving performance. Rachel Weisz, Aronofsky's wife, matches Jackman at every turn, delivering a mystical and captivating performance through each time period. Though the supporting cast is sparsely used, Ellen Burstyn stands out as a caring doctor in the twentieth century storyline, though the film unquestionably belongs to Jackman and Weisz, who prove themselves more than up to the task. <br/><br/>It is highly difficult to describe such a radically unique film such as The Fountain - the film stands out as one of the most visually inventive, philosophical and soul searching efforts in recent history, completely unlike anything most viewers are likely to have ever seen before. Yet at the core of it all is a simple love story, which is executed with as much emotional weight and tenderness as any of the grandiose themes surrounding it. Is The Fountain a perfect film? No, though the word is hard to describe and really an entirely subjective quality anyway. What the Fountain does offer is an epic story of love and rebirth, spanning generations and complimented by simply stunning visuals. Don't expect necessarily to entirely understand the film upon first completing it, but instead allow it to blossom over time until it can be fully appreciated and respected. In a day and age so starved of originality, The Fountain is worth seeing simply for proof that fresh and touching work can still be produced, and that from the depths of commercial garbage, beauty can still emerge. <br/><br/>-9/10"

However, because I need to fill up 10 lines worth of space, I can attempt to justify the film. A beautiful experience; like living, breathing art. Each scene is exquisitely beautiful. I have never left a film feeling so content; so satisfied. The actors were wonderful and Rachel's performance was, as always, beautiful. The film requires no explanation. I look forward to watching this film again and again! Thank you Mr. Aronofsky!

"tills_liebe","10","1","2","28 February 2007"," The road to awe. . .mazement
","I was in Chandler, AZ in November of '06 on a business trip with my best friend. The only thing we did was go to see the movie The Fountain. A friend of his had recommended it and he trusted her judgment. We drove to the mall, only after getting lost a bit, and got our tickets and food and went to our theater. <br/><br/>Little did we know we were in for an almost overwhelming visual treat. The first half of the film I almost cried because I had never seen anything so beautiful. I thought all the effects were CGI induced but later found out Aronofsky chose to do the special effects for the film by using micro-photography of chemical reactions on tiny petri dishes. He has said that CGI would take away from the timelessness of the film and that he wants the film to stand the test of time. We had watched the trailer before hand and it gave me chills, I was rather excited to see this. <br/><br/>I keep reading reviews that say the movie dragged on, it wasn't good, didn't make sense or the like. Every moment held me in my seat, until that is people in the theater wouldn't stop talking and I had to alert someone. I am not a fan of Rachel Weisz by any means but in this movie I feel she really gave some substance to the role. I love Hugh Jackman, I always have. Aside from his action roles I believe him to be a great dramatic actor. From both of these actors I never knew they could inspire with so much feeling. I have never seen either of them so good in a role. <br/><br/>The movie plot itself appealed to me and seeing it for myself just made it all the more great. Who on this earth hasn't battled with thoughts and awareness of their own mortality? A theme Aronofsky craft fully spun into a mesmerizing and meaningful movie. <br/><br/>I am not totally unaware of the film maker. I have seen his moving movie about heroine addiction, Requiem for a Dream. He too cast Ellen Burstyn as Dr. Lillian Guzetti, Tom Verde's superior and friend. I believe her to be one of America's great actresses with a career spanning decades.<br/><br/>In this movie there are three periods of time we visit. Time of the Spanish Inquisition, present day, and somewhere in the future, with all stories intertwining in the last. <br/><br/>Izzi (Weisz) has inoperable brain cancer and her husband Tom (Jackman) tires by any means necessary to cure her. He says, ""Death is a disease, it's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure - and I will find it."" Working day in and day out, testing on animals, to save his wife. A story of a desperate man and a dying woman that is handled gracefully and poetically in the hands of Jackman and Weisz.<br/><br/>In the future Tom is haunted by the vision of his dead wife, ultimately losing the battle to save her in the past. His only company, a large tree. When she had died he planted a seed on her grave, something akin to a story she had told him, and it grew into this tree. The story she told him was of a Mayan guide, Moses Morales, from a trip she had taken. He said that if they dug his father's body up, it would be gone. They planted a seed over his grave. The seed became a tree. Moses said his father became a part of that tree. He grew into the wood, into the bloom. And when a sparrow ate the tree's fruit, his father flew with the birds. He said... death was his father's road to awe. That's what he called it. The road to awe.<br/><br/>His wife keeps haunting him about finishing the last chapter in the book she was writing just before her death. She couldn't finish it and asked him to complete the task. Riddled with strife and grief he fights and relishes these memories and her ghost. Unable to let go, until the end, sacrificing himself.<br/><br/>Accepting what has happened he joins her in Xibalba (pronounced ""shibalba"", where they are reunited. The pervasive theme in Aronofsy's film. <br/><br/>Quite truthfully it's one of the best movies I have ever seen and it has haunted me ever since, striking a deep chord within my own spirit with my own questions about life and death."
"Chris_Docker","8","1","2","29 January 2007"," Visual poetry
","In Requiem for a Dream, director Darren Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique used innovative techniques to mimic the effects of drugs taken by the film's protagonists, fish eye lenses deforming the living space and fast motion distorting the conversation time-frame. In The Fountain, the same team attempt to convey more of a mystical experience, with story layers little more than props for elaborate and stunning visual metaphors.<br/><br/>On a basic level, Hugh Jackman represents man's eternal struggle to save the woman he loves. In 16th Century Spain, he is a Conquistador searching for the Fountain of Youth in a Mayan Garden of Eden. When he succeeds, Queen Isabel of Spain will be his Eve. As a modern day scientist, he is trying to find a cure to save his wife, Izzi, who is dying of cancer and who is also writing a book called The Fountain. As a 26th Century astronaut, he is trying to grasp these mysteries that have always seemed just out of reach.<br/><br/>The genre and style of the film, like its subject matter, is elusive. At first, it seems determinedly weird, like David Lynch with no clues. As it develops, there is more than a nod to the elaborate aesthetic of films like Cremaster or the favourite of psychedelic cinema-goers, 2001. You become wrapped up in a visual overload of spectacular beauty (but if you were thinking of casually popping some acid before going to see it, you should be aware that there are also many dark, menacing images). This is no sanitised flight of fancy - it has more in common with Pan's Labyrinth than Star Trek. The futuristic images have an almost Matthew Barney -like organic evolution to them, whereas those of the Spanish Inquisition create a mandala of horror that fascinates at the same time that it shocks. A sense of Pandorian menace is rarely far from the explosion of visual beauty that constantly assaults our senses.<br/><br/>So what of the story? It is here that The Fountain is at its weakest. It creates intoxicating images of life, death, and re-birth but the theoretical connections are hazy at best. In the most developed of the tripartite, intertextual stories, Dr Tom Crio's experiments on monkeys will, he hopes, yield a method of shrinking the brain tumour affecting his wife. It is his love for her that motivates him to push beyond protocol. It also blinds him to the fact that he is making a remarkable scientific breakthrough - that of reversing the aging process. The film delicately weaves fringe science, Mayan myth, and symbols of the memories and inspirations that live forever when someone dies. We see the conflict of scientific and artistic temperaments - Tommy never, it seems, has enough time to explore the simple poetry of life with Izzi, with things like the first snow. She wants him to help her finish her book. ""Please, leave me alone - I don't know how it ends,"" he says to her early on. The words haunt him later as they take on a different meaning.<br/><br/>A haunting score and remarkable special effects support a movie that has more talent than there were perhaps dollars to support. The Fountain is avant-garde and so far from the mainstream that you shouldn't even consider it unless you are prepared for a serious challenge. But if you are, you may be amply rewarded. The feint-hearted will dismiss it as a pretentious mess while aficionados will extol its haunting beauty. Whatever you do, don't even think of watching it on DVD."
"maarten_van_winckel","10","1","2","28 January 2007"," Best movie of 2006!
","The fountain by Darren Aronofsky is truly the best movie of 2006. I watched it during the Flanders film festival and I was shocked. People where actually sitting in the hallway because there wasn't enough room and people kept sitting there 3 minutes after the film had ended. The fountain is an experience that takes you through 3 different periods in time, each presenting a different atmosphere. The way Aronofsky and his whole cast do this is simply marvelous. The dark and primitive 1500's, the 'city that never sleeps' 2000 and the vast depths of space in 2500. The story is as brilliant as it is beautiful, love through the ages. Don't get me wrong, the fountain is a difficult movie and nodding of for a few minutes can cause a lot of confusion. But in exchange for your attention you get brilliant acting by a wonderful Hugh Jackman and a breathtaking Rachel Weisz, the most beautiful shots that the modern cinema has ever seen, and a story that fills your heart with so much love, hope and also sadness that you can't help but wanting to see this movie again. The reason this film was ripped of multiple oscarnominations is that it is not a crowd pleaser. It's a difficult film with a lot of symbolism. If the academy hadn't denied Darren Aronofsky's success. This film would have been a serious contender for Best Direction, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best actress in a supporting role, Best original score and Best Movie. It's a pity that films that can make a difference in the movie world are denied the respect and honor that they deserve."

And then think about the film. This movie is definitely one of the year 2006's top 5 best films!! Hugh Jackman has made a breakthrough this year, this one, thus far this being the BEST!! Rachel Weisz (most recent Mummy Movies) has come a far way in success in recent area of films, ""Constantine"" etc. This is top notch for the CREW!!<br/><br/>I also know that the trailer is very deceiving while it does draw in viewers some people notice that one of the few comments made on the trailer about the movie was by MAXIM which in my own opinion would have thrown me off. The trailer also seems to show that it is mainly a love/ sci-fi movie which although is true is not what overall captivates you about the film. Again I think this movie is a top five of the year it's definitely a MUST SEE!!"

I am guaranteeing it will become a classic. 2001 was booed on it initial release, not it's classic because people need time to understand it's messages.

","There is something going on here. If I were to say that I knew what everything in The Fountain is supposed to mean, I'd probably be a damn liar. That said, I feel that I got the general idea. Many people have compared this film's esoteric, pseudo-intellectual appeal to something like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I think this is a wrong claim to make. There are many moments in the Fountain in which the story is too desperately being explained to us. Rachel Weisz is an amazing actress, but God bless her, half her lines in the movie feel like she's just spoon-feeding us important information. It took the joy away from a movie that should (though mostly does) communicate on an emotional level more than anything else. Even if you don't really know why, The Fountain has the ability to provoke some powerful emotions. Unfortunately, it does not do much else.<br/><br/>While watching the film, I sensed that Darren Aronofsky has become a director that believes in his own myth. People have called him one of the great contemporary directors, and now he has come up with this movie, which, at times, is just completely up its own ass. Fans of Aronofsky will no doubt love this and hail it as a triumph of the modern auteur.<br/><br/>If you were to remove the entire concept of past and future from the movie, you'd have a story of a man with a love so intense for the woman he lost, he would never, ever recover. Since we do get the other, more wondrous aspects to it, The Fountain becomes a more memorable, unique film, and has a beautiful sense of hope to it. It is a very one-sided love story though. It is mainly about Hugh Jackman's character's experiences. Aronosky's wife, the lovely Weisz, has to play a character who is never fully realized, and is degraded to an object of affection and goal for the main character, and someone who lays down all the important information to get the plot rolling.<br/><br/>I generally liked The Fountain, it had incredible visual effects that weren't CGI for once, it features a haunting musical score by Clint Mansell, good performances by Jackman and Weisz, and was emotionally hard-hitting. It's the the kind of film that just begs for repeat viewings, but it's honestly not as clever or deep as it thinks it is.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10"

The funny thing is that the movie demonstrates that you don't have to understand!

","After reviewing many sites, the consensus seemed to be that the movie was ""hard to follow."" I remember people spouting off the same comments about Highlander back in the 80s. It was not that The Fountain was hard to follow, for many I'm told after questioning; they realized they were unable to interpret the complex themes the movie presented, furthermore, the way the it was presented on-screen. What The Fountain is not: a typical Hollywood film. If you expected typical Hollywood action, drama, or other predictable works, bypass this movie and please see the next Bruckheimer film instead. The Fountain is an outside-of-the-box movie and should be appreciated for its simplicity and underlying message of love, religion, conquest and the human desire for immortality."

If you have an acceptance for stories that do not fall within the norm, give this movie a chance. If you are not tolerant of new idea's and uniqueness, don't bother, you probably won't like it.

As with Aronofsky's other films (Pi and Requiem for a Dream), the imagery is compelling, beautiful, and sucks you in completely. Warning, though: if you see this with your significant other, be prepared to have an important discussion afterwards about love, life, and death. Also, if you're looking for something that you don't have to think about, go elsewhere (I saw American Dreamz a few days before and felt my brain going into sleep mode during that pap.)"

Then while watching it i saw a masterpiece unfolding in front of my eyes. Where it is mistaken as a movie about the quest for immortality, it is really an amazing story of how a man overcomes a fear of death, and learns to embrace his own mortality in the fight to save his terminally ill wife. Darren Aronofsky does an amazing job of bringing the story he created as a graphic novel to the screen. This film is breathtaking visually and emotionally, and is an amazing follow up to his previous films(Pi, and Reqium for a Dream). With the addition of an absolutely beautiful score by Clint Mansell, this film will move you like no other film can. The Fountain also features an amazing performance by Hugh Jackman(X-Men, and The Prestige), as he masterfully plays three different roles in such a way you begin to question if it is even the same actor, also lets not forget to mention the performance of Rachel Weiz, who's almost angelic performance will make you instantly fall in love with her character. This movie is by far the best, and probably will become the most under rated movie of the year 2006. Writer/Director Aronofsky tells an amazing story that takes you on an emotional, and thought provoking trip that you will never soon forget."

The acting is wonderful, the special effects and the music, are both top notch but this movie just leaves one very confused. It skips around more than a 60 year old scratched record. First I thought I was watching something that happened long ago in Spain...then all of a sudden the audience is sent into an orb floating somewhere in outer-space. Sure this is cool and everything but, I struggled to keep up in the beginning. Then as the plot unfolds and the audience comes to learn certain things about what is going on in the life of the main character; all of the symbolism of the movie starts to fall into place. However, it is not always a good thing to rely on so much symbolism to keep the audience interested in the movie. There were times where I thought I was going to pass out in the chair, other times I was asking my girlfriend what the heck was going on. It just seemed like the movie tried to complicate things, when the story is really very simple. All in all this was an entertaining movie. If you can put up with some confusion and slow moving scenes see this film. If you are not so artsy and like a straight-forward movie then this definitely isn't for you."

","I must say, the fountain is a visually captivating film with terrific acting. I cannot emphasize how important it is to place trust in Aronofsky while watching this film, and follow his path through this cyclical adventure. This is not a linear story. If you cannot detach yourself from formulaic art you may not like this film. I have read quite a few negative criticisms on the film, and I write this to offer my interpretation to show that it is possible to appreciate this film aside from the gorgeous visuals. I am not saying the film goes without flaws, but what film is perfect? We see Thomas among 3 different landscapes of time. These landscapes could be interpreted as past, present, and future; and among each landscape the themes life, death, and knowledge are represented. In the past Thomas is a Spaniard who takes the mission from Isabel the Queen of Spain to find a cure against the diseased Spanish inquisition. The cure believed to be found in a sort of tree of life, and the sap of the tree is the cure. As Thomas closes in on the source of the cure, he is nearly fatally wounded, and therefore must use the cure on himself. Thomas is rebuilt from the sap. However, this life Thomas thought he was saving, that life being his own, is quickly met with a definition more becoming to the universe rather than to humans. His body is torn apart and reborn with earth. He recovered not his life as a human by the sap, but instead knowledge that there is no death, but a cycle of life. Thomas is not independent of the universe as a human, but instead an integral part of the universe as a tree to its roots, the roots to the soil, the rain to the soil, and so forth. Present day Thomas is a research oncologist who is again trying to find a cure for Izzi. His mission ill fated once again as the cancer's life engulfs Izzi's life. Izzi having cancer was a catalyst for Thomas's research. Though he could not save her life he did reach a break through, and with that knowledge he can prolong life for others. Finally, we see Thomas in the terrarium orb gliding through space. These segments of the film act as a mind's eye as well as another landscape. We see Thomas here traveling through the universe. However, we are moving on the path purposed by the knowledge bestowed by Izzi's book, The Fountain, to find the cure to death. In the end, the extension of life or cure to death is not found in our favor. The universe engulfs Thomas, as he was smaller vessel of energy he is now apart of a bigger energy in the universe. His body dies but he lives in the cycle of life. Explaining life as cyclical is not easy to portray in any medium. Aronofsky is an artist, a good one, and he should be supported. It would be a shame if we lost any future opportunities to see his work. I urge you to watch this challenging film, and let yourself see it. Don't waist your time and money and see it through the eyes of a quick to judge critic. There are many other themes I didn't touch on, but you will have to discover those on your own. If you enjoy this film I highly recommend the film ""Slaughter House 5"", and if you like these concepts research the symbol ""Om"".<br/><br/>Best Exploring"

","""Zardoz anyone?"" Sounds more like the stuff of keyboard vengeance that an honest review. I'll go ahead and take a step past the 2-cent quip. Is this film easy to understand? No. Is it easy to plot? No. Is a film of this individuality made often? No. Was I caught with a senior citizen's ticket by an usher? Yes. There have been others in cinematic history whose strangeness surpasses conventional standards and commands us to either accept its difference as enlightenment or refuse it as pretentious hogwash. 2001 has been mentioned so far in comparison but I might offer a more recent film like Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys, which is not easily decipherable but like The Fountain asks the viewer to do some mental exercise and not just be bleached over with the predictability of moving from point A to point B. <br/><br/>Firstly, hats off to Brian Emerich and his crew. The sound design was amazing. Muted city noise toppled by the snow crunching footsteps of Jackman amplify how alone the character is in his quest while being surrounded by so many. From the sounds of intergalactic breakfast cooking in his cosmic conveyance, to the hairs whispering back in response to the sound of Hugh's voice summon the sense of beguiling sound that so rarely tantalizes a film audience. The score composed by Clint Mansell was mostly complimentary which I didn't find it as plodding as others have stated. If placed, I would have to say it sounded somewhere in the realm of Japanese-existentialist-keyboard-ponder-fest to music found in film classics such as Heat (night scenes of De Niro riding in his camaro) and Uncle Buck (listen to the scene sequence directly after Buck scares Bug with a 12 inch drill bit).<br/><br/>Trippy visual effects like kicking out the stars will send the most skeptical cerebrally enhanced big gulp drinker into gooey awe. Golden showers (it's a sci-fi thing, sorry) raining down and morning light brought in through the castle walls to illuminate Rachel Weiz are just a few of the optical morsels to take in.<br/><br/>The interweaving of time works fairly well, offering the circadian dimensions of time as plausible reality. Though I had trouble understanding the end fully or how Weiz's character became a tree in a bubble but I settled my thought's bones around it. It is just flat out confusing to know the origins of the future role Jackman plays. Where does he come from? Has he been traveling since present day? This part is so esoteric; I'm willing to bet when asked this question the witchiest of Mayan witch doctors would hop the 1st thing smoking back to Central America. <br/><br/>The whole concept of drifting through space working towards one seemingly ridiculous goal is futile but isn't that what so many of us do with our lives? The whole idea of eternal life wasn't in the main character's head until the Queen (Weiz) put it there. The roles for Hugh must have been exceedingly exhausting. He is (in many scenes) on the cusp of breaking down and in others his voice exudes the total frailty of an emotionally ruptured soul. His character was born to fulfill his loyalty (duties to Spain in the face of cultural cancer) and love is plainly a mission millions carry out and strives to protect everyday on our planet. Maybe I just can't see the harm in a kid walking out of the theater saying, ""Dad, when I grow up I want to be a tai chi astronaut.""<br/><br/>If we're accepting that God is at the helm regarding the film's universe, then the fact that present day Hugh is a brain surgeon and she has a tumor is totally plausible. If God is the great designer and time is circular, why wouldn't he just update the repeated lives we all live? He can't stop humans from advancing mentally but if he's in charge of time spent doesn't he write the fate of our eternal tickets? Hugh's character rails against all physical laws beset upon us. Religious or not I think its safe to say we can all agree that death is the inevitable equalizer. <br/><br/>This film is unique and because it does contain some grey area in its storyline, it makes for a highly debatable piece of work. Aside from that this film is definitely worth going to the theater for to obtain the overwhelming sensation you cant get on DVD."
"kellydna","8","1","2","2 December 2006"," Prepare yourself for an intense movie experience!
","I agree with Monotreme02's review above that this movie is unlike any I've seen in a long time. The reviews that I had seen prior to going had prepared me for parallel stories taking place in three different times including in the future, giving it a science fiction element. But that's not exactly how it was. Like Monotreme02, I am currently at a loss to know exactly how to describe it which is why I gave it only 8 stars--I feel like I should watch it again, to peel back a few more layers of meaning. Just when you think it's one thing, then it dissolves into being something else, and nothing is quite predictable (or at least it wasn't to me). Even just before the end something happened that I totally didn't see coming, yet made perfect sense and made me chuckle to myself, not because it was funny, but because I was so delighted at having been truly surprised. The movie is over two hours long but at no time did I sit there thinking I wish it would hurry up. It wasn't until well in that things began to be revealed that gave clues as to how everything ties together, but I didn't mind at all.<br/><br/>The actors' performances were indeed intense, Rachel Weisz in her reserved way and Hugh Jackman as a man who doesn't have control over certain events and whose frustration you can feel simmering just below the surface until, on occasion, it erupts. I was curious to see Hugh Jackman in something other than X-Men and I wasn't disappointed. It's all in his eyes.<br/><br/>And it was a visual stunner. Monotreme02 above has covered that adequately, as well as the understated musical score which I, too, found to be a perfect compliment to what I was watching.<br/><br/>For me, the final indication that this was a movie that had had some kind of effect on the audience was the complete silence that greeted the start of the closing credits, with nobody stirring for a good minute after they started rolling, due having been riveted by what they just saw."
"etsubmariner","10","1","2","29 November 2006"," I like The Fountainm but I don't expect everyone will.
","The Fountain is a great movie - for some. It is pure cinematography with a solid storyline, yet the transitions sometimes cause people headaches. My own brain had to transition actively to keep up, and I can only say you should experience the movie, not qualify/quantify each part.<br/><br/>Some of the flashbacks change as you are moved along in the movie. In one instance, Tom doesn't walk with his wife into the first snow of the year. Later, in another flashback, he does. How can this be? I found nothing wrong with that transition. I believe in reincarnation, but one that places time itself as an unimportant side note. If time was of no consequence, what would happen to your reincarnation? You'd come back as a person in the future as well as in the past - you'd also reincarnate sideways in time, meaning, at the same time. You and I are the same soul. Gives a broader, deeper definition to the Golden Rule, doesn't it? <br/><br/>How does this apply to The Fountain? When you transcend the logical, bestial world as I saw Tom do, time and all of 'nonsense' vanish - its not important. He didn't initially walk with Izzie into the snow, but later after transcending himself and truly becoming one with everything, he did walk with her. Beautiful. Transcendent.<br/><br/>In other words, this film was perfection. For me. Hate it, love it, be neutral about it. It isn't important that you fit in the group or feel insulted by others opinions of your opinion. That said, at least SEE IT!"

","Fantastic film. When I first finished The Fountain I truly did not know what to think. I just stared at the screen not knowing if I loved or hated the film. I now can't stop thinking about it. The more my mind dwells on it, the more brilliance i find within it. Many moviegoers don't bother investing time outside of the theater to truly reflect on a film. I assume that many are viewing this, in a way that was not intended by the Creator. They watch for sheer entertainment. they want a traditional linear storyline, they want action, explosions and special effects. What makes this film so spectacular is how incredibly unique it is. No other film can be compared to it. The Fountain explores deep philosophical messages about life, death and love. The prospect of morality and how so many view it as a negative. <br/><br/>I have viewed the film twice now, and was able to appreciate it so very much more the second go around. The symbolic meanings placed throughout the entire film became ever clearer. Technically this film is also very strong. The acting is superb, the cinematography beautiful, the direction spot-on. The Fountain is a rare film that viewers will get more and more out of with each repetitive viewing.<br/><br/>More than anything I appreciate The Fountain, because of it's profound impact it has had on me. I left the theater of different person. My views on life, and everyday situations have changed. And as a student filmmaker it has truly inspired me.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This film is art, much like beautiful poetry."

","I'm not sure what the professional critics seem to have against this film. To me it seemed to be what David Lynch, The Wachoski's, and Tim Burton have all aspired to, and never quite reached. I'm fairly jaded and film weary, myself, but when something like THE FOUNTAIN comes along, it reminds me of why I keep going to the movies. This is the perfect sort of film to enter into without expectations...meet it on the filmmakers terms, and you won't be disappointed. In the films by the previously mentioned folks, I'd often leave with the sense that they were poking fun at the audience, or aware of the concept of deeper meaning, but simply unable to express it. They seem pretentious. Aronofsky, on the other hand, knows how to tell a story, and knows how to tell one that resonates with those who are prepared to listen.<br/><br/>This truly is a poem in film form. The use of interweaved layers of story and repetition of symbolism maintains a steady pace, which slowly builds to a truly climactic (when you look up ""climax"" in the dictionary, this film's could be the definition of the word) crescendo."
"Welcome_to_the_Suck","10","1","2","29 November 2006"," One of the Best films ever made
","It is rare in which a filmmaker presents us with a film that not only challenges our beliefs and feelings, but also how we look at film. Darren Aronofsky shows signs of becoming a filmmaker in the ranks of Stanley Kubrick. His films Pi and Requiem for a Dream showed us his prowess of presenting a relentless harrowing experience as if we were committed to the characters of the film. His films are about subtext, and they truly remember what too few directors realize today: film is an art form, not just a senseless montage of explosions and useless story lines (Michael Bay pay heed).<br/><br/>This film presented an experience of which I cannot compare. It speaks of transcendence for the sake of love. I heard a friend say that Aronofsky IS the next Kubrick, but only time will tell. The plain fact of the matter is this film is gorgeous from start to finish. The ending harrows that of 2001: A Space Oddesy in terms of pure innovation. Clint Mansell's beautiful score (brilliantly featuring heartfelt performances by both the Kronos Quartet and Mogwai) is the best I have heard this year. Matthew Libatique's cinematography is by far the best of the year. Very few times in my history of watching film and going to film festivals have I seen such beauty. There were many moments which I just stared at the screen literally in awe of the images I was presented with. I feel very torn on this film for one reason.<br/><br/>This year we have been presented with many fine films from established directors. The Departed, The Prestige, Babel, The Queen, Volver, and the Fountain are all beautiful in there own right. But it really comes down to only 2 of these films in true terms of best picture material. The Departed and The Fountain. The Departed despite being a remake of the amazing Hong Kong action film Infernal Affairs, establishes itself apart from its parent material by the performances contained within it and the re-imagining of the storyline. Scorsese is definitely in the running (in my opinion) for best director. While this film is brilliant, it shares the limelight (for anyone that is paying attention) with The Fountain. Hugh Jackman's performance single handedly keeps this film out of the gutter of artsy trash by showing you a man who is truly broken by his wife's predicament. Not only is this the single best performance by Jackman, it also ranks as one of the best of the year. Without this performance, the film quite simply would falter with anyone else in the role. On top of this fact is Aronofsky's directing ability. He handles his material with such love and tenderness for the sheer beauty of the medium of film. Too often in Hollywood directors are just trying to make a buck selling weak films that only establish itself on the scenes of violence or camera trickery they use.<br/><br/>Needless to say I personally recommend this film to anyone who is a true cinema lover. People who were raised correctly on the classics of film (1900-1970's). Not just flashy images from 1980-2000. The problem with this film for most American audiences is it is too high brow. It forces you to think and connect the pieces as to the man's fate (i.e. Goddard, Peckinpah, Lumet, Murnau, Hitchcock, Malick, and yes Kubrick), and not just accept what you are seeing. I witnessed many walkouts by the MTV generation used to the overstimulate nature of films today, and I pray that one day America can turn itself around and bring back true respect for celluloid.<br/><br/>See this film if you are ready to experience a film of passion and love for not only transcendental ideas, but also of the nature of film making itself.<br/><br/>Do not see this film if you have trouble with films like Baraka or Babel. I cannot state this enough that it is NOT a film for American movie going audiences, it is a film for filmmakers and lovers of cinema.<br/><br/>Never has a film affected me like this one. I sat stunned by it throughout the credits and couldn't talk about films for days afterward. Like 2001: A Space Oddesy, this film will be hated for ridiculous reasons, but by no means should critics get in the way of true film lovers."

","Being a big fan of Pi and well, I don't know if you can say you ""enjoyed"" Requiem, but I was anxious to see this film for 2 years. I have never written a review of any kind, but reading the previous which compared this to Donnie Darko, I felt I had to say something. This is not a sci-fi movie, it is not a medievalesk sword battle. It is an art-house movie about someone dealing with death, with enough of the aforementioned cool stuff to keep it fun to watch. But in a nutshell, and trust me this is no spoiler, it is one man trying to save his wife through chemistry, her metaphorical story about his struggle trying to save her, and the lofty sci-fi internal metaphor of how he sees himself. Its a beautiful creation, I enjoyed it and felt awed at the accomplishment. But, to be clear its not action, it is not Pi and it is definitely not Donnie Darko. Its not even Solaris, but it does remind me of something Tarkovsky might enjoy."
"deejaytye","10","1","2","28 November 2006"," More than meets the eye...
","I have to say that the reviews on this movie were less that inspiring. I can understand how most people would miss what this movie is about, mistaking it for a scattered love story across what seems an endless time line. It couldn't be anything further from that hopeless synopsis that i can imagine. This brilliant film is a depiction of our inner selves and the simple yet epic struggle of being present with ones self. Which can mean the difference in our experience hear on earth becoming heaven or hell. How beautiful that it is our choice. <br/><br/>I would like to further stipulate that this film does not take place over the course of thousands of years but that it happens within the essence of a sheer moment, the here and now, which is all there is. It begins with him telling his wife he couldn't spend the moment with her because he was to busy trying to save her life, and ends with his enlightened response to the same question. <br/><br/>I further maintain that the bubble in space represented his state of being or mind and was a visual manifestation of where his awareness was during the entire experience.<br/><br/>The story of the conquistador was his wife's method of showing her beloved husband what it means to truly live, forever, together. She used a method in which he could easily follow, as he wasn't ever really with HER, he was only consumed with the inner desire to hold on to the idea of her. As he was loosing her, he clung to the only thing that would make him feel consumed by her, an unfinished story which he was to write the end to. This took him down the path of ultimate enlightenment which is what you see at the very end of the film. Again people mistake this for some hocus pocus or loss of focus on account of the creators. This is his coming to the conclusion that life is eternal right here and now, that death is but a mere transformation, and that as we are beings of energy, that there really is no end, just endless evolution.<br/><br/>I also believe the creators of this story intended to bring up the point that we have people in our lives who guide us to higher awareness and understanding, and I believe his wife was his guide. <br/><br/>There is so much to this film I plan on seeing it a few times and I give it two thumbs up!!"

","When my husband and I went to see this movie, I noticed that there were three different types of movie goers. First, were the people who plain didn't get it. They turned to their friends after the movie and said ""Wait a minute, what was the deal with the guy and that tree?"" and similarly annoying questions. Second, were the people who walked out. They didn't get either. The difference is that they were impatient, probably thinking something like ""Ugh, this is so boring! When are they gonna blow something up?"" At least they were nice enough to be quiet as they left. Then, there were the people like my husband and I. We may not have understood the movie perfectly (who can after only one viewing) but we were awestruck by the beauty and intelligence of this film. This is one of my favorite movies now (and believe you me, I am not one of those people who goes to see movies like Shop Girl and Little Miss Sunshine and calls herself enlightened and smarter than everyone else.) I am not going into what the movie is about because I want people who haven't seen this movie yet to be able to read this review and still go, see this film, and not have it ruined for them. Ignore all those people who call this movie ""artsy, fartsy crap"". They are entitled to their opinions just like everyone else. I think that you should see this film, not because I loved it and think that this movie will move you deeply (if you understand it) but because this movie should be given a fair chance. You will either love this movie, hate it, or just plain don't get it. It' worth it to go just on the chance that you may love it. I can't get this movie out of my head and I watched it a week ago. It's a beautifully made, thought provoking movie and you should see it. Please disregard everything you've heard about this movie (including this review), put your hands over your ears and sing ""LA, LA, LA"" at the top of your lungs if someone tries to tell you about it, and go watch it."

","Darren Aronofsky will no doubt be regarded as one of the most creative, insightful and dedicated to his art directors of our generation. He has created a moving lyrical poetic film about life after death and one only hopes his growing thinking audience will embrace the film as his best yet.<br/><br/>True love comes through as soul mates throughout time and the images, which sometimes are disturbing are enlightening as well as to the nature of soul mates. Fantastic sensitive performances by the leads, Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weiss as well as notable roles for Ellen Burstyn as Hugh's boss and Mark Margolis as Father Avila. We need to see these two professionals in more films. The younger stars are wonderful compliments to the brooding and intense Jackman and balance him well.<br/><br/>Overall the picture came from darkness and death and moved to the light.

"esmith11-1","9","1","2","27 November 2006"," Portrait of the different sides of love
","When I say the different sides I don't mean the bad and good because love is by definition good. Instead there are three stories used to show how love is courageous, patient, and caring. The courageous heroic side of love is represented in a story of a conquistador. The patient contemplative side of love is shown in a futuristic setting. The caring side of love is demonstrated in modern times. Masterfully intertwined and used perfectly to evoke the emotions Aronofsky is trying to convey.<br/><br/>You may have a different interpretation but that's the best part about Aronofsky films. The emotions are clear but the interpretation, the thematic focus, is up to to the person watching.<br/><br/>The movie contains amazing sets, beautiful lighting, and a heart wrenching story. Don't look for the plot as much as the experience. The plot is fine but you'll miss more than half of the movie if that's what you focus on.<br/><br/>In order of favorite to least favorite Aronofsky films I would rate them: Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, Pi"
"ELB-6","9","1","2","26 November 2006"," A haunting and profound experience
","My partner and I saw The Fountain last night. One of our tests of whether a movie is good or not is if it 'wears' well. Some movies I forget as soon as I see them. Other movies bring up a bad taste in my mind when I remember them. Others come back to me in various ways days or weeks after seeing them. The Fountain was such an experience for me. All through the day I kept remembering bits of the movie: the tone, the mystery, the journey. I wanted to tell people about the movie. This is another good sign. I have not read any reviews of the film, nor have I talked w/ anyone who has seen it other than my partner. I can hear some people saying now: ""It doesn't make any sense!"" or ""What was that bubble? Why was he floating?"" These are the same kinds of people who are better off seeing one of the 'Ernest' movies, in which everything is spelled out in numbing detail. I prefer a movie that leaves questions in one's mind. I like to be involved in the unfolding of what is on screen. I don't generally like, or trust, a director who feels it is necessary to explain and underscore every single significant moment in a movie, nor one who feels it necessary to wrap everything up in a cute Dickensian bow. There are two things I liked most about The Fountain. One is its beautiful imagery and creative use of myth. The other is its emotional rawness. If anyone has ever faced losing a loved one, s/he will know just how desperately helpless one can feel. It is incredibly easy to believe anything in a state of denial. It is also tragically easy to miss the most important thing that is always in front of us: the present moment. There were times in the movie when I felt like it was too much --- I felt many times like I needed to stop the movie and go somewhere and sob for an hour. This is probably what I will do when I watch the movie at home when it comes out on DVD. This is not an easy movie to watch. But it is extremely rewarding, if you open the part of your mind that allows mystery to exist. I highly recommend it."

","First off, I have to state that in order to explain this film, you have to see it yourself. it is almost impossible to write this review, for the film had so much wonder that left me and the audience bewildered and speechless. It is a highly unusually film that could be seen in many different views. That said, a lot of previous reviews of this film that I have read are quite different and off key, at least from the way I viewed the film.<br/><br/>To put this film in simpler terms, it is about the whole topic of death. Which includes spirituality, reincarnation, loads and loads of symbolism, specifically with trees, henceforth the tree of life, and also various time periods. The story is about a couple Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) and Izzi Creo (rachel Weisz). It ends up that Izzy has cancer and is near death. Tom does everything in his power to stop her from dying.<br/><br/>meanwhile, back in the 1500s, the same two people are in the same circumstances, and Tom, known as the Conquistador is sent to South America to locate the Tree of Life. Both stories intertwine and bring together neatly and dramatically with surprising ends. both are great pieces to the story.<br/><br/>However, the third story is very confusing, which is the story 500 years from modern-day, and it is when Tom is an astronaut, who is bound to a tree that is dying, supposedly representing his ill wife. he travels in a bubble to a star that suppsoedly gives you rebirth and life. <br/><br/>This story, in my mind, pulled away and created diversions from the original two stories. It took a long time to explain what the story stood for, and it at least gave some explanation at the end of the film, which was no more than mere implications, which left me hanging saying ""Okay, now what?"" Another thing about the film was that the director used the same scenes throughout the film, as if to warn the audience, ""okay, it's time for a new scene"". This grew very annoying, and only slowed the pace of the film, making a 95 minute film feel an hour extra longer. These delays also caused some damage to the end, which was left hanging, instead of totally resolved. in other words, there was to be more of the film at the end, but was cut short, and left almost like a cliffhanger (previously stated earlier in the paragraph).<br/><br/>Besides these flaws, the film was great. The director uses a lot of up closes and different camera angles compared to the average Hollywood director. Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackamn gave powerful performances, but neither of them were Oscar worthy. The visual effects were flat out amazing, and beyond the works of Lord of the Rings, not to mention the use of beautiful cinematography that gave a feel to the film, as well as other small details such as: costumes, set-decoration, and a moving music score by Clint Mansell.<br/><br/>It was a great film that was unfortunately flawed, but still held a strong lesson that tells us that we're all going to die someday, but it's what we do in our life that defines us.<br/><br/>*** out of **** Not the best thing, but a decent film"

The cognitive spirit of the story was intersticed with a tale of endearing romance, a lifelong struggle, and the fraility of existence. The interprations of a tree of life to represent a riddle of the indifference of life was beyond words. It inspired me the way a flash of insight inspires a scholar to write ceaselessly until all thoughts are expounded. And to think that Arranofsky was capable of maintaining direction in this film which is primarily quiet, contemplative, and unlinear. Of course, The Fountain won't leave you with a cerebral aftertaste lying dank in your mouth. Instead it delivers a poignant tale of a romance so powerful it inspires a man to devote his entire being to saving his wife. The story and it's elaborate imaginatory content spans a thousand years. In one instance, the conquistador is searching for the fountain of youth in New Spain and in the other scene memories and thoughts occupy a future where beings transcend time and space in life pods. Ultimately, the overlying themes behind the Fountain are more than enough rationale to conclude this as a must-see. If not for intellectual inspiration, perhaps at least for its science fiction value."

","my interpretations: It's hard to digest the whole immensity of the movie after one viewing. The movie has been falsely advertised as being a story of undying love with three parallel stories when in fact this movie has only one true story and it isn't about love. The story is about one man's journey in accepting death as a part of natural order of the universe. Thomas the conquistador is merely a metaphor for the 21rst century Tommy's reckless pursuit on finding a cure for the degenerating disease his wife has. That metaphor is portrayed by the fictional tale Lizzy has written on her book. She intentionally leaves out the last few pages to be written by Tommy after her death so he can come to peace with the idea of immortality through the infinity and rebirth through death. The future Tom is an allegory for tommy's unwavering and unending quest in saving his dying wife while he himself is perishing slowly in his work, losing his humanity, losing perspective in what's truly important. <br/><br/>Therefore, out of the 3 stories, the 21rst century one is actually the only literal one. The past is tied with Lizzy's book and the future is tommy's internal struggle into coming at peace with her death.<br/><br/>The ending scene is beautiful, he plants a a seed on her grave so that she can be one with the cosmos and breed new life and render life through death.<br/><br/>well I could be totally wrong but those are my opinions."

","To start, I'm surprised to view so many negative comments (by critics) of this piece of art. Critics are always complaining about the non-artistic, flawed, action, sappy, movies that are 99% of what we all see in theaters, yet they bash such a profound, beautiful, and artistic film. Goes to show that this film is before its time. I wouldn't be surprised years ahead, once this film is revisited, it will get just a piece of the merit it deserves.<br/><br/>To continue, this movie is not for all to see and understand as some will not even get the message that is being projected in that 1hr and 1/2. This movie is not meant to just entertain but to re-examine what we all think about out own mortality. Some see movies as a form of entertainment and thats it, ""Movies are just Movies"". Yet ""movies"", at least the ones that fall into this category, are an art form that are meant to make you think and open your mind. Have you been to a museum and seen works of art? What type of mind set do you go with? These are the questions you have to view this movie with. Hugh Jackman is stupendous and should be considered for an Oscar! Hugh's acting is at his best and he really projects the emotion to the viewer about a man afraid to lose everything that he loves only to the inevitable death (the theme of the movie). The score is what it should be, a passionate piece! And every time you hear what I believe was the main song (Stay With Me), you can't help immersing yourself in Hugh Jackman's shoes every time its played, very heart-felt. Visually, one of the best films I have ever seen, and that is not an exaggeration if you know how to appreciate how cinematography works and how beautiful art can be.<br/><br/>To conclude, I know not all will like this film because mentally we all do not think the same. But those that read this, have seen the film with a positive light, and agree with this comment understand the potential to this artistic film. In plain English, this movie is about the struggle of a man's mortality and the threat we all feel when someone we love is on the brink to leave us to death. Yet death is not the end but the symbol to the ""true eternal life"". To those willing to view, open your minds, and to those not willing, I hope you reach that level."

","This is not entertainment. This is cinema at its best. Weaving through exquisitely amazing images, Aronofsky talks about time as a structural dimension of consciousness; and death as a transitional stage in the continuous stream of life. It is a philosophical, existential, spiritual (if you like), and very much a humanistic film. Everything exist at the this moment: life, death, past, present, future, pain, pleasure, love, and loss. <br/><br/>More frequently than not, the critics disappoint me. Reading their reviews reminds of the intellect of a six-year old child. Watch the movie, let it sink in, and allow it to unfold in your daily life, gradually and repeatedly."

","the concept betrays the perfunctory audience, the film industry itself was created to render a world of streamlined constituents and plot. aronofsky has produced a tapestry - it is a work of art and the first film i have seen in several years that goes about its own existence and self-awareness in a method of ambivalence. our cultural identity is long defined by books - their importance was contingent on our myriad explications. aronofsky makes no comments on what we should feel at the end of the fountain, it is an experience by itself and in that we are allowed to find our own meaning. i recommend this film to anyone who thought every last vestige of art had been perverted. there is hope. get your ticket and just take the painting in, just sit and ignore the whispers of less aware audience members, and see the intricacy and consciousness. the film has its flaws, but if you look at it on the macro level it is an impressive feat of craft."

","This film is a beautiful exploration of the enigmatic topic of death, love and life. Aronofsky's handling of the film's metaphysical subject matter is captured to great precision in its form. There are obvious homage's or allusions to Kubrick's ""2001..."" masterpiece as this film strays from rationality and neat 'cause and effect' formations. This was very appropriate considering the various questions the film poses rather than answers. To read the film on a literal narrative level is somewhat possible, but this misses the point of the film. Aronofsky is more concerned with experience than coming to conclusions. To offer rational explanations for some of the pro-filmic events does not pose justice to the film's creative sensibility. The film explores the boundaries of editing and linearity, which is not new for this director. It is not a carbon copy of prior works, but is more of a challenging engagement with the viewer in how we watch or experience cinema differently than any other artistic medium."

It is true what someone else said that you have to have a certain mental capacity,and depth of understanding to really get and appreciate this movie. Yes, it was very ambitious, and sometimes hard to follow, but a wonderful statement on love,loss,the afterlife, and the meaning of it all. I must say that it is refreshing and wonderful to see that a movie like this one can even be made anymore considering the sad state of affairs of the industry and this culture in general. Just when I have given up hope of thinking that there was even people left out there that really GOT what truly is important in life. This film is a beautiful statement about what is. Stunning visuals,great acting, and a beautiful message is alone enough to see this movie. But go see it for your self before you make up your mind. Its one of those films that either you love or hate. and its funny that from what I have read its split about 50/50 on the reviews. It is one movie that stays with you for sure."

Fight Club used to be my favorite movie of all time and this has taken it's place! The issues about life and death are portrayed wonderfully in both. But as a movie The Fountain and Fight Club are on the same page in my mind. I loved the move also because it makes you think about everything in life. It isn't said or explained. You have to feel it.

","I just saw the new Darren Aronofski film, Th Fountain, yesterday and it completely blew me away. Clocking in at only an hour and a half, it makes every shot, every line absolutely count. The direction, acting and story are all flawless. The story is a non-linear tale of a man (Hugh Jackman) who seeks to defeat death in three separate time periods -- the Spanish Inquisition, modern American and an untold number of years into the future. Each frame is an absolute work of art and the performances are nothing short of amazing. It's also interesting to observe how Aronofski managed to construct a detachment from reality and humanity while at the same time preserving the deep, underlying emotions that undoubtedly connect the main character there. I would not be heartbroken if this film took every Oscar for 2006 (including best director.) I have literally racked my brains to come up with something wrong with this movie I seem to always come up with nothing. Warning: Don't watch this movie as you would a normal movie -- just let it take you along and watch for the connective theme that prevails in all three stories.<br/><br/>If you wanna see a really good movie, a movie that MATTERS, for God's sake, see the Fountain!

","I agree with what this person said so I copied and put it here as my comment. Kinda like what most established Screenwriters do when Writers send in Treatments and Screenplays to an Agent who pawns it off to those established screenwriter's. Yeah, their best ideas get extracted and used in someone else's work: <br/><br/>""the plot structure wasn't as cohesive as it could've been. the intermingling of time dimensions is nothing new, however for this movie it was abit jumpy and required the audience more effort in deciphering it's flow rather than enjoying a good story. The visuals were stunning awesome but didn't lend any true significance to the storyline. as a special effect it's cool, but there was no solid relevance to the story. for instance, with bullet-time and frame freezing there is relevance with what is going on in the scene and how it works as a function of the movies story and plot. Whereas in ""Fountain"" all you get is beautiful imagery with music that doesn't particularly drive the story forward. It's non-functional imagery. But that's okay, I enjoyed it. However for a movie, no, I can see where this sound and imagery would be really cool with some fine Columbian Gold and a water bong ! 3 stories, 3 time dimension, is a worn out idea. however it works for this ""movie"" sort of. <br/><br/>When I watched it( 4 hours ago ) I caught the Holiday Season crowd, so a lot of people were already giddy. Wolverine was easier chuckled at or hissed at depending on what type of emotion he was trying to evoke. I thought he was doing well since I didn't get to see the last X-men movie. People still look at him as Wolverine so that kinda ruined it for them. Rachel was immaculate in her acting, and if it wasn't for her, the movie wouldn't have much substance. I mean her acting was excellent. Some of the visuals made no sense and were quite distracting. It's almost as if the Director has all these fantastic ideas in front of him and didn't know what to do, so he just through them all together with no concern as to how they'd make sense. <br/><br/>The movie is better viewed as an Art piece like most viewers have already said. So, this is not a movie in the traditional sense, but tries to be one. Actually, I was bored and thought the visuals provided some thought provocation, the story line was not cohesive enough to drive any meaningful point that I already couldn't decipher from a few lines of dialog or a still image. <br/><br/>I figure the screenwriter needed more time with the content. this movie had so much potential but it seemed thrown together without any refining. And, indeed, it needs a lot of refining to be considered seriously. therefore, I conclude that ""the fountain"" is no ""The Matrix"" but it was a good try for the Director in trying to do something different. "" - someone else's words. <br/><br/>Thank you, JQ"

"Ziya90","1","2","7","26 June 2013"," The story seems original, but if you look closer, you can see that it is cliché and its visuals are no more than a slide show
","The Fountain seems like a different film, it is a combination of past, present and future with different settings and stories. It is a hybrid movie, it has science fiction elements, it is a drama about a doctor and his ill wife, it is epic, there are Mad Max- like punk? tribes, it is a postmodern film, but none of those makes The Fountain a good film. The present story is the main story, it is the starting point, but this main story is very cliché that we saw even in some B movies! A doctor's wife is sick. He uses science to try to cure his wife who he loves. That's the story of the film. What a simple story! The worse thing is that this story doesn't go any further and we can't feel the romance or the pain either. Other than this, yes, as some other audiences said, the movie is extremely pretentious. The images, all those visual elements doesn't make any sense, instead it was like a long and very boring slide show. As a moviegoer, I very rarely call a movie boring, but The Fountain just pushed my limits. The images, some of those were beautiful, yes, but it is like all those images has not any supportive or enough background or emotion. It is called pretentious, right? This is not style over substance stuff, because there is not any real story for this feature length film, there are rather some ideas. I said the man who tries to save his wife is the brief story of the film, but it is more like a sum of ideas rather than a real, interesting story. Hugh Jackman doesn't fit his role, also he was not very good in this, Rachel Weisz was more adaptable than him, but both of them were literally missing in the movie. It seems that even they didn't believe the story, the movie. This film proves that all of the different time zones, different stories films are not good, just because it sounds or looks different. If you liked Moon, you will like The Fountain, there is no doubt about it! I couldn't like Moon either, because it was the same as The Fountain. No heart and soul. The Fountain has no heart and soul, no dramatic scene or twist. The movie's pseudo weightiness was over for me. This isn't high art for me, this isn't entertainment, this isn't a cinematic journey, this is something else, but I am sure about one thing, it was a zest-less experience."

Unfortunately the fine visuals were ruined by what is a very slow moving film. Considering the length of the film I would expect a little more too happen. Although maybe it just felt like a really long movie. Some may like the spiritual aspects. I didn't. A movie can make you think without boring you to tears. In the end, I couldn't wait for the film to end. Watching a guy eat a tree in the middle of space is not my idea of an entertaining movie. I recommend that this movie only be watched with mates, whilst chatting and consuming alcohol."

"Innsmouth_Apprentice","1","2","9","13 August 2014"," Death is a disease. Like any other.
","""And there's a cure. I will find it."" Words of The Fountain's protagonist. Here's the plot of the film: a man who achieves immortality - in other words, finds the aforementioned cure - fails to find any joy in it, instead choosing to pine for his long-deceased wife. Seriously, that's the core of it - a guy who misses his missus. (yawn)<br/><br/>The Fountain is a tedious rehashing of the themes of loss and longing, wrapped up in some admittedly pretty imagery to the accompaniment of an OST by the always great Clint Mansell. If you want a better acted, more entertaining, and more emotional look at similar issues, try Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. That one doesn't feature such obscene, depressing praise for death and its acceptance, either.<br/><br/>I rate The Fountain so low (2/10) because Aronofsky really is pathetic in what he does here. He's a guy ever-brooding over death and the futility of life (this feeling permeates all of his work), and in The Fountain he lays out his metaphorical crutches that he's built up to help him deal with those issues. What follows is a wimpy, panicked barricade of self-delusion and self-placation.<br/><br/>Oh, that laughable plot. An immortal man is flying to commit suicide because his dead wife is the only thing he can think about. Plus death, as the movie constantly reiterates, is great, and necessary, and you'd do well to practically rush into it head-first. Because it's ""the road to awe"".<br/><br/>Let's use some logic for a change, eh? What is this ""awe""? Something beyond death? Well, if Aronofsky managed to be honest with himself, he'd realize that ""something beyond death"" is simply a different form of life, and hoping that death leads to that ""awe"" is a veiled desire to get some more life after this life. That's why they call it ""the afterlife"".<br/><br/>Now: if you want more life...and you get an infinite amount of it by achieving immortality...isn't the ""problem"" solved? And if life is intolerable without your dead wife, what's good about that ""awe"" that death will lead you to? Even if you find some afterlife, it's highly unlikely that it's going to be exactly what you dream of, i.e. a place where you can hang out with your loved one. You're taking a huge chance on a) total oblivion, b) an afterlife without the dead wife.<br/><br/>Point is, what you are if you think and behave like the protagonist, and by extension (or precedence) - Aronofsky, what you are is what's known as ""needy"" and ""suicidal"". You're not cut out for existence. If you would die/kill yourself because you lost someone, then you're one of the very weakest human beings - and living beings in general - around.<br/><br/>You can look on this plot as not literal in all of its aspects, sure; but its meaning stays fundamentally unchanged: welcome death, don't chase after immortality, ""love"" is more important than anything. What if you are too cynical to believe in ""love""? Or too self-sufficient to forever feel damaged if you lose a certain person in your life? Aronofsky doesn't really acknowledge the existence of such people. Or of the possibility of finding joy in never-ending life.<br/><br/>If the plot is to be taken literally, then it makes little to no sense for even more reasons, by the way. After finding the cure to aging and death, humanity would thrive, and immortals would multiply. If afterwards mankind were, by some miracle, decimated completely, the chances that only one immortal would somehow survive the cataclysm and be left to fly around in an indestructible spaceship would be infinitesimal.<br/><br/>This assessment, by the way is based on the fact that the Clint Mansell OST features a track called ""The Last Man"".<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's acting is decent. Rachel Weisz's is irritating. I don't particularly like her acting to begin with, and the fact that her character is a superficial, empty, charmless cutout doesn't help.<br/><br/>P.S. And now Aronofsky's made a movie about Noah. Consistency is certainly not the man's strongest suit, is it? I mean, the guy who called for welcoming death as the road to awe now makes a movie about a mythical man who serves as the ultimate savior of life on Earth. If Aronofsky had any strength of conviction, he'd alter the story of Noah and make the guy drown the ark and everyone on it because he thought that life was a tragic mistake and didn't want to go on. Plus maybe he didn't endorse God's genocide of the rest of humanity and didn't want to serve as such a monster's obedient pawn. Aronofsky doesn't make movies about characters who break out of the mold, however. Quite the opposite: his characters always submit. To death, to God, to fate, to chance...to whatever. Point is, resistance is futile in his world. In his sad, powerless, gloomy world all you can do in the end is go along..."

","The Fountain, the fountain, the fountain; the fountain of youth, the tree of life. Biblical piety, the natural world and the beauty of life through death. Lo the f***ing fountain. I hate The Fountain (2006). There's no getting around that while the film tries so, so hard to make a statement about grief and death and the cyclical nature of the universe there's no helping this pretentious, overlong bore is a stifling jumble of Philosophy 101 prattle made by a maddening blatherskite.<br/><br/>The film overlaps three narratives each with the same actors (Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz) playing different characters. The main story takes place in modern times; Tom Creo (Jackman) works in a biology lab where he's trying to find a cure for cancer. He has extra motivation to find answers as his wife Izzi (Weisz) is slowing dying. He works tirelessly yet ignores the precious little time he has left with Izzi. Jump a few centuries in the past and we have a narrative supposedly created by Izzi in a book she's writing. Queen Isabella of Spain is being politically questioned by the Grand Inquisitor (Stephen McHattie). Her solution: find the fountain of youth/tree of life by sending conquistador Tomas into the jungles of Central America looking for it. Then a few thousand years into the future (I think) Astronaut Tommy is nearing a dying star in a self-enclosed bubble containing a tree and the ghost of his dead wife.<br/><br/>If this all sounds confusing to you, you're not alone; though that isn't the reason I despise this movie. The reason why this film is a waste of your time lies in the false correlation between its supposedly hopeful message and its sad, depressing emotional core. We're meant to suffer through mysticism, biblical and Mayan origin myths, Buddhist and Taoist symbolism to tell us what? Death is a natural thing and we should accept it? By not accepting death, we're essentially dooming the human race? Death is life? Thanks movie for that uplifting message, and thank you for convincing me of your worldview by showing me a suffering couple who love each other but can never be whole.<br/><br/>At least 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) attempted to give an unabashedly hopeful agnostic message and kept its emotions in check. On the other side of the philosophical spectrum The Tree of Life (2011) was emotionally engaging and gave a deeply spiritual monotheistic account of everyone and everything. The Fountain's emotional core is as soapy as an overloaded dishwasher and its philosophy is contrived. It has the audacity to be utterly pointless.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying the message is just flat out wrong. We all do have to die some day and when faced with the great abyss, being at peace would help. Yet the assumption on the part of the filmmakers' is the value of life is muted by cosmic forces beyond our control. Life is nothing but clouds of grey dust, so wrap yourself around a dusty chair a light a damp cigarette because we're all doomed anyway.<br/><br/>When this movie is at its most philosophically cogent, it's nihilistic and brooding. Otherwise it's a sorry assemblage of microphotography and fake set dressing. It's enough to put anyone in a soporific stupor. May I suggest instead of watching The Fountain, you go outside and enjoy the rest of your existence? Go do something that gives you joy instead of being held captive in front of a darkly lit screen awaiting eternal sleep."

But it's eminently metaphorical and philosophical character will displease the overwhelming majority of the public, who normally seeks out films of easy digestion, for pure entertainment.<br/><br/>The action happens in three distinct timings, using non-linear narrative to intertwine it through metaphors and linking elements. The pace is purposefully slow, allowing the powerful soundtrack of Clint Mansell to elegantly harmonize with perfect cinematography and astonishing visual effects. That may seem surprising given the relatively modest budget with which everything has been achieved. The work of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz is absolutely impeccable, particularly his.<br/><br/>Now let's go to the script. This is the point where, for me, the film is less interesting. Addressing very complex issues from a philosophical and existential perspective (transcendentality, mortality, what is beyond death, our relationship with the Sacred etc.), it raises a series of questions that never answers in order to let each viewer think. But truth is the film points the way to the answer, as if it wanted to do it but didn't have the guts. This gave me a sense of dissatisfaction, of absence of closure. Then there are small details in which the script clearly makes beginner mistakes, such as putting the Maya alive and well during the arrival of the Conquistadors, when we know that the Mayan civilization disappeared before the year Thousand of the Christian era, five hundred years before Columbus. I know it's a minor detail, but as a historian I don't like to see things like this."

But somehow I realized that there was something in the movie though for I haven't forgot about it. And after three years, I enjoyed every single moment while I was watching it for a second time. For I am going through a spiritual journey and surviving a heart attack at 27, this film helped me to overcome the fear of death and it answered most of my questions regarding life, death and reincarnation.<br/><br/>Most people may not get the main point of this film. I would recommend them to watch it over and over again and study spirituality meanwhile."

The acting was good, although not much for Weisz to get her teeth into, and some of the barging through the lab was a bit scenery chewing. <br/><br/>Problem for me was the pace - it didn't really keep my attention, even with the short running time."

Having three stories together, and still all connected to each other so mysteriously and weirdly, has made this movie something amazing. And I don't remember any other movies like this, though it's always been an idea in my mind to build such a movie! so I thank Mr. Aronofsky for letting my wish come true! As I said before, I loved the ending, though I think if some scenes were shorter or removed, it would be better. There is no need to tell about the awesome music of the fountain! It's simply unique. Still, I think if the scenes were matched more with the music, it would be fabulous, something that seems like no director really care about! But anyway, I do."

","This movie is definitely one I would consider to be an ""artsy"" film. I'm someone who isn't particularly fond of artsy films to put it lightly. In fact, the first time I tried to watch this film I turned it off within the first 15 minutes. A few months later I decided to try to watch it a second time. This time I made a conscious decision to sit and watch through the whole movie.<br/><br/>By the end of this film I was awed and mystified by the powerful message and beauty of this film. The fountain tells a story spanning across time from the past to the present and into the future. The message is deep but the meaning of the movie isn't clear without some effort on the viewer's part to decipher the story. The film's message is also darker and more pessimistic than most people's idea concerning life, death, love and hope. Logically speaking though, the ideas in this film are actually very realistic with most people's experiences across the world. I don't want to give away any of the story so that's all I will say in regards to the content of the movie.<br/><br/>If you're willing to open your mind, want to see a film unlike any other, appreciate an artistic film, are a fan of amazing soundtracks and don't mind a unorthodox message regarding our existence as human beings; this film will amaze you. It is a brilliant film that's been vastly underrated. However, for those looking for a more conventional movie this movie is not for you."
"Aaron_West","9","1","3","26 May 2014"," A spectacular and powerful film, if not unfocused.
","Darren Aronofsky does well to create a visually stunning film, along with Clint Mansell's potent and effectual score. I would see unfocused as a fair criticism of The Fountain, but it is also ambitious, poetic, effecting, interpretive, and spurs debate. <br/><br/>A second viewing after watching supplementary ""explanation"" videos helps enhance and focus the experience, allowing the viewer to pick up on repeating visual nuances and construct an interpretation themselves. I would like to have seen many themes and ideas explored other than mortality and coming to terms with your transience. <br/><br/>While it is often compared with Cloud Atlas, its only similarity is in premise; the execution is of a very different style, the thematics are similarly ""deep"" to those new to experimental cinema but are vastly different in detail, and the method with which interpretations can be drawn are much more literal. Both seem to be hated by critics, but both are powerful epics.<br/><br/>To call The Fountain a failure is understandable, in essence it is, but only because its ambitions are so infinite that if it did meet expectations it could quite easily be one of the best films of the 21st century.<br/><br/>It was likely cut and played with hugely from Aronofsky's initial plans. It does feel like a 3 hour epic that was cut into a 1.5 hour risk due to reasonable worries about box office. Maybe one day the film will be revisited and a very extended cut will be released, that will be the film Aronofsky wanted, intended and wasn't allowed to make.<br/><br/>It is also one of the few films that I do truly believe are underrated by critics - for which I give it a 9 rating, out of sympathy, over a 7 or 8 star review."
"jackalpl","10","1","3","28 September 2013"," A deeply humanistic movie with wonderful aesthetics and music!
","'The Fountain' is an ambitious, artistic movie by Darren Aronofsky (director of such movies as 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'Pi') that feels like reading a touching poem or drama.<br/><br/>While its tag-line is ""Death frees every soul"", watching this film can provide us with some catharsis already during our lives, and help us come to terms with the fact that both we and our loved ones have to die at some point.<br/><br/>Indeed, 'The Fountain' is at its core a tragedy about love or rather the fear of losing those we love. The main protagonist (played by Hugh Jackman) only suffers for his choices to desperately cling to the idea of saving from death the woman he loves (played by Rachel Weisz) - he pays the price for denying the reality of her imminent death, as the quest for eternal life is doomed to fail. The movie guides us through such emotions as fear and pity, and more specifically: fear of loss, grief, and finally leads us to acceptance.<br/><br/>It achieves this not just through the 3 stories seemingly spanning over the course of 1500 years, but also thanks to excellent acting by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz in protagonist roles. Also, the beautiful visual effects achieved with micro-photography, and especially the brilliant score by Clint Mansell, Kronos Quartet and Mogwai, greatly contribute to the film's emotional drive.<br/><br/>The story and the awe-inspiring images and music will stay in your mind, and the music will also stay on your play-list. That is - until you die."

"freeist","4","1","3","18 July 2013"," Ambitious Film Overreaches, has Great Moments
","I've been impressed with director Darren Aronofsky ever since I saw his first, and very off-the-wall independent movie, Pi. Nobody else is filming on the themes Aronofsky does, and with The Black Swan he has since proved his value to Hollywood. He also has about the best name an auteur could be born with.<br/><br/>So when I saw The Fountain and was disappointed and watched it again, but it wasn't any better. A pre-Black Swan movie, The Fountain is ambitious, but it overreaches badly. It tries to tell three different stories about eternal devotion with the same couple playing out a love story in different settings and times. Unfortunately, it was too much for the resources he had. The result is a movie that has all the ambition of a student filmmaker trying to shoot ""War and Peace,"" with exactly the kind of errors you'd expect him to make.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with the central plot of this movie, in fact it's an excellent romantic tragedy. A cancer researcher, Tom (Hugh Jackman) is desperate to find a cure for his wife, Izzy (Rachel Weisz) who has already accepted and embraced the inevitability of her death. Tom is obsessed with saving her, while Izzy only wants his comfort and love for the little time she has left. His tireless drive to save her ends up separating them. Great story, operatic and ironic, I loved it.<br/><br/>The problem comes in because Aronofsky adds two other stories. They both take place in different settings, different centuries, maybe even different universes.<br/><br/>One of them being a novel Izzy is writing, it at least has a loose connection to the central plot. The story is set in sixteenth century Spain and Central America. Jackman plays a conquistador, Tomas, and Weisz plays Queen Isabella (in a very inaccurate historical depiction) who sends him on a quest to find the Tree of Life. The Maya paradise of Xibalba, which is also a star, figures prominently in the book, and Izzy refers to it in the main plot.<br/><br/>Nothing in that plot was worthwhile, nor did it really connect well to the ""real"" Tom and Izzy. I also had an issue with Izzy's imbalanced historical research. I don't know why she, (and that is to say, the movie's writers) would research into so much into the Mayans only to get the 16th century Spanish so wrong. The conquistadors were some awful people, and making Tomas a heroic conquistador is to overlook the massive genocide they committed all for sake of telling a historically unbelievable romantic tale.<br/><br/>The third plot is more vague, because it seemingly takes place in the future where a pseudo-Zen version of Tom is taking the ""Tree of Life,"" to the Xibalba star, that is, the Maya heaven. The shooting of the scene leaves no doubt the tree is really Izzy, symbolically depicted, and it is dying. The things connecting this to the other plots, the star and the tree, and of course, Jackman. This thread has metaphoric imagery but no plot or logical connection to the central storyline.<br/><br/>It's a beautifully shot scene, but slow, and hardly lit, giving you a long time straining your eyes to resent the incoherence with the real story. He's traveling through space in a kind of bubble terrarium living off the bark of the tree, which makes for a disturbing comparison to cannibalism. Wouldn't an easier way to the afterlife be to let it die? Unlike the conquistador plot, we don't the least explanation of what this is. Is this a science fiction maybe Tom was writing? He didn't mention it, and didn't have the time. Maybe it's Tom's unconscious narrative. Unless you're excited to see Jackman out-acting the hunk of wood at center stage, it's pretty boring, not to mention confounding. My question all along was who gave spaceman Jack this mission? Though these two parallel plots have some striking images, you almost can't see them because the lighting is so dark, probably to hide the poor production values. Apparently, the movie was supposed to have an $80 million budget but was made for a fraction of that. It shows. Actually, with the horror movie/film noir it doesn't show-- enough. This pretty much wipes out the color palate, and it somehow doesn't fit a romance story, even one this heartrending.<br/><br/>The Fountain might have been only a short subject without those two parallel plots, but it would have been a better movie. They add nothing but murkiness to the story. Without the funds he needed, I wish Aronofsky would have focused on the best plot he had.<br/><br/>In its favor, the film is well acted no matter which sequence it's in. Jackman and Weisz do a great job, and for many people, the acting, the beautiful, stirring score by Clint Mansell, and the occasionally- discernible, breathtaking images are enough for them to rate this film very highly.<br/><br/>Not for me. I'd say it's a 4/10 which is a major disappointment. But I could see how great it might have been."
"Artimidor","9","1","3","13 June 2013"," Romantic fantasy/sci-fi Rubik cube for those who like it different
","Darren Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"" might be called all kinds of things: enigmatic, mystifying, intense, mind-bending, transcendental, and a lot of not exactly favorable attributes as common opinion suggests. Or a ""Rubik cube"" as the director/writer himself puts it. Well, it's really not all that complicated actually, as the film revolves around a rather simple central story carrying the basic idea. However, the picture is put together and presented in a most unusual and unique way, and that's where the whole beauty and challenge lies. Aronofsky takes no prisoners, constantly references, quotes and hints at, but leaves it to the viewer to connect the dots and literally make the story whole. In short: If you expect a bit more from a film than a run-of-the-mill action-adventure drama/thriller with CGI participation you might as well get into the fascinating world that is ""The Fountain"". While framed by medieval romantically inspired fantasy and imaginative poetic sci-fi, the film is actually about none of these things and has its heart and soul elsewhere: in the present, deeply buried in the human condition searching for meaning in death, and life. Thus the film might seem like a weird incongruent and at the same time strangely familiar and intimate experience on the one hand, all of which reflects in its different timelines and its jumbled representation of events. On the other hand it is held together by familiar faces, playing similar characters, themes reverberate, intertwine, all for a reason - a concept leading up through labyrinthine paths to a deeply affecting denouement when everything comes together in the viewer's mind. Your turn! Keep it simple or add your own preferred twist - the material offers ample options.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly ""The Fountain"" is Aronofsky's most visually stunning piece aiming for grand scope that boldly follows no ready-made formulas of successful film-making - consequently it flopped at the box office. The picture found audiences strongly divided ever since, which is often the case at masterpieces. An indicator? Spirituality, enlightenment, a path of grace à la Malick/Tarkovsky meeting conquistadors and spacemen in biospheres? For your consideration. Or as Rod Serling might have said: Submitted for your perusal, a tale about two dreamers - two dreamers and an observer, with all involved imaginations being tested. Somewhere far out there... in the cinematic twilight zone."
"fajjour","10","1","3","13 June 2013"," A true Masterpiece
","I am surprised that The Fountain isn't the movie with the highest rating. I guess not everyone appreciates a movie that they don't fully understand the first time. But then again that's what I love about this movie. I have seen it more than 20 times so far and each time I discover something interesting about it that I haven't noticed before. A treat for the mind as it makes you wonder but not too complicated like other movies where you find yourself detached from the plot. Touching as well on so many levels. A movie that should please anyone who likes to use their imagination. Whether you're a romantic, a history buff, or a religious person I am sure that you will find great deal to love about this movie. A true masterpiece that should be more recognized in my humble opinion."
"cat_ranchero","8","1","3","29 September 2012"," Underrated IMO...
","Beautifully shot with some stunning images. I wasn't sure about the muted tones used at first but as the film went on it grew on me. The musical score by Clint Mansell was both beautiful and inspired; I will be tracking it down. The performances of the two central characters; Hugh Jackman as Tomas / Tommy / Tom Creo and Rachel Weisz as Isabel / Izzi Creo were stunning; Aronofsky certainly knows how to get a performance and they didn't let him down. I also have to give honourable mentions to; Ellen Burstyn as Dr. Lillian Guzetti, Mark Margolis as Father Avila, Stephen McHattie as Grand Inquisitor Silecio and Fernando Hernandez as Lord of Xibalba.<br/><br/>I have to admit this is the second time I've seen this one and it's one of those that gets better each time you see it. There are so many nuances and plot devices that it can be quite a hard one to get a handle on first time around. That's probably one of the reasons it has divided opinion so much. The three threads of the story seem so remote at first but as you watch it all gradually pulls together. For me it is just the right length, any longer and it might have become a little tedious. I know there are many out there that didn't like if first time around; to you I say; give it another chance try to watch it with an open mind. It is slow-paced deliberately to allow the audience time to assimilate the story. If you're watching it for the first time on my recommendation, then be prepared to give it a second viewing; you may not get it all first time around.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>My score: 8.1/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
"mihajlocimi","10","1","3","18 September 2012"," Pure art, for both the eyes and the ears
","Darren Aronofsky's greatest film! By a mile. What? Am i mad? The Wrestler, Black Swan... Pi? Nope. The Fountain. If there ever was a film that was not for everyone, this is it. If you are an action-loving, die hard Stallone fan who likes a happy ending, or any ending at all... Really anyone who thinks that a film should be coherent and chronological. Skip the Fountain, you would not understand it. This film is art in it's purest form: Cinematography. And it is the best representative of it. Basically you have three tales of love, spanning ages, which twist and intertwine amongst them. Three heroes, three brilliant performances by Hugh Jackman, accompanied by Rachel Weisz, and elevated by their amazing chemistry. Did you know that originally Brad Pitt was supposed to star instead of Jackman. Let me tell you something, Brad Pitt is not half the actor Hugh Jackman is. There i said it. Jackman's range of emotions in this film is so good, it would surprise even his most loyal fans. Hell, i bet he even surprised himself. It's a strange film to say the least without an apparent ending, just a loop, but still leaving you with closure. How? Simple. Darren Aronofsky. One of the greatest directors of the century and a member of the great 21st century sci-fi trio, alongside Christopher Nolan, and Duncan Jones. His directing sense and style is superb. Especially when he partners up with Clint Mansell, forming the legendary duo rivaled only by Nolan and Hans Zimmer. Mansell's soundtrack cannot be described by words. It will deplete you of your emotions, leaving you wondering what godlike creature created this perfection. Never has there been a more perfect soundtrack to accompany a film. There's not much more i can say about the Fountain, except that you will either hate it, or it will be the best film you ever seen."
"immortaliti","10","1","3","14 June 2012"," Intricately Woven Masterpiece
","This is my favorite movie of all time. I bought it for 3$ at some movie store that was selling extra copies, with no idea what it was about. I have to say, it was one of the best movie purchases of my life. I seriously and personally take offense to people who say this movie is sh*t and doesn't make sense. It is beyond beautiful and the depth of it is amazing.<br/><br/>People are complaining this movie is jumpy and irrational. For all of you who do not like to watch a movie twice to understand the entire meaning, please do not watch this movie. This is definitely not for you. It's a virtual mindf*ck the first time through, and if you aren't willing to put in the brain power in to start to connect the dots, I doubt you are going to want to watch it again. The second, and third, and umpteen times around, is where you see the masterpiece. <br/><br/>Those who I mentioned above, that's where the automatic ""THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!1 OMG"" comments come from. Scenes/Centuries skip around like it's nothing. They aren't linear - if you can't keep what you saw 15 minutes ago in your head, forget it. Don't watch. Once it ends, and you see how SOME of the things are tied together, you need to watch it again to see ALL of the things tie together. That's what makes this the beautiful movie that it is. Everything is related.. yet subtly. Any small random thing, looked over by most people is tied in. Words, lights, phrases, other supporting characters, objects, everything. Every detail you would overlook the first time around watching the movie, becomes so apparently obvious the second time around, it makes it amazing when it just clicks. The fact that someone could even tie all of those minuscule details together that they thought of, is unbelievable. Every time I watch it, it just becomes even more beautiful. I find something new almost every time, and I have watched this movie WAY more than I should.<br/><br/>This is the best acting I have seen out of Hugh Jackman by FAR so far. All I could picture him as before this was either some crazy Broadway actor, or an action actor with very little emotion working with a poorly written script. He proved me wrong by bringing out the emotional side of his acting which I have never seen before -- and it is amazing. You truly want to cry when he cries -- you truly want to push yourself and achieve the impossible when he does. <br/><br/>Rachel Weisz plays a roll she is absolutely perfect in. She is beautiful, strong and independent, yet she is terrified of what to come. She plays a role in which she is regal, yet shows her weaknesses -- in all the time periods this movie encompasses. She hides her fear realistically and brings out palpable emotions in this film. Contrary to some, I do not think this is overacting at all, on either of their parts. The people who say it is, probably were expecting some B--- (yes, that is 3 - ) acting from her, such as The Mummy or films of that sort, or some CGI scripted bullsh*t from Xmen for Hugh Jackman where he tears up people all day. I'm not saying those aren't good movies, but it's not that. It's not meant to be that. They show off some TRUE talent here. For ""wolverine"" to cry in a movie, that is pure and true beauty.<br/><br/>The music, my GOD, I can not tell you how amazing it is. It is playing throughout the movie, and ties all the time periods together. It is like one epic symphony playing for the entirety of it -- moving and beautiful. With another soundtrack, I do not think this movie would have the impact on most people as it does. I have personally downloaded the entire album on I tunes, because it is so breathtaking. If Clint Mansell were to compose back in the times of Mozart, Beethoven, and Pachelbel, he would be one of the most famous composers today, hands down. He ranks way up in the ""Most Amazing Music Ever"" department. If you have not ever heard any of his compositions, please indulge yourself. His work is beyond amazing - in any of the movies he writes for - but this one tops the cake. For me, it puts me in a state of pure bliss and I could listen to it forever. Absolutely gorgeous. <br/><br/>I think this is one of the greatest movies ever made. If you truly understand it and embrace it, it is a life changer in terms of movies. Definitely one of the most beautiful love stories ever told. People who do not like this movie -- I think you don't have the brain capacity to tie all of the pieces together. Please, sir, step out of your box. You want a linear, easy to watch and understand movie? Try something a little bit easier for you, like Bad Boys or something (not that that is a bad movie!). I feel like this is a movie only appreciated by the truly intellectual or emotionally aware people, and all negative reviews are due to the lack of brain cells that one endures through life. If you can not tie the pieces together at all, this is going to be one confusing, stupid movie to you. Please look beyond Hollywood and see the beauty this film really is."

","This is a piece of art. On the contrary to the general belief, I saw this movie as one story instead of three. The content and the thoughts to be expressed are so very complicated and intense that probably the writer felt the need to create three different canvases to present the same story. Before watching the movie, I never even thought that someone would be able to transfer such state of a human mind to the screen in such a profound and convincing manner. Personally I think this is a work of a person who knows what it feels like. The actors were awesome and did justice to the wonderful script. As one reviewer said, this movie is for you if you watch it with the open mind.

","The Fountain is one of those movies so hard to review. Well, okay, for people like me that didn't fully get it. I mean, it's not the easiest thing to admit your ignorance.<br/><br/>All the way through this movie, and this is my first time watching it – 5+ years late, it reminded me of a more recent movie, Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life (2011.) In fact, not knowing anything about The Fountain, I thought this movie had Terrence Malick all over it. Not just for the subject matter – both spoke about the actual ""tree of life"" – but for the art direction, the mysticism and the space/inner-space journeys. But, alas, I was incorrect. The Fountain was Darren Aronofsky's baby.<br/><br/>I digress, The Fountain is a beautiful movie and somewhat deep – though, again, I didn't fully understand the message. As the movie progresses, if you can make it that far (I've heard of people all-but immediately stopping it, not giving it a chance), it slowly, but surely reveals the jumps in time-periods. I counted three separate story lines.<br/><br/>The Past. Seems like the Dark Ages – but, then, what do I know – and a man's journey to find the Mayan's ""secret"" Tree of Life, the original one from the Garden of Eden.<br/><br/>The Present. A Man and His Dying wife. Here's the tad bit clichéd, but effective story of a doctor (Jackman) doing everything (albeit mad) he can to cure cancer to save his wife who's on her deathbed, pretty much.<br/><br/>The Future (??). This part kinda reminded me of a Pixar short. A man (could be that same doctor??) in a snow globe (??) heading into space and into a dying star.<br/><br/>That last part might throw off a lot of people. It sure as hell did the trick on me.<br/><br/>Unlike the more recent The Tree of Life, mercifully, this is only 90 or so minutes, verses the 139 agonizing minutes of Tree. Also, The Fountain got to the point faster where Tree was all over the place and a minute few walked with a new meaning of life.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the meaning of The Fountain really wasbut that's okay. It was entertaining, mesmerizing, had fantastic cinematography and a beautiful score. I just wish I ""got"" it more.<br/><br/>Perhaps the person that recommended it to me could fill me in a bit.

","From the beginning to the end, I was in a state of utter amazement, to say the least. The film, ""The Fountain"" is a wonderful cinematic journey created by Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Wrestler, Black Swan) that tells the story of Tommy (Hugh Jackman) trying to save his wife Izzie (Rachel Weisz).<br/><br/>Thomas is on a quest to find the cure for cancer, whilst his wife is dying from it. Unknowing, he wastes valuable time away from her by trying to save her, in three separate timelines. Heart-wrenching acting, wonderful directing and an enchanting score by Clint Mansell give this film its own genre. Many things can be taken away from it and repeat viewings are a necessity to gather all the wonder of this film. I loved it the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, etc times I've watched it! The cinematography is absolutely breath-taking and the story of love is deep and meaningful. Films are not made this way anymore when they should be! The film's three separate timelines are: the 16th century Conquistador timeline is the book that Izzie is writing that she asks Tommy to finish; the timeline where Tommy is trying to save Izzie is the present; and the man journeying to the nebula with the tree is the future. Of course, that is just how I interpret the film, others may see it completely differently.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" is about death, love and most importantly the meaning of life. PURE ART. I give it 10/10 stars and would give it a billion/10 if I could! I highly recommend you see this film, nothing I have seen in my life has been as touching or as mesmerizing, and I have seen MANY films!"

In most of my reviews I try to summarize the plot, but I had no idea what was going on during the whole thing. I mean I got that Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz were married, and that they transcended time between three different times. But beyond that I really do not know what was happening in this movie.<br/><br/>It's not like it was bad, I was really intrigued by the plot and I loved Aranfosky's previous work, Jackman and Weisz are really good, doesn't hurt to throw in Ellyn Burstyn, Mark Margolis, Cliff Curtis and Stephen McHattie, the score by Clint Mansell is as epic as he always makes it. But it just lacked.<br/><br/>The conclusion will probably be different for you, but I just didn't like the plot enough to stay interested. I ended up playing solitaire on my computer, and honestly had more fun doing that."

","This chronicles several lives of the characters of Jackman and Weisz, who are always connected to one another(they were different relationships, but they always knew and cared about each other). It's about love, destiny, death, spirituality, the circle of life, nature and our fragile existence in this world. You won't completely know what's going on until the end, and it leaves things open for interpretation. This has been called a new generation's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and to an extent, the comparison can at least be made. While the running time is a mere 87 minutes sans credits, this does have a slow pace(there at those who'd outright say it drags). As far as level of detail, poetry of cinematography(don't get me wrong, this does look good, and there are some stunning visuals) and dramatic effect, this has nothing on Kubrick's film. The score is great. This makes you think(is it about accepting loss, or fighting until the end? Etc.), and the philosophy has some roots in Eastern religion, and explores the idea of living forever, present in many, perhaps most, faiths. There is little CGI, instead the majority of the FX are unique and organic, as they are, quite simply, not fake or staged... it's micro-photography of chemical reactions in petri dishes. The acting is well-done and the characters are relatively swiftly developed(they aren't lingered on, usually), though it really isn't the focus, and you don't go out of this remembering either that strongly. The DVD comes with a short production called Life on a Boat that I'm not sure I ""get"", and a feature-length 64 minute documentary called Inside the Fountain, which I will review on its separate page here on the site. There is some violence and sensuality in this. I recommend this to those who believe they will enjoy it. 7/10"
"vok2000","9","1","3","16 March 2011"," My review
","The fountain is a movie where 3 stories are running parallel. These 3 stories are of the same person living in 3 different time zones living the same moment each time. In scenario one he is a scientist, in the second a knight may be & in the 3rd he is a pure energy, spirit or soul who can be felt once one is in a transcendental meditation where time & limitations for one do not exist as a being. In all the 3 time zones, he lives the same moments. The character of the movie is extremely brave & one who does not know what to do & how to deal with a situation where his life / love - Izzi (Heroin) is going to die. He is not only ready to put everything to save her but also has the caliber in all the stories to seek for a realistic understanding in this situation. The movie has a higher philosophical touch to the story as the story clearly highlights the thought process of a being as to what one goes through when he is helpless & unable to stop the flow of nature i.e death. He is in no frame to accept the law of nature as he is eternally in love with Izze. On the other hand, In the main story Izze understands him really well so plots a smart climax to curb his thinking to higher understanding of life.<br/><br/>The movie has a strong message. It says that the let go of our loved ones cannot happen by living in past & the future will always be being together with her / them as we will also leave the body one day & be again an energy. It says every beginning has a end & every end is a new beginning.<br/><br/>The movie had to be a flop because it drains one emotionally & slightly difficult to understand in all states of mind. The movie will remain a master piece for me & I will remember this movie for a long time. It's a movie, where I will give it a 9 of 10 for its great visual effects, direction & acting. I will keep the one mark simply because the message should have been present related that is living every moment in internal bliss & not expressing a depressing acceptance & messaging one that they will have to wait until they die to be together with their lost love."

","""Death is a disease. It's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure. And I will find it.""<br/><br/>I think Darren Aronofsky is great. He brings a sense of art into each movie he makes, no matter how human, small, and individual his stories may be. The Fountain is different from his other projects, however, because it's almost wholly an art film. It largely leaves conventional storytelling behind and explores love, loss, and fear of mortality through reoccurring images, symbolism, alternating time-lines/realities, and some really fantastic visuals. <br/><br/>I have to say that I liked it. It's ambitious and it takes a while to get a handle on, but it captured my interest from the very beginning. There were moments when The Fountain brought to mind a Guillermo del Toro movie, times when it felt like pure Aronofsky, and then scenes that reminded me of nothing I've seen previously. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman gives a commendable, fragmented performance as the three main characters in their three variations of the story. But it's Rachel Weisz who plays the only character in the film that we really get to know a part of, and she's the anchor of the overall story. I gained a healthy respect for both actors, while watching this. <br/><br/>On the whole, I found The Fountain to be a worthy experience. There's something lacking, though. I can't say what it is, exactly. The movie felt a little too loosely connected, as if the theme binding it together wasn't tied quite as tightly as it should have been.<br/><br/>I predict three different possible reactions to The Fountian. Person A will watch about 15 minutes of it, quickly realize it's not for them, and turn it off. Person B will appreciate what Aronofsky tried to do, but feel that The Fountain is ultimately a flawed effort. Person C will enjoy the movie and want to see it again several times, despite niggling concerns that it's not quite all it had the potential to be. <br/><br/>I'm Person C. I loved the cinematography and had a very positive reaction to all the metaphysics and existential themes (which isn't always the case, despite the fact that I was a philosophy major in college). It's not the typical Aronofsky film and it's not his best (The Wrestler) or his most complete (Black Swan), but it's definitely his most ambitious."
"MajorFilmFan","10","1","3","18 January 2011"," A beautiful, but very strange, hymn to life, death, and love
","Darren Arenofsky has created an EXTREMELY original film in The Fountain. And, while it may not connect with most people, I found it to be beautiful.<br/><br/>Tommy(Hugh Jackman) and his wife Izzi(Rachel Weiz) live an idyllic life in the 21st century. But, appearances are never as they seem. Tommy is a brilliant scientist. His goal: cure Izzi, who is dying of Cancer. But, before Izzi dies, she plans to finish the book she's been writing, a book titled The Fountain. The Fountain details the following story: In The 1500s, Queen Isabella of Spain sends her best Conquistidor, Thomas to the jungles of Mexico to hunt for a mysterious hidden temple of the Mayan people. According to Mayan legend, the Mayan creator, First Father, sacrificed himself in this temple in order to create the Mayan people. His body became a tree, and his soul, its branches. This is known to the Mayans as The Tree of Life. It is said that anyone that drinks its sap will be able to live forever. She gives Thomas a ring, and tells him that if he should find the tree, and he returns to Spain, he and the Queen will be married, and together, they shall live forever.<br/><br/>Tommy seems to recall these events as if he has lived them himself. But, seeing as there is 500 years difference, that is physically impossible. Except, that is, if Thomas found the Tree of Life.<br/><br/>In the year 2500, a aging Tommy is reacing through Space in a strange bubble. The only company he has is a tree, which is the body of his deceased wife, Izzi. His target, the Mayan underworld, Xibalba (pronounced ""shibalba""),which is, in actuality, a Nebula wrapping around a dying star. Tommy is heading here in order to be reborn, so he can live with Izzi forever.<br/><br/>As odd as this film sounds, everything ties together in the end, and makes a strange but powerful tale of one man's undying love for the woman he loves, and how far he will go to be with her forever"

So first things first.<br/><br/>There is no timetravelling, no parallel universes/realities no fantasy world.<br/><br/>There is actually only one real story, of a neuroscientist trying obsessively to save his dying wife who was suffering of brain cancer. In her final days she was writing a novel(The Fountain) which was also her way of processing her near death. Besides, the story was also intended to make her husband understand why she lost her fear of death. For that, she left the book unfinished and asked him to write the final chapter. The story of the novel plays probably in the early 16th century in Spain and Central America(Mayan territory) and is one of the three, some reviewers are talking about. The ""third"" story is just a visualization of what was going on within his mind/soul and is very dreamlike.<br/><br/>ENJOY!"

","How nice to have a movie that requires one to pay attention and that challenges the mind! I'm going to buy this because each time I see it I get more from it. I gave it 9 out 10 only because I wish it were longer!!!<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is astonishing. It took me a while the first time to realize that he was the Spanish character too, he looks so different and even his body language is different. In fact all three characters have different body language, quite an achievement. His emotional range is vast, and his portrayal of grief here is just as raw and real as Juliet Stephenson's in ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"". I know he makes a lot of money as Wolverine but I'd love to see him playing more roles with this kind of deep emotional honesty.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz doesn't do a lot but her beauty and gravity and sweetness and sense of play make it obvious why the Jackman characters are so obsessed with getting her back or getting back to her or whatever.<br/><br/>The art direction is Oscar-worthy,it's a character in its own right.<br/><br/>I love it!"

","Never say never, but I never thought I'd say this, but The Fountain is the best I have ever witnessed. For me, music arouses emotions and quite frankly need not to go further, the best movie sound track I have ever heard is placed on this wonderful story. My first viewing was very confusing, knowing there's something very special here yet needs to be unearthed. So I left this title and waited a few years just for the right time, and on my second viewing I figured things out for myself and had a good cry after.<br/><br/>Just like words, it's hard to take away the exact meaning of what is said, yet the listener will always take away something from their own experiences.<br/><br/>I believe there are two stories in The Fountain, one is in the present time, the other is being written by Isabel (Rachel Weisz). The third which people believe is the third story is only a happening in Tomas's (Hugh Jackman) head, his guilt for not having the ability to save his love in time, his emotions and his insanity due to his loss. It's quite sad really, yet very true. Would I go mad, would I only hear the music that's played throughout the movie if the same occurred in my life? God forbid. <br/><br/>Four years have past since the first time I watched The Fountain, yet I can not stop think about it, I hear the music all the time and I consider myself a very happy person.

"couching_tiger_eatin_popcorn","10","1","3","11 April 2010"," The Fountain: Of death and grief
","In this film about learning to let go and accepting death, Aronofsky takes a highly unusual path in the visualization of the concepts, and succeeds in so many ways. Aronofsky took a simple story about a man and his dying wife and made us feel the weight of its significance in the grieving man. The woman he loved represented for him, life, but this convergence took him away from reality, and distanced him from his wife during her dying days, both physically and mentally, and the film shows him realizing this among other things as he sorts through his feelings about her death. Aronofsky shows that he can deal with the affirmation of life as well as he has with urban death in Requiem for a Dream.<br/><br/>The film is divided into three story lines about a Spanish conquistador, a present-day man whose wife is dying, and a man in a futuristic bubble traveling through space. The film is grounded in the present-day story; the other two are metaphoric representations. The first storyline is a visualization of the manuscript that the wife wrote about a conquistador, representative of a role the husband fashioned for himself to try to save his wife, attempting to save a Spanish queen, a shadow of his beloved wife coupled with his sense of duty to serve her. She leaves the unwritten ending to be finished by her husband, and he struggles to do so, but at the end, he realizes that the character of the conquistador must die alone, as it was the part of him that lived only to save his beloved.<br/><br/>Grief is a journey, one metaphorically represented by the man's travel toward the dying star through the golden nebula in a bubble. He travels with the dying tree of life, a representation of his feelings and memories about his dead wife. He sustains himself by consuming the dying tree of life, piece by piece. Only by killing his grief, trapped with the feelings about his wife, can he actually be born anew and rendered able to live.<br/><br/>The present-day story is mainly composed of him recalling the memories of his wife's last days. In it, a curious element stands out: the magical elixir from Central America that cures the macaque. Does this make this work a science fiction? For me, it's a reinforcement of the concept that this movie itself is a vision. Perhaps this distances the film away from reality, but it really works here, because the three storytelling elements merge so seamlessly together, due to this fantastic element at even the movie's most grounded level. Is it a warped memory, or even a hopeful fantasy of the grieving husband? Whatever the case, the grief, the guilt, and the obsession over the loss of a loved one come through in abundance.<br/><br/>Beyond the basics of the ingenious narrative that allows for a deep plunge beyond empathy, the film brings other layers of understanding and subjects to chew on long after you've finished watching. Some of the most enjoyable for me were the religious metaphors. Christian, Mayan, Buddhist imageries are presented throughout the film. All of these religious beliefs, and perhaps most if not all of the world's religions, deal with birth, death, and rebirth. The concept of rebirth is different for each, but death brings life, including in Christianity, where Christ's death cleanses the original sin and invites humans back to life beyond death. As is such, the conquistador and the man in the bubble had to die, so that the man can live on. Also in our lives, we constantly go through a process of death and rebirth as we grow older, and the film represents through a grieving process these cycles that mirror that of life and nature itself.<br/><br/>Touching back on the narrative, our traditional sense of time is useless here. The three stories are not real, even in a fictional sense; rather they are memories and metaphors. The only scene that occurs in real time may be the one where the man buries the tree seed near the end (within fiction, of course). The film may be, in a fictional time, taking place in a few minutes, or in an hour and a half, rather than days or centuries. For all of us, our memories and thoughts of things past exist in timeless space among connectors between neurons, where we can revisit large spans of time in merely seconds, and recall the feelings from those times with force and clarity. The film is an expression of such concept of time, and the expansion of the collapsed sense of time we feel in our memories.<br/><br/>The film's sense of morality is also quite unusual. The history of the conquistadors is that of exploitation and brutality in the name of religion and state, and it loosely parallels the film's concept of science in the thoughtless use of animals for the conceits of mankind. It points to the moral ambiguities that can be spurred on by our resistance to the cycles of life and death. I don't think the movie is anti-science, but rather prompts us to think about our role within the natural order.<br/><br/>The film is shot beautifully as well, adding to its amazing depth. The disassociated feel of the conquistador and the floating bubble story lines is a reflection of the man's inability to deal with reality. In both of these visions, the woman is hardly seen, although her presence is always felt in connection to his obsession over cheating death--she is obscured in the earlier storyline, and exist only in ghostly bits of memory in the latter. In contrast, the husband's recalling of the present-day memories feels incredibly tactile--the close up shots of the pair's intimate moments during their heartfelt interactions reveals itself as the closest reflection of reality. Of course, the excellent and compelling music thread these elements together."

","First of all excuse me for not being an eloquent writer like most here (I have some language disabilities) and this is my first ""review.""<br/><br/>Not till the last scene of the movie did it really hit me what I just witnessed. I've only watched the movie once so there maybe some small things I missed. Simply put the movie is about a young woman (Isabel) dying of terminal brain cancer, she knows she is dying and accepts her fate with grace, and ease, but her loving husband Tommy, a research doctor in the field, can not accept the inevitable her passing. Isabel as she is coming to grips with her fate and what may lie beyond death researches Mayan beliefs of death and renewal (these secrets take place in the Orion Nebula). She writes a fantasy book based on these beliefs ""The Fountain."" She writes chapters 1–11 but leaves the last chapter unfinished for her husband to finish... something that he is very reluctant to do. Her part of the book is about a Spanish conquistador (her husband) searching for eternal life to save his queen (herself) from the Spanish Inquisition by finding the biblical ""Tree of Life"" hidden in the Mayan world. The space scenes (not necessarily in the future) with him and the Tree of Life in a bubble craft is the way he finishes the book consisting of him reaching the Orion Nebula in order to renew the dying Tree of Life (the metaphor for his beloved wife). He finds that the only way to achieve eternal life is through death, then renewal. In the end I came to the conclusion that the book was the last gift Isabel could give him a way to accept her death (and death in general) which in the end he does."

There is, it is true, some good cinematography, but the film abandons any attempt at a traditional narrative.<br/><br/>I suppose if you enjoy the randomness of images in a dream you might just enjoy this however I can't help feeling that a lot of the positive comments on here are a result of ""emperor's new clothes"" syndrome regarding the director"

"Mean_Joe_Weeks","7","1","3","28 May 2009"," A not-quite-realized Dream
","Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"" is a truly visionary work which no other director living today could have imagined and pulled off. It's a staggering film to behold, bursting at the seams with ideas and motifs and references to history, philosophy, and religion.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it never quite adds up to a sum of its parts. Although the photography is beyond fantastic and Jackman and Weisz commit completely and, in Jackman's case, almost heroically to their parts, the film is just stuffed too full for its slim 96 minute runtime.<br/><br/>Aronofsky tells 3 stories in that runtime, at least two of which probably deserve their own 146 minute films. As a result, the historical tale of a Spanish conquistador, which is treated as an epic tale of obsession and madness gets maybe ten scenes in the final product. It feels incomplete, a sketch or maybe an annotated telling of something meant to feel much more intense. The main, and arguably the only ""real"" storyline, set in present day, feels complete but almost painfully sparse. There's just barely enough time to tell the story, let alone flesh it out. The third ""sci-fi/fanatasy"" story is complete and perhaps the most satisfying of the three universes, but can't really augment its sister stories which aren't all there in the first place. As such, it feels like a subplot which is stealing much-needed time from the main plot(s).<br/><br/>Now, this is arguably not Aronofsky's fault. The budget for the film was essentially cut in half from what he originally wanted, down to 35 mil. The film, though always impeccably photographed, looks like it cost about 100 mil sometimes (the space parts), while at other times looking a bit cheap and chintzy, with some sets obviously dressed and lit to hide their cheap construction (some of the modern-day parts and a couple jungle scenes). This has the unfortunate effect of occasionally taking you out of the reality of the story, and reminding you that you're watching a film. The film is constantly struggling to be epic... but settling for the best it can offer. Which sometimes means little, sparse sets and sequences have to try and pretend to be big and elaborate, with varying degrees of success and low lighting.<br/><br/>When a director of Aronofsky's ambition is forced into this sort of limitation, you've gotta believe that a lot was lost. Whole scenes, whole subplots surely got the ax before the thing was even shot, and may more were probably lost in the editing room. There is a long an interesting scene where Conquistador Jackman considers assassinating a member of the Inquisition. It's the only real scene in the whole story that feels like it was not a 100% inarguably necessary scene to tell the bare bones of the plot, but I have to imagine there were more like it originally, which would have developed the story a little more fully. Likewise, there are a few tertiary characters (Ellen Burstyn's and Mark Margolis's being obvious examples) who get a scene or two but never really amount to more than plot devices. I'd bet heavily that the original script gives them more meaning and life. This mean that the whole thing feels uncomfortably truncated, zipping from event to event with no downtime for us to absorb the characters and atmosphere, or even the organic progression of a story.<br/><br/>In the end, even the leads get only a few small sequences in which to establish their relationship, which is absolutely key to the story's emotional core. Despite their honest efforts, they can only really build a kind of bland, general relationship out of their few scenes together (most of which relentlessly advance the plot and allow little time for the kind of detail which would make this work better). The film gets too obsessed with getting its story out in time, and forgets that we need to be able to invest in the characters and the world too, which is it's fatal law.<br/><br/>The Fountain is not a failure, exactly; its still full of interesting thoughts and images (most of which announce themselves pretty unsubtly) and it certainly is a more creative and ambitious film than just about anything else you'll see. Tragically, the constrains of reality and the complexity of balancing three compelling stories at once ended up damning it to the realm of the merely interesting, rather than the truly great. Which is a shame, because it comes so close; it feels like one more permissive edit away from a true classic. Like a rough sketch waiting for the texture to bring it home. Maybe a director's cut will get it there, if one exists. But maybe next time Aronofsky says he needs money for a film, it would be wise to just let him do what he needs to do to make his masterpiece."
"yasminaaa99","8","1","3","27 April 2009"," a movie to make you think
","I finally saw this movie on DVD. Throughout the movie I just couldn't t get it in my mind that the story has much to do with love. Instead it tells a lot about selfishness and the consequences of being ego driven (as eastern philosophy teaches since another man stayed under a tree): wrong choices and inability to live without distress. Thomas does not love his wife, if he loved her he would stay more with her and live the present , the only immortality we have. Instead he loves himself and is crushed by the thought of losing her and the thought of his own imminent death. Of course a film is more that a story, even one such full of metaphors, but I confess I don t have the knowledge to competently review the directing or the editing of the movie. All I know is that it must have been good because it proved an easy and enjoyable vehicle for me to get to the interpretations. And I agree with reviews that have pointed out that it could have been directed better. After all, Van Gogh could have painted more neatly . But I don t think this is the point. Yet I don t agree with reviews that dismissed the movie as being complicated or trying to hard. The genius of Aronofsky is that, I think, his stories are about the content and his directing about the processes of the character s minds. The Fountain has the qualities of sumptuous imagery, cultural and historic references and yes, complexity and sometimes confusion of beliefs of educated minds, like Thomas and Izzi are supposed to have. There may be mistakes about this movie but I respect Aronofsky as a writer and director because, like all good art, his movie pleases the senses and goes beyond to make you think. It sure left me thinking of my own death and from witch perspective would be better to face it."
"billion_mucks","7","1","3","7 December 2008"," Abiding after Death
","After watching Arrenofsky's head cracker, I had mixed feelings. First, it's love story was uneven, it meandered around pretentiousness, and it lacked light and colors.<br/><br/>Then, there are the scenes in which Hugh Jackman is alone in his space bubble, forward to the Nirvana, remembering Lizzie, contemplating the stars, alone. And I figured, this is a good approach at death: having to cope alone in the afterlife, along a Tree that represents the object of the search, remembering love as he felt it. Along him, supernovas and stars collide crafted by a good graphic design.<br/><br/>Very hard, with few moments to suck on. But those moments..."

I was at this bar in Havelock North in 2003 and I notice this attractive dark haired woman smiling at me... I danced with her for hours and you know we started to put our arms around each other and lean in close to talk over the music. We woke up together and laughed about life. I realize now that she was putting on a New Zealand accent as she was trying to get it down pat for a New Zealand movie that didn't eventuate. Still that night is linked to this movie for me.

","Aronofsky perfects his vision with this wondrous, emotionally draining experience. It transcends being a film and completely immerses the audience into it's world and story; drawing them further and further along until the explosive finale. I wasn't too crazy about some of the dialogue, and Cliff Curtis' horrific accent almost made me kill myself but aside from those two minor things, the entire film was mind-blowing. Hugh Jackman's intense, emotional performance was stunning and had me in tears. Rachel Weisz was also quite good, though she suffered from the majority of the dialogue that I didn't like. Aronofsky creates his vision by combining the sensational score and cinematography to drive the viewer along this incredible journey."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","3","23 January 2008"," Though obscure in its ways, ""The Fountain"" is rich and beautiful
","""The Fountain"" often feels like an interlocking puzzle of eras, characters and symbolism, yet there is a distinct overall thematic tone to the film, almost a decoder that once utilized brings out the best in the film.<br/><br/>It's the kind of movie that for most people will necessitate a second viewing. Once the viewer can set aside thoughts of the plot direction, the film opens up a lot more in its discussion of life and death and the idea of eternal life. Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, Pi) has brought to life an art film that wraps itself in the genres of science-fiction and mythical history.<br/><br/>At its core, ""The Fountain"" is about the relationship between Tommy and Izzy (Jackman and Weisz), the names of their characters in the contemporary storyline. This is the easiest access point for the viewer and consequently the most important, we see a very relatable example in that Izzy is dying and Tommy, a doctor researching tumor cures, would do anything to save her. Arronofsky uses this as a spring board into the more obscure ways of telling the story (inquisition era Spain and conquering the Mayans and the distant future). To keep them connected, he imposes images of the characters from one storyline to another and uses consistent symbols. Also, his brilliant use of lighting gives the film a distinct look and an overall mystical feel.<br/><br/>It's tough to give up on making the plot fit and make sense neatly like a normal film, but this is not a normal film. It is a story about themes that are exemplified by the relationship between the main characters. It is a film about emotions and ideas and discussing them in very abstract ways. It is difficult and tough to access, but very ripe for deep thinking or discussion."

","The polycentric structure of THE FOUNTAIN is bound to make it a difficult film for some viewers, an intriguing one for others, and an irresistibly fantastic one for even more viewers. Those who stretch their senses beyond the movie's leaps between the past, present, and future time periods, and who allow themselves to flow along with director Darren Aronofsky's brilliant stream of consciousness discover one amazingly beautiful film.<br/><br/>Among the reasons that some have found The Fountain more disorienting than entertaining is because most of the scenes are shot in shadowy environments with concentrations of light shining like a promised revelation at a distance. This same implied promise of revelation, along with composer Clint Mansell's hauntingly gorgeous score, is a major part of the magic that pulls lovers of the movie deep inside its beguiling story of one man's quest to climb ""The Tree of Knowledge"" in order to master ""The Tree of Life."" Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz both enjoy an actor's feast with multiple roles that place them in the 16th Century, the present, and the 26th Century. We first meet Jackman in the past, as Tomas the Conquistador, when he accepts a mission from Queen Isabel (Weisz) to challenge the Mayans and ""deliver Spain from bondage."" But his mission is not really so much about delivering Spain as it is taking possession of the fabled fountain of youth and the tree of life referenced in the Book of Genesis. There are no sub-headings or other warnings to let us know when we're about to travel to another era and that causes a double-take when we suddenly see Tom meditating before a large grayed tree afloat in a giant space bubble. There, he counts the rings tattooed on his arm to symbolize the many years or lifetimes he has waited to reunite with his beloved. Finally, in the present time, there is Dr. Tommy Creo, who races against time to discover a cure for his terminally ill wife Izzi (Weisz again.) As painfully frustrating as it is to watch his wife dying, it is almost just as agonizing for Tommy to endure her attitude towards her death. Rather than mourning pitifully for herself or struggling to defeat death as Tommy does, she takes her cue from Mayan mythology that observes ""Death is the road to awe,"" and that conscious dying should be experienced ""as an act of creation."" Definitely a difficult concept for the average Westerner to embrace. The act of creation that Izzi undertakes to confront death is the composition of an historic novel called ""The Fountain."" Is the story she's writing one about their lives in centuries past, or a fable conjured to help her husband cope with his grief once she's gone? Or is it both? Only director Aronofsky--maybe--knows for sure.<br/><br/>If balancing time-lines was the biggest challenge viewing The Fountain, viewers could probably handle it easily enough. However, it is also Aronofsky's tendency to explore different states of consciousness while moving back and forth through time. For that reason, in addition to experiencing the ups and downs of Tom's conscious angst, we also step inside his dreams, memories, nightmares, scientific dilemmas, and his life as a character in Izzi's book. The fitting word to describe such a lush mosaic of genius is...well, genius.<br/><br/>Jackman's performance did not earn him an Oscar nomination but probably should have. Not just for the soulful depth he brought to his triple-layered role but for the extraordinary blend of technical and spiritual resources employed to achieve that depth. The overall imagery in The Fountain is pure metaphysical poetry: from flaming swords and golden floating galaxies, to a human body literally blossoming and Tom's ink-black silhouette moving against a backdrop of countless white stars. This is not the kind of movie to which one should give two thumbs up or two thumbs down. It's the kind one should watch and absorb several times over to extract from it as much beauty and wisdom as possible.<br/><br/>by Author-Poet Aberjhani, author of ""Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance"""
"theskylabadventure","6","1","3","20 January 2008"," Hugely disappointing and not nearly as profound as it tries to be
","Having eagerly awaited the release of this movie, I had perhaps set my expectations a little too high. I consider both 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream' to be brilliant works of cinema, and I had read many glowing reviews for 'The Fountain' before seeing it, so it did have a lot to live up to.<br/><br/>This is a three tiered story, concerning questions of love, death, the meaning of life and the idea of immortality. We are presented with three irrevocably intertwined tales - one set in 16th Century Spain; the second set in modern, urban America; the final set in the future. That's a lot to fit into 92 minutes, I thought to myself, but if anyone can do it, Aronofsky can.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the film succeeds on many levels, not least a visual one. The effects and the cinematography deserve a great deal of praise, but this is not the kind of film to value style over substance.<br/><br/>As far as the substance goes, it's hit or miss. The main (modern) story is deeply moving, thanks largely to two fine performances. We feel every bit of Hugh Jackman's anger and frustration at the world as he tries to find a way to save his dying wife, played devastatingly by Rachel Weisz.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, neither the dialogue or the performances during the 16th Century scenes, which see Jackman play a warrior sent on a mission to find the key to eternal life by Weisz' queen, are good enough to carry the weight of the premise. This is heavy stuff, and it is handled a little clumsily by all concerned and, consequently, never hits the mark.<br/><br/>The future segment sees Jackman sporting a Buddhist skinhead and talking to a tree. Sounds a bit silly you may think. Unfortunately, despite Jackman's best efforts, it is. It really is.<br/><br/>In the end, while the film poses some pretty heavy questions about the nature of man, and manages to deliver some very moving moments, it never really comes close to the greatness it strives for. Much as it pains me to say it, it really is a bit of a turkey.<br/><br/>See it for the stunning visuals and for the fine performances of Jackman and Weisz in the central story (try to overlook the others), but don't set your heart on being blown away. Let's just hope Aronofsky's next film will be a return to form."
"tubby1","6","1","3","17 January 2008"," Wonderously ponderous
","There is something strangely hypnotic and alluring about 'The Fountain'.<br/><br/>The sets and photography are crafted to create this otherworldly feel and to take you through a narrative that shifts from the Spanish Inquisition to a Space Odyssey of the future.<br/><br/>The script is ponderous and grand in its depiction, which it ultimately fails to reach. However, Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman are engaging and do very well with the understated emotions that are necessary in this delicate piece of film making.<br/><br/>I appreciate this film for what it is, a look into the delicacy of life, love and death and if you can admire its audacity to venture into such territory and not be unsettled by its meanderings it will be a worthwhile experience, one that will oddly remain with you for sometimes."
"klesker","10","1","3","15 January 2008"," A unique experience
","I am a fan of surreal. Yes i am guilty of enjoying things that make little sense and are open to interpretation. I find it a pleasant release from some of the formulaic drivel that comes out of Hollywood from time to time, spoon feeding the audience with endless scenes of exposition just to let them know where they are in the story. But with surrealism, the movie is very much a different experience to those that enjoy watching it. Look at pretty much everything by David Lynch.<br/><br/>I am also a huge fan of Darren Aronofski with Requiem For a Dream being the greatest anti drug movie since Trainspotting. Surrealism was a key influence on his debut Pi, so we already know the man i capable of tackling such weirdness.<br/><br/>The Fountain is no exception. yes, it is weird, yes, a lot of the time is appears to make little sense and yes, in aims to confront the audience rather than comfort. But this is a totally different surrealism that we witnessed in Pi. This is a different Aronofski all together. And, quite simply, it is one of the finest films of the decade.<br/><br/>There have been few cinematic experiences that have made me want to weep with joy but this is one of. The last time i felt so elated was when i watched Magnolia for the first time at 17. I felt so...involved, beside myself with emotion. Sounds cheesy, i know but i couldn't help but be so moved by it. As a friend of mine put it: ""you don;t watch the film, you FEEL it"". And he couldn't be anymore right.<br/><br/>This is a collage of images rather than a concrete narrative structure. Like Dali, Aronofski tells a simple story, that of love and loss, using unconventional means. The result is awe inspiring and made me ask (as i did at the end of Magnolia) why movies are very rarely this good.<br/><br/>With a movie of this calibre the performances are incredible yet it's the direction that's the biggest surprise. Gone is the frantic cutting and hectic pace or Aronofski's previous efforts. This movie takes its time, effortlessly so, looking more akin to Kubrick. Patience is required yet the result is all the more rewarding. And it looks beautiful.<br/><br/>I understand wholeheartedly why there are those that hate this film but they can't seem to appreciate the majesty of it. I loved it and as soon as i finished watching it i wanted to watch it five times more. I believe each repeated viewing will bring further rewards. It ain't for everyone but then again, it wasn't made for everyone.<br/><br/>5/5"
"Robert_90","8","1","3","14 January 2008"," Brilliant visuals, confusing story lines
","I hadn't really heard too much about The Fountain - it directed by Aronofsky, the man who did Requiem for a Dream, it was set in the past, present and future somehow, had to do with eternal life, etc. So I guessed I didn't really have much of an idea about the movie. I was right about that.<br/><br/>The main plot revolves around Tom (Hugh Jackman), a genetic scientist who is trying to perfect a cure for brain tumours, all while dealing with his terminally ill wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz). The movie often follows two different plots that tie in with the main one - a story-within-a-story about a medieval conquistador (also Jackman) searching for the mythical ""tree of life"" in South America, and Tom's future, where he lives inside a ball with a tree as it hurtles through outer space. Something like that.<br/><br/>It's even harder to wrap your head around the plot when it happens on screen. I'll be honest here, I spent a fairly good portion of the movie wondering what exactly was real and what wasn't. Since I review movies after one viewing, I probably missed a fair bit. This film could use several viewings.<br/><br/>That's a small error to worry about when you're watching everything that's going on. On the whole, any moment in The Fountain is a powerful one. Everything comes together perfectly - sight, sound, emotions. If anything really stood out about this film, it was the general look of the film. Visually, The Fountain is quite simply eye-boggling. The final 20 minutes alone are jaw-dropping in their intensity.<br/><br/>The Fountain was one hell of a movie to watch. Between the convoluted, thought-provoking plot line(s) and the film's aesthetics, you're in for more than just a movie - you're in for an experience."
"98nurdinm-1","9","1","3","10 January 2008"," ""The Fountain""
","I like to think of myself as a fairly universal film viewer, in that I watch both mainstream and art house films. Personally I don't really like the fact that there is such a thing as art house cinema  films are for everyone, and we should all be given the chance to watch them, whatever their subject matter, country of origin, etc. Thank goodness, then, for DVDs, or else I know I probably would have had to wait a very long time before seeing ""The Fountain"".<br/><br/>This film totally staggered me. I knew I was in for a wild ride in a technological sense, and I wasn't proved wrong. The visual effects, particularly those set in the ""future/inner self"" segments of the film are awesome to watch and beautiful. But this film has a hell of a lot of emotion in it too, and I wasn't expecting to be taken on a wild ride inwards.<br/><br/>I guess it's kind of difficult to work out the exact synopsis  Aronofsky gives the plot just enough ambiguity for everyone to have their own opinion on what exactly is going on. It all revolves around the characters of Tommy and Izzie, played respectively by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. Izzie is sick, dying of a brain tumour, and Tommy has made it his mission to find a cure for it and save her life. Izzie, meanwhile, spends her time writing a manuscript for a novel about a Spanish conquistador who is sent on a seemingly impossible expedition by his love, the Queen of Spain  again, both of these characters played by Jackman and Weisz.<br/><br/>This film is a real tour de force for both these actors, and Weisz is fast becoming one of my top five favourite actresses who make films watchable simply because they are in them. Thankfully, this doesn't have to be the case with ""The Fountain"". Jackman is probably the stand out performance here, however, his character (or characters) going through a wide range of emotions and journeys whose endings, though perhaps are sometimes predictable, are not tedious in their predictability.<br/><br/>Several images repeat themselves through the film; for example a ring, skin, and, perhaps most important of all, a tree. Not just any tree, mark you, but the Tree of Life, the perhaps less famous one from the book of genesis in the Bible, the one whose slightly overshadowed by the big bad Tree of Knowledge. If anything, this film made me actually see for the first time what several of the sentences mean in this segment of the biblical text, words that I and I'm sure a lot of others would have simply blanked over.<br/><br/>I urge you to see this film. I know it won't be everybody's cup of tea  after all, that's why it's not mainstream. It's intellectual, has a confusing plot line, only has two major stars in it, and it's director's last film was ""Requiem For A Dream"", another flick which divided film goers and critics alike. But it's also about grief, about love and hope and of acceptance. This would be a great therapy film for those going through a terminal illness, or for those who have recently lost someone in that way. It is a beautiful, beautiful film, and the first chance that you get, please, watch it.<br/><br/>9/10"

","As I looked through the comments on this film, what I noticed was that it was either receiving 9s and 10s, or 1s and 2s. Yes, it is a love it or hate it type of film, but that's alright; who wants to go with the flow? I personally loved it. Great cinematography, great acting, great directing, and very very thought provoking. Yes, it is hard to understand, and I know that's the number one complaint about the movie. That's fine, though; I'd rather watch a movie that makes me think instead of a brainless flick that spoon-feeds the audience everything. I'm not saying I'm a genius or anything either...I'm just the average Joe. Maybe the reason I liked it is because of the fact that it is deep. In an age dominated by sequels and remakes, I welcome in the originality with ease.<br/><br/>So, whether Aronofsky is a genius, I'm not sure. His films seem thought out enough to me, but I'm sure others will just label such things as ""pretentious"" or ""overrated."" One thing I do know, though, is that Aronofsky is very talented visually, and it's something that shows a lot in The Fountain.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","THE FOUNTAIN became a long-awaited project, the production and shooting of it took many years, the result is a complex love & death story with sterling performances from both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. There are three stories to be told; the main story is about doctor Tom who's doing everything in his power to prevail his wife's tragic fate; death of cancer. This is a moving and powerful story that is the main-spine of the movie, keeping it fairly understandably and appealing. Then we go back to the 15th century, were Tomas is having a burning passion for his country Spain as the country is on its last breakdown before its inquisitor forges a full-on dictator; Tomas is thereby sent out by the Queen of Spain to find the Tree of Life, hidden somewhere in the deep jungle, strongly guarded by Maia-Indians - and then, we travel into 2500, were Tommy is living in a bobble in space together with the Tree of Life, ready to sacrifice for his love for his now-dead wife so they can finally live together for ever. I don't even know if I got the story correctly, but I know that THE FOUNTAIN gripped me right away and it is one of the most compelling and fascinating movies of 2007. Especially Jackman and Weisz keeps the movie burning, as their performances stands as probably their best so far.

","""The Fountain"" is a different film. The visual effects, the poetic style, the mythology and the non-linearity of the plot give it a unique style and form, different from everything else! The movie is not easy to understand, because it's all around a metaphysical and philosophical subject: the rebirth after death and the possibility of an eternal life but in the end its greatest value is to present the viewer a beautiful and poetic love story with great visual effects. In fact, visually, the film is very good, in spite of having some ""cliché ideas"" about what could be an eventual life after death, and the ancestral idea of the Human soul floating in the Universe However, I liked the insertion of the Mayan mythology in the movie.

"gweller-3","10","1","3","29 August 2007"," Incredible, heart breaking love story
","I fully understand that people would give this movie a bad review if they don't understand it. I'm posting this review to help them understand it and hopefully appreciate it more:<br/><br/>* SPOILERS BELOW *<br/><br/>The Fountain consists of 3 parallel stories that take place over 1000 years. The different time periods are not shown in chronological order and there is a reason for this which I will explain below.<br/><br/>1400's - Inquistions<br/><br/>Tomas is a conquistador searching for the tree of life so that queen Isabella, the woman he loves, will live forever. Eventually Tomas finds the tree of life and brings the sap back to Isabella where they live for 500 years until...<br/><br/>Our present day - ~500 years later<br/><br/>Thomas (Tomas) is searching for a cure for Izzy's (Isabella) brain cancer. He tries to use mixtures with the tree of life in order to save her but finds the cure too late and Izzy passes on. Using the story that Izzy relayed to him he plants a seed of the tree of life on Izzy's grave.<br/><br/>Future - 2500's (the hardest part to understand I think)<br/><br/>Thomas, quite possibly the last man alive, is traveling in a space ship carrying a seeded tree of life, the tree which grew over Izzy's grave. The tree has consumed Izzy's body and with it's powers allows him to communicate with her since he consumes it on a regular basis. It is no coincidence that he speaks to the tree exactly as he speaks to Izzy. There is a reason so much of the dialog is repeated. Aranofsky is trying to show you that she is part of the tree without completely spelling it out for you. Notice how it cuts from the body of the tree to Izzy's body.<br/><br/>The tree is dying and needs a great energy source to be reborn which he will get from Xibalba when it explodes into a supernova. This is Thomas's hope that by having the tree reborn, Izzy will be reborn in a way too. If the tree dies, Izzy dies again which is why he is so distraught when the tree doesn't make it (he failed both times right before the moment where he could save both and the overlapping future and present show this very nicely).<br/><br/>Thomas realizes with the tree dead, he will die too. This is another hard to understand part of the movie. The visions he sees of himself dying as he drinks the sap, etc are how he ""finishes it""....finishes Izzy's story. He also finishes the story by in the present by deciding to spend time with Izzy instead of distancing himself from her while he tries so hard to find her cure.<br/><br/>Many people think the past and future did not really occur and are just allegories for his struggle with Izzy's death in the present, but I think once you understand the story it is quite clear they did. If you watch when he looks at the 500 tatooes on his arms (one for each year Izzy died), he asks Izzy to take him back so he can remember what he is trying to do. Likewise Izzy's book is their autobiography of the past, but Thomas has been too busy working to remember.<br/><br/>At any rate I think it is a very beautiful and simple story once you understand it. I'm glad that Aranofsky did not spell it out for everyone. It was nice to have a movie that didn't throw things in people's faces and allowed them to try and figure it out. I'm sure this isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I also see a ton of complaints from people when things are made too obvious. People are hard to please."
"regertz","10","1","3","8 August 2007"," Tremendous film reaching for the sublime...
","While this magnificent film should be seen in a theater it's worth it to see the DVD background and the intense devotion to the story by the various designers and crew caught up in the vision. Indeed, it's fun to see actors Jackman and Weisz pulling back a bit at times to poke a little fun at their roles. That said, there's little to add to the above reviews as to the film's imagery and beauty. I would suggest that the ""Future-2500"" segments may come close to overreaching at times for some but for me were enthralling. The acting was outstanding and career-making for the leads and the support alike...The Grand Inquisator and the Francisan being two especially fine performances.<br/><br/>Spoiler...My own view of the film follows a few others in feeling the 1500 segment is 2006 wife Izzy's book, her attempt to help her husband as well as herself deal with the inevitability of her death, while the 2500 segment is husband Tom's final chapter, written at her request in which he finally comes to terms with her death. The true ending for me is Tom planting the seed of the amazing Guatamalan tree which furnished a cure for both aging and cancer-one which came too late to save his wife- and then at last saying good-bye to her. But I'm probably being too pragmatic.<br/><br/>A hard film for me to watch, sharing some of its issues, but one you should not miss."

I don't know why people say this takes play in three eras. I think that was either the marketing department or obfuscation.<br/><br/>The Conquistador story exists in the imagination of Rachel and Hugh (it is the story she is writing and is NOT literal. She is telling Hugh to write the story himself. To imbue his life with meaning and assume responsibility for being the author/hero of his own life.<br/><br/>The future story takes place on the Platonic, or ideal level. The intention of the protagonists are revealed at their purist level.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on the doctor as a Platonic ""Third Man""- Not ideal (Anthropos, or the future dude in space), not material (Ialdaboath, or the guy trying to get a potion), but something in between.<br/><br/>Message: we are neither pure thought or pure matter.

I had previously seen Pi and thought that was crap, so for me, watching this film and not liking it was my fault. The film itself I found incongruent, it did not seem to follow any set pattern or storyline. maybe it's the form of direction, I don't care for movies that bounce around like this one did. <br/><br/>If a viewer is a fan of Aronofsky, he or she may appreciate this movie, I personally, felt it was a waste of the ""celluloid"" (and two hours of my life!) <br/><br/>When Warner Bros. first decided to cancel production, they should have left well enough alone."
"pc95","6","1","3","13 July 2007"," Imaginative but jumbled; perhaps needs more than 90min...
","The Fountain is imaginative and distinctive in it's look, and features vigorous acting from Hugh Jackman. It reminded me of something like a ""good"" version of ""The Cell"". Unfortunately, The Fountain at times feels like it's trying to cram in 3 movies into one 90 min session. Without any foreknowledge of what the story is, it took some 15-20 min to come to grips with the maker's reality or narrative.... Not too good for me, tried my patience. There is a pretty clear message of a cyclical meaning in life and death - they support one another and are linked. However, for me, whenever religion, faith, or spirituality permeate into explanations, it's a bit of let-down. I'm one more for reasoning and logic. Going back to medieval Spain with inquisitors and dark ages type setting is interesting as narrative, but not as an explanation really. Another thing is because of all the jumping around, I never quite empathized with the main 2 characters - they don't get much of a chance to develop, but rather are thrown onto us. Still the look is vivid and dreamlike - the filmmakers at least dared to make something less clichéd even though jumbled."
"mankler","8","1","3","10 July 2007"," Fantastic atmosphere
","One thing that was on my mind throughout this great film was how much I liked the atmosphere. The music, acting, props and story all bind together to give you a remarkably strong feeling of calm and something supernatural that I cannot really describe, and that is unlike anything that I have felt in any other movie before.<br/><br/>The closest I get to an example of a similar experience is the video game series Myst. People who have been enjoying Myst and Uru for the atmosphere, will probably like this movie a lot.<br/><br/>From start to finish I sat enchanted watching The Fountain. If you are looking for a movie to sink deeply into, this is what you should watch."

I haven't seen Jackman show such a great deal of emotion before.<br/><br/>As for the plot, magnificent ! This film is NOT for the narrow-minded among us. Im totally furious that a lot of critics have besmirched this movie. But yes, let's not beat around the bush - the film is (absolutely) not made for an audience whose spiritual level is as high like that of a spoon. I've heard of so many people talking bad about the movie, just because of the fact, that they probably didn't even bother to make up their minds. Yes, it is a thought-provocing movie ! But that doesn't mean, that it has no sense and deeper meaning. And so I've come to the point why I love this film so much. I stopped watching it at 3 o clock in the morning and as I went to bed millions of thoughts were running through my head. The more time passed, the more I began to find my way around all those ways of this great, great labyrinth. Yes, I personally felt myself more enlightened as I already am...<br/><br/>And this is one of the things that makes a good movie - the fact, that even after a week the meaning of the story can show its colours to me. Or that I see something totally different every time I watch this movie.<br/><br/>So, please people, don't go and watch this movie heads full of bad comments, but with an opened mind, with no expectations. For if so, the end and its meaning will really pierce your heart...and you will be grateful for it :)"

","WARNING: Potentially CONTAINS SPOILER... What The Fountain experience was to this viewer. <br/><br/>In my mind... the film handles (with kid gloves) those issues surrounding death, loss and grief and that it's not about aspiring to a futile immortality to conquer them but to find our way to Heaven, where our loved ones are waiting to spend eternity with us.<br/><br/>It's about taking advantage of the time we have here and now to love and to live. To not waste one moment of the scarce precious time we have been given to express that love.<br/><br/>It's about soul mates and how two being's love and destiny transcend physical death and whose spirits are bound together throughout all time and impossibilities. <br/><br/>It's a BEAUTIFULLY made film which goes through a great deal of time and painstaking effort to bring that message across to people who may otherwise be drudging through their lives. I hope it awakens minds and helps improve the lives of those willing to heed such a message, rather than disappoint some simple minded movie goers. The message was not wasted on me.

I believe I have a rudimentary idea what the director and authors want to tell me and the three intertwining stories are all beautiful in their own way. Well, perhaps not the story the director call ""Number one"" in the extra material on the DVD, but the two others are marvelous.<br/><br/>This is a strong movie. Strong in emotions, and a strong workmanship of everyone involved. The performances of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz is in my humble opinion well within Academy Award-winning quality. The director worked hard on getting this together and delivered a masterpiece. To top it of, the score for this jewel of a movie, lies there in the background and actually enhance what you see on the screen. Floating music to a floating... err... watch for your self.

","I am a big fan of Rachel Weisz. Every time I see one of her films, I fall in love all over again. This movie makes no exception. She looks stunning and gives us a moving performance. <br/><br/>The movie takes place at three different periods. There are several ways to tell how each period is associated. Actually, one way is more likely to be the good one. But Aronofsky incorporates in each period some elements that belong to another period and that contradict the logical order of things. It makes you wonder which time period is the one that started it all and what is the real story. I think that's why many people were confused by this film.<br/><br/>In my opinion, you shouldn't watch this film trying to find a logical story line. Things are imbricated just to show us that life is a perpetual cycle. That is the entire point of the story."

","It is really a pity that a Movie like this is so overlooked by the audience, at least in Germany. It can really be called a work of eclectic philosophy, as it combines many different ideas form different cultures about what the essence of life and death really is. What's apparently confusing many People is that there is no conclusion in the end, no solution with which you could go home satisfied and enlightened. So make sure you don't belong to the people who need a ""moral"" to be pleased with a movie before watching it, because that is not the point of the movie. It deals with many different aspects of ancient philosophy, like the old Indian circle of reincarnation, Mayan mysticism and Jewish-Christian ideas about sin and salvation. Actually, the Film leaves you with nothing but a feeling of a clue about the meaning of our existence, and this effect is an astonishing illustration of the thoughts that Plato had when he said that the meaning of life is not understandable with the mind but with the soul. Aronofsky surely read some philosophy before making this movie, and it doubles the fun if the viewer does also. Definitely on one level with 2001."

If only one thing that can be said about this film, then its attempting to ""stand the test of time."" This is not only an interesting story and superb acting cast and I mean Superb!! This movie also is a visual spectacle, yet they used very little CG in this movie. In certain climatic parts of the movie where you would swear there was computer graphics...there isn't. <br/><br/>This is one of those movies where as soon as you see it you'll want to see it again to make more sense of it or to get more meaning out of it. These movies are rare. The storyline is difficult to follow and requires the audiences vulnerability. If you try to connect the story lines (and there are three of them) you 'll miss everything else. Just sit back relax, watch, enjoy. This is nothing like Requiem for a Dream or Pi, it has a heavier feel to it, though it is not as depressing. <br/><br/>This movie has gotten a lot of negative responses from those, I believe, were expecting an epic Sci-Fi movie from one of the great directors. However The trailers were completely misleading and it is better almost to have never have watched them. This is a fantasy movie. <br/><br/>I read that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchet were supposed to play in this movie. On this note Hugh Jackman should have been the first and only choice. Brad Pitt is good for looking cool and thats about it. (sorry to all you B.P. fans)<br/><br/>Not everyone will like this movie, in fact, I find it hard to believe that this will get a wide viewing, as it is not a commercial film. It is an art film, a discussion piece, a beautiful poem about the fragility of life and the idea of forever."

","Many people, mostly critics, have accused The Fountain of being pretentious; of being an esoteric, manipulative mish-mash that clamors about its own importance in every scene.<br/><br/>While I can see and understand the angle where these people are coming from, I think The Fountain is one of those films where you just need to stop thinking. I don't mean stop thinking in a bad way - not like with a Michael Bay film; rather, one needs to immerse himself in the flow of the images, the atmosphere and the message Aronofsky's film is trying to convey. It may not have a really deep meaning or one that hasn't been dealt with in film yet, but Aronofsky, behind all the flashy visuals, delivers it with such an honesty and passion that I have not seen in years, in any film.<br/><br/>The mistake Aronofsky does make is that he thinks he needs to make this message more complex, more ambiguous in order to make viewers susceptible to it. And so he goes a bit overboard with the closing scenes. He doesn't know when enough is enough, and that detracts a bit from The Fountain's elegance and beauty.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this film is one of the most enjoyable pictures I've seen this year, one that really doesn't deserve the hate it gets."
"jluis1984","8","1","3","22 March 2007"," A very creative work by Aronofsky!
","After the release of his acclaimed feature length debut, the independent film ""Pi"", back in 1998, director Darren Aronofsky became one of the most promising names of the late 90s generation of young directors. Two years after ""Pi"", Aronofsky proved that he was more than a one hit wonder with his adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel ""Requiem for a Dream"", a story about the consequences of drug addictions that without a doubt has become one of the first classics of the first decade of the 21st century. With such an outstanding beginning of career, it was natural that expectations for Aronofsky's next work grew to enormously high altitudes, and not few doubted that his new project, ""The Fountain"", could live up to the hype surrounding it (specially after the trouble preproduction, which lasted almost 5 years). Fortunately, Aronofsky's film demonstrates once again that his first two films were note the result of luck, and that there is real talent behind his work.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" is the story of Tomas Creo (Hugh Jackman), as he faces the fact that his beloved wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz) has terminal cancer and is close to death. A research oncologist himself, Tomas is desperately trying to find a cure for his wife's tumor, motivated by the idea that if he discovers a way to reverse brain tumors, he'll be able to save his wife. However, Izzi seems to have a different philosophy than him, and having accepted death, decides to write a book named ""The Fountain"", about a Spanish conquistador looking for the legendary Tree of Life. As Tom keeps failing in his many attempts to find the cure, his mind begins to suffer the consequences, but as he seems unable to accept his wife's fate, Izzi's has prepared a way for him to overcome his grief.<br/><br/>Written by Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel, ""The Fountain"" is essentially a love story with touches of science fiction, all spiced up with Aronofsky's ideas about philosophy. It's truly a very ambitious story, but Aronofsky manages to develop it nicely and with intelligence, avoiding the clichés and the sappiness that tend to be in movies dealing with similar themes. The philosophic themes (focusing on sociology and specially on Thanatology) are handled carefully, and while they are kept in simple and easy to understand terms, Aronofsky explores them deeply, making ""The Fountin"" a remarkable study of love and the experience of grief. As usual, Aronofsky fleshes out his characters in a very realistic way, making them feel very real and human, allowing us to easily feel identified with them (somehting essential given the subject matter of the story).<br/><br/>In ""The Fountain"", Aronofsky shows a real improvement in his skills as a director, as well as a willingness to push the boundaries of his very own style of storytelling. While the story is entirely focused on the characters' emotions, he allows himself to experiment with different styles as the story takes the characters to the past and the future (where Aronofsky displays a heavy use of symbols and traces of surrealism), and interestingly, he also moves away from many of the devices that had began to be known as ""trademarks"" of his style. ""The Fountain"" is a very visual movie (probably more than his previous two), but despite this, Aronofsky still manages to keep the story as the main focus of the movie. On a side not, it's worth to point out that Clint Mansell's score for the movie is truly amazing, and easily one of the best of the decade.<br/><br/>In a movie that's basically about the undying love between two characters, the performances of the actors portraying them are of great importance. Fortunately, the cast did a very good job with it, specially Hugh Jackman, who truly surprised me (I had never been impressed by his work before) and made me realize how really talented he is. His portrayal of Tom as a man who can't bear the unavoidable loss of the love of his life is truly moving. While Rachel Weisz is a really awesome actress, I couldn't help but think that this was not one of her best works, as while her character was supposed to be truly at peace, she came to me as cold and distant, making Jackman to shine even more. The supporting cast was overall very good, despite not having a lot of screen time when compared to Jackman and Weisz. Ellen Burstyn makes a small appearance and does a great job with it.<br/><br/>""The Fountain"" is a very good movie, with many good elements on its favor as the cast, the score and the brilliant cinematography (by Matthew Libatique); however, it is not exactly the masterpiece the hype made it out to be. The film's main problem lays in the very ambitious (and let's face it, pretentious) way Aronofsky crafts his movie, as while he does indeed attempts to keep the film's message easy and simple, he seems to sacrifice the story for the sake of the symbolism of his visual art. This results in a plot that looks more contrived than what it really is, and that irremediably will feel somewhat patronizing to some viewers. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but it's one that one must see with an open mind and aware that it's neither the masterpiece that the most ardent fans of Aronofsky make it to be, nor the void and pretentious trash its detractors claim it is.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie is a really satisfying experience, as despite its troubles the movie manages to deliver a nice and intelligent story and Aronofsky's interesting views on love and death. While sadly I must say that it's not the redefinition of science fiction that Aronofsky intended it to be, I'm happy to admit that with ""The Fountain"", director Aronofsky has proved that he was more than a lucky beginner, and that great things await for him in the future. 8/10"
"Davidon80","8","1","3","18 March 2007"," Love will keep us together
","The Fountain starts of promisingly, there is the shift in time, a gorgeous set up and Hugh Jackman demonstrating Wu Chu moves in a scrumptious silhouette sequence. At this point cinema lovers feel they are in for something special, then the story begins far away in a bubble, to then shift to present day, to then shift to the story within the story. This is still tantalising for the viewer until we realise that the story is taking too long and that not enough is being done to keep our interest. <br/><br/>Is it a love story, is it a story of time, is it a story of science, is it a story within the story? Time shifts, narrative departures are utilised at will, but the overriding effect is one of uncertainty. There is the feeling that for all the narratives that are taking place the director has forgotten one key element, that being an overriding narrative to hold these stories together. Kudos to the composer for creating a truly eerie soundtrack to complement the visuals, but still this is not enough to drag this movie from wannabe indie epic, to satisfactory Hollywood pseudo intellectual coffee table banter fodder.<br/><br/>Perhaps with a little more time, a little more editing, a little more thought in the actual result then this could have been great, but what we are left with is eventually a confusing love story trapped in time. Maybe cinema students will study this piece, Citizen Kane style in years to come, I, on the other hand remain in the position of dismissing this piece as art which has good intentions but failed in reaching the epic heights that it could have. Perhaps this could be the story of Aronofsky's career."
"Orific","7","1","3","30 December 2006"," Agreeably surprising !
","I did not believe any more that such finely worked films could be produced in Hollywood. 2006 previous releases had almost discouraged me of going to the cinema for US productions.<br/><br/>This film can be seen as a touching reflection about Death, although one may as well (and equivalently) consider that the main subject is Life. Spreaded between three different (but deeply connected) fragments of time-space, it tells the story of a man fighting against the death of his queen, wife, and soulmate. Once again, it is also, as identically, a fight to bring to his beloved eternal life. The screenplay is built upon old Mayan legends about the origin of Life, and the afterlife world.<br/><br/>The story is not told linearly, owing to the multiplicity of the time periods involved, and their mutual entanglement. But I think that Aronofsky managed to link them in a coherent flow. Some people might also be frightened away by the apparent repetitivity of some passages, but each one has its place in the narration (except maybe one or two, but let's not quibble). The camera work is well done and many innovative shots are quite successful. The director really strove to convey ideas and concepts through the arrangement and symmetry of some images. As well as using a strong symbolic language. The special effects are wonderful and fit very well with the cosmogonic dimension of the film.<br/><br/>I was very impressed by Hugh Jackman's acting, which contributed to this film being such a surprise for me. Rachel Weisz is at least as convincing, in what must be one of her best performances. Their dialogues often get full of emotion without indulging in mawkishness.<br/><br/>I will just temper my otherwise very positive appreciation in regard to the unjustified mixing of some Buddhist references and symbols in a metaphysical background which is meant to be Mayan. Which somewhat spoils the remarkable homogeneity and sobriety of the rest of the film. As well as the too numerous representations attached to the tree in the last time period, making its symbolic meaning fuzzy. But, once again, let's not quibble: ""The Fountain"" is first of all a very enjoyable visual and spiritual experience."

","""Spanning over one thousand years, and three parallel stories, The Fountain is a story of love, death, spirituality, and the fragility of our existence in this world."" <br/><br/>I confess myself not a fan of Aronofsky, and this ambitious excursion into sci-fi metaphysics does nothing to banish my previous annoyance at his muddy avant-gardism (Pi) and his simpleminded tract on drugs that unaccountably was greeted as hip (Requiem for a Dream). After a longish pause, he has taken another direction, one of greater ambition but no greater clarity or good sense. He now has a beautiful girlfriend, mother of his child, Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz, whom he's made the center of a movie aboutwhat? You be the judge, but obviously it touches on modest topics like love, death, spirituality, and the fragility of our existence in this world, seeking to encompass them through a three-pronged story-line about: <br/><br/>1. A present-day medical researcher, Tommy Oreo (Hugh Jackman), working on monkeys with brain tumors in hopes of finding a cure for his wife Izzi's (Wiesz's) tumor; she has one too. This leads to some medically and scientifically questionable procedures (unlikely ones too) which a distinguished supervisor, Dr. Lillian Guzetti (Ellen Burstyn) strenuously disapproves of. <br/><br/>2. A Spanish explorer, Tomas (Jackman, looking for the fountain of life (or youth) in Latin America, urged on by Queen Isabel (Weisz), with trouble afoot from Grand Inquisitor Silecio (Stephen McHattie). Encounters with Mayan hierophants dressed up like in Apocalypto also occur. Thre's some hand-to-hand combat, but nobody's heart gets ripped out. <br/><br/>3. Meanwhile in the future sometime a sort of astronaut or guru is floating in outer space, sometimes in the yoga position. His name is Tommy (Jackman) and his guiding spirit is ..you guessed it, Izzi (Weisz). He seems to be the custodian of a magical tree. <br/><br/>Variations in chevelure distinguish the two stars in the separate time-frames. In sequence 1, Jackman has the unshaven look, with a down-flop hairdo. In No. 2, he's lushly bearded. In 3, he's as bald as an egg. Weisz's hair lengths vary appropriately. <br/><br/>Now, themes do emerge, and they're grand. ""Death is an act of creation,"" the Maya priest (who's into killing people) says. ""What if you could live forever?""""Death is a disease, like any other,"" medical researcher Tommy shouts. ""Death frees every soul,"" somebody says. Tomas samples the sap from a magical tree. Dropped on the ground it makes a stripling spring up instantly covered with leaves. Tomas applies it to a wound and the wound closes. He drinks a big glob of it and that is a big mistake. He's covered with striplings, springing out of his body. Back to the drawing board on that one. <br/><br/>The plight of researcher Tommy and his brave but doomed wife Izzi gets most of the screen time, and this is the segment that is easiest to parse into a narrative (though it's corny and punctuated with vapid dialogue), while not only is the development of the other segments spotty, their relationship to each other and the main plot remains incoherent, at most symbolic. <br/><br/>Jackman is a good sport; it's not his fault that his futuristic guru and his conquistador are mere fragments and his recurrent stints as the nervous researcher are stagy and less convincing than a TV hospital series. Weisz is a radiant beauty and a warm presence; she has a few moments when her emotions seem real. Her Spanish queen is just a static cameo. Ellen Burstyn adds class to a minor role. It's hard to speak of direction. <br/><br/>The uncertainty of this project is indicated by the fact that it is an attempt to redo a glossier one for which Warner Brothers put up $75 million (of which $20 million was spent), and which was to star Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Irreconcilable difference between Pitt and Aronofsky were cited. Brad and Cate apparently went off to do the equally over-ambitious but infinitely superior Babel This pickup version was made for less than half the original budget. It appears corners were cut on the lighting. It is dim. The movie itself is a murky mess. <br/><br/>This is one genius whose mind I don't want to be trapped inside of."

"celtic821","9","1","3","7 December 2006"," A Beautiful Train Wreck
","I am of two minds about Darren Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"". On one hand it was creatively conceived, well acted, and beautifully photographed. On the other it is a dark and convoluted existential mish-mash of huge ideas that are perhaps not as well explored as they could have been. It's a movie that, while spectacular, is not always what I would call entertaining. <br/><br/>I consider ""Requiem for a Dream"" to be one of the greatest films of our time, so I was absolutely salivating over Aronofsky's long awaited follow-up. Given my astronomical expectations, it's only natural that ""The Fountain"" would be at least a little bit disappointing. But I also have to respect the fact that Aronofsky aimed very high with this project. If anything, perhaps a little too high. To paraphrase a review I read: I'd rather see a director, or any artist for that matter, aspire to greatness and fail, than have success playing it safe. Not to say that ""The Fountain"" is a failure exactly, but its far from the great film that it wants to be.<br/><br/>This is not the easiest movie to sit and watch. It is confusing at times, and at times it is so quiet and deliberately paced that the only sound you'll hear is the crunching of popcorn and perhaps a few yawns. That said, I still believe that this is a movie that should be seen. Its originality and scope are exceptional, and, while it may not knock your socks off, it will make you think. There has never been a movie quite like this, and there probably never will be again. If for no other reason than this, ""The Fountain"" should be experienced."
"drexelspivey","9","1","3","6 December 2006"," With death breathes life
","""The Fountain"" A film review by Brian Murphy Evanston RoundTable<br/><br/>I am unaware as to whether or not Darren Aronofsky has obsessive-compulsive disorder, but the characters and themes in his films certainly reflect this trait. The brilliant writer/director has explored the disturbing obsession of a mathematical genius (""Pi""), the horrifying compulsions of drug addicts (""Requiem for a Dream"") and now the ceaseless quest of man who, during the course of a thousand years, seeks a cure for death so he can be with his loved one forever. <br/><br/>With ""The Fountain,"" Mr. Aronofsky has created a stunning visual and thematic tapestry. Three separate yet interconnecting stories and time-lines are expressed with such skill that they become one ongoing saga. Hugh Jackman (""The Illusionist"") and Oscar winner Rachel Weisz (""The Constant Gardener"") play two star-crossed lovers torn apart by death. Mr. Jackman is a volcano of erupting emotion, while Ms. Weisz is almost Zen-like in her dual, terminal roles. Both are exceptional in their performances. In Spain, 1500 A.D., Weisz is Isabel, a Queen desperately trying to survive the Spanish Inquisition. As a last resort, she sends her loyal Conquistador, Tomas (Jackman), to ""New Spain"" (Guatemala) on a quest to find the Mayan-protected Tree of Life, the same one referred to in Genesis that gives eternal life. She gives him a ring and makes him promise to return so that they can rule and live together forever. <br/><br/>In America, 2000 A.D., Jackman is Tom Creo, a doctor whose cancer treatment experiments are vastly improved when he uses a root found in Guatemala to cure lab monkey Donovan's brain tumor. His obsession to find a cure as quickly as possible spreads as wife Izzi's (Weisz) health begins to rapidly deteriorate from her own brain tumor. Forgoing his chance to spend time with his beloved during her last days, Tom chooses to try and conquer death, instead. <br/><br/>In outer space, 2500 A.D., Tommy (you guessed it-Jackman) floats and meditates in a nebula, finally reaching the snow globe-like orb that contains the tree of life, greeting welcome memories of Izzi/Isabel, and desperately fighting off bad memories, like his failed promise, or even more disheartening to Tommy- listening to Izzi try to explain things like death leads to creation, death will bring them together, or that she is no longer afraid of dying. To Tommy, by definition, the only way to be immortal is to live forever. <br/><br/>To separate the three tales, as I have just done, does the film a grave injustice. It is Aronofsky's artful direction that blends this tale into a fascinating work. His use of symbolism not only recalls archetypes (dagger and pen), but is also used as a bridge between stories and time-lines. Perhaps the painting in present day Tom's home, of a Mayan temple that just happens to be the same one he entered, as a Conquistador, comes off more as a wink than an epiphany, but fans of a certain auteur (and Aronofsky has earned the right to garner that title) often indulge the artist, such as Hitchcock making cameos in so many of his films. He forever bathes the mise en scene in gold-both objects and lighting-creating a warm and ethereal tone. Implausibly, the film may somehow manage to peak the interests of both a religious and an existentialist audience. The topic of death and the afterlife (or lack thereof) sets off an engaging quandary for our characters to either accept or conquer. Will it lead them to the same place?"
"jslip3","10","1","3","4 December 2006"," don't believe the critics this movie is awesome
","I had been eagerly awaiting this movie ever since I saw Darren Aronofsky's film, Requiem For A Dream. Suffice to say I was not disappointed. Before I saw The Fountain, I listened to what people were saying about the movie and a few friends of mine said it was excellent, but after reading and seeing how many of the critics said that the movie was awful, I felt very disheartened.In fact,a lot of my previous anticipation had worn off by the time I got to see it. As I sat in the theater, I wasn't drawn too much into the story at the very beginning (which is also how I felt while watching Requiem), but as the movie progressed I got more and more into it By the end of the film, I was completely in love with it. The visuals are simply amazing, even with the budget cuts that they had. The movie is simply beautiful to watch. The story is complex and inter-woven between three stories each staring Hugh Jackman, who is trying to save the woman he loves, Rachel Weisz. Many critics have said that the movie was confusing and made no sense. I couldn't agree less. While admittedly the story is complex, I didn't find it at all confusing, in fact the story at its core is very simple and the complexity only arises as the three stories begin to connect together. I also felt that both of the performances were very convincing, despite the fact that many other critics have tried to denounce their performances. The fighting sequences in the film were edited down both because of budget and to give the film a Pg-13 rating, but the film hardly lacks because of it, so as the strength of the film holds up because of the main character's relationship. <br/><br/>To understand this movie you have to see it from different angles, but it all adds up to the same point,of life and death, that is what this movie is about, dealing with death and the question of immortality. If you had a dearly loved one who was about to die, how would you react? how would you react in the face of your own death? The film lets you ponder these questions as you watch the on screen. <br/><br/>The first part of this story involves a conquistador searching for the fountain of youth, because he wants immortality for his queen. The second story deals with a doctor who is trying to find a cure to his wife's disease, but he spends so much time away from her to try to save her that he can't really appreciate the little time he has with her. He loses sight of what he has doing, so he must learn accept the eventual death of his wife. The third part is the most confusing, but it's really not that complex. Essentially Hugh is living in a bubble that is ascending into a star that is about to be reborn. When they reach the star they will be reborn as well, but for now Hugh depends on the tree for survival as a means of nourishment. The tree is an obvious representation of his wife Izzy, and the significance of this isn't revealed until the end.<br/><br/>The film interestingly pulls together different answers to death, different responses to it, and philosophies after life it combines scientific beliefs, Christian beliefs, Buddhist beliefs, and other philosophies. And it does it so beautifully. Both Rachel and Jack should have received more attention for picking up these roles that had been dropped by other big actors, because they were willing to play difficult roles (3 roles in fact..well two for Rachel) in a script that is completely different from anything else and a very risky move. The music in the film hooks you in and is an incredible strength in the film. it all fits perfectly. Even with a large cut in budget Darren still pulled through to make the film and the visuals are amazing. Watching this movie is like watching a piece of art. It's simply stunning! If you enjoy philosophy, and like involving movies than there is really no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this film. IT'S EXCELLENT."
"desol81","9","1","3","4 December 2006"," Amazing film
","Very much like the early works David Lynch(and Aronofsky's first film, ""Pi"") the director has created an artwork focusing more on the juxtaposition of light and shadow and incredibly baroque varieties of textures. I also found this reminiscent of the theatre works of Robert Wilson. These elements overwhelm the plot line of the story, which in reality I found to be mostly inconsequential in the overall quality of this piece, although the acting, especially that of Hugh Jackman, is well done and not over-the top. If the audient comes to the theater prepared with this mindset, the overall experience will be a more satisfying experience."

","I saw the movie yesterday with three other people and every one in my group had a different reaction toward the movie. It ranged from a ""what in the world"" reaction to ""oh..that was interesting!"" One of my friends said that the film possessed elements of writers Borjes and Calvino. Another friend said that the film should have been called ""The Mountain"" because it has so many layers that it felt like you had to climb a mountain to get to the top. I say that no one should go to see this film if they're not prepared to seriously have a philosophical dialog during and after the film. I know another friend of mine said that the philosophical dialog is simple and a mature person won't ask those questions, but at the same time I think the questions raised are being asked by everyone, no matter what their age. I'm speaking vaguely here because I don't want to include any spoilers.<br/><br/>The three intertwined narratives were well thought out and executed. It was very interesting for me from beginning to end. It really appealed to many of my senses, and I'm glad I got the chance to see it."
"FreedomCostABuckOFive","10","1","3","3 December 2006"," Great, but no 2001
","I have seen my fair share of weird movies. Now don't get me wrong, weird does not necessarily mean bad. 2001: A Space Odyssey is in my top ten favorite movie list, but it is weird. So are most movies done by Darren Aronofsky. Pi, for instance, talks about how mathematics is connected to religion. If that sound strange, then the Fountain is far beyond that. The plot sounds understandable, but when you see it, you realize you were totally off.<br/><br/>It takes place in three different time lines. The first has Rachel Weisz as Queen Isabel of Spain during the Spanish Inquisition. She appoints Tomas (played by Hugh Jackman), who is a conquistador, to find the tree of life. By drinking the sap, you will live forever. In the second time line, Tom Creo, played again by Hugh Jackman, is a doctor trying to find the cure for cancer. Ironically, Izzy Creo, also by Rachel Weisz, who is his wife, is dying from cancer. There isn't a long deadline for him to find the cure, so he pushes hard, while Izzy is getting weaker and weaker. In the last, and most obscure, storyline, Tom, bald and sporting weird tattoos, is flying around space in a big bubble with a tree, presumably the tree of life, inside. All three story lines intertwine throughout the movie.<br/><br/>There was one major problem with the story. With Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz being in all story lines, you would think that they would be connected somehow. But they weren't at all. They were basically six different people. That's one thing I didn't expect. Also, being a huge history buff, what was the deal with calling the movie The Fountain, when Tomas was looking for the tree of life, not the fountain of youth, which Conquistadors where actually trying to find in the 15th and 16th century? That really bugged me.<br/><br/>You got to give it to Hugh Jackman, though. He was what made me enjoy this movie. Besides the X-Men movies and Van Helsing, he is good in everything he does. He brings great energy to his parts (for more of Hugh Jackman, I recommend The Prestige), and this one is no different. Rachel Weisz was a little lacking in emotion, but Hugh Jackman made up for it. Another thing that wowed me where the visual effects. They were extraordinary, without feeling too cheesy. They aren't 2001, but they're still good.<br/><br/>So, besides the obscurity of the plot, the movie was aesthetically pleasing. It's not Darren Aronofsky's best, but it's better than most sci-fi movies. If you're not a big sci-fi or weird movie fan, than this movie is definitely not for you. If you are though, see 2001 instead. I would recommend The Fountain, though."
"moutonbear25","7","1","3","3 December 2006"," Leaky FOUNTAIN
","THE FOUNTAIN Written and Directed by Darren Aronofsky<br/><br/>THE FOUNTAIN reinvigorates the meaning of ""labour of love."" Writer/Director Darren Aronofsky's ambitious offering had many eyes on it from the moment of its conception, through its disastrous pre-production period and even more so now as it finally unrolls into theatres. When his last film, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, struck many a chord amongst many a different viewer (it is a compelling plea to not use drugs as many people watch the film high and never want to touch the stuff again), people knew they had a young genius in Aronofsky. Naturally, Hollywood wanted him all to itself. The problem is that Aronofsky is anything but Hollywood. When THE FOUNTAIN got the green light from a major Hollywood studio, conditional to Brad Pitt's attachment to the project, Aronofsky found himself in a new world. In this world, budgets blow up to $75 million, stars back out, funding disappears and you can spend $20 million without shooting a single frame. When THE FOUNTAIN was shut down, Aronofsky would not let go. This is the film his heart wanted to make and so he scaled the budget down to $35 million and found a new cast and new funding. Somehow though, while everyone scrambled to get THE FOUNTAIN made, no one seemed to notice what a hard sell it was going to be. Aronofsky attempts to show in an hour and a half that we as humans are not of our bodies but that the soul, life and love are eternal; that the death of our physical bodies is both a natural and necessary part of what we know as life; that we should neither fear it nor fight it but accept it as peacefully as possible. He attempts to tell this by stretching his story over a thousand years. Though the vastness of his ideas lose some focus around the edges and struggle to remain congealed, THE FOUNTAIN remains incredibly beautiful with piercing performances by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz that plant the seeds necessary for Aronofsky's ethereal ideas to grow in the souls of his audience. Despite all the love given, the roots could have still used a little more water.<br/><br/>Jackman and Weisz play Tom and Izzi Creo in the year 2000. Izzi has an inoperable tumor in her brain and not much time left on earth. Tom is a scientist, a rational man who believes that death is no more than another disease that can one day be cured. As Tom tries to play God, Izzi embraces that she will soon meet God. Jackman plays Tom as tortured and desperate and his performance is in direct conflict with Weisz's embodiment of Izzi as a creative beacon of repose and understanding. Yet they still manage to share a life together, one that is clearly based on a deep and engrossing love that binds them, thanks to a tender, caring chemistry between Jackman and Wiesz. The present day chemistry needs to be solid in order for the bookending to fall into place. 500 years later, Tom finds himself traveling through space towards a dying star in order have that life that is fading be reborn in the tree of life he is traveling with. 500 years earlier, Tom finds himself searching for the tree of life in order to give himself and his queen (an earlier incarnation of Izzi) eternal life. It is in these two extremes that Aronofsky exhibits his strengths and weaknesses. The future scenes are organic and spiritual making his quest seem plausible in an other-worldly fashion but the past sequences, told as a story and not confirmed as an actual past life, seem stagy and forced. <br/><br/>Aronofsky's ambition opens minds to new possibilities but it also takes on too much. A common thread was obviously necessary to tie three story elements that span a thousand years but he focuses on two threads instead, causing a struggle. Tom and Izzi's love anchors the center story but though Izzi is present in the past and future, their love is not the central issue. There is an expectation that it would be more prominent that is never fulfilled. Instead, what Tom cannot deal with in the central story becomes the focus in the later and prior. No matter when, Tom is always seeking the key to eternal life. Death brings about rebirth and Tom must spend a thousand years trying to figure that out. It is ultimately Tom's journey but Izzi is so compelling that she draws attention away from him. Despite this, the timelessness of his quest shows how fighting against death is an unnatural exertion that limits potential when one is fortunate enough to be alive that can also only reach its true potential by crossing through death.<br/><br/>There is no dispute that Aronofsky is a genuine artist and genius in his own right. THE FOUNTAIN shows his insight, his openness and his innovation. How else can one describe the usage of chemical reactions in a Petri dish shot with a microphotography camera as the backdrop for the future scenes? The technique is even intrinsically linked to the themes of the film. Obviously the scientific approach is an extension of Tom's profession but the approach was also chosen to give the film a timeless feel and avoid the dating that can sometimes happen with CGI. But for all its ingenuity, THE FOUNTAIN never feels like it has fully translated from Aronofsky's complex mind to the screen. That being said, there are worse places to be trapped than the mind of a genius."
"jes2871","5","1","3","2 December 2006"," OK film, but not for everyone
","The buzz about this film was that it would either be good or bad, but I walked out feeling ambivalent. There were some cool special effects and the acting was good, but Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz (sp?) can't create something out of nothing. The problem is the writing, not the acting or special effects. The story jumps around a lot, and at times I felt lost. The point of the film is that you can't live forever, which was illustrated very beautifully. I don't think this film has mainstream appeal, but it does have aesthetic and moral value. It's not ""Pi"" or ""Requiem for a Dream"". Personally, I wish I would have spent my eight dollars on ""Borat""."
"joman-3","10","1","3","30 November 2006"," My way of seeing things ... spoiler
","There is no past (though you might think of conquistador as the past of now) there is no future (though you might count the trip to nebula as future of now) and there is no now because the three time parallels are soul though they are connected to each other and even if you think The now tells about The past and The future you are wrong - it is now at all three parallels. The conquistador is saving the Spain but in reality he is saving Isabel. Tom is saving his love Izzi. The First Father as the Mayan called Tomas is saving his (Izzi) tree of life for Izzi is his life (you can clearly see that when he gets glimpses of other two parallels). In your eyes it would seem quite mixed-up but it is very easy to understand once you have seen the movie. But enough with the philosophical thoughts. The movie is worth to be seen ! The actors have done their job very good."
"guessmoviebycat","10","1","3","30 November 2006"," I think I figured it out lol
","Definitely read ""Tom in the present is tom in the future"" posts before reading my theory :) I think those Adam and Eve references meant something very critical to the ending. My theory is, yes the past sequences with Tom were nothing more than the story... and that ending where the foliage blooms out of him and he becomes one with the tree are his ending that he finally writes at the climax of the film. The present is nothing more than the future Tom's actual past. In the end they both do live forever, as Adam and Eve. Tom has been eating off the Tree of life and will live forever (Adam) and Eve is Izzy after shes had the tree grow over her (We see Tom drop the piece of the tree of life into her grave to make the tree grow). The dead star exploding and recreating all life finally happens at the end.... I don't know if God was waiting on Tom to finally make sense of his past and finish the story before it happened or if Tom was in control of when it would happen the whole time. I believe after that sonic boom and the tree re-blooming that ALL life returned. Tom was in fact the last man feeding off the tree for eternity so that he and Izzy (now part of the tree) could live forever. The finishing of the story was how things turn out in the very end (future toms ascension). He chooses to drink from the tree of life and blam becomes part of it, the never ending cycle of life. The same goes for the star exploding at the end. So much symbolism.... In the past sequences when Queen Isabella referred to Spain and what the conquistador would do to protect it... she meant many things ""Spain, Her, The Tree of Life, and maybe even God"". I agree with a prior post that said... even in the future (Tom in the bubble) he still hadn't finished the damn story she had asked him to ... Finally at the end hes able to make his ending after reconciling the past... or it was just the stars time to be reborn. He finally got his ring back because of their selfish quest to live together forever was finally over... it took the death of IZZY (THE TREE AND THE STAR) to finally set those things in motion. Any comments on this?! lol Thats what I gathered from the movie tho :)"

","THE FOUNTAIN (2006) *** Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz, Ellen Burstyn, Mark Margolis, Stephen McHattie, Fernando Hernandez, Cliff Curtis, Sean Patrick Thomas, Donna Murphy, Ethan Suplee. Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's labor of love finally comes to fruition in this trippy Kubrickian fable of timeless love between eternal lovers Jackman and Weisz (each portraying three versions of one character) linked in the theme of discovering a cure for death and the pursuit of the mythical Fountain of Youth/Tree of Life. Told with unrequited brio and consummate technical skill - kudos to long-time collaborative cinematographer Matthew Libatique's wonderful photography, Jay Rabinowitz's sharp editing , exquisite production design by James Chinlund and the ethereally haunting score by Clint Mansell - the loginess does mire in bits but it is the everlasting triumph of the human spirit that underscores the theme of desire, faith and again, love that really shines in this blend of romance, sci-fi, fantasy and drama."
"xander34","5","1","3","26 November 2006"," hmm
","It's been six years since acclaimed writer-director Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream) released his last film. Those six years have been a whirlwind of youthful ambition and overwhelming disappointment. The Fountain's early incarnation in 2002 was a big budget epic starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, then after Pitt dropped out for ""creative differences"", Aronofsky had to start over, creating what he calls the no budget version of his early script. Pitt was replaced with Hugh Jackman, and Blanchett was replaced with his fiancé Rachel Weisz. The end result is an intimate love story, that just so happens to span three different time periods.<br/><br/>Fans of Aronofsky's previous work will be surprised by his latest film. Gone are the hip hop montages, Snorricam shots (a camera attached to the actor), and nauseating visual tricks. However, Aronofsky keeps his trademark center framing, fades to whites, and ambiguous endings. This is Aronofsky's most original, artistic, and ambitious work to date, and every single shot appears to be profusely thought out. It can even be said this is a thirty-five million dollar art film.<br/><br/>All audiences can appreciate The Fountain's remarkably original photography and astonishing visual effects, guided by Aronofsky's long time cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, as well as the gorgeous score by Clint Mansell, also a previous Aronofsky collaborator. However, will audiences be able to appreciate the film itself? Viewer's reactions from the film have ranged from ""beautiful,"" ""gripping,"" and ""transcendent"" to ""muddled,"" ""unfocused,"" and even ""pretentious."" This polarizing effect might have something to do with the odd, interweaving structure of the three time periods the film covers: past, present, and the future in space. In addition, Hugh Jackman plays the same character throughout each time period, which can further confuse audiences.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky stated in an interview on Joblo.com that before a prescreening of his film, he told the audience: ""Don't think too much."" Also, Jackman and Weisz have claimed numerous times that although the film might seem confusing, it's really just a love story at heart. If a viewer takes this advice before watching The Fountain, the film will make perfect sense, and the viewer can appreciate how much Aronofsky did with such a simple idea.<br/><br/>Essentially, The Fountain is about a man, Tom (undoubtedly a reference to David Bowie's Major Tom songs) trying to save his wife, Izzy, who is dying from brain cancer. Tom can't come to terms with her death, yet Izzy openly awaits it. Hugh Jackman is at his undisputed finest as Tom, showing a complete range of emotions, while the beautiful Rachel Weisz gives another solid performance as Izzy, even though it is Jackman, who undoubtedly carries the film. Other critics have proclaimed that Tom and Izzy have little to no character development, but the story Aronofsky is trying to tell is so simple and organic that the characters themselves are just symbols for Man and Woman.<br/><br/>The Fountain is a staggeringly ambitious film that does contain some ridiculous moments and a slow start, but nevertheless, the story of a man's quest for immortality is something we can all relate to."

","The movie starts with the phrase ""Finish it"" and you hear it plenty. It is so filled with flashbacks that it's actually hard to enjoy; tells approximately three stories which might or might not connect but are wrongfully edited or intertwined. Also there are about 5 scenes that appear many times in a 2 hour period that I just almost went berserk. I was tired when the movie started and it's almost impossible for me to sleep watching any film because I like it so much, yet the very ssssllllllloooooooowwwwww pace and lack of aaaaannnnnyyyyy action made me yawn and still does when I think of it and I nodded off several times. I was bored for more than half the duration. Of course there's a message but the way of telling it is not working, at least for me. The editing gets a dying 2 out of 10. Maybe they didn't have enough material to edit a full length product. The script gets a fantastic 4 out of 10 due to it's over complicated back and forth struggle, there are some clever lines and very few good twists. The directing is maybe OK if you can make it without the other two. But superb? No no no no. It's not even average. Waste of time. I would wait for the ""super edited"" version of 1 hour to watch it, if I hadn't seen it yet. Some guys have died of boredom watching ""The extended version"" forced by their wives. Beware of the oncoming DVD because: It's coming! Almost impossible to avoid! At 7.8 rate out of 10 (at the time of this writing) which to me it's just too much. The comments are generally close to 1 or 10 (That's excessive love or hate). Just before watching it I ran into acquaintances and two told me it was very good so my impression is that it will make quite a buck on the expense of half the audience. Will someone get an epiphany after watching this piece? Sure. Weak minds will enjoy it a lot. People who don't have a defined religion and know as much as the little pieces that are almost common knowledge of the 5 more extended religions on earth.

D-U-M-B! I have no idea what the writer was trying to tell or why the need for so much mysticism in everything that took place.

Was it ""beautifully filmed?"" Maybe...but, I was so distracted by the idiocy of the whole thing that I failed to notice the cinematography. But, being ""beautifully filmed"" has nothing to do with how ""good"" the movie is, it only means it's not ""painful"" to watch in a visual sense, even though the experience as a whole was painful; laughable is probably a better word!

I don't feel like I wasted my time watching it, but I probably won't be watching it again."
"ashhollowell","9","1","4","15 February 2015"," The word ""pretentious"" is thrown around too much these days.
","The Fountain is a film that really shows just how wonderful storytelling is. As this review is intended to encourage people to watch it (as well as to persuade viewers of its merits), I'll keep it brief and free from spoilers. <br/><br/>There are many reviews that claim this film is pretentious nonsense and that it's too artsy. However, let's just take this film for what it is: it's a film that's merely about the struggles of dealing with death, whether it be your own mortality or others. But, to sum its themes up briefly: It's a sci-fi film that bursts with romanticist philosophy. Unlike other films of its type, which you could be forgiven for calling ""pretentious"", there's barely any cryptic and seemingly unnecessary complication, and there wasn't one point in the film where I felt like something was going over my head. Yet it is still an intellectual masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Fountain raises thoughts that excite me in the way that it contains within itself a ""fictional"" story (also called ""The Fountain""), written by Izzi, that is blended with the ""real life"" of present-day Tom and Issi, and indeed the future space-traveller. This makes the film as much a commentary on the arts and literature, suggesting that stories are as much a part of the universe as the physical existence of matter, influencing the lives of the people within it, much in the way that emotions do. <br/><br/>Speaking of emotions, this is an emotional story and therefore the acting needed to be spot-on. Being the first film I've seen Hugh Jackman in NOT as Wolverine, I was massively impressed by his convincing portrayal of our time-confused protagonist. Well done to Jackman for that!<br/><br/>The emotional nature of the film also called for a strong, but eerie, soundtrack. This has also been perfectly accomplished, with the main recurring string motif evoking strong feelings that perfectly coincided with the context on-screen. As for visuals, the colours and filters are beautiful, and all the settings for the story decorated in cold, metallic darkness. This really emphasises the claustrophobic and isolated nature of the film, making us feel like the universe centres around their love for each other, and ultimately invoking empathy in order to really make the emotional impact strong. <br/><br/>Relevant, clever, and underrated."

I won't try to sum up the plot, as others have already done so, so instead I will use a list of adjectives to describe it - Beautiful, Mesmeric, Psychedelic, Awe inspiring, Haunting, Emotional, Compelling, Mysterious, Stunning. It is like no film I have seen before. Watch it and you will feel like you have been sucked into a fantastical world of Aronofsky's creation, which will make you think very deeply about life, love, spirituality and the universe. It is like going down the rabbit hole and you will not want it to end! The cinematography is amazing. One for people who like to think and dream and feel.

At first movie was little boring, didn't really have a clue what it's all about, my friend just advised me to watch this and i didn't want to spoil it by crawling through reviews etc.<br/><br/>Main story; love story. Beginning, the middle and the End.<br/><br/>So here we go with Sumerian believes and all, very interesting thoughts, how we did born why did we born and all that stuff, very very religious movie even I'm not too religious I like this kind of movies.<br/><br/>It appears to be trans-dimensional work of art, you really have to watch this like it was plugged in your brain to make it work. Only watched once and didn't got bored, more like interested a lot.<br/><br/>Philosophy in this film, the screenplay, great cast again funny, Darren always succeeds in that .. He must have some God-issue if comparing to PI etc. Simillarities but very different .. Evolution, great fx (not too much cgi but just so nicely fitting) Well if you are open minded, watch lot of movies, like other works of Darren and so, and don't except any action packed crap this is for you.<br/><br/>Not much to say, one hell of a work. From beginning to end.<br/><br/>Few things why I didn't give it 10/10: little too much (and not needed) ideas copied from other movies involving time traveling and so.. Little boring at times when the time jumps way there way here and almost get confused. But thats just the great stuff :) Keeping up with the storyline and focusing on atmosphere, actors, everything, the main idea.<br/><br/>Darren, please continue this kind of movies. You are truly markable and original. Got good night sleep when watched.<br/><br/>...and I agree with warren-10 abt 20 minutes more, the ending was pretty fast comparing to length, it wasn't long but felt long. Then the ending just came there suddenly.<br/><br/>Thank you Darren :) Respect! 9/10"

She said several times while we were watching she had expected differently of this movie and apologized for taking me to it, and she observed the few other audience members didn't seem to like it either.<br/><br/>The first few minutes with the conquistadors was good, but the rest of the movie was so disjointed, long, and confusing we were glad it was over.

"gentendo","5","1","4","9 November 2008"," I've seen Better Aronofsky Films
","I feel rather ambivalent towards The Fountain. The structure is somewhat cold and melancholy, yet there are also subtle moments of inspiration and hope. The story seems to mourn over the loss of spirituality in today's culture and tries to resurrect hope in the existence of man as an eternal race. However, I didn't feel compelled to lead a more spiritual life after watching it. This is not to suggest that the film lacked spiritual undertones; indeed, the film had many. I only felt that it could have been portrayed more powerfully if it didn't really so much upon the surreal and abstract. Granted, I understand that expressionistic films often rely heavily upon both. It just for some reason didn't leave me feeling satisfied. In short, it's not my favorite Aronofsky piece but I appreciated his efforts to search for spirituality in a seemingly lost and hopeless world. <br/><br/>I think the film tries to emphasize that death is not something that people should fear. Hope ought to override death; hope for a better tomorrow and better existence in general. Death is what eats away at this hope in most people's lives. The film at first depicts death as inevitable, and since no one escapes its jaws, life should be held as something extremely preciousas if to imply that there may not be an afterlife. To live with the belief that life does not perpetuate beyond the grave is a terrible reality for most people to embrace, including Jackman's character. He, like most of us, fears death because of the attachments he has made on earth. In particular, he develops a special bond with his significant other. The mere thought of losing her to the unknown brings only pain because his soul longs to be with her forever. <br/><br/>In this sense, the film does a good job at promoting the human hope to live for the people we love and for a better world, rather than selfishly squander it to ourselves. Jackman's character helps display the struggle that most of us have between wanting to save our loved ones from death, versus spending time with those who inevitably will die.<br/><br/>Jackman plays an obsessive doctor/conquistador who sees death as a curable disease. He stops at nothing to find this cure so he can save the life of his dying wife. Though his cause is stalwart and even noble, he becomes too preoccupied with his work and loses the meaning of his lifehis wife. By sacrificing his life to search for eternal life, he neglects his wife to a degree and fails to save her before she dies. Consequently, his soul becomes harrowed up as he replays a regretful memory in his mind of ignoring her when she asks him to go on a walk. For Jackman, a hope for reconciliation with his wife in some posthumous world seems bleak. <br/><br/>The overarching story juxtaposes three distinct time periods in which Jackman is on a mission to find the cure for death. The only time period sketch that suggested the transcendence of earth and into the sublime was the one where Jackman is floating within the tree of life bubble. As he tries to save the tree from dying completely, he continues to float heavenward until he reaches the ultimate enlightenment. Though I think I understood what Aronofsky was trying to do, I wish he would have executed the film without heavily relying upon the abstract. Then again, who am I to criticize a personalized vision of eternity that was born out of one of the more talented filmmakers in our society?"
"getani","5","1","4","13 May 2008"," Too abstract
","Art is abstraction and abstraction is an art. Now 'The Fountain' is so abstract that it's difficult to fathom what the director is intending to say. When there is too much abstraction, confusion in the guise of interpretation comes.<br/><br/>But the lest we forget that simplicity is also an art.<br/><br/>This film confuses you and ""it's the way you interpret it"" is simple excuse to escape for simplifying what you wanted to say. Since nobody understands it, everybody thinks its genius piece of work. This a general trend with Hollywood's so called 'class cinema' scripts.<br/><br/>The only commendable thing about this film is Hugh Jackman. He is a revelation, his finest performance till date.<br/><br/>Bottom line is don't waste your time on this !"
"Galileo_Smith","Null","1","4","11 March 2008"," What The Heck!?
","Friends, <br/><br/>About thirty years ago Saturday Night Live had a semi-reoccurring skit where Dan Aykroyd would host bad theater scenes under a character name Leonard Pith Garnell. They were intentionally rambling, oddball scenes that made no sense. After each scene Aykroyd would remove his glasses, stare into the camera, and in a phony British accent profoundly declare, ""Really bad theater. Truly awful."" As I watched The Fountain, I was reminded of those Saturday Night Live bits. Only there was no Leonard Pith Garnell, the movie lasted longer than a two minute skit, and I actually paid money to see the film.<br/><br/>I had no idea what was going on in the movie. Hugh Jackman would appear as some kind of Midevil knight, then a moment later, show up as bald as a cheap cueball, then a few minutes later, morph into a contemporary character with a modern-day hairstyle. No clue. Not the foggiest. Fortunately a near total lack of character development was made painless by an indecipherable plot. <br/><br/>It is kind of a novel experience seeing Hugh Jackman eat tree bark, but it's not worth the DVD rental price."
"fernloth-2","9","1","4","21 December 2007"," Beautiful and creative
","After reading several lukewarm to negative reviews of this movie, it was several months before I finally saw The Fountain. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a beautiful, ambitious and legitimately moving piece of work. It takes quite an interesting direction approaching the subject of grief and does so with an amazing lack of pretentiousness. Hugh Jackman does a magnificent job of carrying the tone of this almost impressionistic take on the complexity of dealing with extreme emotions. It really is a gorgeous film which will leave you reflecting long after the credits roll. It is much more human and far less cynical than Aronofsky's other works and I would have to say it currently rates as his best. As many reviews pointed out, the movie has more than its share of flaws, but as with most worthwhile creations, the flaws often become part of the beauty. As with its protagonist, the movie seems to unconsciously sense the ugliness of perfection and in the end, it realizes strength in its shortcomings.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. In a film industry era consumed with assembly line production, it's a rare treat to see such a creative and ambitious piece of film-making outside of the art house world.<br/><br/>9/10."
"mr_walsh","5","1","4","6 July 2007"," Unsatisfying
","I have to give the makers of this film credit for creativity and visuals. But the movie comes across to me as lacking in the human element. Maybe that's why it's so lauded by internet-ish folks on IMDb.<br/><br/>Many have commended the acting, and I suppose it was well acted, but if I don't care about the characters, how can I care about the acting? For example, the quality of the dialog simply didn't reflect the intended intensity of relationship between husband and wife. The emotions are instead expressed with elements including several too many outbursts of anguish by Jackman/Tom. I mean, while it is clear that Tom is upset about Izzi's condition, you don't sense that he actually knows her as a person.<br/><br/>As to story...I still really couldn't for the life of me explain the point. I won't give away the ending, but how can one reconcile the buildup and the conclusion? What are we supposed to take away from it other by being dazzled by cosmic spectacle and some vague connections? In the commentary, Aronofsky stated that he writes by taking a pile of interesting ideas and trying to find a way to meld them together. And that's what you get in this movie. Lots of good ideas, but not one cohesive, complete, satisfying story."
"craig.duncan","5","1","4","21 May 2007"," Instead of a film about a tragedy, a tragedy about a film
","I'm a big fan of Darren Aronofsky (and of ""deep"" films, and science fiction). After watching ""Pi"" in one of the several smaller theatres in which it was released, I made mental note of him as a writer/director to watch, and spread predictions of future great things to come. In ""Requiem for a Dream"", I saw confirmation of my prediction (as, apparently, did tens of thousands of IMDb voters, who put it at #61 on the top 250 list). So, when I read the advanced publicity for ""The Fountain"", my thought was that it might be a truly great film, possibly a candidate for ""best film ever"" - Aronofsky, with a big budget, a long filming and production schedule, making a science fiction film.<br/><br/>Not for lack of desire, I missed seeing ""The Fountain"" in a theatre, watching it just last night on DVD (which, thanks to recent upgrades in my home gadgetry inventory  a 42"" LCD TV  and decent sound equipment, is now almost on a par with the small theatre where I saw ""Pi""). My expectation being what it was, I was rapt and attentive for through the whole 96 minutes, and, having a summary idea of what it was about, was able to follow it well, but after 15 minutes, was dreadfully aware that the film was only working for me because I was prepared for it, and was actively filling in its many discontinuities and exposition failures. By the end, rather than feeling on the edge of a consuming mystery (as I did after ""Pi""), or overwhelmed by tragedy (as I did in ""Requiem""), I felt I'd witnessed a hint of a film that could have been, a jigsaw puzzle complete enough to reveal a picture, but with such gaps that one couldn't for even a moment not be aware of its incompleteness - instead of a film about a tragedy, a tragedy about a film.<br/><br/>I saw it with my wife, who was indifferent to ""Pi"" but utterly enthused by ""Requiem"". Her opinion was a simple ""that was awful"". When we discussed it afterwards, and I referred to ""the bubble spaceship"", she responded ""that was a spaceship? I thought it was a dream sequence."" When she asked me if Thomas/Dr. Tommy/Space Oddity Tom was the same person, somehow rendered immortal and surviving his floral outbreak in sixteenth century, I realized that, while I was pretty sure the answer was ""no. Thomas and Dr. Tommy had separate births. Aided by his pharma-botanical research data, Dr. Tommy travels to present day Mexico, locates the Tree of Life atop the lost Mayan ziggurat, and, in the far future, travel to Xibalba/the Orion Nebula with it in an advanced bubble spaceship."" Having read that the working title of ""The Fountain"" was ""The Last Man"", I vaguely speculated that Astronaut Tom was the last living human, perhaps living in a trans-human society in which all other humans have been uploaded into computers.<br/><br/>IMHO Aronofsky's style, and strength, lies in his ability to evoke a powerful emotional response with a sparse sketch of details  incompleteness and gaps are what make his films work. In ""The Fountain"", however, the gaps are so vast that most audience members either can't fill them, or must work so hard to do so that they're distracted from the film's goal of an emotional exploration of life/death/sacrifice/rebirth. For many audience members who can bridge the gaps, this goal is old territory, and a let-down. Though apparently several thousand IMDb voters are among them, the fraction of the $10,000,000-worth of viewers who could both follow the movie and not be underwhelmed by it is, I think, small.<br/><br/>On a side note, the bubble-ship scenes were reminiscent of 1972's ""Silent Running"", starring Bruce Dern. I wonder if Aronofsky and the co-creators of ""The Fountain"" have seen it?"

Instead it stands now as a 90 minute collage of unfinished ideas that can't quite be called deep. The quirks in the structure don't really effect the picture in any way.

Lack of screenplay was always aronofsky's weak side. p and requiem had the same problems of plot silliness and primitive manipulation, but directors's scills and talent and actor's abilities is always on the patrol and saves the day. just as it saves the fountain. visually the movie is close to perfect, performances are great most of the time and the only problem is that aronofsky maybe should meet someone to tell him what exactly to make. Aronofsky knows how, but he need ""what to do"" advices for shure. a co-director maybe. anyway the fountain worth a review.not many movies made it since the unforgiven.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","4","2 January 2007"," Three cons in the fountain
","(Watched in Toronto) <br/><br/>My summary line, like the movie itself, is a little contrived. There are three stories is ""The fountain"" and not all of them are so contrived as to be called ""con"". The main story about scientist Tom's (Hugh Jackman) desperate research against a ticking clock to find a cure for wife Izzi's (Rachel Weisz) brain tumour is just fine. A little far-fetched is a tale during the Spanish Inquisition 500 years ago, of loyal Thomas (Jackman) going into Maya territory in search of a elixir, at the bidding of Queen Isabel (Weize). But what tops it all - a look 500 years in the future, of a bald guy (Jackman) alternating between tapping on a keyboard, kissing a magical tree and doing what looks like Tai-chi (but really isn't), all this in the middle of a whirl nebula - verges on ridiculous.<br/><br/>Amalgamating three stories based on some pseudo metaphysical link falls flat on its face and hurts rather than helps the central story. I'll never understand where movie makers get the idea that they can make audience into philosophers with 2 hours of pseudo profound messages. If they want to do fantasy, they better have the elegance of Tolkien. If they want to do sci-fi, they better have the authenticity and logic of Asimov. A smorgasbord that is neither here nor there does not a good movie make.<br/><br/>""The fountain"" has some good star power which unfortunately is somewhat wasted. Jackman, who may not be Oscar material yet but certainly has a good screen presence, does little more than convulse with deep anguish. Most recent Oscar best supporting actress Weize has still less, being charged with the responsibility of looking ethereally beautiful and vulnerable. Even sadder to see is veteran Ellen Burstyn walking around like a body without a soul."
"PoisonKeyblade","10","1","4","5 December 2006"," The Fountain delivers
","Director Darren Aronofsky has done it once again. After the amazing masterpiece that was Requiem for a Dream, Aronofsky has made another treasure that is sure to quickly develop a huge fan base. The Fountain features Hugh Jackman (a busy man with X-Men 3, The Prestige, Happy Feet, Flushed Away, and Scoop all being released this year) and Rachel Weisz (who appears this year in the upcoming epic Eragon and is famous for her role in The Mummy films) and is directed, written, and produced by Darren Aronofsky.<br/><br/>The Fountain mainly focuses upon a love story between Izzie (Weisz) and Thomas (Jackman) throughout three different time periods. In the first period, 16th Century Spain, Thomas is a conquistador sent by a Queen to find the Tree of Life (Fountain of Youth) in a Mayan temple. In present day, Thomas is a scientist working to find the cure for a brain tumor that is slowly killing his wife Izzie. The third and final section details Thomas in the 26th Century, traveling in a bubble with the Tree of Life through the stars on a voyage to the fabled Sebulba, his journey's end. The first hour or so of the film is thoroughly confusing, and nothing even becomes comprehensible until the last half an hour or so of the movie. Due to the film's bizarre nature, a second viewing is almost demanded by the viewer.<br/><br/>The Fountain is full of spectacular images and stunning photography, lush worlds and faultless special effects. The three stories link together perfectly in the end, and even fun little phrases or links are thrown around here and there: In present day, Izzie tells Thomas, ""You are my conquistador, always conquering."" Hugh Jackman shines in with some of his best acting, and Rachel Weisz gets the job done, although her part was nowhere near as large as Jackman's. The plot is compelling, but the storytelling sometimes sucks away from the film  rather than being three separate stories, these periods are intertwined in a jumble of flashy scenes. The 16th century story is actually just a book Izzie is writing, and she wants Thomas to help her write the ending. The 26th century story features Thomas having flashbacks to the present-day occurrences. Somehow, everything connects in the end in a most jigsaw-like manner, and it all makes sense. The Fountain is sure to become a sci-fi classic in the years to come, as well as a gripping tale of romance and fantasy."

Stunning visuals aren't enough to carry a movie, and there were moments where I couldn't quite suppress a snicker (levitating as a shaven-headed Buddha, for one). However, what made the film was Hugh Jackman's performance. He was bloody amazing. I had no idea. You should see it if only for his performance. <br/><br/>All in all, if you are willing to suspend your disbelief, and if you have at least a medium-level tolerance for pretentious film-making, you will be rewarded with a genre-defying film, whose merit lies not in any particular cleverness but in its ability to make you feel something. At worst, it will make you laugh. At best, it will make you feel a certain spiritual awareness. <br/><br/>It bears mentioning that if you're single and lonely, this film is a kick in the pants. ** ALSO, this is not a date movie - perhaps the worst possible date movie of all time.

(PG-13)<br/><br/>The tale of a scientist (Jackman) working on a medical discovery to save his cancer-stricken wife (Weisz), interwoven with stories set in the distant past (conquistador searching for the tree of life) and future (last living man traveling through space with a different tree, aged and dying). Spanning roughly 1,000 years (though the latter two tales are fictional within the film's universe), this ambitious sci-fi/fantasy film certainly has some striking imagery and heady ideas about resisting and accepting death, but it falls short on emotional resonance--the lead characters have little depth and are drawn as totemic by the expansive canvas--and nearly every leap into the ethereal is a soggy muddle. Jumbles various religious and philosophical traditions (New Age, Buddhism, Mayan mythology, Christian beliefs, etc.) without exploring any of them beneath the surface; might have benefited from a more comprehensive survey, but even at only about an hour-and-a-half in length, it starts to drag by the home stretch.

"Wuchakk","4","1","5","29 October 2015"," Aesthetically pleasing and spiritually rich, but not compelling
","Released in 2007, ""The Fountain"" features three stories in its plot: The main story is that of a modern-day medical researcher, Tom (Hugh Jackman), trying to find a cure for cancer, which would save his dying wife, Izzy (Rachel Weisz). The other two stories involve a conquistador (also Jackman) in Mayan country trying to find a legendary ""tree of life,"" and a bald space-traveler (Jackman again) in a bubble partaking from the ""tree of life"" therein. Ellen Burstyn is on hand as Tom's superior in the medical facility.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with director Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000) then you know he's more interested in creating cinematic art than popcorn fodder for the masses. ""The Fountain"" belongs in the former category and this makes it a hard film to critique. On the one hand, it's an aesthetically pleasing picture and very well made, but, on the other, it's simply not a compelling experience and therefore I'm not interested in viewing it again. The only way I was able to get through it was because I viewed it with my wife and we kept ourselves entertained.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that I very much appreciate artistic films and enjoy trying to figure them out, etc. but the most important element of any movie is a compelling story and the corresponding interesting characters to hook the viewer for two hours or so. Without these it'll be a boring experience regardless of the beautiful and innovative images, music, sets, editing, F/X, etc. This is why I'll give a low-budget movie with weak sets and F/X a positive review if the story is effective and contains rich subtext. I'm sure a lot of thought was put into the script of ""The Fountain"" and the subtext thereof – in fact, my INTERPRETATION below shows this – but at the end of the day the movie's a dull experience despite its awesome aesthetics. Moreover, the deeper elements – while well-intentioned – are more laughable than profound.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola is an artistic filmmaker like Aronofsky (and no doubt his mentor) and Coppola's ""Youth Without Youth"" is cut from the same cloth as ""The Fountain,"" not to mention released the same year. While it has the same problems as ""The Fountain"" it works better because the story's more interesting and Coppola was sure to throw in some hooks for the viewer despite the film's thematic and aesthetic depth.<br/><br/>The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Montreal, Canada, with an establishing shot of Philadelphia.<br/><br/>GRADE: C- <br/><br/>INTERPRETATION ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie): <br/><br/>The conquistador story is fictional because it's Izzy's novel whereas the modern-day story is reality. As such, Izzy imagines the noble swordsman to be her husband (but with a different name) and herself as Queen Isabel. The spaceman story is Tom's final chapter of Izzy's book."

Honestly, there is not much more to say about how bad it is. The acting is terrible. The script is terrible. There is no attempt made to tie all the stories together. The themes are terrible. In addition, there is a lot of offensive nature to this film. The way they deal with Mayan culture is a bit ridiculous. The excessive use of the Buddha pose is completely ridiculous. The integration of Christian theology is equally ridiculous. Offensive and bad."
"dandebs","3","1","5","14 May 2012"," Death is not awe
","Watched ""the Fountain"" the other day (yes, I know it's an old film). A film with some interesting premises, interesting cinematography, and unusual style, let down abominably by its underlying philosophy: ""Death is awe"".<br/><br/>Talk about calling evil good! (Rom 1 & Isa 5:20) Death is not awe. You will not be part of a tree. You will not fly with the sparrow when it eats the tree's fruit. Death is a horrible, brutal curse. The doctor was right to ""rage, rage against the dying of the night""!<br/><br/>With people desperately afraid of the curse of death, I can understand why the Fountain was so warmly embraced. But it offers a mirage, an illusion. Pretending that death is awe instead of acknowledging that death is awful is just that - a pretence. And one that will not suffice when faced with the awful reality of death.<br/><br/>There is only one who has faced down death and defeated it. Only God Himself, our Lord Jesus, the Christ, could defeat death - and he did so, in our place. In Him, the fear of death is no more - death has no sting. There is only one refuge from death, and it is not in the whimsical folly of an otherwise interesting movie."

OK, let me admit that there is some good cinematography and the acting is good but the film is incomprehensible at times and absurd most of the time.

","The only thing good about this movie is Hugh Jackman. There was no hook in the story from the very beginning, which makes one say the writing was awful. It was awful throughout; too intellectual, not enough emotion, no emotional core to the film, but apparently that's Aronovsky. Maybe he'll do better with Robocop, which might be more for him, after all. Sad to say after Requiem.<br/><br/>Apparently not a good idea to make a large Sci-fi film for 35 million with stars. This film should have never been made. Bad effects, bad cinematography (a surprise actually), and terrible production design because everything looks phony including the colors in the frame. I understood the hubris part on the part of the main character at the resolution after trying to conquer death the entire film, but after being bored on the verge of pain for the entire film it is an intellectual insight that can hardly make the film worth it. It's like a long, boring, painful trek up a mountain that when you get to the top you discover that, in fact, look, the sun does set in the west. Amazingly bad pretentious painful movie, oh sorry, film."
"jackferwerda-1","6","1","5","4 February 2008"," Almost really liked it
","The story of a dying wife is often very emotional in nature. This is obvious. It also is the type of movie that I am already not partial to. However, the other elements of the film that I saw as flaws or felt were uncomplimentary to the film, took this from a possibly great film to an above average film. (note that I would consider going up to a 7 out of 10 maybe with another viewing.) One problem is that the non-linear story telling works for some films but didn't seem to pay off for this one. They accidentally created in the viewer too strong of a desire for their to be a tying together of these stories. Not to say that you couldn't figure out what the tie in was, but films create their own world of rules and it seemed that this world wanted to explain itself.<br/><br/>The story makes you want to think that this fascinating visual of a man floating through space is real. Then you begin to believe that this story is really just the novel the wife was writing .. (which the way the film was made, leaves that to be the only reasonable conclusion.) However then the film makes you doubt this yet again, and you think maybe this man in space is the future doctor that eventually fulfills the destiny of sacrificing himself to give re-birth and so on. It just ends up being ambiguous.<br/><br/>Ambiguity is great and I'm not one of these people who can't deal with things not being spelled out for me. However, the story does set you up to think that it will be explained where as if you contrast this with Kubrick's 2001 (where it was beautifully unexplained) but you weren't being set up to think that you were getting an explanation in that film.<br/><br/>The imagery of heaven, the symbols of ancient religion, references to the bible and other iconic stuff also annoyed me a bit. After watching I thought 'why do you need this garbage to tell a story?'. However then I thought how many people are conditioned to react to these images as though they automatically mean something deep and profound. So, I guess it makes sense but I didn't really like it.<br/><br/>In conclusion I still think the movie was interesting and thougth provoking. I find it funny how it provoked so many people to have a polarized view of it. This is an example of a film that made it difficult for you not to have an extreme opinion of it. I wanted to say ""I absolutely loved it"" then I wanted to say ""I absolutely hated it"" but ultimately I have to give it a 6 out of 10. wheeeww.. now I can get on with my life !!"

","After the paranoid, art-house appeal of 'Pi' and the gorgeous viscerality of 'Requiem for a Dream', above, with merciful breviloquence (to save anyone who might be tempted to rent this), is the message Darren Aaronovsky's most recent offering attempts to convey to the world. And convey it, the film certainly does. The problem here is like all philosophical penmanship, it can be written on the back of a mustardseed.<br/><br/>Even at an MTV-generation-friendly 96mins, there simply is too much film and not nearly enough dramatic interest to sustain the attention of even the Gautama Buddha. Aaronovsky may gain some comfort from the fact that there have been many greater artists before him who, in over-reaching for profundity, on occasion, have failed in their most basic of dramatic duties - which, when are attended to in The Fountain, are done so with lamentable wealth of clichés and bi-dimensional characterisation.<br/><br/>As for The Fountain as transcendental cinema, what, exactly, can it be said to transcend? One might as well call 'Jurassic Park' transcendental, but at least there were lots of hungry dinosaurs running around a bloody island. We forgive you Darren. Try not to let it happen again. 5/10"
"JustApt","4","1","5","6 November 2007"," All Flesh Is Grass
","It is said that God can reach any point of eternity at his will. In The Fountain Darren Aronofsky can reach none at all: his depicting of the present is maudlinly melodramatic, his flashbacks into the distant past are historically illiterate and his visions of the future are naively childish. He also made a bloody mess of world religions - sitting in a lotus position Buddha-like being ascending in a soap bubble just made me laugh. So I consider this movie as a black comedy of one joke - when at last the hero finds Tree of Life and applies its juice to his deadly wounds, he sees how wounds are instantly healed but then his flesh starts turning into the flowering grass: ""For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass"" (1 Peter 1:24) - so much for an eternal life. Then one may say that there still remains a beautiful cinematography, but to my great regrets it's mostly eclectic in the worst sense of this word."

Nothing comes together as we prance from the Inquisition (Spain's finest hour), the discovery of the fountain of youth, the droning modern couple (with her calligraphic book no less), and the golden bubble whizzing through space toward the Mayan dead star.<br/><br/>It sounded interesting , but I can see why it was a huge bomb.

"JacksonDonovan","3","1","6","2 September 2015"," It's not pretentious, but it's definitely garbage.
","In short, this film is pretty damn bad. The performances are corny, despite some patchy greatness from Hugh Jackman. The characters are weak, with an equally weak script. Some of the dialogue in this film sounded like it was lifted right out of a police forensics procedural. Darren Aronofsky's directing is at it's worst in this film, despite some creative (although ultimately cheap) looking visuals. The set pieces, while aiming to be vibrant and stunning, come across as tacky and lame. To Aronofsky's credit, he's tackling an immense concept; unfortunately one that he hasn't managed to handle very well. The Fountain is just not very good, and ultimately very disappointing.<br/><br/>3/10"

","It's a shame that The Fountain is a bad movie. Why? Because it's by a great director, has some amazing visuals, and sports some complex themes about death, mortality, love, and greed. Yet, the movie tries to do to much at once, and with it's overly convoluted timeline, the movie loses it's meaning in it's ambition, ultimately meaning nothing in the end. A good performance by Hugh Jackman is wasted, which is a shame. If you really have to see this movie, try to look at it from a filmmakers standpoint, as that will be interesting, but plot-wise, it's underwritten. Also, beyond its overstuffed themes, the film is at once dark and morose, and then suddenly ludicrously cheesy. The saccharine themes that pervade parts of this film really take away the power that the film could have if it wasn't for its many faults. Once again, this is a bad movie, an ambitious failure, interesting, but not interesting enough."

","The Fountain seems very dated. I'm reminded of Kubrick's brilliant film operas, very much reminded of George Roy Hill's Slaughterhouse-Five. Reminded, reminded. This is a film that practically screams ""COMPARE ME TO OTHER FILMS!"". It might have survived scrutiny better 30 years ago, when we weren't so used to seeing grandiose, long winded attempts to explain simple concepts. Kubrick was the master at it and he, yes even he, can induce a yawn.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman (who gives it his best), plays a man who seeks out eternal life and spends what I'm assuming is eternity trying to understand it all out of love for his dying wife. I can only imagine how horrible eternal life would be, but this film would suggest it's like Bill Murray's Groundhog Day. Scenes are repeated way too many times. Very little is explained, an obvious attempt to create a highbrow intellectual atmosphere, but it just becomes frustrating. It is nice to look at, but becomes flat after a while. Beautifully shot, although relying a lot on the washed out dull look that's popular now. There are very few light moments, literally. I can't help but laugh when hospitals are lit like cellars during a black out, but it's done often and it's done here. The apartment that Jackman shares with Rachel Weiz, his dewy, glowy, dying wife is gloomy Gothic chic. The Spanish explorer and Queen scenes are gloomy Alhambra chic. Scenes of the jungle and The Tree of Life, are gloomy Apocolypto chic. Then there are the future Space scenes, probably the most derivative (and gloomy) off all. Pretentious, unoriginal and grim.

","This is an extraordinary film in so many ways which doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good one. Indeed, it is a failure but an ambitious, over-reaching one with bits here and there that really are amazing. It has had a troubled history. At one point the film was 'scrapped' and started over, it's leading actor recast. This is just one of the many unfortunate elements of the finished product since Hugh Jackman's performance is largely inadequate.<br/><br/>The film follows three separate stories linked by, what we must assume are, the same pair of lovers played by the same performers, one set at the time of the conquistadors, the other in the present and the third in the distant future. It all has to do with the Tree of Life, (you know, the one from the Garden of Eden), love through eternity, conquering death and all that. The ideas themselves are fine but they don't gel; the film's troubled history is all too obvious. This feels like a film that has been badly chopped about, (maybe it hasn't; maybe this was all Aronofsky wanted), and the pretty terrible acting of all concerned doesn't help.<br/><br/>Yet there is considerable imagination here and visually certain scenes take the breath away. The medieval sequences are sumptuous and the scenes set in 'deep space' are often magnificent. It's the 'middle' story that is mundane and yet these scenes are the anchor for everything else that happens. The stories are inter-linked so we keep moving back and forth in time until finally we tire of the dull central yarn. I didn't like Aronofsky's hyper-kinetic drugs movie ""Requiem for a Dream"". At least, this time round he showed, in tantalizing glimpses, just what a fine film-maker he can be ... and then he blew it."

If you don't, you may regret it. This film shows the longing and regret from a future perspective and a rather unusual story within a story as the main plot line.<br/><br/>The result is a rather boring film that, at no point, really grabs the viewer, you always feel you are looking in on the periphery and waiting for the dots to be joined.

Les miserables, prisoners and the greatest showman he is a good actor but this is not one of his great movies this is one of his worst movies and Jackman and Weisz have zero chemistry but you can actually laugh at the fact that they actually chose to work together on this crapfest but why is it because aronofsky wanted to return to directing and make creative art for a movie well he makes it poorly that is what kind of a terrible director he is a one who makes movies that are about art and weird disturbing imagery. I hated all of the charachters especially weisz's charachter she was really unlikeable and Weisz's acting was also bad her performance was likely a contendor for worst actress of the year I honestly wanted Izzy to die I hated her so much she was unlikeable and the scene were she dies is painful they try to revive her and Tom gets sad and complains all the time I was cheering for that tumor to kill her I was happy she died because it would have been the only way to end the movie but unfortunately it didn't because Tom later dreams about her like she is still alive but she isn't she is dead and then Tom turns into a plant and prays to the tree of life and it also has a bad ending and where he plants a fruit in izzys grave and this film also has a mix of science fiction because it has a scene were the tree of life dies into space and a spaceship arrives for its destination to experience the horror of toms vision this movie has the worst plot ever it is another terrible movie from Darren aronofsky i am surprised it didn't get razzie nominated it deserved razzie nominations for worst actress, worst director , worst picture and worst screenplay.

","I was intrigued by this film for a few reasons, because of the leading actor and actress, because of the director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler, Black Swan, Mother!), and because it was rated highly by critics, I hoped for something great. Basically it involves three story lines, taking place in three interweaving narratives, in three places in time, with the same characters in three guises. The past is the 16th century, during the time of the Mayans, the present is 2005, in a hospital, and the future is the 26th century, in a spaceship with a biosphere. In the past, Conquistador Tomás Verde (Hugh Jackman) searches for the Tree of Life, offering immortality, for him and his love, Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz). In the present, Tom Creo (Jackman) is a doctor losing his wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz) to cancer, she begs him to spend what time they have left together, but he desperately seeks a cure. In the future, space traveller Tommy (Jackman) spends most of his time enclosed in the biosphere, containing the Tree of Life he seeded, above the grave of Isabel. The three stories are in a non-linear and non chronological order, interwoven with match cuts and visual motifs, it is essential the same story each time, with lovers connected by the fate of the ""fountain"", but ultimately the characters have to learn come to terms with death. Also starring Ellen Burstyn as Dr. Lillian Guzetti, Mark Margolis as Father Avila, Stephen McHattie as Grand Inquisitor Silecio, Fernando Hernandez as Lord of Xibalba, Cliff Curtis as Captain Ariel, Sean Patrick Thomas as Antonio and Ethan Suplee as Manny. Jackman and Weisz give good performances, there are certainly plenty of visually engaging moments, I will be completely honest though, it is not a movie that is easy to follow, as long as you understand the love story, and get the gist of the philosophical stuff about love, immortality, death and the meaning of life, it is a pretty perplexing but profound enough experience, an interesting enough romantic science-fiction drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Clint Mansell. Good!"

","Unprepared in every way for this movie, I hadn't the faintest idea what was going on for about the first four-fifths of it. Towards the very end it became a little clearer. Reading the other reviews has explained it, more or less. But even knowing what it was meant to be about, I don't think I'll be revisiting it again. Not in the foreseeable future anyway. Jackman and Weisz both seemed to be trying hard, as did the rest of the cast, so presumably the fault lies with the script and direction. Perhaps the basic idea had possible potential. It needed a considerable number of revisions, to make it user-friendly, and I gather it had already had a few, but more were needed.<br/><br/>It was evidently a film with a message, and the message was ""Death Is the Road to Awe"".

","Darren Aronofsky is a director perhaps best known for his films which deal with a dark subject matter. Weather it be Drug addiction in 'Requiem for a dream' or the impossible pursuit for perfection in 'Black Swan', he doesn't shy away from tackling these subject matters head on, in a gritty, yet visually stunning way. It is a shame to say that when he deals with various themes of 'Loosing a loved one', 'Spiritualism' and 'The desire of ever lasting life', is done in the most frothy and pretentious way possible. <br/><br/>It's not that the film isn't gorgeous to look at, which it is. The visuals were mostly done through man-made techniques, which in a world of constant CGI, is nice to see. Tom, the space traveller's sphere and the tree of life, is a wonder to behold. But ultimately, this does not amount to much if, the characters are as flat as Thales' belief of the shape of the earth. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, two actors who are generally fine, have zero chemistry. Ultimately, the beautiful visuals are futile if the characters aren't believable, which they are not. Because then there isn't an emotional backbone to the narrative. The overuse of Taoist, Hindu and Jewish symbolism is a bit too much. Why have multiple sources for the imagery? Is it to say that life is full of all these faiths and it represents life? I don't know and frankly don't care, which is the main problem. <br/><br/>When somebody explains a different viewpoint of a film and makes you think about it in a different way, it can improve the experience. Several people have given their two cents worth of this film to me, and my reaction remains unchanged. Meh. So we all die in the end? Wow, I never knew that. Next, you'll be telling me the sky is blue. Simply because a film is loaded with hidden messages and symbols, doesn't make it any more deep than one which shows it in an obvious way."

If you enjoyed Mr. Nobody then this film will be probably be a film you will appreciate a lot more than most people. The film also has you confused right from the start, but as you go on, you realize it still makes no sense, then you will get this urge with about 45 minutes to go in the film to just shut it off, if you are not into it by then, then trust me on this. You will find absolutely no more interest in this film."

It's heart this is a great love story but it's soul is a metaphysical journey to the edges of time and space. Rachael is awesome, there is something seductive about her screen presence, you want to help her. Hugh is also good in this, although there had to be at least one macho scene to keep the box office ticking.The production has a retro feel, like there is a filter across the lens. But all in all the space fantasy scenes are well executed and invoke flying.

","This movie is, to say it politely, abstract. There is really no coherent way that the three plot lines fit together. Apparently the main guy is a scientist whose wife is about to die, some guy who has reached spiritual enlightenment with his tree that he's in love with, and a Spanish conquistador seeking the tree of life. While I was watching it, it got to the point that I would predict bizarre things would happen as a joke, that ended up occurring. Also, near the end, there was the classic sad cello music that is always played in artsy movies. When I was debating whether or not I wanted to see this movie, I thought it was about a man who was trying to defeat death, as in the Grimm reaper. I was disappointed. To conclude everything, there is a fine line between artsy, and ""what the heck did I just watch!"". This movie crosses that line."

","The only reason I watched this movie was because my younger brother, who thinks of himself as a bit of an intellectual, said it was the best movie he's ever seen. I had no pre-determined notions as I had not even read a review of it first. The only reason I give it as high a score as '4' is because Hugh Jackman is pretty hot, and I love any kind of stories involving history. It's just as well my husband (a Bruce Willis/Chevy Chase fan) didn't watch this because he would have been utterly lost in the first 10 minutes. That's about the time too, that I realized it was going to be an awful movie. Boring, confusing, surreal artsy-fartsy nonsense. I could have understood the Spanish story line and the Tom Cleo storyline, but adding in the (what I now know from reading reviews, was suppose to portray the far future)space travel, was just too bizarre. I didn't feel that the point of the movie had been made. If I were in high-school and had been MADE to watch this movie and comment, I would have proclaimed what I think the movie meant to say (die gracefully, mortality, blah, blah, blah) and pray I was right. Give me ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or ""The Family Stone"" over this movie, any day."

","This was a very creative and entertaining way to describe love, life, and death, but the movie in my opinion was too short and needed a little more narrative. Many people that have seen the movie complained that there was no narrative, but there was definitely a narrative, it's just that at times it was too vague. The other issue is that in some of the scenes they whisper so quietly you can't hear a word that's said. The story and the ideas put into this movie are really fantastic though. You will have to pay attention and definitely turn the volume up when they whisper, which is quite often. Also realize the narrative isn't complete and much of it is left to your own interpretation. My main complaint is that they left too much up to interpretation and that left the movie feeling incomplete. That said, I still give this movie a 7 because it still comes across pretty well."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","3","7 February 2012"," A strong story not told overly well
","It's a damn shame that Darren Aronofsky was forced to cut his budget in half, because I would have loved to see what he could have come up with the original script. Because right now the film feels like it's halfway done. Like certain scenes are missing and that the film didn't reach its full potential.<br/><br/>Right now the film is very much love it or hate it. Those film goers, who love deep and thought-provoking films will appreciate the underlying themes and the quiet atmosphere that slowly builds as the story progresses. Others, myself included, will see the fact that the film is not executed correctly. The overall story is a masterpiece, retelling the story of the first man and woman, but unfortunately that said story is not told correctly. The choice to separate the story into three different time periods and locations was a good one, but those three separate stories have to tie together in some way. And the first two time periods actually do feed of each other and they feel connected. But the last time period is there mainly for the gorgeous space imagery and for the trailer shots. Or at least that's the feeling I was left with after I was done watching this movie. There are some minor scenes where the third time period ties together with the first two, but they are few and far between.<br/><br/>Thought I must admit that the first two stories are extremely well-done. The love story between these two archetypical characters is believable and eventually even a bit heart-breaking. Both main actors are very talented and they have a genuine chemistry. The cinematography IS damn impressive, special effects are used skillfully and this movie honestly managed to pull me in.<br/><br/>Thus, in the end, this movie has an amazing story, but it doesn't manage to convey that story overly well. It's a brilliant movie for those that can appreciate it from a thematic, aesthetic or atmospheric point of view, but it's definitely not for those who demand a coherent, well-told story above all else."

Yes, I didn't get at least 30% of the movie, but that didn't matter to me so much.<br/><br/>Some people might find this movie pretentious. I'd say 'niche' for now. What I liked is that I deeply cared for the protagonists. There are real emotions on screen here, the acting is terrific.

Many things are left open. The inquisitor for example, what does he have to do with the whole story, why the need of this figure? And at what point of time does the past become the present and then the future? This movie has the capacity to move things inside people because of the use of powerful symbols from Buddhism, Maya myths, Christianity and some New Age elements, what results in an exposed used of symbols and a mixture of things that aren't really connected to each other. It is a pity that great messages like the one of acceptance as the key to inner peace didn't find a better channel of expression and a better story telling.

"vincent_ireland","10","0","2","13 June 2011"," Outstanding - I only wished there were more films of this quality
","This film is full of nuance and is interwoven in such a way that makes it a feast for those who love to analyse, interpret and debate. But for those who prefer to forgo the puzzle aspect of a film, it is a lush experience first and foremost that doesn't need to be analysed to be enjoyed. But for those who can't resist the riddle, questions revolve around these points: how do Tomas the Conquistador/Tommy the oncologist/Tom the astronaut relate to one another? Are they the same guy? What about Queen Isabella/Izzi dying of brain cancer/Izzis' apparitions? Are these reincarnations? Are they parallel lives? What is ""real"" in The Fountain and what is imagined? On one level these questions could be said to miss the point. The whole film is by definition a work of imagination. Nothing in it is really ""real"". Some would say that what matters is the way the film affects the viewer, the impressions it makes, the thoughts and feelings it leaves you with. However let's be honest, on another level the film can be approached as a puzzle. So, looking at it as a puzzle, what is the solution to the previous questions? My own best take, having seen the film a few times, goes something like this. The film is about Tommy and Izzi struggling to come to terms with her death and its consequences for Tommy who will be left behind. Izzi manages to make peace with dying, but she recognises that Tommy can't. She has been writing a book called ""The Fountain"" about a Conquistador (representing Tommy) who wants to save his queen (representing Izzi) from tyranny (the cancer) by finding her the key to eternal life (Tommy's oncology research). The process of writing the book has helped Izzi come to terms with dying. It is also a final act of love in that she gives the book to Tommy to finish. Her wisdom is that by getting Tommy to finish the book the process of writing it can unite them one last time in their joint struggle to heal over Izzi's premature death. By struggling to finish the book Tommy may find the path Izzi found, out of despair and towards a sense of peace and awe (she once describes it as feeling ""full, held""). So the ""real"" parts of the film are the scenes involving Tommy and Izzi that are set in the present. The scenes involving the other couples (Tomas and Isabella, as well as Tom and the apparitions of Izzi and Isabella) are from the book ""The Fountain"" that they co-write. The scenes from the book with the fictional Tomas/Isabella/Tom are essentially the working out of the struggle Tommy and Izzi go through to come to terms with loss and death. We can imagine that Izzi, being fascinated with the Mayans and Spanish history, wrote most of the scenes set in that era. We even see Tommy reading these scenes from her book. I think that Tommy, being a man of science, and essentially desolate after the loss of Izzi, wrote all of the Tom the astronaut story arc. Throughout the film we see Tom travelling towards the Xibalba nebula, trying to keep alive the tree which somehow carries Izzi's essence. Tom's journey, his struggle and suffering alone in space, haunted by the memory of Izzi, mirrors Tommy's journey of grief in the present. Throughout the film we hear Izzi say to Tommy/Tom to ""finish it"". This is her insistence to Tommy that he find a way to finish the book. Her faith is that when Tommy finds a way to finish the book he will find a way to make peace with life and death, love and loss. At the end of the film we see that Tommy recrafts the final scene Izzi wrote in the unfinished book to tie in with Tom the astronaut's quest. Initially mid way through the film the confrontation between the Mayan priest and Tomas the seeker of eternal life showed the priest ready to strike down the intruder. In the recrafted scene Tom appears as a floating enlightened being before the priest, and the priest recognises that Tom has ""got it"" – he is prepared to die to create new life. He is the ""First Father"" by virtue of this realisation. We then see that Tom reverts back to Tomas, who slits the priest's throat. I think this is Tommy writing out the Tomas character, who represents an earlier version of himself, when he was essentially unenlightened and is still ""going after the gold"" of eternal life, and is still resisting the fate that awaits him. Next, in eating the sap from the Tree of Life Tomas unwillingly is converted into foliage. This kind of mirrors the Bible where Adam and Eve try to cheat ignorance by eating from the Tree of Knowledge. I think this may be just to show the futility of going after eternal life and the consequences of trying to cheat death. We then see Tom going through a kind of transcendent death. We already know he embraces this because of this exchange between him and the Izzi apparition earlier on: Tom(joyfully): ""I'm going to die!"" Izzi: ""Together we will live forever."" Tom: ""Forever."" His passing gives new life to the tree he has been transporting and nurturing. This represents the universe being renewed. Tom and Izzi will together live forever but not by literally cheating death, but rather by reaching a higher understanding and by accepting their return to become a part of the where they came. This ties in with what Izzi tried to explain to Tommy earlier in the film about death being the road to awe. The final scene in the film, where Tommy plants the seed in Izzi's grave, shows that he has finally grasped the realisation that allowed Izzi to die in peace."

","This movie has had an infamous reputation amongst my circle of friends, and for good reason.<br/><br/>The plot: Spread between three time lines (past, present and future{I think}) it movie tells a story of a conquistador searching for the fountain of youth. A doctor trying find a cure for his ill wife, and the future: Which is so abstract all I can say is a man trying to save a tree?<br/><br/>The writing: Is good, the story lines I understood made sense and are filled with symbolism about; life, death , and the after life. The characters interactions are well written and the relations between Hugh Jackman's characters and Rachel Weisz's characters are quite compelling (both of them play a ""different"" character in each timeline. Sadly I did find the three stories as a whole hard to enjoy as I spent most of the movie trying to figure out what is supposed to be happening. This led me to become more bored than intrigued. I thought the most compelling story is the one of the past, as it is both intriguing and understandable. The story line in the present seemed to be overly dramatic as the characters are not given enough development for me to empathize with them. The future story line is enjoyable to watch, but I did not really understand it.I would compare this movie with the novel ""One Hundred Years Of Solitude"" by Garcia Marquez, not only with its dream atmosphere but because of the time lapses are similar. <br/><br/>The acting: The lead actors in this movie were good, but they seemed to be secondary. Most of the movies strengths lie in its script and atmosphere. This is not to say no emotions are conveyed by the actors as Jackman and Weisz give a full on performance. This performance also demanded a myriad of emotions to be displayed in sequence and the leads do a great job during these scenes. <br/><br/>The cinematography: I thought this was the best part of the movie. The interloping cuts between time lines are done really, and the imaginative environments created are filled with mystique. We are taken to the deep South American jungles, to an tranquil garden reminiscent to that of distant galaxies, and more moderate scene in a gloomy hospital. The lighting ranged from high contrasts to darker softer lights (depending on the timeline). The contrasting atmospheres of the three story lines some how meshed well together and this is definitely credited to Aronofsky's visionary direction. <br/><br/>The score: Mostly filled with strings to convey emotion and emphasize the drama in each scene. It works well with the movie and is not jarring in any way, but is nothing spectacular. <br/><br/>If you are in the mood for something abstract that will take you to places only in our imaginations watch this movie. However if one is unable to appreciate the arts do not watch this movie without someone who does so one may be able to appreciate this masterfully created film. <br/><br/>7.5/10"

","The Fountain is not your typical sci-fi/drama. Being unrealistic is one of its goals. Its mission is not to show us what life lies beyond the scope of our imagination, but what the life actually is that is fully within that scope. At several points in the movie I found myself racking my brain trying to make sense of the scene when it turned out that simplicity was the answer. The cinematography is beautiful, including one perfect silent tracking shot in a rainy street. The movie not only shows you the true fragility of the human experience but also the beauty of the big picture of things. Some new insight into the meaning of love is also provided.

"FilmCynics","8","0","1","5 August 2010"," This is an artsy film, no doubt.
","In the early minutes of what you know will be an artsy film, it's natural to feel a little disoriented as you adjust to whatever narrative language the film is going to speak in. But as the minutes ticked by, I could see I was wading in beyond my depth and all I could do was sit back and let The Fountain wash over me. Once again, the bounds of Darren Aronofsky's imagination seem only limited by the constraints of his budget. And as he continues to demonstrate a knack for drawing the best out of his actors, one can only imagine what further fame and success will afford his creative arsenal.<br/><br/>While the story of The Fountain spans centuries and three sets of star-crossed lovers, it is really about one thing: the quest for the fountain of youth (whether metaphorical or not). The impetus behind this search, and the thread this ties all three stories together is an unmistakable love story, the only unmistakable thing in this film. While colder poetic science fiction like 2001 stays rooted firmly in humanity's relationship to technology, The Fountain's travel through time proves that relationship to be irrelevant and instead, much like Solaris, says that it is how we relate to each other that makes us what we are. Like other Aronofsky films, there are undercurrents of desperation throughout, and coupled with the sublime cinematography, there's a mournful beauty that permeates every scene.<br/><br/>Watching The Fountain, I felt like a dog at a garden party; I knew there was something special happening, there were plenty of great metaphors to nibble on, and juicy helpings of symbolism to lap up off the grass, but I was generally at a loss to understand what it was. But a dog doesn't need to what their master's saying to know that they're sad, or happy, or kicking them off the couch, so a passable knowledge of what's going down is perfectly acceptable for an emotive film like this.<br/><br/>I admit it, this film is too big for me to do it justice on paper, but what I can do is nibble around the edges and deal with smaller elements that are more within my grasp. For instance, as soon as I was able to get my bearings, the first thing to strike me was the immersive nature of the sound design. I can't attest to what it was like in theatres, but my 5.1 system at home was firing on all cylinders. It could be argued that the best sound design is like the best editing, if you've noticed it, it can't be all that great, but as you travel through both space and time, the soundscapes really help to get you situated.<br/><br/>The Verdict: This is an artsy film, no doubt. So if you have a problem with convoluted plots and going an hour and a half without seeing an explosion (mind you, there is an Aztec priest wielding a flaming sword) this might not be the film for you. If you're looking for a movie that will appeal to your sense of wonder, while not making you feel spoon-fed with glaringly obvious plot progression, I say run, don't walk, run to the video store and get your hands on this Better yet, hold off for a bit and then head to the previously viewed bin and consider adding it to your permanent collection at a sweet discount – come to think of it, that's where I'm heading now."

","A movie like ""The Fountain"" doesn't come along every day. Here is a rundown of its best qualities, which few movies can similarly boast all at once: <br/><br/><ul><li>Awesome original score. Raw and powerful, its emotional force ebbs and flows seamlessly with the visual elements, from moment to moment. It is lamenting and mysterious, beautiful, cascading in repeating patterns and creating an aural texture that is simply stunning.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Brilliant acting. I have seen this movie four times. Up until this last time (7-28-10), I thought of the movie synonymously as a ""tour de force"" by Hugh Jackman. His portrayal of Tommy, a young doctor attempting against the clock to save his wife from cancer, and of a Spanish Conquistador and futuristic monk show three angles of the same quest: a man straining at his very limit to find the answers to his questions. Jackman acts unreservedly, allowing us to see deeply into each character. I have always thought that Rachel Weisz was also very good. However, upon this last viewing, it struck me that Weisz' heart- rending performance is, arguably, even more critical to the movie's success than Jackman's. In the end, this is a moot point: it is sufficient to say that Weisz turns in one of the best, most intriguing and deeply human character sketches of her career in this movie. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Brilliant directing. Obviously, when you try to weave a visual fantasy (Weisz' character's fictional book) together with the theme of birth and rebirth as seen through the lens of the ancient Mayan culture together with a love story of a modern-day couple together with the relationship of a queen and her champion conquistador during the time of the Great Inquisition - and to do it all in a visually staggering way while still driving forward the story and keeping it interesting - you're going to need some skill. Enter Darren Aronofsky. I haven't yet seen ""Pi"" or ""Requiem for a Dream,"" but, trust me, these are now top of the list of movies I want/need to see.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Breathtaking visuals. I have only seen one movie that I might rank higher than ""The Fountain"" for its accomplishment as a visual feast in its own right, and that is ""Hero."" But this is some distinguished company. If you lose track of the story in The Fountain (which can happen), or just want to listen to your iPod for a while, put this movie on in the background and mute the sound and I guarantee: you will have a very entertaining and beautiful experience! In fact, if you do, email me and let me know how it was. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Unforgettableness. Unlike the bulk of movies that are thrust before us, this movie gives you something to chew on, for all of the above reasons but also because it grapples with age-old quandaries like death and the meaning of life. </li></ul><br/><br/>All-in-all, a tremendous accomplishment."

","Three parallel stories revolves around the two characters in different time periods but there are invisible threads connecting this three stories.Each story is the journey of a man to save his beloved one from the certain death.A doctor trying to find the cure for his wife dying from cancer,a warrior in the ancient Spain to save his queen trying to find a tree which according to ancient Mayan myth is the source for life in Earth,and the third story is of a man traveling in the space to save the dying tree.First story which is the real story and other two stories are used as symbolism and interpretations to make us realize the message and to express the purpose of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie looks very simple on the surface,Darren Aronofsky use the ancient myths and mysteries of universe as the symbolism to raise the questions on life and death.The Fountain is the movie which does not depend on it's story but on what will we experience after watching the movie,you cannot know what movie delivers by just reading it's story on the page you have to experience the movie on your own. What i felt about the movie is that this is a great effort but it lacks in vision and focus.Due to it's lack of clear insight the movie failed to get us to the destined point and the message of the movie get lost and remained unclear and at the end i was left unsatisfied.<br/><br/>The Fountain is not like other Hollywood mainstream sci-fi cinema,this movie reminds me of the Andrew Tarnofynsky's movies,The Solyaris and The Stalker which deals with the same questions and philosophy of human life,it's existence and it's purpose through symbolism.But this movie is not as complete and insightful as those movies but still a good experience to watch.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is it's beautiful cinematography,it's editing and its mesmerizing music given by Clint Massel.This three things makes the movie a visually captivating and eye-pleasing experience to watch but it failed to be eye-opening experience for me.The movie have outstanding performance of Rachelz Weisz but Hugh Jackman could have done much better job here,i think he was not the right choice for the role.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is a very talented director with a great vision,his every work took out some deep thoughts from inside of us forces us to face the harsh reality of human life,the sorrow,the failure,the death.His works always remains like a very sad poem with a message.The Fountain is so far the worst movie from him but still have strength to distinct itself from other movies we see nowadays,you can see the fingerprints of a brilliant and visionary artist in his bad movie too."
"rooee","7","0","1","12 April 2010"," Flawed but true
","If Pi took us through the trials of purgatory and Requiem For A Dream gave us a taste of hell then there is something heavenly about Darren Aronofsky's latest. Clearly he never had in mind to limit his intimate romantic drama to the confines of genre, feasibility, or even planet Earth. The film has predictably polarised the opinion of critics. It seems that the more personal the vision, the more extreme the critical response; whenever a vision such as Aronofsky's comes along the condemnation is vicious and the praise is lavish.<br/><br/>He could have done what he wanted after the stupendously grim Requiem for a Dream. The marketing bods must have been cracking their knuckles in glee when they'd found someone who shot violent neo-noir who they could sell as the new David Fincher. But instead he ended up six years later completing a metaphysical love story, full of light, and ultimately hopeful.<br/><br/>Some critics have made comparisons between this and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I believe thematic comparisons are erroneous. Certainly, the film provides similar challenges (and possibly confusion) for its audience. But 2001 had bigger fish to fry - the post-Nietzschean rebirth of God, no less - while The Fountain is filmed in close-up. 2001 was about the power of Man; The Fountain is about one powerless man and his inevitable defeat.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether you find The Fountain mysterious and moving or a pretentious bore, Aronofksy's conviction is undeniable. In an industry steadily becoming saturated with product placement sequels and depressing remakes, it's refreshing to lie back and be presented with a truly unique vista. It's as much about capturing a single emotion - the most elusive of all - as it is about telling a story. And, if nothing else, life in a Petri dish sure looks pretty."

","OK, so, this movie is ALL about visual and conceptual metaphors, so every single person will come up with their own interpretation of them. And that is basically all the story there is to this movie.<br/><br/>Aside for that, I must say I was about to stop watching at about minutes 15 and 30. I was very annoyed by the continuous story-switching (there are 3 different 'realities' alternating, and they don't follow a linear chronological order). I don't like flashbacks, and this movie is like a huge (metaphoric) flashback at the nth power. But since I thought I could waste another hour watching, I did. However, I don't see why this was labeled as Sci-Fi: it is NOT (maybe LS-Di).<br/><br/>On the bright side, I must say Wolverine delivers a very neat and convincing performance (the fact he doesn't have claws nor hair spikes at the sides of his head helped), and this is even more impressing considering that in order to do that Jackman must have been able to actually understand what the movie was all about and relate to it.<br/><br/>The locations (especially the interiors) are quite beautiful, both the CGI and the real ones, same goes for the camera work.<br/><br/>There isn't really much to say about the characters... the movie could have even been shot with just Jackman and Weisz and nothing would have really changed (possibly with Jackman all by himself).<br/><br/>My personal interpretation is that this movie is an eulogy of acceptance and closure. Peace (enlightenment) can be reached by not brooding over losses, letting go and accept whatever comes. Probably all good and true, but certainly not particularly original, nor 'enlightened'... As for the way the director rendered it, probably he has a predilection for certain substances over others, or he just wanted to show off, or both, who knows/cares?<br/><br/>The mark is about 6.5/10 in my book."

","The Fountain is an extremely ambitious film by Darren Aronofsky. It is the story of a man Tom, who is trying to save his lover, Izzie, from her last stages of death. It spans over two other stories, one that takes place in the past and one that takes place in the future. I would be lying if I said I understood all of it. I don't, and that is why the film requires multiple viewings. However, I honestly loved it. It is not perfect, but it has some of the most visually enchanting scenes of any film in recent years. The present part of the film is touching. Hugh Jackman is very good, but flawed in all of his three roles. Rachel Weisz, however, was fantastic. I have not seen many films from her, but from the ones I did, she has never stood out to me. Here, she creates a very vulnerable and compassionate woman, and it is easy to understand why Tom loves her so much. Weisz is perfect for this role and she really shines through. One of the best female performances of 2006, and she was snubbed of an Oscar nomination. The cinematography is also flawed, but mostly beautiful. In the scenes involving Tom and the Tree in the future, it is beautiful shot, but other times, the cinematography, mostly in the opening action scene, is not handled correctly. The costumes visual effects are amazing, and the whole production design was snubbed of any real awards consideration. Now lets get to the music score. Absolutely breathtaking! Easily the best score of it's year, and probably one of the best music scores of the last five years, along with Atonement and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. The final scene of the film was fantastic and powerful because it comes to prove that the film medium can become art. <br/><br/>Overall, The Fountain is flawed, but is ultimately a touching, sad, and powerful visually spellbinding film."

I recommend it to everyone who likes poetry, because ""The Fountain"" is poetry itself. The three story lines which the film contains bring the technique widely promoted by Manchevski and Tarantino fifteen years a go to a master's perfection. Hence, it is three masterpieces into one marvelous acomplishment. Sitting back and reviewing my fear of watching this film again after the first time, I find myself extremely silly.

I don't really know what they are trying to say, why is that guy floating in the middle of the air. Why did the man bury his wife in the middle of nowhere in a snow covered empty space? This movie is more like a special effect documentary than a typical movie. And sometimes, the music is strange, it makes me kind depressed momentarily or at least made me feel unhappy.<br/><br/>If you watched the special feature, the director admitted that he was in Australia for two years, and the movie got shut down by Warner brother Studio. Well, that wasn't a bad decision. The idea is good, but the movie is not coherent, the stories were all over the place.<br/><br/>This is just one of those movies that you wish that it can end faster.

","Pi was great. Requiem was really good and I'll never know if it's better than that because it would take a lot to make me sit down and watch it again. And I have a feeling it's the kind of movie you only need to see once anyways. The Fountain was an ambitious attempt at a modern-day 2001, but without the cohesiveness and style to hold it all together.<br/><br/>A lot of the visuals in The Fountain come off as silly and distract from the overall enjoyment of the film. The flow and pacing of the film was confused in that it felt more like a three hour movie when really it was closer to 90 minutes. This is most likely because it felt like a series of ideas, some decent and some haphazard, strung together over rich visuals. The acting is average at best, which is saying a lot since neither Jackman or Weisz have much room to explore their characters.<br/><br/>For a more cohesive style and visuals that are much closer to breathtaking (which Aronofsky thrived for here but generally failed), then I'd recommend 'Sunshine', another modern day film that works along similar lines as 2001 but succeeds more as an action film than as a Zen parable. Aronofsky is talented and has achieved some stunning work, but I'm not going to like this movie on that fact alone. He doesn't demonstrate his qualities as a filmmaker with this movie so much as reveal his weaknesses. I was underwhelmed."

If I followed it right we got to see the book she is writing before he does and that doesn't seem to go together well once he receives it.

If you watch the film and can concentrate on the efforts of those above, you may find some enjoyment in watching this composition.<br/><br/>However, if you enjoy a well-told story that conveys some meaning, rather than a second-rate understanding of metaphysics, myth, and spirituality, then avoid view this flick.<br/><br/>The fault clearly lies with the writer/director. I viewed this film last night, and so desired to give him the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, I watched the DVD's bonus features. Instead of finding some deeper meaning into the films message, all I got was his personal diary (and not a very insightful one) of how the film was technically made. Watching this bonus feature only gave me greater respect for the efforts of those listed above. They are the only ones who seemed to even attempt to convey any meaning in the film.<br/><br/>During the bonus feature, we find out that the studio shut him down in 2002 from making this film. After listening to him drone on about literally nothing, I can understand that executive decision.<br/><br/>As one reviewer stated, this film is more about one man's 1000 year, struggle to conquer death. However, at the end of the film, it totally abandons that notion, and tries to pawn off as depth of meaning some ridiculous idea that all life is found in a flower, or some other form of nature. This extremely unsatisfying resolution is reason enough to avoid the film altogether.<br/><br/>However, if you enjoy fine art direction, nice visuals, and can glean enough meaning out of only those things in a film, then go ahead and watch."

"lagomorph13","5","0","4","23 June 2007"," High on Visuals, Low on Inspiration
","When it comes to blending multiple stories and time lines into one great story, Aronofsky would do well to study the work of Alejandro Inarritu. I'm thinking of two films in particular where several stories are interwoven around one concept (the dogs) in Amores Perros and one object (the rifle) in Babel.<br/><br/>Inarritu creates balance, coherence and integration between his various stories. What inspires me most about Inarritu's work is that I find myself caring about his characters even when they are brutal, self-serving and pathetic (i.e. Octavio, Susana and Valeria in Amores Perros and Santiago and Yussef in Babel). Why? Because he's able to show them as multidimensional, as worthy of redemption as of devastation.<br/><br/>Aronofsky seems to be trying too hard in this story, and as a result I find Izzi's character far too precious, and Tommy's character gratingly obsessive. I cannot empathize with these characters, nor do they inspire me to think about immortality, redemption, love, beauty, romance, salvation or similar themes that could have been generated by a more spiritually mature director.<br/><br/>As for the fantasy aspect of his story, Aronofsky would do well to study the techniques of Guillermo del Toro. In The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, del Toro expertly weaves the fantastic into the everyday, scene by scene, until they merge perfectly into one common universe. Not only does he construct the integration of fantasy and reality with skillful plot lines, he also applies brilliant technical skills such as camera work, color filter palettes and editing wipes to draw the viewer into the ""visual poetry"" (and I do agree that is the term best used for these types of movies).<br/><br/>Not only do Innaritu and del Toro beautifully portray the human condition, but their soundtracks are minimal and the music becomes yet another character. I found the constant undercurrent of music in this movie to be unnecessary and annoying. Unfortunately, I think that is a common flaw in most of the movies made by modern American directors.<br/><br/>Yet another aspect of Aronofsky's film that did not appeal to me was the portrayal of the animals as throwaways in the medical experiments. When Inarritu exposes the carnage of the dog fights, it's a reflection of the violent and brutal nature of the men who train and employ these animals. Also, the carnage in Amores Perros is always implied off-camera but never directly shown, and we are assured in the featurette that these animals are treated wonderfully throughout the filming and are never injured or mistreated in any way. It did not appear to me that there was nearly as much care taken with the animals in this film.<br/><br/>I did find the visual art of the movie appealing, and I hope that Aronofsky will continue working on his craft and evolving it. If his work inspired others, then that's great. But if it didn't inspire me, it's not because I didn't ""get it"" or I'm a ""hater"", it's because I'm more attracted to the brilliance of those whose work and vision outshines Aronofsky's the way that a diamond outshines a facsimile."

The music. Don't get me wrong, the music was beautiful. But it played almost ALL the time. Again, it seems this director wanted to make a 2 hours music video. It felt as if he couldn't make scenes strong enough, as if images couldn't speak for themselves without background music all the time. That's a flaw, in my opinion.

","Hugh Jackman, bald. That's where we start this film. The question behind the movie is ""What if the Fountain of Life really existed?"" Of course, this film is primarily an exercise in visual excess and melodrama, much like Aronovsky's previous film, Requiem for a Dream. Much like that past film, this one places the story in the heart of emotion, concerning itself less with good storytelling and character development and more with creating situations of great emotion. But unlike Requiem, The Fountain's structure inhibits a full appreciation of the characters' emotional progression.<br/><br/>While the film is visually brilliant, the pacing and the shallowness of the story often makes the progression of the film tedious and the inclusion of some of the religious visual motifs (and the picture of the future) really serve to distract from central point--a man's dealing with inevitable grief, which in its moments is quite impressive to watch. It's just burdened with a whole lot of extra ""stuff"" that's unnecessary to the core story, especially the overuse of the ""future story"". If the film were centered in the ""near future"" with occasional allusions to the fictional past, that might be sufficient dressing for the core element.<br/><br/>As it stands, it's a passable affair, with good-enough acting, outstanding visuals and a few moments of melodrama that might move you, but it becomes difficult to watch because of the unfocused meandering of the sequences and some amount of zaniness, which detracts from the otherwise somber tone of the film (I have to liken it to how I felt about Superman Returns). There are good ideas here, but the end package doesn't match up with the potential. Better luck next time, Mr. Aronovsky. 6/10."

I have to give some credit to writer/director Aronofsky as there are some visually gripping and emotionally raw moments. Oh, and the musical score is descent.

Pi is a great film and Requiem is problematic, but a good film nonetheless. Also the knowledge that it had taken him nearly six years to finish this film intrigued me. That said, the film is totally misrepresented by the trailer. It's not nearly as 'sci-fi' as they want you to think it's going to be. (Though not everyone will agree, I think it's a good thing). The film is beautifully shot, incredible landscapes and color washes. Jackman gives a solid performance. But Weisz's character is the stock, moderately eccentric woman that seems to be popping up more and more in American 'independent' cinema. She was Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine, was Julianne Moore in Children of Men, was Nora Zehtner in Brick. The story exists in three separate settings, 1500 CE Spain, present-day America, and an undefined futuristic sequence (which may or may not be nothing more than Hugh Jackman's character trying to deal with his life). These settings have nothing to do with time- travel or anything sci-fi at all, they are logical extensions of the psyche of these complex characters. It's high concept and interesting, well shot, and never really crosses any dangerous thresholds, into the realms of laborious exercises in cinematic experiments, but it's, nonetheless, problematic. So what do I think? See it. The whip shot motif is beautiful, good cinematography and an interesting screenplay, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that anyone would actually fall in love with the film."

His talent lies in his rare ability to place his hands upon what genuinely drives people - their fears, passions, pains and obsessions  and to manipulate this on screen in a way that so few filmmakers are able to do. Now The Fountain further cements his status as an artist of the soul.<br/><br/>Let's stop with the semantics for a moment and simply say that this film is a work of total beauty; from the wonderfully elegant and understated performance of Rachel Weisz as Izzy, to the stunning visual imagery of the film's moving-painting style backdrop. The Fountain is a real viewing experience that I hope many of you will enjoy as much as I did. Hugh Jackman (my favourite over Pitt any day!) gives a sterling performance as the tortured Tomas/Tommy/Dr. Tom Creo; whose desperation propels the narrative throughout its many levels of love, loss and existential spirituality.<br/><br/>Though mostly taking place in the present day, the narrative visits three separate time frames spanning 1000 years. Each story is bound together by the film's central couple, and delicately interlaced to produce a beautiful and ambiguous reflection on the complexity of emotion and the human endeavour. Despite the occasionally uncertain chronology and moments of absolute sadness; The Fountain is a bittersweet and strangely reassuring tale (in a tear-your-heart-out-and-lock-it-in-a-box sort of way) that really left an emotional imprint upon me. I urge anyone who has a penchant for highly personal and often painful cinema, and who is unfamiliar with Aronosfsky to get yourself acquainted immediately with his inimitable style and very individual films."

","Critically drubbed and a commercial flop, The Fountain, is lining up behind 2001: A Space Odyssey as the most misunderstood film of its era. What's so fascinating is that if you've ever been in love with someone other than yourself, the movie makes total sense. My wife and I watched it only once and that was enough. Despite what some are saying I don't think this needs multiple viewings. It stirs powerful emotions with just about every frame, and lays out a logical visual narrative that reaches a beautiful conclusion. The ""story"" may take longer to process, but its rather inconsequential and in some cases left up to interpretation. What's important here is watching with your heart exposed. Not ground breaking by any means, but still an irreplaceable experience."
"TheGOLDENWALRUS","9","0","1","24 May 2007"," beautiful and quite complicated but will start up a nice discussion
","The Fountain is a stylish beautifully directed film that needs more attention. Though quite confusing and people may not pick up on it after the first time, it does lead to different interpretations and lots of symbolism. the music is very well pieced together as it didn't dominate the film.<br/><br/>The starts with Jackman in a strange bubble with a tree. My favorite part is when he is dancing and the stars are in the background. I actually wished the scene lasted 10 seconds longer. Than flashbacks are shown in the 1500's and 2000. Jackman and Weis both have two different roles in the movie (well my interpretation they do).<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman really surprised me in the beautiful piece of artwork. He should of at least received a nomination for this movie. In my opinion it even beats DiCaprio in The Departed. Rachel Weis also did a very good job but Jackman stole the show as his role required a lot of emotion. Jackman got into his role so much it felt as real as a film can get.<br/><br/>About 30 percent of you will like this movie as it is easily labeled as a hit or miss (look at the message boards and you will see plenty of annoying complaints). Give this movie a try, you will be blown or way or you will punch a hole in your t.v."
"DonFishies","6","0","1","19 May 2007"," Visually astounding, but far too flawed to be looked at as anything more
","After seeing the brilliance he delivered in Requiem for a Dream last summer, I was up for anything Darren Aronofsky had to offer. I never had a chance to view his first film, Pi, but I did want to make a point of seeing The Fountain as soon as I could. And despite the heavily negative reviews I read, I figured it had to be somewhat worthwhile.<br/><br/>So as anyone who has read anything on this film can tell you, The Fountain cycles through a thousand year cycle of a man named Tom (Hugh Jackman), and the love of his life, Isabel (Rachel Weisz), and his search for everlasting life. In 1500, he is a Spanish conquistador, searching for a tree that will keep his queen alive forever. In 2000, he is a lab scientist trying to find a cure for his ailing wife. In 2500, he is a cosmonaut, traveling through space with a tree, haunted by old memories.<br/><br/>While the film is undeniably unique and original, it often played itself out to look like a movie that was originally envisioned to be so much grander. It really does feel like Aronofsky made a compromise and took out the real lavishness of the film, and just left the bare bones. Not that the powerful and deep seated core of the movie is not there, it just feels like that is it, and nothing more.<br/><br/>While this would not usually sound like a bad thing, it proves to be one here. Whole sequences go on for minutes at a time, and they just point to something that is either not there, or not worthy of retrieving. Every moment in the film is interconnected (hence why some are overplayed quite annoyingly), but every moment does not feel like it is needed. It just turns boring really quickly, and leads to a lot of eye-rolling as the movie barrels on. And for a movie that is just over ninety minutes, that just does not work. While editing probably would not have solved this, more coherency in these redundant sequences probably would have helped.<br/><br/>And while the film is fairly easy to follow at first (despite the jumpiness between time periods and its numerous allusions to everything from the bible to medieval times), it completely turns itself on its own head during its denouement. I expected my mind to get screwed with, but it just did not seem to make a whole total whack of sense the way Aronofsky did it. It seemed more like he wanted to play out every idea he has, and just throw it at the audience all at once and yell ""Gotcha!"" My mind hurts even now, just attempting to comprehend the ultimate point of The Fountain. Was it all an exercise to toy with me, or did Aronofsky genuinely believe he delivered the film he set out to originally? If the whole film did anything for me, it is the fact that I am now curious to see what the original vision was, and if it was just as buggy as this one.<br/><br/>What the film also loses in a lot of cases is emotion from the cast. The entire supporting cast looks like they are either watching a train wreck or just seem completely confused at why they are even there throughout the entirety of the film. None of them are particularly notable, and most are seen for fleeting minutes, if at all (and the majority are only used in the events that take place in 2000).<br/><br/>Jackman seems like he is really trying, but only makes it work half the time. You can see the pain in his face and in his actions, but when brilliant ideas that make the film progress occur, he just does not seem too phased by what has hit him. He looks just like the script reader told him that something big just happened, and he just runs along and goes with the flow. He is lifeless for the majority of the film, and when his poignant moments come, you stare in agony just wishing that he was not so stiff delivering it. Weisz fares even worse. Despite being the key to the entire production, she goes totally underused. I never got a real sense of why Jackman was moved to keep her alive in any of the scenarios, and got even less a sense as to what she brought to the film besides being the reason for the search. She is good for what she does, but her character does not feel complete. I can only hope this too, was something that got cut.<br/><br/>The film succeeds however, in astonishingly detailed style, in its set design and visual effects. They are just totally awe-inspiring, and so totally unique. It is quite the trip, and it never lets up in any case. The colours used are just totally out of this world. Every single visual spec is more than a treat for the audience. It guides them through this totally flawed movie, and is visually appetizing. If I continued watching for any reason (or recommended this to anyone), it was because of just how much effort was obviously used in bringing Aronofsky's vision to life. He clearly is very vivid and imaginative, and his film benefits as a result. It all feels so fluid and so real, even at its most overt-the-top moments. It really breathes life into how biblically and epically laden the film is, and suggests just how much greater it could have been if it was shown in its originally conceived form.<br/><br/>Although it is heavily flawed, The Fountain works as a beautiful case of visual direction. Aronofsky clearly was far too ambitious with this third project of his. If he dug a little deeper into his original screenplay, I think he could have made this compromise a whole lot more watchable than it is.<br/><br/>6.5/10."

","I think, after reading many of the IMDb user comments, that many people do not know how to rate a movie. You do not rate a movie on how you thought it should have been, or by the level of understanding you have of it.<br/><br/>Many people simply give a low rating if they do not immediately ""get"" a film. Quite a shame... If you do not understand something it does not immediately make it bad, or good for that matter, but it certainly should not warrant a poor rating... an educated rating is a good one whether it be a 1 or a 10.<br/><br/>The Fountain is one of the most thought provoking (and beautiful) movies that we will ever see. The attention to detail along with the use of light and sound make the sensory portion of the film almost as astonishing as the story (which can be interpreted many many ways, which is its beauty) ######## For those that rated this film a 1, I think that it says more towards that person, than to the quality the film. ##########"

"Loredon","10","0","3","17 April 2007"," A brilliant film, but not for everyone.
","The Fountain is a movie that chronicles three parallel story lines that span a thousand years.<br/><br/>It is my firm belief that this is the greatest work of film art produced since Stanley Kubrick's 2001, or maybe even Orson Welles Citizen Kane. That being said if you are not a knowledgeable film viewer and are looking to be purely entertained, do not see this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is primarily told through images. Through a series of very structured and recurrent symbols the movie weaves an intricate syntax that it uses to tell the story like no other movie I have ever seen. The cinematography is second to none. The way the shot is framed and placed is as much used to tell the story as the actual progression itself. The editing between shots is flawless and meaningful. All the technical and directorial aspects of this film fuse with Aronofsky's script to convey a wide variety of themes as well as, not one, but three coherent story lines. While utilizing filming technique's that disregard traditional horizontal shot structure, Aronofsky uses a primarily depth oriented and vertical shot structure with great skill. His vaunted non CGI special effects that he used to cut the budget of the film by almost thirty million dollars are seamless. The sound track composed by Aronofsky's longtime cohort Clint Mansell is beautifully rendered. Performed by the virtuoso Kronos Quartet, the music serves to enhance the symbolism of the movie making something very much akin to an aural narrative. The theme's in this movie convey a magnitude that has not been attempted since metaphysical poetry was in vogue in the late 16th early 17th century.<br/><br/>The acting is equally superb. Every member of the cast delivers and does their job. Aronofsky has a reputation for being exceptionally demanding of his actors, yet the performances that he captures are well worth whatever he has them go through. Hugh Jackman is at his best, he delivers a performance of total realism and honesty. This movie cements in my mind the fact that Jackman is one of the next great actors. Rachel Weisz is nearly beatific, though not quite as powerful as Jackman, in her role. She does exactly what the role required of her.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely not for everyone. However, if you are in the mood for an intelligent, critical, and moving piece of art, this is the movie for you."
"sirwootalot","10","0","1","15 April 2007"," Beautiful beyond compare, in every respect.
","The Fountain, despite being a richly gorgeous poem-like experience, is NOT a movie for everyone. I guarantee that you will not fully appreciate this film unless you are completely willing to open up your mind all the way, put on your thinking cap, and contemplate the message rather than question the prose. All too often, one expects a movie to do the thinking for them; and The Fountain completely reverses this trend in more than one respect (On that note, please read one of the plot summaries before reading this review - I'm not going to summarize the film for you; I'm only reviewing it :P). The entire movie shares this exact same theme perfectly: the cycle of life and death, and how we as humans both revel in the beauty of the former and languish in the inevitability of the latter. This is more an experience than a movie - more art than entertainment, more poetry than plot. The Fountain, like all three ""toms"", is transcending common logic in an attempt to save itself from inevitability - while at first the three stories are jumbled and possibly even random to some, in the end it all becomes sequential and perfectly connected. The music, like the film, is festering with suppressed fears. Like every other aspect, it fits both the theme and the mood perfectly. My greatest passions are photography, computer graphics, and science; when I first heard of this movie in 2005, it was on a Digital Art website. The article was explaining the cinematography during the ""future"" sequence - how it had no CGI whatsoever and was generated by filming chemical reactions on microscopic scales. Having witnessed reactions through a microscope myself and experiencing a ""god"" moment because of it, I was all a sudden struck both by my memory of the experience and the sheer ingenuity of using one of nature's most beautiful phenomena in lieu of a 50-man crew of Photoshop and MAYA geeks. Oh, and it also helped that I'm a massive fan of Aronofsky's other two films, which I won't delve into now. The main melody, played on guitar but sounding almost like a piano, seems like an anthem to both hope and despair simultaneously. The strings in the background invoke all three settings as well as all the anticipation and nostalgia present in Tom. In short, the score is an absolute masterpiece, and is a perfect companion to the film in every respect.<br/><br/>To put my review in summation, The Fountain is a film where all elements you can possibly imagine - score, cinematography, acting - blend perfectly together. Everything fits everything within this mesmerizing portrait, and because of that, I find The Fountain to be a masterpiece of our generation. I can only hope that it will someday gain the recognition it deserves, overcoming the commercial flop and critical injustice it was given by the general public as so many other masterpieces before it have done."
"t1000-7","10","0","1","14 April 2007"," One of the finest films of the last 20 years
","I don't usually leave comments here, however, after seeing this film and reading the reviews (which were mostly negative) I felt compelled to leave comment.<br/><br/>I can see reasons why this film would divide both audiences and critics, however, to my mind this is one of the finest films of the last 20 years.<br/><br/>The film contains what appears to be three stories, although looking deeper there is really only one story, involving the main character; played by Hugh Jackman struggling to come to terms with the death of his wife. The stories are set in the year 1500, present time, and 'sometime in the future' (possibly perhaps the year 5000).<br/><br/>This film contains some of the most breathtaking scenes ever committed to film, and one scene in particular where the main character finally resigns to his loss that might be one of the most beautiful sequences ever committed to film (Death is the Road to Awe) that literally made my jaw drop and caused me to weep like a baby - those who have seen it will know what I mean.<br/><br/>I rushed out and bought the soundtrack the other day - first time I've done that in five years.<br/><br/>A masterpiece."
"saarvardi","10","0","2","13 April 2007"," The Fountain fills you with life and emotion and doesn't leave you apathetic in your seat
","Welcome to the lucid, dreamy, drugged up world of Darren Aronofsky. If you've seen Requiem for a Dream and/or Pi, welcome back. Aronofsky's world is a creepy place to be in if you're not in the right mood, so my first advice would be to just let go. The Fountain is told in a non-linear, rarely coherent manner. Like Requiem, it jumps from sequence to sequence like a rushed up video clip, shows you the lowest depths of human nature – but unlike its predecessor, it also has an upside in tempo, in the final, somewhat optimistic message, and in general feel.<br/><br/>Without getting too much into details (it would just ruin the whole thing), i'll sum the plot up by saying it deals with a love story that spans over 1,000 years (the first occurring somewhere circa 1,500 a.d., the last around 2,500 a.d. and the main one told in current time). In the main arc, Hugh Jackman plays a tortured doctor seeking treatment to his ill wife's sickness (Academy Award winning actress Rachel Weisz), and finding a possible cure in the form of the mythological fountain of youth. Throughout the various plots, it is evident that our protagonist is not willing to give up his love without a vicious, courageous struggle against death and eternity. The final build up is also very satisfying, as Aronofsky makes his way toward the ending in a similar crescendo fashion with which Requiem for a Dream ended as well. Unlike the latter, The Fountain actually ends with something good to ponder about. It fills you with life and emotion and doesn't leave you apathetic in your seat. It's the greatest affect a movie can have on you. The Fountain delivers the goods."
"azey","10","0","1","11 April 2007"," An anti-Christian interpretation of The Fountain
","This late review (the movie have only just arrived in Danish theaters) takes focus on why I believe ""The Fountain"" have an anti-Christian message, and why I therefore believe it to be one of the most beautiful stories ever seen on the big screen. Enough is already said about the acting, musical score and special effects - they are all superb and completes the experience, but to me not the essential part of the movie. My eyes moisten with the pure beauty of - not just the love story between man and woman - but the story of the love of life itself. And at the same time I claim it to be anti-Christian - here is why:<br/><br/>Izzi is clearly fascinated by the myths of the old Mayan culture. The more she studies, the more of it she is applying to her own life. The crucial part is, where she tells about the underworld Xibalba, and death being the road to awe. You may want to note that there is no talk of an afterlife in Xibalba, but simply a place, where the soul go to die. The only afterlife-like part is the story of the seed growing upon the grave, and the bird eating the fruit. In other words, not an afterlife, but the life of those who comes after (trees, birds and eventually other humans). When Izzi reaches this conclusion, she finds herself ready to meet her upcoming death with peace, because life (of others) will continue. We live on in the memory of our children, so to speak - that is the ""road to awe"". It also explains her spontaneous and vitalized way of living, and why Tom is miserable. She continuously tries to make him understand her discovery, but he is busy trying to literally kill death, and therefore unable to live and to listen. I see that as an obvious message to the way of life in the Western world. We try so hard to extend life that we end up making the search replace living itself.<br/><br/>So naturally she is letting her story (the fountain) follow her newly-found revelation. Important is it to note that the representatives of the Christian faith in her story - both the Inquisitor and Queen Isabel - are striving for the Tree of Life as a way of gaining political power. A pursuit they both are failing. The way the Inquisitor is portrayed is quite clear - that part of Christianity have lost appeal many years ago, if it ever had one - but the failing of the benevolent Queen is revealed only at the very end, where the Conquistador fatally drinks the sap of the tree. Obviously, there will not be any eternal life for the Christians, simply because the myth of the Tree of Life from older religions (like the Mayan) is misunderstood in the biblical version. So my point is, that Christianity looses, because of its selfish search for power and salvation. Whereas the Mayan belief is beautiful, altruistic and selfless - Life is a one-time deal only. Live your life in the moment and your death will provide the basis for birth of future life.<br/><br/>Conclusively Tom Creo is getting the big picture, ironically after Izzi's death. The moment it happens is when, he realizes: ""I am going to die"". To no surprise, this comment is making (dream)Izzi smile. Simply because she is happy for him, now able to understand what she have tried to explain to him. He comes to peace with the fact that he one day will die too, and this isn't a tragedy, but the road to awe (and therefore he can turn his back on the laboratory and follow Izzi to a walk in the snow instead). At the same time he is now able to finish the book (the fountain). He has come to realize how the story must end. Izzi has started it in a setting 500 years earlier, so Tom can appropriately end it 500 years from now in the future. Ascending in his bubble, he is ultimately preparing to reach Xibalba - peace fills him. Upon arrival, his soul reaches its destination, and finally pulverizes to stardust. This is his ending of the book ""the fountain"", but we, the audience, is left to imagine the ending of his real life, when we leave him planting the seed on Izzi's grave."
"crazyoddygal","10","0","1","7 April 2007"," ... A strange flower whose fragrance raises quiet and personal feelings ...
","Two of us step into the cinema room, find the seats and lean our tired heads against the soft chairs, with the daily worries spinning all over. Then, the screen flashes and the whole world is suddenly left behind. ""The Fountain,"" a newly-released American film by Darren Aronofsky, opens in front of us another world, another dimension of time, love and death. There is a unique combination of unusual storytelling, meaningful messages, stunning visuals and brilliant performance of the cast that will leave unforgettable impressions on any audience's mind.<br/><br/>The storyline of the film is built upon three stories. They develop side by side, blend into each other and blur the border between imagination and reality. In one story, Tom, a devoted doctor and scientist, is carrying out research to cure brain tumor, the illness which is killing his wife day after day. In another story, a courageous and loyal conquistador is going on a perilous journey to find the tree of life so that he can save his country and his Queen. The other one features a futuristic man by a dying tree, heading for the star and expecting a revival. The flow of the film is the continuous and clever switches between the three stories, three contexts, and three fates, and the existence of one in another.<br/><br/>Such serious reflection on an abstract issue may sound a bit tiring. Yet, there is another side that helps ""soften"" the atmosphere: the message of the love that extends beyond time and death. The desperation of Tommy in his search for a cure to his wife's illness, his claim ""Death is a disease, it's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure - and I will find it,"" his whisper in the night to her: ""Everything's alright,"" and his whisper to himself after she's gone ""All these years, all these memories, there was you. You pull me through time"" keep lingering in our mind long after the last scene fades out. Depicted as timeless and haunting, this love can stir deep sympathy and admiration.<br/><br/>Apart from the content, one of the most impressive features that strike audience from the very beginning scenes is the brilliant visual effects, amazingly, created on a low budget. The whole movie is bathed in a warm yellow color nearly similar to pure gold, which provokes the feelings of medieval noble royalty, present-day unobtrusive coziness and circa-2500 dazzling supernaturalness at the same time. Through out 96 minutes of imposing images, the three story lines are built up separately yet connectively partly thanks to this unique golden color which leaves a solid impression on viewers' minds no matter when and where it appears. Sean Chavel from cinecon.com has no other word to describe Director Aronofsky than ""a visual poet,"" who can make such a wonderful combination between stunning visual images and metaphysical music ""to communicate all of his artistic ideas."" It seems that every frame of ""The Fountain"" was carefully planned out. There is not a camera move made without purpose; every trivial detail, from a breath on the neck to engraved marks on a dagger, can mean the world. This tactic leads the viewers through surprise after surprise, and grants us the enjoyment of discovering the truth hidden behind the appearance. Undoubtedly, it is always a delight to watch a movie from a director who understands his vision so thoroughly and has the talent to go about achieving it.<br/><br/>It will be a big mistake if the endeavour of the main actor Hugh Jackman and main actress Rachel Weisz is not mentioned as a great contribution to the success of the movie. The hero and heroine have dedicated all their outstanding acting talent and appreciable effort to make ""The Fountain"" an unforgettable experience for the viewers. During the pre-production period of this film, Jackman and Weisz tried to do a lot of research in many hospices and met patients who were dying at a tragically early age in order to have a clear understanding of what their fictional characters have to suffer from. As a result, the depth of Jackman's three characters and his portrayal of each is such a rich and fascinating performance which can outdo that of nearly any other actor in 2006 (Jackman is nominated for the 2006 Saturn Award's Best Actor). The genuine and flexible nature of the Oscar-winning Rachel Weisz was another crowning attainment that built upon the excellence of the film. Director Aronofsky cannot save his compliments for the couple: ""This film would not be possible without Hugh because technically and emotionally he's just so good. It's just hard to believe how good he is. [...] And Rachel is absolutely splendid in the film. [...] Those others weren't meant to be in the film, Hugh and Rachel were. In the end I couldn't be happier about having them.""<br/><br/>In the grassland of expensive films with extensive sensations or actions, or both, ""The Fountain"" is like a strange flower whose fragrance raises quiet and personal feelings. Truly, the film is of the kind that should be ""viewed"" by individual impression rather than logical reasoning. Any attempts to clarify all details and come up with a definite storyline or message will not be very rewarding. Instead, besides dazzling visual and excellent acting, the beauty of this movie lies in the uncertainty that each one can interpret in a different way. So, whatever we have said, do not believe us completely. Please come and experience it yourself."
"jon2005","9","0","1","4 April 2007"," The Fountain
","When watching The Fountain one realises that there really is nothing like it. The closest relative to Darren Aronofsky's latest film would probably be 2001: A Space Odyssey. But whereas 2001 deals with issues like technology, evolution, the universe, and pretty much everything, The Fountain feels more down to earth because it deals with more personal, though no less expansive, issues: death, and love. It's because it deals with these topics on an individual level that The Fountain is a more effective film at provoking emotions and truly makes you think about the nature of love and life, whereas 2001 distances itself because of it's scale; it tries too hard to be an all-encompassing epic. The Fountain is not as epic as it first appears, but is a very intense and personal film.<br/><br/>The film's cast is small, centring on the two leads in three time periods. A 15th century conquistador (Jackman) is on a mission for the Queen of Spain (Weisz) in the Mayan jungle, searching for the Tree of Life, as presented in a book that Izzi (still Weisz) is writing in the present day for her husband, Tommy (Jackman). Tommy is desperately trying to save Izzi from the cancer that is slowly killing her, just as in the future, Tom (Jackman again) is trying to save the Tree of Life by regenerating it in the heart of a dying star.<br/><br/>The film will raise debates as to its true meaning for a long while to come, each section being dissected as theories are put across  what is real? Are they the same people?  but to concern yourself too much with that during the film will make you miss the beauty of what you are watching. The three time periods are referenced nicely in the film's visual flair  the candles in the Queen's throne room looking like the stars outside the future Tom's bubble ship  and the film's cinematography is nothing short of outstanding. Using micro-photography of chemical reactions in Petri dishes as inspiration for the special effects produces some fantastic imagery, and combining this with another of Clint Mansell's beautiful scores allows the viewer to literally float through the film, allowing it to absorb into us. <br/><br/>Providing the performance of his career, Hugh Jackman is an unexpected though absolutely perfect choice to portray the obsession that all three Tom's go through, each on their mission to cheat death. Tearing through the first four stages of grief  denial, anger, bargaining, depression  whilst Izzi has already reached acceptance could potentially make Tom a character to dislike rather than support, but Jackman's performance instead makes us truly feel for him, trying obsessively to cheat death and find a way to keep Izzi alive. Rachel Weisz also proves a fine choice to bring out the seemingly one-dimensional character of Izzi/Isabel and gives her a life in death that centres the film. Together they gel so well, making the missions of all three Tom's both believable and necessary. <br/><br/>The Fountain does not provide us with all the answers  if indeed there are any answers to satisfy on the subjects of love and death  and that is absolutely the point; each viewer will get what they want out of it, whether they see the simple love story at its centre, or the larger picture that surrounds it. The Fountain is an experience, one that needs to be explored rather than explained, and in sheer power of emotion is easily one of the finest experiences that can be seen on the big screen  and it needs to be seen on the big screen, if only because it allows the viewer to absorb it fully, and be engrossed in the atmosphere. It's one of the most beautiful and thought provoking films one is likely to find this year.<br/><br/>Rated: 9/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

","Given the seemingly mixed reactions to this film, I am totally aware that some people simply do not ""get"" it. Just because I am aware of their distaste for this film doesn't mean I understand it, because I believe that The Fountain is nothing short of a masterwork.<br/><br/>For those with open minds and hearts, The Fountain is quite a moving film, visually and emotionally. Darren Aronofsky, the director, created a multi-layered picture that works on all levels. The trailers were, I admit, a bit misleading, showing this as a bit more of an epic. Don't get me wrong, the scope of the movie is breathtaking in every way, filled with imagery that stands among the greatest and most powerful in recent memory. However, the heart of the film is a love story.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman gives a phenomenal performance as a tortured soul desperately seeking a cure for his wife, played by Rachel Weisz with beautiful subtlety. The stories they tell, through their many facets and details, are emotionally gripping and monstrously heartbreaking. The film's conclusion, bringing everything together, is powerful enough to leave you sitting stupefied through the entire credits.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the film is easy to interpret. Everyone has their own opinions on what exactly happened, so needless to say that some will be turned off by that aspect.<br/><br/>But don't let that turn you away from seeing it. Though the film bombed commercially and was robbed of any awards (score and cinematography being the most obvious omissions in award show nominees), I believe The Fountain remains one of the best films of 2006. For those who believe, this film is not one that you will soon forget. It's an unprecedented visual and emotional masterpiece."

","First, let me say the following: The Fountain is not a film; it is an experience. A thought, feeling, or idea. It is a very personal and emotional trip. Each person will have different feelings and ideas towards the film.<br/><br/>The plot isn't the main focus of the film, but here's a brief overview. Around the year 1500, Spain is being torn apart from the inside. A religious zealot figure is hunting down those who do not believe what he does throughout the country. It leads him to Queen Isabel (Rachel Weisz), a beautiful and gorgeous young ruler who ""twists the words of God."" Isabel, fearing for her country and the lives of her people, sends for Tomas (Hugh Jackman), a strong warrior, to search for the Tree of Life. Whether or not this tree actually exists is up for question, yet the Queen sends him on this quest.<br/><br/>In the present time, veterinarian Tommy Creo (Jackman) is searching for a cure to brain tumors. He wishes to use this information and translate it to help his sick wife, Izzi (Weisz). Tommy becomes completely engulfed in his work and often neglects (though not on purpose) his dying wife. Izzi is writing a novel entitled The Fountain, for which she does not have an ending for yet. She is enthralled by ancient Mayan civilization, mainly Xibalba, the Mayan underworld seen in the stars as a dying nebula.<br/><br/>The distant future holds for Tom (Jackman) years of travel to Xibalba. He travels with a tree, eating from it's bark to keep alive. The fly through the stars in a bubble housing the two of them. Tom often has illusions of both Izzi and Isabel, talking to him as if he were either Tommy or Tomas. He wishes to reach Xibalba in order for the tree to be reborn.<br/><br/>That's the best I could do giving a plot summary. Like I said, the plot is not the main concern of the film it only serves as a vehicle to deliver the intense emotions and feelings present in the film.<br/><br/>I'll start with the technical aspects. The film's cinematography is gorgeous, taking in both the ancient Mayan architecture, the modern winter wonderland, and the far reaches of space. The films visual and special effects are by far the best I've ever seen in a film. The filmmakers used an unconventional means in creating the space FX they filmed different specimens under microscopes and used those as the space FX, keeping the organic feeling to the film. I promise you, it's like nothing you've ever seen before. I really really hope that an Oscar nomination is given out.<br/><br/>The score is really one of the highest attributes of the film. Clint Mansell, along with Mogwai and the Kronos Quartet, has done a phenomenal job. The music is brilliant and really reflects what they characters are going through as well as what emotions you are feeling at that time. Mansell really deserves the Golden Globe, and I pray for an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The acting is spot on. Jackman and Weisz give great performances and really know what they are dealing with. The bath tub scene is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, just because of the emotions these two feel. (The other two scenes are spoiler heavy, so I'll leave them for you to see).<br/><br/>The climax of the film is one of the most stunning things I have ever seen in cinema.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has really evolved into quite a stunning filmmaker. He's even matured in his process. But I'm not calling Pi or Requiem for a Dream immature by any means. What I mean is that Aronofsky has created such a somber and serious tone he's really reached a new level in his directing. Some of his quirks are present, but aside from a few scenes (and two recognizable Aronofsky actors), this doesn't seem like an Aronofsky film. It's really a new standard he has set.<br/><br/>The Fountain is very similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of visuals, feelings, and the overall trip the viewer goes on. While 2001 was more focused on evolution, creation, and humanity, The Fountain focuses on love, life, and death as a means of creation. I'm sure that in the near future many people will be comparing Aronofsky to Stanely Kubrick.<br/><br/>If I could, I would rate this movie higher than a ten. Sadly, I cannot do so."
"ghent1","9","0","1","8 March 2007"," Spirituality
","Let me introduce myself. I am one of the relatively few people in the West that is and has been for years, deeply fascinated with true spirituality, meaning the impulse to solve the riddle of Life. All great Masters that have solved that riddle (spanning from Rama, over Krishna, Buddha, Zarathustra, Plato, Christ to modern Masters) agree that the core of the ""riddle of Life"" or call it Karma, is the fear of Life, and the fear of death that is part of that. THe ""ego"", being the Seeker all talk about, is the problem of Life, the one to be surmounted, and not the one to be taken for granted. The ego fears death and life and therefore does not reach full potential within. While watching this film I wondered if people who are not immersed in all this can truly understand the depth and true message of the film. To begin with, there are NOT three stories, but only two. The supposed third one, where the main Seeker sits next to the three in a sort of floating world is not a separate ""story"". That is what Masters call the Higher Self, or the Soul or whatever you call it, the timeless part of all of us sitting next to the tree of Life trying to solve its apparent health problem. THe two concrete stories in historical time are the Lower self, the ego, trying to solve in real time this same riddle of Life, being the same being. Each life on earth he is stuck on the same problem, but in different historical settings and different nuances, but with the same people. That is the Law of Kharma. ONly when he discovers that to Live you must let go and stop fearing and searching does he find the solution and his higher self is freed, and manifests also on earth. At that time it becomes clear that there is no difference between him and the tree of Life and that the reason why the tree was ill was precisely that the character did not understand that he WAS/IS the tree, and that the problem to solve in order to make the tree healthy was/is his fear of the death of himself and of the tree, instead of looking for medicine outside of himself. When he becomes Enlightened and is absorbed in Life itself, only then the tree becomes alive by itself. THis is called Enlightenment, and with Christ for instance this was symbolized by the descent of the white dove on his head, when he reached Christ or enlightened consciousness. IN the end, to melt with Life, the ego disappears completely within the Master, only Life remains, there is no personality in the body anymore, just ""God"". In the film this is shown by the fact that de main character literally disappears and he becomes part of nature, in the physical sense. Maybe you don't believe in this sort of thing, but in my humble opinion, the director knows a lot about it and wanted to make this film testimony to this spiritual and timeless quest. A true masterpiece spiritually and also polemical. THis does of course not mean that my view of this film is the only one, or even the correct one. Besides that, as other noted, what beautiful camera-work, lighting, concept, acting etc. Truly a magnificent film!"

","This was the first film I saw with someone i've been waiting to meet for two and half years of communication across the world and eight hours ahead. I must say that it was a surprisingly good first film to watch. I have tried to determine what this film means to me and I find it difficult because i'm lost in the performance of the film and the gravity of who I was with.<br/><br/>If it is a love story then I think it does well to say that it shows a couple different aspects of love, fate and heroism that all couples wish to have. If the three story lines are tied to the same spirit of the Izzy and Tommy then we have the idea that fate has destined us to be with someone forever, in some aspect. But they are not together forever as death separates them in all three stories. What if fate is destined for us to find someone to be with forever? It is powerful to me because I think like many aspects of our life we can't control how we feel. We can't control the nature of life and the plans that fate may have for us but we can control how we act. Thomas loves his Queen, Tommy loves his wife and he will stop at nothing if he can help it to be with her forever.<br/><br/>To me this film is the enduring love that one person can have for someone else and never wanting to be away from that love. Never wanting that person to know the pain of being out of love from you.<br/><br/>Hugh does a fantastic job with his character and the obsession he had with fighting the loss he was afraid to deal with. Much like the fear we all have of death in many aspects it wasn't his death he was mortified with. He was so driven and it showed in his role as the doctor. Rachel did an alright job as Izzy but I haven't been overly fond of her performances. As a couple it was hard to see the chemistry because they were not often together on screen. In the few short moments they were I was hoping to see the love they shared and the best I saw it was in the bath scene when he showed is care for her life, her comfort and happiness. But still it was fueled with his obsession to cure her.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Darren Aronofskys Requiem for a Dream. As much as I didn't like the reality of the film because it was horrific to watch it was a brilliantly done film. I look forward to his future films. I also congratulate the actors for their part and generosity."

","how this movie never got any nominations is beyond me simply one of the best movies I've ever seen. Aronofski was once again at his best in this movie, and there was not an aspect of the film that lacks in any category. Even though it is more of an ""artsy"" film, if one wishes to concentrate enough on the storyline, then it is really enjoyable, and probably not a movie for anybody not willing to pay attention during the film. This movie literally had me thinking about it for days after seeing it, and I am in shocked in the amount of people who have not only not seen this film, but have not even heard of it. Unfortunately the academy does not want to promote these types of films, and one can only wonder if Aronofski has the patience to do another masterpiece without getting recognition for his work"

","A visual feast of stunning imagery...captivating and clever, beautiful and intense; full of mystery and dreamlike metaphors - i loved it! If you are an artist you will be inspired by this movie. I am looking forward to watching it again<br/><br/>The director grapples with life's great mysteries, suffering and death, in such a refreshing way. And just like suffering and death it doesn't always make sense. <br/><br/>My take on the movie: the 'present' story is straight forward, its the real part of the story . The historical story was Izzi's metaphor for how she was dealing with her sickness. The future story was a little hard to work out but i think it was Tom's journey, his way of dealing with his wife's death. The message for me was no matter how far into the future you go trying to cure suffering it will always be with us. The way to resolve it is to celebrate the moments we have and know when to let go. This was shown towards the end of the movie when Tom decided to go for a walk in the snow with her, and give up on the cure.<br/><br/>We can be so busy trying to work out the cure for life(or death) we miss out living it... 'enjoy the journey'."

","You know, I was disappointed as others were. This film was creative and inspiring yes, but it just wasn't what I thought it would be. It did have very interesting views on the cycle of life and such, but a let down none the less. The way it was written and portrayed was very entertaining and all.... But there's something I didn't like. When I had first heard of this movie being in production I was immediately fascinated. I thought it would be something I guess, more simple. Such as they live in the past and find the fountain, drink from it and live for years. Only in the future she develops a brain tumor and the fountain can't save her that type of thing. I'm probably ignorant for wishing it was that simple, but what can you do. All in all it was a great love story about life and death."

","What I liked most about this film is its intense spirituality, fantastic cinematography, moving soundtrack and Tree of Life mythology, which is also historically accurate! <br/><br/>The film is essentially divided into two stories, one happening in the real world, and the other coming to life though the imagination of the author. I enjoyed the story within a story approach! It's refreshing!<br/><br/>I also like brave movies, which are dreamlike and leave much to the imagination, like 2001: A Space Odyssey. The cinematography is rich and inventive. I think the great surrealists, like Salvadore Dali, would have greatly enjoyed this film! <br/><br/>Oh, and the music still pulsates through my soul as I write this review! It reaches deep, and I'm adding the soundtrack to my collection. The music is so magnificent, I feel it's the best part of the entire movie! It deserves an Oscar nomination! <br/><br/>I was also deeply moved by the Tree of Life theme that runs through the entire movie. It so enchanted me that I did some research. Not only is The Tree of Life a part of the rich mythology from the Judeo-Christian tradition, it is also a significant aspect of the ancient Mayan culture! I find that absolutely fascinating, so much so, that I purchased a very obscure video documentary, ""Tree Of Life,"" directed by Bruce Lane!!<br/><br/>While it would be very easy to criticize this unique film for it's various shortcomings, I much rather concentrate on its many strengths.

Pieces of one story would follow into the next and I would think, ""Oh, this must be the same guy."" A tattoo carries over from story 2 into story 3. A nickname for a character in story one is used in story 2. At the same time though, there are character transitions between the stories that would make it impossible for one character to be the same person in the next.

"megwelchdendlercs","8","0","1","6 February 2007"," Searching for Eternal Life
","Death as an act of creation and new birth. Death as the road to awe. Life that is eternal and immortality that already exists. Not themes you generally find going on in a major motion picture with A-list box office stars leading the way, but this love child of writer/director Darren Aronofsky hits them all and then some. It is spiritually significant cinema at its most beautiful, most touching, and most thought-provoking. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman (Tom) and Rachel Weisz (Izzi) take us through the death process asking the time-old questions about life and death. Is this human life all that there is? How hard should we fight to continue living in a mortal body? Is death to be feared or is it just another step on an eternal journey? Biblical themes of Adam and Eve, the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Life, and the Maya creation legends of The First Father who gave his life to create the world are interwoven throughout the three different but inexorably linked story lines. It may be a tad confusing for the inexperienced in spiritual cinema, but for those ready for the challenge it is an amazing adventure. <br/><br/>I've never bought into the idea that death is like a proverbial ax falling  that God is waiting to pass judgment on us and consign us to heaven or hell based on our spiritual understanding at that second, or our deeds in life up to that moment. I know many religions teach this and that Jesus talks about those things in the Gospels. But most of what Jesus taught about was in figurative language, and I believe that is what he was doing there too. <br/><br/>And who knows how those teachings have been warped over the centuries through mistranslations and purposes of creed and doctrine? Whole books have been written about that. My leanings are more toward Jesus' teachings about eternal life. It isn't heaven or hell ... it's just more. <br/><br/>I've heard it said that death is not the experience of the person, just the conclusion of the onlooker. Those still standing in the human experience of life find what they knew of as that person to be gone. But the spiritual reality of the situation is that their friend or family member is just as busy going forward with their life as they were when we could see what they were up to. <br/><br/>There's an amazing little article called ""The Passing of the Seagull,"" originally published in the Christian Science Monitor newspaper in 1927. It equates death with watching a seagull fly effortlessly through the sky until it passes from our line of vision. It is no longer part of our life-experience, but nothing has changed for that seagull. It is soaring on and on  even though our limited sense of material vision cannot follow it. <br/><br/>Under the marginal heading ""true life eternal,"" spiritual writer Mary Baker Eddy says: ""Life is eternal. We should find this out, and begin the demonstration thereof. Life and goodness are immortal. Let us then shape our views of existence into loveliness, freshness, and continuity, rather than into age and blight."" (""Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,"" p. 246) <br/><br/>While I, with Weisz's Izzi, am not interested in dying tomorrow, I don't fear it in the slightest. God is not waiting to take me. Life is already one with God. I don't need to go anywhere to get closer to divine Love. <br/><br/>Just turning the corner on 40 next month, I would fight valiantly for more years here, but I have no interest in being injected with anything or consuming anything that will continue life in this human experience eternally. My purpose in life is to do good and learn the spiritual lessons that will continue to bless me on my eternal life journey. This continuing nature of spiritual life is what Jackman's Tom is struggling with (at an Oscar-worthy level)  and what we all wrestle with in our own way from time to time. <br/><br/>Metaphysically, spiritually speaking, human life is nothing more than a dream that we create with our own thoughts, and someday we will believe that we pass out of this dream through death. But then we will find that the spiritual truths of the universe and our divine existence as God's children have remained untouched. <br/><br/>Then another adventure begins, and hopefully we have matured and progressed  gained grace, as ""The Fountain"" says  enough to move forward into more light and harmony than we find in this mortal dream. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if Darren Aronofsky would agree with me on all that, but I left his movie thinking that he just might. Again, this is not a movie for cinematic sissies. Leave the teenagers at home, unless they are already pretty advanced in their spiritual journey or you are ready to do some explaining during and after this movie. But if you look forward to films that will challenge you to think and explore the nature of life and your place in the universe, don't miss seeing this on the big screen in all of its glory. <br/><br/>Don't try to analyze this film or overthink it. It's not important what every single specific moment represents (though I can't wait to watch the DVD with Aronofsky's commentary on). Just let it flow over your consciousness and see what questions it brings up for you. That's the joy of truly spiritually significant cinema."
"thoms_shane-1","10","0","1","5 February 2007"," Discover the metaphors for yourself...spoilers in here
","From a personal perspective, I interpreted The Fountain as ""the mortal acceptance/non acceptance of death"". Its a very difficult idea to develop as a watchable narrative/screenplay because we live in a world of man made religions with so many different after life ideas. This probably subconsciously upsets people because it tampers with their own systems of belief or, for others, terrifies them because they realise that every human, including themselves, will inevitably die (its surprising how many humans actually feel that they are immortal). The film involves Tomas, a doctor/scientist who's wife is dying of a brain tumor. He cannot accept the fact that she is dying and is certain that he can find a cure for her tumor. At first, his wife is frightened at the fact that she is dying, so she begins writing a book about a search for the tree of life and the fountain of youth (a metaphor for her husbands search for a cure for her tumor). Accepting her death, she gives the book to Tomas and asks him to finish writing the story. There are so many metaphors in this film (the loss of his wedding ring, the planting of the seed at his wife's grave, his tattoos), to be interpreted by ones own inquiring mind. I thought it was beautiful nonetheless, both visually and audial. As another reviewer stated, if you are frightened of dying, then perhaps give this one a miss. If you are comfortable with questioning your existence and your mortality, give it a go and enjoy this amazing film. I didn't exist before I was born...so I've been there before...there's nothing scary about going back to it....whatever it is."

It was sort of like The Neverending Story for adults without the tedious narrative.

","Some hate this movie. It happens these days when the ambitions of a filmmaker, in this case Darren Aronofsky soar above the crap that Hollywood poops out. H. Jackman portrays a medical researcher trying to stop a brain tumor from killing his wife (the lovely Rachel Weisz). He's also playing a sixteenth-century Spanish explorer on a quest for Queen Isabel (Weisz again) to discover the Tree of Life. And he plays a twenty-sixth-century astronaut. In telling a tale of love across time, Aronofsky is sometimes guilty of creating arty, pretentious psycho- silly stuff. But in aesthetic terms, he's trying to explore really raw stuff.

I actually think that it has been edited this way to make the audience think.<br/><br/>The acting is good, Hugh Jackman is good and Rachal Weisz is exceptional. The cinematography was good but unfortunately at times went slightly over the top.

","Should any husband be allowed to direct his wife in love scenes? (Apart from home video/DVDs with their questionable production values. ) If he's not explicit enough people shout ""cheat!"" If he's too explicit then one questions his own limit setting. That I guess was one of the dilemmas (but not the least) facing Daniel Aronowsky with his filming of his wife Rachel Weisz in his new film THE FOUNTAIN.<br/><br/>Daniel Aronowsky directs this multi leveled/ layered story of a tale of love and the quest for immortality through the ages; on a physical, scientific and spiritual level. It's set at the time of the conquistadors, the present day and in a timeless state. And if that sounds a little confusing, well that's because it is; until at least a good half hour into the film.<br/><br/>One gets the feeling that the editing process must have been a ""sturm und drang"" performance, with time changes, scene changes, reversals in time sequences all taking part. And the script is not as tight as it could be despite multiple revisions greater than a south African history textbook. This film has been a labour of love for him, it having first being proposed and worked on since the late '90's. Initially the Hugh Jackman role was to be played by Brad Pitt who pulled out at the last minute, causing the whole project to collapse. Cate Blanchett also pulled out, causing him to re-cast his wife in her role. I guess he just wanted someone he'd be sure wouldn't abandon him in the end. It's like his own FITZCARRALDO (8/10) So, after all that, did I like the film? Some of the set pieces were really quite beautiful, given the relatively small budget. And Hugh Jackman gives a pleasantly overwrought performance. Rachel Weisz, A Rhodes? graduate isn't really all that interesting in this- back to the old problem of directing family. And I would have loved to have seen more of Stephen McHattie who played the Chief Inquisitor. But I guess that will come with the deleted scenes, extra length special edition. Back to the over editing/ strange cuts that occurred throughout.<br/><br/>But overall, no. This isn't a film that is going to get me waiting fervently for the special edition DVD. . The film reminded me of SOLARIS(8/10) especially in the way it ambled through the space sequences in an almost zen-like trance. SOLARIS was also a film that initially didn't grab me by the short and curlies initially, but grew on me from a second viewing.<br/><br/>While I can't say I was too excited about it in toto, this is a film which will have its proponents and fierce opponents.

Flitting between three different periods in time spanning 1000 years,the film is mesmering from the opening sequence.At the outset,the film appears as fairly convoluted and confusing.However,once the film gets into its stride it is nothing less than totally gripping throughout.Aronofksy has created a truly unique piece of cinema in terms of vision,sound,characters, and a plethora of other attributes.The performances are spot on,with Hugh Jackman furthers his case for being a great actor with screen presence resembling a young Robert de Niro.The relationship feels real,and so draws you in and finds you giving yourself up to Darren Aronofsky's magnificent creation. A truly brilliant film that will leaves its indelible mark on you."
"peshawar6","9","0","1","29 January 2007"," Flawed Genius
","With this film, Aronovsky cements his reputation as America's most exciting new film-making talent.<br/><br/>Fountain is a flawed piece of work but pleasingly so. It is flawed through its sheer ambition, nearly (but not quite) biting off more than it can chew. There's quite a bit of digestion required though, especially at the end of the film. Not just by the audience, you can see that Aronovsky really racked his brains over the last 15 minutes as he tries to tie the story off. He succeeds...but only just. It doesn't have quite the arrogant, easy perfection of Requiem, but there's the same raw power, enhanced by the strain of a film-maker pushing his own talent to the limit, and if anything, moves up a notch on intellectual intensity.<br/><br/>His technical grasp is amazing, if you were impressed by Requiem, you're gonna be blown away here.<br/><br/>This is only his third major piece, but he's already in the company of the Jim Jarmuschs, Polanskis, and Wong Kar Wais.....and has a real chance of surpassing even those avant garde icons. Aronovsky's genius is breathtaking, precocious, and possibly unprecedented. If there's a filmmaker of greater genius...then I haven't come across him/her yet."
"colonel_green","10","0","1","28 January 2007"," My interpretation of events...
","From the first time I heard of it, I was very interested by the concept of Darren Aronofsky's ""The Fountain,"" starring Aronofsky's wife Rachel Weicz and Hugh Jackman. It has been receiving an extraordinarily mixed reaction from critics and audiences, and there seems to be very little middle ground. It is, truth be told, a bit pretentious, and (if my interpretation is correct) it's not saying anything new (it's the same basic idea as the moral of ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone""), but it's quite an impressive work of art. It is an interesting, poetic film, with a great performance from Hugh Jackman (Rachel Weicz's role is less substantial, as only in the 2000 segment is she given a real part, but she is also good).<br/><br/>Without having looked at any of the other theories that have been posted, this is my interpretation: the anchor story is the 2000 segment (although there's no specific dates given, other than in the trailer), about the quest for medical immortality. Thomas is looking for the medical ""fountain of youth/life"", while Izzie has found a kind of acceptance about death and the universe. The 1500 segment is her allegorical story about her life, with the last chapter left open for Thomas to write. In the 2000 segment, Thomas finds the medical fountain, but too late, and so he lives into the 2500 segment, traveling with the Mayan spirit-tree thing to the nebula. The tree dies, just as Izzie died right before the cure was found, and so he realizes the truth about death and the afterlife. The final section of the 1500 segment, which we see intercut with the finale in 2500, is Thomas' realization of how the last chapter of Izzie's book should be written.<br/><br/>My assumption through most of the film was that Tomas found the Tree of Life and he and Queen Isabella lived into the 2000 segment, at which point she became ill, since the Tree doesn't grant invulnerability; obviously, I changed this perception when Tomas turned into a flower bush.<br/><br/>The other interesting thing I noted was that the Grand Inquisitor's spiel about death was more or less correct; the characterization of the body as a ""prison"" doesn't really fit, but the idea of death freeing all souls is right.<br/><br/>I give it a 10 out of 10 as a work of art; it should be seen by people, even if many will not like it."

","Honestly speaking I was expecting either mystical, sci-fi style in which ""Pi"" was created or dramatic and brutal - as seen in ""Requiem for a Dream"".

"bopdog","6","0","4","27 January 2007"," Bold try... but ultimately rubbish. A tedious hash of a whinger with OCD
","I hesitate to criticise someone else's spiritual beliefs--- but I get the feeling that this movie was not about spiritual beliefs so much as crazed attachment. The hero can't let go of his wife. Does that echo the romantic attempts and psychological profiles of the director or the writer? Dunno. But the sentiment is very Rob McCuen, Leonard Nimoy-ish, for those of you who may have come across those two writers' attempts at love poetry and such in the late 1960s (Nimoy, famous as Spock in Star Trek, also wrote a very gooey romance novel). Maudlin to the point of mawkish.<br/><br/>Just so you're clear, I LIKE metaphysical movies. And I like boldness in movie making. For that, the director gets kudos. But the pay-off was really bad. The hero displayed a narcissistic OCD that was meant to be endearing and inspiring and loving--- but just came off as creepy, indulgent, and well--- just plain crazy. As a result, most of his histrionics were annoying, rather than moving. He was, by turns, always shouting, throwing things, slamming things, or crying.<br/><br/>But Hey--- what about that Rachel Weisz? is she HOT or what? The movie is almost worth the time just to see her for a couple of hours. But even so, better just go and rent 'The Mummy' and be satisfied with that.<br/><br/>If you're a seeker--- well, you won't find it here. If you're a romance fancier--- same deal--- nothing here. The FX were nice, and the monkey had character, but that's about it. Save your time and your dough, and do something else. I gave this a 6 out of 10 because of Rachel, the FX, and the monkey, and at least the movie tried. Otherwise, to have been unnecessarily cruel, it was more of a 3."

","First, let me mention that the Golden Globes finally did something right when they nominated this movie's soundtrack by Clint Mansell for Best Original Score.<br/><br/>It is possibly the very best score ever made!!! If you thought the Munich score was amazing, this will make it seem like a Paris Hilton single.<br/><br/>Cheers for Clint Mansell.<br/><br/>Secondly, the cinematography of this film was absolutely gorgeous, and again the awarder societies got it right by nominating this film for best cinematography.<br/><br/>However, the writing was problematic and the plot, at times, substance-less. I liked the disjointed chronology and the method by which the three stories were presented (two being real, one fictional) but the dialogue felt worthless to me. I couldn't help rolling my eyes at all the scenes with the Donovan researchers spewing their technical jargon. Rachel Weisz sucks in everything but Hugh Jackman was incredible.<br/><br/>I appreciated Aronofsky's attempt at Art. He understands that art has been lost and needs to come back to cinema, but he makes it too blaring and self-aware and doesn't let it speak for itself. This was the primary fault of the film.<br/><br/>A user above made the comment that this movie falls somewhere between ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Donnie Darko"" in terms of sophistication and complexity. I couldn't stop laughing after I read that comment, primarily because somehow this user managed to jumble ""Donnie Darko"" in the same bag as ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" 2001 is cinematic mastery in all aspects, Donnie Darko was a terrible experiment for teenagers. Learn to tell the difference please."
"lucasaq-1","8","0","1","22 January 2007"," A visual wonder.
","Darren Aronofsky's film is a visual wonder which much like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey leaves you to come to your own conclusions. Hugh Jackman stars as Tom, one man who basically has the same desire across the three periods that the film covers in the film. Rachel Weisz is his lover across all these. The focal point is the middle point which appears to be the reality.<br/><br/>The film opens with Tom as a Conquistador preparing for one last battle to get to the Tree of Life at the top of a Mayan Temple. His men abandon him at the last moment when they are ambushed by the Mayans guarding the temple. They are cut down by spears. Tom alone brazenly attacks the Mayans putting up a good fight before being cut down. But he is not killed. They force him to go up the steps of the temple to face their ""priest."" He slowly approaches the ""priest"" with a dagger that wasn't stripped from him in the struggle below. It doesn't help him as is stabbed in the stomach and falls to his knees. The film cuts from there as ""priest"" appears to cut him down with a blazing sword. Tom is now in space, in a bubble, flying through the stars. In the bubble is what appears to be the Tree of Life. He appears to meditating above it, floating. He cares for it and talks to it as if it were a living being, a close companion. He sees what appears to be a vision of Izzi, telling him to finish it. It is here that we cut to what appears to me to be the key point. We jump to the middle point which is modern times, or close to it. Tom is working at a desk and telling Izzi he is working on it. She leaves and just as Tom is going after her, he is called by a lab assistant to work on the patient. It is then revealed that he working on a cure for cancer, experimenting with monkeys. He is working vigorously on this because his wife, Izzi, has cancer and he refuses to lose her. ""Death is a disease. There is a cure. And I will find it."" This Tom declares.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman offers an amazing performance as Conquistador, doctor, and monk/spaceman in this film which spans centuries, but we are never really sure what is real. I could feel his characters anguish and frustration at not being able to help his wife and his growing obsession with finding the cure to death. Now I am not really sure who everything in the story connected, but I felt the growing point was about our inability to avoid death and that the greatest thing we can have on this earth at least according to this film is love. It is powerfully displayed visually in this film. It is a hard film to describe, but very much worth a viewing on the big screen. The score by Clint Mansell is incredible. The most memorable I have heard all year and the most beautiful. It captures the journey feel of the film.<br/><br/>The film is very much a heavy film if you were for its message and visual experience. It isn't a clear cut adventure film, but one which forces you to think. Based around the Biblical Tree of Life described in Genesis, I think it is one of the most original pieces of artistry I have seen in quite sometime, but definitely not for those looking for pure entertainment."

","(Contains spoilers about the ideas in film, which where the main event here, not what characters said or did) (I.e. DEFINITELY contains spoilers)<br/><br/>Aronofski certainly has made this movie a worthwhile 1+ (2?) hours, as there are some ideas you can grapple with for even some time after seeing the movie: There's the idea of being immortalized through a work of art - like a book. There's the idea of living forever as one universal life-force through biology (the metaphor in the movie about a tree growing on a human grave, thereby being fed by human organic remains). There's the idea of death simply being just another disease which we have not found cure against yet. And also, more in today's context, there's the message for war against cancer.<br/><br/>Probably more ideas to be found.<br/><br/>The ideas or rather background for ideas and idea-inklings were developed as the movie progressed and brought on stage in the finale. If one is to quibble, the finale lasted too long, but what the heck. The director sure took its time with the narrative, which was for most of the time good, the ideas were not rushed in for enjoyable rides sake.<br/><br/>The ideas, plot or the movie as a whole progressed in three dimensions: 1. our real world and present day(ish), 2. world of fiction, 3. some metaphysical parallel universe. Now if someone would like to explain whether the flying in space bubble bit was the future and actual space-ride, I'm all ears. <br/><br/>The acting was great, by mostly Hugh Jackman, simply phenomenal. Weisz was ordinary self and Stephen McHattie made a great religion-nut."

","This film runs 96 minutes but the viewing experience feels closer to 4 or 5 hours. In a good way. THE FOUNTAIN is a testament to storytelling and the power of it, the way that an auteur uses those around him to explain and explicate the unthinkable. The imagery, the emotions and the bridging of reality with imagination with surreality - it is all extremely well done. I could not have had higher expectations for this film. Aronofsky is a stand alone director of his generation, in a class of his own as he's created his own style in a matter of two extremely low budget films. Make no mistake by this film's 35M budget - it is an epic independent film. An indie in the sense that it is concerned more with its own passion and images than its adherences to any act structures or crowd-pleasing moments. It took him 6 years to make this movie, two casts and two different takes of the movie. It is based on his parents' having cancer, stars his wife as the heroe's wife, and the ""finish it"" mentality of the leads finishing a story-within-a-story that extends beyond their lives brilliantly parallels Aronofsky's overall undertaking of the film. It is no coincidence then, or maybe it's ironic one would say, that the let-down of the film is the same let-down that happens within the movie. You have to accept THE FOUNTAIN as it is, and it has to end like all other films do. It is not an easy movie to digest or simply love at first sight. Like its context, it will take future viewings and a lot of rumination. But like Hugh Jackman's character throughout, there is greater understanding and beauty within it."
"paraded_ignorance","10","0","1","15 January 2007"," The film all films should aspire to be
","I know it is trendy to say Citizen Kane is the best film of all time. I certainly agree that it is an amazing film, especially for the time, but a film made in 1941? is that the best we can come up with? (not that there is anything wrong with classics, but i refuse to believe that film has been downhill since) I made it my own personal goal to find a film that could replace Citizen Kane as the best film ever made. I strongly believe The Fountain is that film. It is not my favorite film, but certainly the best i've seen. Every element of the film, the lighting, the pacing, the dialogue, the acting, the music, the editing, composition, art direction, (everything) fit the film perfectly. Not once did i think that something was out of place, or not thought through enough. I understand why it wasn't critically acclaimed, or why it isn't getting any nominations. It was a dense and complex film, dealing with issues that i think make a lot of people uncomfortable and not all of it made perfect sense. But isn't that what a good film is? complex. repeated viewing offers new meaning and understanding, and perhaps most important of all it actually said something. Citizen Kane wasn't understood in its time, and i am willing to believe that the Fountain is the same way."

Instead it is somehow a pure science-fiction one but in the same sense as Space Odyssey was. Good story that is being told on several different levels - logical and spiritual at the same time. The story is one of those universal-truth-based, almost kind of those we are fed everyday by every ""big directors"" in their ""milestone pictures"" but it is told a nice and not invasive way so it works and do not fall to pompous style. And as I mentioned in the summary however it is a series o visions if you would like to analyse it from logical and mundane point of view it will work too. Which creates an impression than apart of creating those dreamy, artistic and spiritual visions the director and script writer did actually care for constructing the plot and even if they did not told us every aspect of their story the story has been thought through and none of the movie element were thrown into it without a reason. Worth of seeing, definitely, especially for true SF fans."

If there weren't so many other great performances this year, Hugh would have definitely gotten a GG nomination. Rachel Weisz is also great. Her role is a subtle one; she's not supposed to win an Oscar. She acts wonderfully; she's just not a difficult character.<br/><br/>Darren Arronofsky does a spectacular job. He wrote and directed the whole thing. The camera angles are beautiful done. A wonderfully shot film (not crappy camera direction like Constant Gardener). It's quite surprising Darren hasn't been nominated for a GG.<br/><br/>The score is brilliant; one of the best I've heard.<br/><br/>The way the story is told (3 time periods, 3 characters) is highly original. The plot is different from all the biographies, sequels, and pervy teen horrors out there. It has a great message. The 1st 15 minutes are a little freaky, but then it just sucks you in. Darren uses motifs, reappearing symbols, same camera angles to tie the story together. The symbols (light, looking up, ...) deepen the story.<br/><br/>The effects are done very well. This film takes a risk. It is different; it's ""arty"" and intelligent. It is pure poetry. My mother who only like romantic comedies (Pillow Talk, Something's Gotta Give, ...) highly enjoyed this, so you may like it too. Give it a chance. It is a drama; no comical relief whatsoever. If you are in an intelligent mood or wish to see a drama, this is the film for you. You'll hate it or love it.<br/><br/>This is a very useful comment.

The next two hours consisted of almost constant tears for the both of us, only I can't for the life of me explain why. Do you know that intangible feeling that you get from really beautiful, great songs that hit you deeply? That's what this film did. None of the dialog stands out in my memory, the cinematography and imagery were almost subliminal. Whether or not this had to do with my frame of mind or not, it was probably the most deeply affected I've ever been from a movie. ""The Fountain"" completely ripped me apart emotionally and I'm lost as to how.<br/><br/>I think Darren Aronofsky has done something beyond ""typical"" film-making at this point.

I guess, but if you look at all the paper reviews, you'll get a fairly smooth spectrum from Awesome to Horrible. It's as if two different films were shown to people.<br/><br/>It's as if half of everyone who watched it uses one side of their brain and loved it while the other half used the other half of their brain and hated it. One thing's for sure, opinions are usually strong about this film. Mine are firmly on the awesome side, as I consider this film Aronofsky's best yet and a film that for all its tacit references or inspirations is totally unique when approached in a fair and unbiased manner. Fountain gushes with amazing visuals, with a minimum of CGI.<br/><br/>Pi and Requiem were sometimes painful to watch, both emotionally and even physically. They were designed to be, part of why those two great films were so effective. The fountain is pleasure where those films are pain; you are drawn in with the absolutely gorgeous and sublime sights and sounds of a story that spans centuries.Then it wraps you up and holds you in from the first moment of the movie to its explosive climax. You aren't held captive by this film; rather you're completely mesmerized and unable to care about anything else. Like being deeply in love.<br/><br/>That's where Aronofsky truly excels: not just in composing an utterly taut, elegant, and engrossing visual nirvana, but being able to transmit raw, primal and fiercely real emotion from the screen to the hearts and minds of the audience. That is, as long as those hearts/minds are open to new things. The fountain isn't without its faults, but was without doubt the most impactive film I've seen in the theater in years.<br/><br/>Kudos also to Clint Mansell, who has also reached a new high of his own with The Fountain's score, which gives the film fully half of its power, if not more.

Plus being a sci-fi nut. The Inquisition led by Torquemada (any resemblance to the man called Moqtada in present-day Iraq who is pictured on the cover of the current issue of a popular US weekly is more than coincidental) absolutely destroyed the fabric of Spanish culture for over 500 years: from the Christian defeat of the Moors at Cordoba (do read Michener's Iberia) to the adoption of a modern constitution in 1978. The inquisitors required all Muslims and people of the Jewish faith to convert to Christianity. Those who refused were executed; those who converted were later exiled (e.g. the Sephardic Jews and the Spanish Diaspora.)<br/><br/>The only part of Spain not previously conquered by the Moors is the Basque country in the north, which is a whole other fascinating part of Spanish history.

Unlike the other films of this period, ones that focus on marketability, star-power, and sheer impact, this film seeks to achieve what film was meant to.<br/><br/>Since the first of the Lumiere films, Fritz Lang's Metropolis, and the Wizard of Oz, film has been the medium of a story-telling that provides a shared audio-visual experience that be found nowhere else. The Fountain achieves this. It is a spectacle of the interwoven lifetimes of Tomas and Isabella (Izzy). From the fall of Andalusian Spain under the weight of the Inquisition, to turn of the millennium American medical research, to an undated ""future"" recounting the lives past. It is the search for life, the reality of death, and the relationship between them.<br/><br/>I don't often grant 10 of 10 ratings to films. This film is truly exceptional. However, I do NOT feel that I can recommend it to anyone. This is not the type of film to be recommended. Similarly, Akira Kurosawa's Dreams or Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut; either you'll get it or you won't, either you'll love it or hate it.<br/><br/>For a little background, I recommend the following for perspective: Genesis 3:24 from the Bible; the misnomered ""Dark Ages"" of Europe wherein is Islamic empire crossed the strait of Gibraltar and peacefully ruled Southern Europe between ~790 and ~1497; Isabella, Queen of Spain; al-Andalus; The Spanish Inquisition, which essentially erased 700 years of European history; the Conquest of South America; old growth trees in the Amazon basin and resource exploitation by everyone from the colonial Spainiards to contemporary pharmaceutical companies; Yggdrasil and the Tree of Life.<br/><br/>Demand that more films be made this way."

","I have read so many negative reviews of this film, and in the end, I'm simply left with the belief that all these people ... just ... didn't ... get ... it. Fine, so be it. I didn't get ""Memento"", but because I didn't get it, I wouldn't dare trash the film.<br/><br/>This film shines in almost every way -- it's simplistic in its vision, actually, but brought to life on screen, it's amazing. The images are amazing, the atmosphere created by the audio/visual synchronicity renders you speechless, and the interconnectivity of the three timelines is just about seamless. The soundtrack is stunning: rhythmic at times, orgasmic at others, all underlying the pain and urgency of the story. Love beats strong, literally.<br/><br/>The acting is interesting: Rachel Weisz has her moments, and when she is in the middle timeline, she's at her physical worst. All the more so to emphasize her character, I suspect. As the Spanish Queen, she's just captivating. Hugh Jackman will always be Wolverine to most viewers, but his best efforts in this film are in the 26th century timeline, as the solitude of his character demands a top performance.<br/><br/>One complaint: the film is almost too short -- 15 extra minutes of development would have helped. I wonder if there is a director's cut awaiting us on DVD?"

"MJBlazin","7","0","2","3 December 2006"," It's not a science fiction story
","Spoiler The initial scenes in the bubble amongst the stars are hard to shake. Probably intentionally, they cloud what is really happening. As noted by only a few reviewers, it's not a movie where the characters span 1000 years and it's really not science fiction. The time span may be less than one year. The Spanish story set in 1500 is really the unfinished book written in the present by the dying wife. The star travel is really Jackman's effort to meet his wife's request that he finish the book after her death.<br/><br/>It's the only way to reconcile how the future intrudes on the past at the temple. That intrusion made no sense until I understood that both past and future are part of a book, and as designated author, Hugh Jackman can finish the story as he wants.<br/><br/>The real plot line is Rachel gets cancer and writes story, Hugh as husband stumbles on to something that might have saved her, Rachel dies before Hugh can try it, and Jackman comes to terms with his failure to save her and then finishes her story."
"jzappa","7","0","1","3 December 2006"," Death: A Rebirth
","Familiar of course with Pi and Requiem For A Dream, I knew that when I saw The Fountain I would be taken aback by the inventiveness and talent in the film-making itself, and I was. It has very progressive and interesting cinematography, with lots of gold in the theme of the lighting, which movies rarely have and this happens to have in nearly every seen. The editing was, as in Requiem, intensely complex, infusing the sharp images of reality as we know it with abstract sequences involving the Tree of Life and the nebula that surrounds it. The musical score gives the film such drama and emotional drive, even if it's only a hint of the power that it had in Requiem. The story, however, could just be either something way ahead of its time or way ahead of itself.<br/><br/>The Fountain is a movie that cannot explain itself, so it's created in a way relative to an impressionist painting. You'll find that you're asking yourself questions about the story, like stories by their very nature provoke you to do, but they tend to be qusetions that you feel you've either missed the answer to or don't quite understand the answer to. I'm not panning the film for its intricacy. It's very possible that it has a profound point at the doorstep of the answers to all of the questions you'll find yourself asking yourself about the story. And it does provoke thought. For instance, the tagline for the movie is, ""What if you could live forever?"" During it, you surprisingly end up seriously asking yourself that. What if you could? What would you do? But the film requires such concentration and patience and the subsequent pondering after seeing it, and after several ""avant-garde"" and ""post-modernist"" and ""neo-realist"" filmmakers have opened so many brain-rattling discussions over so many films that they strategically claim later to have meant basically nothing so that they could look down on their audience as patsies, the victims of their time and age, I grow suspicious when a film is so cryptic that by the end, the plot hasn't even entirely revealed itself at face value yet.<br/><br/>As for Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, the two leads that replaced Brad Pitt and Jennifer Connelly, are very impressive, Jackman being one of the great cryers of recent cinema and Weisz being so evasively good at absorbing your sympathy. Burstyn is wasted, her character a token."
"tghoneyc","9","0","1","3 December 2006"," The most visually stimulating movie of the year
","Okay, I'm not one of those people who loves to hype up a movie, and considering the mixed reviews this one's received, there isn't, I suppose, much risk of people taking what I say too seriously.<br/><br/>That said, and in all seriousness, this is a fantastic piece of cinema! Darren Aronofsky, one of the most visually gifted directors working today, has created a masterwork so radically different from his previous two forays into the medium that comparing this to either his debut, ""Pi,"" or ""Requiem for a Dream"" would be unfair to what this has to offer on its own. Granted, it also means that just because you liked those movies doesn't mean you'll like this one.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has created a complex, time-tripping story about love, obsession, life, death, and rebirth. Tom Creo is a man floating through space, with a tree, toward a dying star in the far future. He is a present day doctor who is searching for a way to reverse the effects on a chimp named Donovan, in the hope that the same can be done for his wife Izzy. He also imagines himself the protagonist in his wife's journal of a Conquistador who is sent to New Spain (Guatemala) during the Spanish Inquisition by Queen Isabella, with the mission of finding the Tree of Life.<br/><br/>Cutting back and forth in time, through present and future and past, and leaving much unanswered, it is not the story itself that is important, the the themes at work here.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman gives the best dramatic performance I have seen b a lead actor all year. Something of a control freak, he goes to pieces when the one absolute - death - takes his wife from him.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is the innocent, his opposite and equal, who is a bit of a free spirit. She prefers to leave things to fate. She conveys the fragile but fearless existence of Izzy, and the commanding vulnerability of the Queen of Spain.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn and Aronofsky favorite Mark Margolis in particular offer great support to the two stars, as do Cliff Curtis, Ethan Suplee, and Stephen McHattie, as the Grand Inquisitor. But it is Jackman who shines the brightest, and Weisz who seals the deal.<br/><br/>This, more than anything, is a film about ideas, and Aronofsky does a masterful job of showing these ideas unravel.<br/><br/>P.S. There is a small twist with regard to the Tree of Life, but this movie isn't about twists."

","This is a beautiful movie. It takes a little bit to get into it, but once you become aware of what's going on  it transforms from a visually stun art house flick into a wonderful love story. The cinematography was breathtaking and the acting was well done. I went into this film not know what to expect except that it would be visually stunning and I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and beauty of the story. It reminded me a lot of What Dreams May Come in the visuals and the love story. I was sad to see that there were only four other people in the theater at the showing I attended. Of course, it doesn't have explosions or graphic sex scenes, it's just a beautiful film and that is obviously not where Hollywood is right now  that's a shame. With this film, Mr. Aronofsky has thrown his hat into the ring as a worthy successor to Stanley Kubric."
"EGANJM24","6","0","1","2 December 2006"," 'Fountain' confusing until well after movie is over, but fantastic visionary ride
","Two lovers are followed over the span of a thousand years. What they discover about each other is a story of love, death, spirituality and the essence of hope. I think. Darren Aronofsky's latest visual ride is ""The Fountain,"" starring Hugh Jackman (""X-Men"") and Rachel Weisz (""The Mummy""). The story revolves around their love throughout the past, present and future. In the past, Tomas (Jackman) is a soldier of Spain in 1500, sent by the queen (Weisz) to find the Tree of Life. Finding it will save Spain, and as she says it, make the queen the Eve to Tomas's Adam. In the present, Tommy is a scientist and his wife, Izzi, has cancer that has spread to her brain. Tommy is obsessed with finding a cure for Izzi, shutting out everyone and everything to save his beloved. His lab has a sample of the Tree of Life and hopes to eventually use it on Izzi so they can be together forever. In the future, Tom Creo is an astronaut in a ship, taking the Tree of Life to a dying star in order to reunite with his lost lover. The movie itself is confusing. If you expect to go to the theater and see three stories in a row, you are very wrong. The movie switches from all three eras, getting pieces of information throughout each scene to eventually piece together the final conclusion. Before seeing the movie, I researched and saw that most people would not get the movie, and that you should pay attention to everything in order to pick up on what is going on. Well I did, and I walked out of the theater like a six-year-old who was just told to memorize calculus. I was utterly confused. ""The Fountain"" is a ride that takes massive thinking and attention. Symbolism is everywhere. From the constant colors and camera views, to the meaning of each action in every scene. Anything major event that occurs means something to the rest of the movie and all three eras. The movie involves many different themes and thoughts, especially dealing with spirituality. The story of Adam and Eve, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge, the Mayan First Father story, the book Izzi writes, the missing wedding ring, the seven deadly sins and so on. Everything in the movie has a meaning. What seems like three different stories ends up being a story that is all woven together by the end with the common goal of love. Characters go through the same experiences in different times, with almost the same outcome each time. But believe me, it is not that simple. 'The Fountain"" has a beautiful tone to it. It is shot fantastically, and Aronofsky is well on his way to being one of the most visually intriguing and thought-provoking directors of our time. Aronofsky's previous film, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" is a depressing yet fantastic movie. It was the reason I wanted to explore this film, and it ends up being something completely unique and different. I didn't get this movie until I got home and read the hundreds of posts on the movie. In fact, I still don't have it all pieced together. If you want a film that you can just sit back and enjoy without thinking, do not see this film. It is really hard to get and absorb, and it's one of those movies that you could enjoy more after leaving the theater and discussing it. I hated the movie after it ended, and had to read and read about it before I got what happened. Now I want to see it again to catch everything I missed, which was about 60% of the film. Jackman and Weisz are simply amazing. Originally, Brad Pitt and Cate Blancett were slotted for this film, and I am glad that changed. I can't see Pitt giving the emotion or depth that Jackman gives in the film. The two are simply stunning, and give performances that are more than nomination worthy. It is one of those movies that is enhanced tremendously by the performances of the actors. So, if you give this movie a try, get ready for a complicated ride. Watch for everything, absorb every sentence, statement or action. It is a great movie concealed by visual mystery and story-telling, and definitely worth a second look. So be prepared to be confused, tested, and enthralled. ""The Fountain"" is a one of a kind film, if you are up for a challenge and a thought- provoking experience. EEe"
"mvaldi20","10","0","1","2 December 2006"," A meditative love poem; something to behold.
","It's been a few days since I've seen this film, and it still is in my mind. Darren Aronofsky has created a bold, beautiful and abstract piece of art. And he should be commended for it.<br/><br/>This film is not for everyone. This is not a film you just randomly ""check out."" You must be prepared. I've been waiting three years for this film. It has been in development even longer. This past week I finally got the see the film that I have been waiting for.<br/><br/>The Fountain is a simple tale, told masterfully and abstractly. I went in ready to focus on every nuance this film held, and it was a joy. This is pure cinema, in an Eisensteinian, juxtaposition of images, enthralling way. There is no hyperbole when I say the visuals are breathtaking. This is truly a film made for the theatre, but will sadly probably never gain respect until the small screen. I had the pleasure of seeing it on the largest screen I've ever seen. That is how it should be viewed.<br/><br/>Everyone involved in this project should be applauded. It is certainly two of the strongest and most emotionally vulnerable performances by Jackman and Weisz. The cinematography is stunning, the score, evocative and haunting. The images edited on screen are magnificent. This film holds your heart in its grip, and keeps you there for its totality. I was sucked in from frame one and did not leave until the very film unspooled in front of my eyes. This is a film you sit down and talk about afterwards. Not everyone will like it, sadly, hardly anyone will ever see it, but if you are a lover of cinema you owe it to yourselves to see this NOW, in the theatre.<br/><br/>The Fountain is not perfect, but it is potent. Aronofsky has put forth an astounding piece of work; a meditative love poem of death and eternity."
"sarcoman","10","0","1","2 December 2006"," Thank God for directors like Aranofsky
","I wont go into any detail regarding the plot of this movie, rather, I want to use this post to praise the director/screenwriter.<br/><br/>Im tired of 'cookie-cutter' movies, movies that follow an established patter of success. There has been a generally lack of original storytelling in movies for years. That is why we need to be especially thankful that directors like Darren Aranofsky are making movies. What I have found most memorable about his films where not the details of the plot, but the emotions that resonated within me during, and after the movie.<br/><br/>Requiem For a Dream left me with such a tight pit in my stomach, that I found I had to immediately distract myself from those emotions. At the time of watching it, I told myself that I would never watch it again because of sadness it thrust into me. But I found myself wanting to watch it again because of the beauty of its storytelling, because it was one of the few films to create that emotion in me.<br/><br/>The Fountain was no different. The story was completely different from Requiem, as was the method in story telling. Aranofsky avoids using CGI (which is refreshing, considering that everything else does), and creates stunning visuals that are worthy of taking stills of, and hanging them on your wall. Again, the films creates an emotion in you, that when watching you understand how the characters feel because you also feel it.<br/><br/>Like Kubrick before him, Aranofsky does not make studio friendly films... rather, he is an artist and a storyteller. And like Kubrick, his films are experiences more than stories."

"ferguson-6","6","0","3","25 November 2006"," The Road to Awe
","Greetings again from the darkness. Interesting, open to interpretation film from the brilliant mind of writer/director Darren Aronofsky. The film spans over 1000 years, but the three stories are presented in a non-linear manner so as to encourage thought and discussion. The whole topic of everlasting life or death as a disease could and has filled numerous research papers. Mr. Aronofsky brings his unique visual element to the topics.<br/><br/>The two leads are played well enough by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. Jackman's look spans that of Mick Fleetwood as a conquistador, TV's Dr. House in the present, and the zen of David Carradine in the future. Regardless of the era, he spends the entire film extremely agitated with a constant frown. Weisz, on the other hand, makes a lovely queen, a perky dying lady and sickly tree. Supporting help is provided by Ellen Burstyn (making up for her horrible turn in ""The Wicker Man"") and the powerful Stephen McHattie as The Inquistor.<br/><br/>Each story has a frenetic pace and the climax of Jackman discovering ""The Fountain"" is pretty well done. This one doesn't score higher due to lack of connection to the two main characters in any period of time. We just aren't really given any reason to care.<br/><br/>Although not in the class of ""PI"" and certainly not the excellence of ""Requiem for a Dream"", Mr. Aronofsky delivers another thought provoking visual feast that will be loved by many and hated by some."
"aharmas","6","0","3","23 November 2006"," Is it all coming from her book or his mind?
","Unlike ""Requiem"" I found this film to be upsetting, upsetting because the style overpowered its substance. In ""Requiem"" the universe and many of its forces are destroyed by the fragility of our abilities to resist the darkness that can annihilate us. It is tragic to see how four individuals are ripped to pieces as drugs take over their lives. There is, ironically, beauty in the way the director presented that horrible tragedy.<br/><br/>Here we are dealing with more beauty, but it is all disfigured by the presentation, a movie that should have immeasurable power, is delivered mangled by the way, magnificent performances, a lovely score, and a terrific idea, fall secondary to some very interesting special effects and some confusing editing. There is so much potential in the way the story hints come across, and somehow, we are left with a very repetitive delivery of sequences that do not have any new meaning as more is ""revealed"" about the story line. Instead, they feel repetitive and burdensome.<br/><br/>The effect is puzzling because we have some strong acting by both Jackman and his leading lady, Weitz. They look believable and shouldn't become a problem because they are fantastic actors and not stars. They are attractive and effective in their parts, and here is where the problems are. Their acting doesn't complement or enhance the story. It shows how weak the narrative is.<br/><br/>It starts promising, as we are witnessing some spectacular and violent odyssey in the middle of the Mayan lands, soon we're pulled into some existential worlds that might or not exist, and before we know it, we are dealing with some tremendous amount of suffering and guilt, and yet, it feels hollow as the film never takes flight.<br/><br/>There should be more buy in about the power of their love since it appears to transcend time and matter, but a terrific score and very good acting is not nearly enough in this case. There is not enough concern with the need for a great script. It is not all a matter of style. It should be a perfect marriage of both. Too bad, since this film was coming with so many expectations. Maybe next time, we can get some more of the real thing."

","this is another incredible film from darren aronofsky. i didn't expect anything less, but the fountain was so much more than i had hoped it would be. <br/><br/>plot-wise, it runs the gamut from sci-fi to drama, from history to philosophy; it has everything. the cinematography is simply beautiful; the way aronfsky uses light in this movie is beautiful, the shots of the characters are beautiful, the special effects are beautiful (and completely undigital, if i'm not mistaken). the score is understated, but compliments the film perfectly. i was also floored by the acting; i had my doubts about hugh jackman, but he pulled through. rachel weiz was great, but what else would you expect from aronofsky's wife? as for the plot, it comes thisclose to being predictable, but still manages to surprise you. <br/><br/>the fountain is vastly different than aronofsky's previous films, but still an aronofsky. don't expect a repeat of requiem, but if you enjoyed the intellectual aspects of pi, you'll probably love the fountain. even if you don't like sci-fi, or you don't like love stories, this movie is still worth seeing. just go with an open mind!"
