","I've read the book, and the movie's not so bad. Obviously there are many things I'd do different, but in the end it's 2,5 hours of good entertainment, and isn't that what the ratings are all about? Personally I think Tom Hanks wasn't passionate enough for Robert Langdon. That's why it's not a 9 for me.<br/><br/>A lot of people are too harsh on this one. Mostly because they know the book and have very high expectations. I have to see my first book-to-film where the film is better.<br/><br/>Also, you're not going to hell for watching this movie or reading the book. It's based on a novel, which is based on a few loose theories, but in the end all it wants to do is to entertain. And that is exactly what both the book and the movie did for me."
"GF9","6","672","1076","17 May 2006"," The standard 'not as good as the book' applies here.
","I can't say I was blown away by The Da Vinci Code - as is often the  case, the book was far superior. I generally like Tom Hanks in almost  all his roles, however I found that I had such a pre-conception of what  Robert Langdon should be, that it took me about half an hour to get  used to Hanks occupying this character. Once I settled into it  though - it was a thoroughly enjoyable, occasionally slow moving  thriller. Having read the book, I did have a knowledge of the various  groups and factions involved - I'm not sure how someone who hasn't read  the book will fair though.  The casting of the movie is surely one of it's stronger points - Paul  Bettany is almost unrecognisable and plays the menacing single minded  Silas to utter perfection. Sir Ian McKellan too, it totally fantastic,  and really steals most scene's he appears in. He delivers some great  one liners too - a real character actor playing a real character.  Audrey Tautou is as we have come to expect, just lovely, and who else  could have played Bezu Fache - Jean Reno was made for the role.  As you'd expect from a Ron Howard Production, there is a good amount of  cheese, especially towards the end. Langdon's ""Godspeed"" caused me to  awake in the night sweating!   I am a fairly harsh marker on the IMDb, so don't be put off by a 6 out  of 10 - I did enjoy the movie, but my anticipation was so great with  this film, that it could never live up to my expectation."
"Buddy-51","7","74","111","5 July 2006"," better than many critics have given it credit for
","From the way the critics have gone after ""The Da Vinci Code,"" you'd think that Ron Howard himself had been jealously guarding the location of the Holy Grail all these years and was just now revealing it to all the world for his own nefarious (i.e. commercial) purposes. Actually, despite all the critical hostility and rancor, this turns out to be a reasonably entertaining adaptation of a reasonably entertaining novel, far from a classic or a work of art, but hardly the pile of cinematic refuse so many of the reviewers have led us to believe it is.<br/><br/>As a work of history, the novel is a passel of nonsense, and only those with a bent towards conspiracy theory overload would be foolish enough to believe a minute of it. But as a work of imaginative fiction, ""The Da Vinci Code"" certainly gives its audience the neck-twisting workout they've paid good money to receive.<br/><br/>It would be pointless to reiterate the plot of a novel that has probably had the biggest readership of any literary work since ""Gone With the Wind."" Suffice it to say that a mysterious murder in the Louvre sends a Harvard symbologist and the dead man's granddaughter on a clue-driven search for the famed Holy Grail. Along the way, the two uncover a grand conspiracy on the part of a renegade Catholic order to protect a secret that, if it were revealed, could shake the whole of Western civilization down to its very foundations.<br/><br/>Despite the phenomenal - one is tempted to say ""unprecedented"" - commercial success of his work, Dan Brown is no great shakes as a writer; his characters are, almost without exception, drab and two-dimensional, and his dialogue, when it isn't being overly explicit in pouring out explanations, sounds like it was written by a first-year student in a Writer's 101 workshop. But the one undeniable talent Brown does have is his ability to knit together a preposterously complex web of codes and clues into an airtight tapestry, and to make it all convincing.<br/><br/>The movie is very faithful to the novel in this respect. It moves quickly from location to location, never giving us too much time to question the logic (or illogic) of the narrative or to examine the many gaping plot holes in any great detail. Writer Akiva Goldsman has encountered his greatest trouble in the scenes in which the action stops dead in its tracks so that the characters can lay out in laborious detail the elaborate story behind the clues. Yet, this is as much the fault of the nature and design of the novel as it is of the man given the unenviable task of bringing it to the screen. Moreover, perhaps in the interest of time and keeping the action flowing, Robert and Sophie come up with solutions to the myriad riddles much too quickly and accurately, with a ""Golly, gee, could it mean_______?"" attitude that borders on the ludicrous. But, somehow, Howard makes most of it work. Perhaps, it's the clunky literal-minded earnestness with which he approaches the subject that ultimately allows us to buy into it against our better judgment.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is stolid and passive as Dr. Robert Langdon, the college professor involuntarily driven into all this cloak-and-dagger intrigue, but Audrey Tautou has a certain subtle charm as Sophie, the woman who may play more of a part in the unraveling of the mystery than even she herself can imagine. Jean Reno and Paul Bettany have their moments as two of the less savory players in the story, but it is Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on all things related to the Holy Grail, who walks off with the film. His scenery-chewing shtick pumps some much needed life into a tale essentially populated by underdeveloped stick figures.<br/><br/>The religious controversy surrounding both the novel and the film is as ludicrous as it is unjustified. Anyone whose belief system could be seriously shaken by this absurd mixture of unsubstantiated myth-making and plain old-fashioned wild speculation couldn't have had a very solid foundation of faith to begin with.<br/><br/>The rest of us can appreciate ""The Da Vinci Code"" for what it is, an overblown but epic exercise in code-busting and clue-decoding - in short, the ""Gone With the Wind"" of whodunits."
"scobb","5","726","1219","18 May 2006"," Mediocre at best
","While he may not be the world's greatest writer, Dan Brown is an excellent storyteller, as judged by the millions of people who have read and enjoyed ""The Da Vinci Code"" - me included. So I was keenly anticipating the release of this movie, partly because I enjoyed the book and also because a number of scenes were shot in Lincoln Cathedral, which is my birthplace.<br/><br/>First the good points. Ron Howard has chosen some great locations, and produced a sumptuously photographed film, with a thought-provoking, well-paced storyline which sticks pretty faithfully to the book. For me, Silas (Paul Bettany) is the strongest character in the film, graphically portrayed as a faithful servant of Opus Dei. His role is certainly one heck of a contrast with his recent leading role in Wimbledon!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, for me those good points are outweighed by a wooden dialogue which poor old Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou have virtually no hope of making anything meaningful from. There is simply no chemistry between the 2 leading characters and some of their lines made me cringe because they were so embarrassingly weak. At no point did I feel involved in what should be a powerful and emotional story; it simply failed to engross me in any way. Bored is a strong word, but I was verging on it by the end.<br/><br/>In summary, disappointing."
"DICK STEEL","8","521","901","18 May 2006"," A Nutshell Review: The Da Vinci Code
","This movie is becoming as controversial as the book. Since the day it was announced that it's gonna be made, there were protests against it being done, and it has escalated to calls for boycotting, or banning the movie altogether. I'll not waste time and go into its controversies, nor discuss what's real and what's not. Neither will I explain in detail the plot, as I believe most of you readers would already have some vague idea of what it's about, or have read the book, since it's on the bestsellers list for months.<br/><br/>Rather, I'll evaluate the movie as it is, on how well it entertains. Those who wish to preach in my comment box, prepare to have those comments deleted, at my discretion. This is the stand I shall take, that this movie is entirely fictional, based on events which are used loosely, for the sole purpose of weaving a storyline that tries to be believable. I think some have already mentioned it's too successful in doing that, and may mislead people into thinking its theories presented, are real. However, don't take it too seriously, and if you wish to, use another proper platform to debunk the myths, not my movie review blog.<br/><br/>The structure of the movie, is exactly the same as the book. There is no change to the ending, despite some rumours that it will be different. Naturally, some of the detailed explanation that's given in the book, especially many three-way dialogue between Sophie- Robert-Leigh, have to be summarized in order to pace this movie into 2 1/2 hours. Herein lies the challenges. For those who've read the book, the movie offers nothing new, other than the gratification of watching events and characters play out on the big screen. For those who haven't read the book, the movie version should be decent enough to make you want to pick up the novel and read more into the controversial theories explained.<br/><br/>However, having being familiar with the plot and how the story unfolds, red herrings, character motivations, twists and all, it may leave those who've read the novel, a page-turner in every sense of the word, a bit wanting, that the pace could've been improved. Undoubtedly the pacing sags when it's time for some dialogue heavy moments, but I suppose that is unavoidable when you're revisiting material.<br/><br/>However, its presentation of these controversial dialogue moments coupled with special effects, that will make you go wow. Truly, the technique is nothing original, and some of the visuals used looked like Return of the King and Kingdom of Heaven rejects, but as a whole, combined with the narrative, it helps to present the controversies in a more palatable manner.<br/><br/>Casting, I felt, was spot on. Tom Hanks makes Robert Langdon pretty accessible, given Hanks' everyman demeanor, and Audrey Tautou makes a believable Sophie Neveu. Ian McKellen, probably THE actor with 2 summer blockbusters back to back (the other being X- Men 3), is convincing as the rich grail hunter Sir Leigh Teabing. Paul Bettany is chilling as the albino killer Silas, and Jean Reno and Alfred Molina round up the star studded cast as the detective Captain Fache and Bishop Aringarosa.<br/><br/>Much is said about the haunting soundtrack, but as far as I'm aware, there's nothing scary about it. Silas, in his scene of self-cleansing, is horrid enough though, as are some scenes of unexpected on screen violence that hit like a sack of potatoes falling from the sky.<br/><br/>In the end, in spite of all the controversies, perhaps Robert Langdon's line is poignant - if given a chance, would you rather destroy faith, or renew it? The book and the movie have provided an opportunity for the faith to renew itself, to debunk the myths and theories (which were developed loosely to make the story flow of course), and to generally point the curious to the direction and light the faith wants to show.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this Ron Howard movie makes a good summer popcorn flick, with the usual thrills and spills you'd come to expect with its superb production values."
"kajmel","10","1357","2414","17 May 2006"," Great Movie... For Intelligent, Unbiased People
","First off, I'd just like to say that this movie is based on a fictional story. FICTION. Why people need to express hatred over this because of their religious beliefs is so mind-boggling. No one is saying that Christianity is wrong, and that this story is right. The book is classified as FICTION, not THEOLOGY! I should also note that my extremely religious Christian friends don't find this movie at all ""disturbing"" or ""wrong"". The fact is that if you believe in something, nothing -- including a movie, or story -- should be able to deter you from that belief. If you feel threatened by this movie or any other story like this, you have serious problems regarding the foundations in which you believe.<br/><br/>Now, to the review... I'm not here to give you any spoilers or story info, since that's all been done in the other reviews.<br/><br/>I have never read the book. I went to see the movie with my boyfriend, who read the book recently, and some friends (one of whom has read the book at least twice, and is so into the story that he has researched the symbols and meanings thoroughly and participates in Da Vinci Code games, forums, etc). So we actually had at least 3 differing perspectives here.<br/><br/>I really loved the film. Having no story to compare it to, I didn't feel like I had to have read the book to understand the story. Nothing felt missing or incomplete. I came out of the theater ready to add this list to my favorites, and wanting to read the book to compare it to the movie.<br/><br/>My boyfriend also thought the film was great. He said they did a great job adapting the book to film, and although not everything was there, they did the best that they could with the time they had, and he was impressed.<br/><br/>My friend was so excited throughout the movie, he kept wanting to talk to us about it. He pointed out some things from the book that weren't there as well, but he understood it couldn't all be there. He also said that watching the film put a new perspective for him on the movie, since he imagined things looking and feeling different in his head. Seeing the movie allowed him to look at it differently, which made it exciting all over again.<br/><br/>So, in summary, this seems to be a great movie no matter how deep you are into the Da Vinci Code. I normally wait for movies to go on DVD to rent, but this is one that I'd recommend you see in the theater... the atmosphere makes it more fun and also you can talk about this with others after seeing it, instead of catching up to everyone later and possibly getting spoilers before you watch. Again, I highly recommend this movie! A+"
"KrisDemeanoR","8","64","102","22 May 2006"," Da Vinci Unworthy of Negative Hype
","Last Tuesday, when The Da Vinci Code premiered at the Cannes Film festival, it was met with a chilly reception from the reviewing elite. It has been called ""plodding,"" ""stale,"" and ""uninspired,"" thus, dashing the hopes of many movie goers who were hoping to see one of their favorite novels brought to life by one of their favorite directors, and starring one of their favorite actors. Since I'm not a slave to snobby film reviewers, I went to go see it for myself despite the negative hype. And as the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I felt increasingly unsettled; not because of the quality of the movie, but because one question lingered in my head: What's not to like? Am I crazy for actually being entertained by what I just saw? How could the critics pan what I, and those around me, seemed to enjoy? Okay, so that's more than one question....<br/><br/>First, I have to qualify myself. I read the book and I LOVED it; couldn't put it down. I loved the history, the speculation, the riddles and puzzles, and the masterful blend of fact and fiction. Additionally, I'm not religious, although I was definitely familiar with Christian historical icons such as Jesus, John the Baptist, and Mary Magdelene before I read the book. I also happen to be a big fan of Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Ian McKellan.<br/><br/>Having said that, I went in prepared to like this movie, even though I had somewhat lowered my expectations based on the barrage of bad reviews. All of this proved to be a winning formula for me, apparently.<br/><br/>If you're like me and you loved the book and you like the artistic team that pursued making it into a movie, then you'll most likely come out satisfied. You won't mind what many critics have called ""overly-long exposition"" and historical flashbacks, because that's pretty much what the book consisted of. And in the book, it was absolutely engrossing! So, I personally didn't mind all of the explanation of history, symbols, etc.<br/><br/>Critics have also found fault with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's portrayals of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu (respectively), saying that they delivered flat performances. But once again, whoever read the book will remember that both of these characters weren't that dynamic on the written page, either. Of course, Sir Ian McKellan, with the juiciest role of Holy Grail scholar Sir Leigh Teabing, chews up the scenery every time he's shown on screen. Sir Leigh Teabing was also one of the richest characters in the book.<br/><br/>I think that the people who won't like this movie are people who didn't read the book, and are going into the theater expecting a regular movie, which it's not. It's an adaptation of a very wordy, detailed, twisting, speculative novel that blends fact and fiction in a devastatingly effective way, and it's easy to get lost while watching the movie if you don't already know where the story is going. Sure, Ron Howard uses digitized, grainy flashbacks of ancient pagan rituals and societies to move the narrative along and to keep the audience on point, but I can see how it could be overwhelming to those who only know the bare bones of the plot. However, those who found it fascinating in the book will find pleasure in seeing the visual accompaniment to what they've already read.<br/><br/>In short, you go see this movie (or read the book) for how it challenges popularly-held beliefs; not for its rich, engaging character development. It's a quest for the ""truth"", and in terms of the IDEAS expressed, they did a dag-blasted good job of translating those ideas onto the screen. Those who often complain that movies don't stay true to the books that they're based on will find comfort in the fact that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard have stayed incredibly close to the original text when translating it onto the screen. However, this will be to the dismay of those movie-goers who haven't read the book, and are therefore expecting a traditional action thriller with traditional action thriller dialogue.<br/><br/>If you go to RottenTomatoes.com, you'll see the huge disparity between what the critics have said, and what the users have said regarding this film. While the cumulative critics rating is a dismal 22%, the combined user rating is a 74%, which is way above average for the site. That should speak volumes to whoever is skeptical about seeing the movie because of the bad reviews.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that it's definitely a movie worth watching if only to see how the creative team behind it went about turning the best-selling novel into celluloid. It's also a treat to see something in popular culture challenge popular religious ideals so skillfully, even if only in the form of fiction.<br/><br/>My advice: go see for yourself."
"toddt85","10","612","1174","18 May 2006"," Loved the book? It's hard not to love this.
","Okay, let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the book - it had me hooked more than Harry Potter - and that's saying something (and no I'm not a 10 year old child)! After hearing about the critics' mainly negative views of the film, I approached it without high expectations, and for that, I was rewarded. What I got was an action-packed film that didn't let up until the dying minutes. This film is incredibly faithful to the book (I'm looking at you, Girl With a Pearl Earring!!) to the point where hardly anything is left out, and only minor things have been changed. The visuals are stunning, the acting of Hanks and Tautou is great - and contrary to certain critics opinions - I felt the emotional connection between them. As always, McKlellan is fun to watch, effortlessly bringing Teabing to life, and Reno suffices as Fache. Bettany is fantastic as Silas. The musical score was as good as the visual look of the film - it paired perfectly with the storytelling. Overall, I left the cinema feeling satisfied, because a great book had been turned into a really good film. Approach this film with little expectation, and you will enjoy the ride. Bravo Ron Howard, for doing such a good job."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","154","284","23 May 2006"," The best movie critic is YOU
","So I suggest not writing this off as a Hollywood hack film, simply because it's the bandwagon thing to do. Before you go and see The Da Vinci Code, let all the negative and positive hype surrounding this production cancel each other out, clear your mind, and judge this film fairly. Do NOT judge it on its usually weak director, do NOT judge it entirely on the source material and do NOT judge it on your religious beliefs. All this will be rewarding.<br/><br/>I have not read the book so I will not attempt any kind of comparison. <br/><br/>Plot essentially goes like this: In the middle of the night, Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned as an expert to a crime scene in Le Louvre where a terrible murder has been committed. The victim's body is self-placed in such a bizarre, symbolic way next to one of the world's most famous paintings that the investigation gradually unlocks age-old mysteries that many do not wish to be unlocked.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is a chilling, thrilling and well-sewn together mystery thriller that often keeps you on the edge of your seat. The cast do not disappoint either. Paul Bettany is genuinely creepy as Silas and thereby reinforces the stereotype that all albinos are evil. While Audrey Tatou is annoyingly frail as Sophie Neveu, she is captivating and lovely and is able to project both charisma and presence on screen in this film. However, Tom Hanks did not at all feel like the protagonist in the story and I am unaware whether that was intentional or not but I'm guessing no, in which case Hanks definitely fails in both attracting and keeping our interest.<br/><br/>So the cast usually perform well (with the exception of Hanks) and the story is also facilitated by some very striking visuals. A big plus for this film which elevates it slightly above generic formula is its beautiful locations often seen through epic aerial shots. Good call, Howard! Another big plus is its distinctly Euro-centric feel in both style and substance. This surprised me since it is Tom Hanks and Ron Howard in the same film, but they do manage to keep the overblown Hollywood clichÃ©s to a minimum. This is even apparent in the score by Hans Zimmer; it is not overblown, but subtle and appropriate in the scenes to which it was scored. Similarly, Frenchmen do not speak English with a French accent when they were alone together, but speak in French. That said, the plot does unfold in a somewhat Hollywood fashion -- and the plot happens to be thinner than an Olsen twin.<br/><br/>To counter the good parts, two big minuses in The Da Vinci Code are its wooden and sometimes even placeholder dialogue and its distinct lack of humor. I felt the actors were much too serious for this kind of film, which is first and foremost an adventure story, fast-paced and constantly unlocking new mysteries. The issues in the film were serious enough and needed more comedy to balance them.<br/><br/>As I write this review, more and more bad points about it spring to mind. This is strange, since I remember sitting in the cinema with my friends just a few hours ago and being thoroughly entertained and captivated by the whole thing. So, never mind the occasionally insultingly far-fetched plot and plot-twists by Dan Brown; The Da Vinci Code is a nicely done and very entertaining film in which nothing feels missing or incomplete.<br/><br/>7/10"
"marta-63","8","274","522","17 May 2006"," An entertaining, yet not spectacular movie about the book that made the World talk.
","I just watched the film, and even though I liked it, I must confess, I too expected more. I can't precisely point out what was missing and what I was expecting, but some it has some details that weren't there, some small imprecisions, some little things could have been better.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a pleasant movie to watch. I confess I need to see it again, since I saw it from 3 to 6 am, with very few hours of sleep on the night before. I suggest the ones who read the book to re-read it before they go see it - to add a little bit more perspective. To those who haven't, I wish you a lovely time at the movies - it really is pleasant to see.<br/><br/>Praise to Audrey Tautou, a beautiful splendid actress, and all the other actors that don't need any more praise, like Ian McKellen, Jean Reno and Tom Hanks, who I didn't see fit the part at first, but who grew on me half-way through the movie, if not sooner. A huge praise to Paul Bettany too, for his astonishing and disturbing performance as Silas.<br/><br/>I give it an 8, because it's one of the first movies made from books that did not make me go 'Oh, this was not like this in the book' every five seconds. I never saw Ron Howard as the ideal director for this movie - but he pulled it off decently, though a bolder choice would have been in order."
"Madisons","Null","33","54","4 September 2007"," Sir Ian McKellen Expertly Delivers the Legend of the Film
","Playing Sir Leigh Teabing, the great British actor, Sir Ian McKellen, does not disappoint as he delivers the legend of ""The Da Vinci Code."" The theory that is known as 'the Da Vinci code' is what Sir Leigh Teabing teaches to the would-be living descendant of Jesus of Nazareth.<br/><br/>Howard's direction is a marvel. Hanks, whose films I usually don't like in the least, plays the only character he's taken that I became enthralled by, Dr. Robert Langdon, and Audrey Tautou as French Agent Sophie Neveu is certainly a gorgeous, fresh face in a major US film who aptly held a captivating leading role.<br/><br/>Though I can certainly understand why ""The Da Vinci Code,"" is so controversial in US society, because the theory of there being a child conceived by Jesus and Mary Magdelene is not what the Roman Catholic Church wants to believe or witness even being publicly proposed. The very idea of the God-man being so human as to be married somehow threatens ""the Church,"" and its dogma. Strange how it fortifies and invigorates my own (Christian) spirituality! Regardless, this movie is one of my favorites! My rationale for finding favor in it has nothing to do with religion. I have found it fascinating and riveting because it is one heck of an intriguing story that was expertly directed, acted, and filmed. The excitement was ever so understandable within the film itself. The characters of the Opus Dei group made the motion picture's tension build like a very well written suspense as they scrambled for what Teabing wound up with.<br/><br/>Though I am reticent to admit it, Hanks and Tautou made for quite a good screen match. Though their performances are excellent, they can't touch their elder British screen pro, Sir Ian McKellen's. I'm now convinced more than ever that McKellen has been the most versatile actor of our time: From the most watched children's series ""X-Men"" as comic book/sci-fi's evil ""Magneto;"" to numerous Shakespearean characters, such as King ""Richard III,"" ""Iago,"" & ""Edward II;"" to one of the best Hitlers ever in ""Countdown to War;"" to a Nazi war criminal cornered by a high school kid in, ""Apt Pupil;"" to the good wizard ""Gandalf,"" in the highly acclaimed, ""Lord of the Rings,"" trilogy; to the gay film director of ""Frankenstein,"" James Whale, in the biopic that was utterly overlooked at the Oscars, ""Gods and Monsters;"" I know whenever I spend my time with a motion picture that McKellen plays in, I'm in for the best script & performance that an actor of his acumen and towering stature would pick.<br/><br/>So it is no surprise to me that the character of Sir Leigh Teabing is the one who recants the story of the 'Da Vinci code' and does so as a historian who is an expert in the study of it.<br/><br/>I also liked the fact that this movie does come to a convincing end. Not one that convinces me of the Da Vinci code theory, necessarily, but an ending that leaves the characters themselves with open questions. There's no room for a sequel. Yet, the movie is so well done it leaves me wanting more.<br/><br/>It's not that this motion picture is a classic, by any means. But rather, that it is a terrific story, with a great deal of suspense, action, intrigue, and at times more than a little horrific and scary.<br/><br/>Most of all, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is now and will continue to be legendary."
"brodie_kashmir","6","86","155","10 July 2006"," Could have been better... Should have been better.
","If you take the most popular book in recent years, you should have the most popular movie since The Lord of the Rings, right? Wrong. Though the film was hotly debated, its cinematic quality and popularity aren't nearly as high as one would expect. Amid protests, pending lawsuits, and outright denouncements by Catholic officials, Ron Howard released his adaptation of Dan Brown's novel, The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>American symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and French cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) are on a trans-European quest to solve riddles left by Louvre curator, Langdon's hero and Neveu's grandfather, Jacques Saunier, as he lay dying. The riddles and subsequent quest allegedly lead to the true identity and whereabouts of the famed Holy Grail. Hot in pursuit of the thinking man's Bonnie and Clyde is Javert-ian French police captain Bezu Feche (Jean Reno), intent on pinning the murder of Suanier on Langdon and Neveu, and albino monk, Silas (Paul Bettany) under the command of a mysterious telephone voice known only as The Teacher.<br/><br/>With a pedigree such as the most popular book in the world, two Academy Award winners (Hanks, Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman), French film superstars (Tautou and Reno) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen), you'd wonder how such a film could fail.<br/><br/>Well, how about the miscast of Howard as director. Howard lacks the vision to properly adapt the novel and bring it to life. Some of the blame does go to his Cinderella Man scribe Akiva Goldsman for not writing a fitting script. But Howard's awkwardness is more prominent. If we were going to pick name directors for this film, Steven Spielberg would have been better choice, but I think David Fincher (Se7en and Fight Club) would have been perfect.<br/><br/>The whole production felt rushed. Having just read the book, a lot of plot points were fresh in my mind, and that may have clouded the comprehension of certain things, which I think Howard and Goldsman were counting on. Looking back on it, the first 30-45 minutes were very rushed, and I don't think things were adequately explained. They were still referenced and used in the movie, but not explained well. It suffered from the, what I call, Godfather syndrome: referencing things from the book at the wrong time. They could have taken their time with the film, and it would have told the same story, and been a lot better.<br/><br/>Hanks was out of place as Landon, our hero. He doesn't have or project the same presence about him that Langdon should have. Might I suggest seasoned conspiracy theory veteran David Duchovny? As with Mission:Impossible:III, the supporting cast was impeccably put together, and the one true weakness of the cast is unfortunately the keystone (maybe it's just a bad year for actors named Tom).<br/><br/>Slightly better than your average summer fair, but still doesn't hold up when put against the equally action oriented yet wholly more insightful X-Men franchise."
"Screen-Space","Null","385","776","17 May 2006"," A major disappointment......
","Screened overnight for Australian media.<br/><br/>Four words - wrong star, wrong director.<br/><br/>Hanks and Howards best work, both together or separately, have been when they embrace intrinsically American values in their films. All their most memorable movies have involved individuals overcoming hardship through an unshakable belief in love and courage, usually set against an outwardly US-centric interpretation of events. Think Apollo 13, Forrest Gump, Cinderella Man, Saving Private Ryan - all fine films, all centred on an American hero rising above their circumstance.<br/><br/>What is conspicuously absent from either man's resume is a European-set, religious-themed mystery thriller. Having sat through their arduous, laborious adaptation of Dan Brown's novel, I can now see why.<br/><br/>The plot is total bunkum - a hodgepodge of ""what ifs"" and ""oh my god"" moments spun on the ludicrous premise that Leonardo Da Vinci had some sort of insight into the life of Christ - but loopy story lines have not stopped many films from being enjoyable.<br/><br/>What makes The Da Vinci Code so deathly dull is the heavy-handed, oh-so-serious approach Howard applies to the material. Combining with his cinematographer to give the film a sleepy nocturnal feel (not so clever given the 150min running time), Howard's film is just a constant flow of expository clues that fail to create any tension or engender his leads with any human qualities. Even for those that haven't read the book, a couple of obligatory 'big twists' in the story are very obvious from early-on.<br/><br/>Hanks (looking more like Jim Belushi than ever) and McKellen blather on and on and on about knights and saints and symbols and God as if they were giving a lecture at some Ivy-league school for the supernatural; Audrey Tautou is lovely but has little to do in a role that is plot- not character-driven. Jean Reno ambles thru another of his token French cop parts (he was better in the Pink Panther); Paul Bettany's evil albino Silas at least got some audience reaction, though giggles and guffaws were probably not what he was hoping for.<br/><br/>Whatever sense of fun and excitement the book provided is fully-drained from this adaptation. Come credit time, I had the realisation that all this hokey, airport-novel religious hooey and B-movie plotting would've made for a great X-files episode in that series heyday. As the end-product of a publishing phenomenon and carrying the tag ""Years Most-Anticipated"", its a boring dud."
"azuzastreet-1","1","136","265","4 July 2006"," Art Teacher says the Art History in the DaVinci Code was atrocious
","So much for the ""sacred feminine""!<br/><br/>This movie bore more resemblance to Paris Hilton than Paris, France. It was good looking, but extremely shallow.<br/><br/>Ron Howard did a fine job of directing, but Tom Hanks was completely unconvincing. Visuals were excellent, but the music was overbearing. Ian McKellan was fabulous. The actors who played Fache and the bishop were also excellent, but did not have enough camera time. Too bad.<br/><br/>Most of my criticisms are probably aimed at the material Howard had to work with, meaning the book, ""The DaVinci Code"", which contained multiple gross art history errors. As a veteran Art Teacher with a Master's degree in Art Education, these errors was extremely distracting to me in both reading the book and watching the movie.<br/><br/>Some of these errors are as follows: <br/><br/>The windows at the pyramid at the Louvre contain 673 panes of glass, not 666.<br/><br/>Leonardo (Whose last name is NOT DaVinci..Da Vinci simply refers to the town he lived in) never referred to the ""Mona Lisa"" as the ""Mona Lisa"" in his life time. The moniker was given to the painting by the Art biographer Vasari in the 1800's; thus, Leonardo never could have come up with the outlandish anagrams.<br/><br/>The painting ""Madonna on the Rocks"" is actually entitled ""Virgin on the Rock""; again, this was done so that Brown can create a convenient anagram. In the Louvre, it is NOT located in the same room as the Mona Lisa.<br/><br/>The Last Supper is NOT a fresco. It is a mural. If Mary Magdeline is to the left of Christ in the painting, then where was John? Why would Leonardo make him be missing? It was customary for painters from the Florentine school (where Leonardo hailed from), to make young men appear more feminine than older men, to infuse a bit of innocence in their appearance. Additionally, the Bible contains NO references to the ""holy grail"", or ""chalice"". Leonardo was simply making his painting more natural,in keeping with his naturalistic interpretations of his subjects.That's what Leonardo was famous for!! Leonardo, like most of us, simply believed that Jesus didn't have the, uh, "" bling"" to own a golden chalice!!<br/><br/>There is a sketch by Leonardo of the ""mystery hand"" holding the knife in the Royal Windsor Art collection, and that hand definitely belongs to Peter. It is not a ""disembodied hand wielding a dagger"".<br/><br/>If I hadn't read the book first, I would have been confused with the flash backs, which were very poorly rendered.<br/><br/>The film was very ""talky"", which is bad enough, but the talk itself wasn't accurate. I'm surprised the main female character's (Sophie) head didn't explode with all the condescending lectures she was given.<br/><br/>""Sacred feminine"", indeed...I'm a woman, and ""The Davinci Code"" insulted my intelligence."

","Firstly, this is only the second review I've ever posted on IMDb so am unsure as to what constitutes a spoiler to you guys so have checked the box just to cover myself. To be honest though, the whole film is a spoiler so just don't bother.<br/><br/>I can't begin to write here how appalled I was that such a hyped and eagerly anticipated (not by me I must hasten to add) film could be so bad.<br/><br/>I wasn't one of the 'trillions' that read Dan Brown's book, and I think the film makers just assumed that everyone in the audience had read the book, and more to the point, loved the book; ""so hey, we don't have to worry too much, whatever we do we're gonna make shed loads, just get it done!"". I deteste these films which come out of Hollywood, which seemingly are made purely for profit and let all the important attributes needed to make a true, decent film, fall to the way-side.<br/><br/>It literally took about 15 minutes for me to decide that this film was a complete piece of crap. The dialogue used to move the plot along was ridiculous. In those first 15 minutes Tom Hanks (whom to my mind has only ever made a handful of decent movies at best) is giving a lecture to students. Then he gets taken aside to be told his friend was murdered, can he please come have a look. OK, strange but lets go with it. Then a french policeman tells him he must help immediately and it wouldn't be wise not to. Then a girl appears from nowhere and tells him he must come with her as the policeman is trying to kill him. Oh but wait, we can't go out the front door or anything, we have to go this way. Oh and by the way can you read codes by any chance? Oh you can? Wonderful! Then please de-code this before we go, it'll help greatly........<br/><br/>And so the plot goes on and on and on like this, no explanation, no reasoning just blind commands that he follows again and again from anybody that cares to give him one. At no point in this opening 15 minutes does Tom Hanks question what people are telling him, he just believes them, does what he is told and moves onto the next stage. It was like watching a computer game, with the main character being told do this, do that, don't go here and quick come this way, by supporting characters just to progress onto the next level. It was mind-numbingly boring. Does no-one else agree even slightly with this? <br/><br/>The strange thing is I briefly started to read the opening chapter or two of the book whilst I was away last month with my girlfriend, and my first impressions were that it read like a movie script so something doesn't quite add up........"
"Michael-70","1","103","199","14 June 2006"," Listless, Pointless, Dull and far Worse than I had Imagined!
","By the halfway point, I had this film in my liked column, but then it just went on and on and on, in fact, even though I have left the theater, I still think the film is running. This is a thriller with no thrills, an intellectual mystery with no mystery or intellect. It posits a mystery 2000 years old and feels like it was filmed in real time. <br/><br/>Who is Robert Langdon, the hero played by Tom Hanks? I get no feeling for anything about the guy, his claustrophobia is presented as being important, but it is an uninteresting embellishment and is clearly not important to the story.<br/><br/>The whole story for the film reduces to. . .well, I don't know what it reduces to? I seemed to just be watching pretentious people running around on fool's errands. This is not always a problem in a movie, no one can adequately explain The Big Sleep and I defy anyone to clearly tell me what happens in the recent Russian film Night Watch, but those films have a surfeit of characters that make the twists and turns interesting to follow. Not to mention a wonderful visual strategy that makes them breath. The Da Vinci Code is a suffocating film that does the impossible; it makes the Louvre look boring.<br/><br/>I was puzzled by the casting. With all American Tom Hanks on board and the French Audrey Tautou, the German Jurgen Prochnow and the competent Brits: Alfred Molina, Paul Bettany, and Ian McKellen, we have a Chinese dinner approach to casting ""one from column A and one from column B"", but this cast doesn't gel. <br/><br/>They each do their little bits, but the whole does not add up to more than the parts. There were too many little things that rankled me or anyone with half a brain. The Louvre is filmed so blandly, that it doesn't really matter that they really used the real place for a location. Also, the Louvre does not have steel gates that come down when a painting is removed from the wall. Also, Tautou introduces herself as a ""French Police Cryptologist"". French Police Cryptologist? The French have a national police? The Louvre wouldn't be in the Paris police jurisdiction? Does your city have a staff cryptologist on its police force? Too many ludicrous things happen that made me ask questions while it is happening, not after it's all done when you would get the Hitchcock ""refrigerator moment"". I can take religious hooey, but I can't take scientific hooey. Even the car chases are uninteresting, and badly filmed.<br/><br/>One more thing, if I am ever shot and have to leave a clue to the identity of my killer, I will write that he was an albino monk in a cassock with a cell phone and an automatic. There can't be that many running around, even in Paris."
"lavatch","Null","182","367","19 May 2006"," It's Easy to Unlock This ""Da Vinci Code"": Ron Howard's Film Is a Winner!
","Dan Brown's international bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" has enjoyed phenomenal success because it taps into a wellspring of so many different and fascinating topics. The novel touches upon the early history of Christianity, the mysteries of the medieval Knights Templar society, numerology, and, above all, the archetype of the Grail Quest. The strength of Ron Howard's film lies in its integrity of striving to be faithful to Dan Brown's novel. The fidelity is apparent in each of the following areas:<br/><br/>SCREENPLAY: Akiva Goldsman's script includes nearly all of the major scenes from the novel. To his credit, Goldsman provides dialogue on the Knights Templar, Mary Magdelene, Leonardo's ""Last Supper"" mural and other details from the novel. <br/><br/>DIRECTION: Ron Howard's stylish approach to the film includes interesting camera angles, especially in the aerial shots of such great location sites as the Louvre in the Paris and the Rosslyn chapel in Scotland. It was clear that Howard wanted not merely an action picture, but a leisurely paced retelling of Dan Brown's story. There was also the thoughtful use of close-ups in the more intimate moments with a brilliant analytical scene dissecting the controversial ""chalice"" apparent in Leonardo's ""Last Supper.""<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: Overall, the film was appropriately dark and moody. The flashback sequences were shot in a grainy style that contrasted with the action-packed story of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu. Salvatore Totino deserves the highest praise for his tasteful yet imaginative camera work.<br/><br/>ACTING: Tom Hanks was not overly charismatic as Robert Langdon. But that is precisely the bookish Everyman who is the protagonist of Dan Brown's novel. As Sophie, Audrey Tatou was more dynamic than Robert, as appropriate to her character as well; there was a sparking and even radiant quality to this young performer. The supporting cast was solid with Jean Reno especially successful in developing multiple layers of characterization in the morally conflicted detective Bezu Fache. Perhaps most memorably, Ian McKellen delivers a star turn as the scholar Leigh Teabing.<br/><br/>Over twenty years ago, Umberto Eco's novel ""The Name of the Rose"" was the equivalent in its time of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code."" The subsequent film version of Eco's story was a disappointment in its attempt to equal the success of the novel version of ""The Name of the Rose."" In the case of Ron Howard's film version of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" however, not only does the film do justice to the novel, but in many respects it is better!"

","The first five minutes, when I'm supposed to believe that an old man, after being shot in the stomach, strips himself naked, draws a circle on the floor and a star on his chest in his own blood, writes a message in code (also in his own blood) that leads to a painting with another coded message that leads to another painting with yet another coded message, several of which are written in invisible ink (he just happened to have a bottle on him when he was shot?). Then he lays down in the circle and dies in the pose of the Vitruvian Man. I'm surprised he didn't also pause to make a sandwich and finish that novel he'd been working on.<br/><br/>Monty Python could have done a better job with this movie."
"fluffy_orange_monster","9","132","266","25 May 2006"," I'd never read the book but now I have....
","When I heard that they were bringing out a movie of the best selling book I decided I would see the movie first as I always enjoy books more and didn't want to be disappointed. It's not easy for a film to grip an audience and I thought Ron Howard did an excellent job with his film. It's quite a long movie and every time I thought it was going to end something else happened.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen was fabulous in this film and stole the majority of the scenes he was in delivering some excellent one-liners along the way. I loved his passion for England and was very pleased to see he hasn't lost his talent. Paul Bettany was also tremendous in this film and it made me see him in a different light. After Wimbledon I wasn't sure of his acting skills but The Da Vinci Code proved him worthy of many of the actors in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is one of my all-time favourite actors but I have to say he just didn't seem comfortable in the role of Robert Langdon. He wasn't terrible but he just didn't come up to par with some of his previous roles which I felt was a shame. Audrey Tatou was very good in her role and I couldn't have imagined a better actress for the role.<br/><br/>Overall I felt the film was great, even with Ron Howard's inevitable cheesy scene...'Godspeed' from Tom Hanks. After seeing the film I decided to read the book and I can see why some people prefer the book. However I think it is much harder for a film to grip then it is a book and so for that reason I gave The Da Vinci Code 9/10. I would say anyone should go and see it, just accept it as a film, not as an adaptation of a book."
"luciencoolness","8","92","183","18 May 2006"," The critics are dead wrong
","This is a review from a person that has NOT read the book. The critics were never more polarized: some said it was the best film ever and some said it was a horrible film. The most disturbing part was that most of these critics uttered these claims without ever having seen the film. Even the ""journalists"" who saw the first show in Cannes were negative in a way that was almost unheard of. In fact, I have read so many negative reviews (too long, too narrative, boring, predictable, laughable, Tom Hanks ashamed, Ron Howard ashamed, public not amused. etc.) that I was almost tempted not to collect my 2 premiere tickets to the nearby cinema, saving me 20 euro's in the process. My companion (who did read the book, by the way) however insisted and we went. Good, so now I can write about it first hand. Yes, it's a long time to sit with your face directed upwards to the big screen (two and a half hours, plus 15 minutes commercials). Granted, and it contains lots of talking and here and there, some plot movements were indeed incredible and it was quite predictable in certain parts (remember, I did NOT read the book nor did I know the plot), but in whole, it was a fascinating film indeed. Of course, it was a fascinating novel to begin with and personally I found the direction of the film, as well as the parts of most notably Tatou, McKellen and Reno, excellent. I am well aware that, although some points are right on, a considerable part of the story is fiction and some of the facts in the film are dead wrong (unambiguously and easily ascertainable), but most stories, if not all, are. Nothing special about that. Why do many people find exactly this story bad? Simply because of the fact that it is believed to undermine these same people's religious beliefs. But religion itself is based on beliefs, and never the whole truth. This lies within the fundamental definition of what we call religion. Myths are not seldom more true. But that is all irrelevant. Religion itself brings that people will always bend the truth or intermix truth with facts, even facts which are out of place, out of time, or both. Nothing new or spectacular about that. What is spectacular, that this is possibly the most interesting time in recent history in a way that many people start to rethink the whole Christian beliefs. And the fact that the Judas gospel was published also this year, helped tremendously in the process. That process of rethinking belief, that alone is valuable. Many critics wrote from this belief: if you are a fundamentalist Christian, you will most likely hate Brown's book, the film and its message. And if you hate the church, chances are that you love it (I can't think of another reason why over half (616) of the 1176 voters to this instant I write this review, valued this film with a 10 out of 10 (no film in history is worth this)). But both opinions don't count for much, if you ask me, because they are prejudiced ans biased and nothing good ever came from those sentiments. And I can really do without critics who claim you go to hell if you go out and see the film. Hey buddy, I know about hell, I live in The Netherlands... -spoilers after this- Was the a historic person called Jesus the Christ? Probably, but not certainly. Was Jesus the Christ married with Maria Magdalena? Possibly. If yes, did they have children? Possibly. And is Maria Magdalena buried under the Louvre? Unlikely. And is Tatou a direct descendant of Maria Magdalena and Jesus? Very unlikely. Did the Catholic church try to hide Christ's bloodline? I don't think so. Does the church know much more than they say? Certainly. Did the church commit genocide over and over for unholy reasons? Absolutely. Is the new testament complete? Most certainly not - even the translations contain dreadful mistakes. Were there indeed more than 100 gospels instead of 4? Very likely. Is half of Dan Brown's book fantasy? Most likely, yes, but also half is most likely true. but that is again not the issue here. The issue is that if you do have a sufficiently long attention span, if you do have an open mind and if you do have more than half a brain, you may very well enjoy this film. And never stop thinking, no matter who informs you: The Priest, The Politician, The Legislator, The Judge, The Scientist, The Teacher, The Novelist, Mr Gates or the critic. Just never stop thinking..."

I never felt like there was much ""code breaking"" or deep thought involved by any of the characters and It annoyed me the way that things were illuminated as Tom hanks concentrated on them. It felt like it was for idiots to identify where he came up with his conclusions. The acting was very good in regards to all characters but I did feel that Jean Reno was underused and Paul Bettany as Silas wasn't as great as the media have lead us to believe. Sure the monk was misguided but it didn't feel like he really cared that much about finding the keystone/grail...whatever. I felt that everything in the movie was a bit rushed, and the differences in the story from that of the book, just didn't feel right. It kinda went off on a tangent at the end and I felt like a lot of questions went unanswered. The grail guardians also didn't look like they'd stand up to much with the majority of them a few years short of zimmer frames.

The 'mysterious' clues and riddles which were ludicrously simple to decipher in the book (none of the three supposedly great intellects in the book could work out that Newton's orb was the apple that fell on his head? Please!) were, if anything, spelled out even more. The dialogue was stilted and unintentionally funny with audience members at the screening I attended laughing at moments intended as high drama. I believe this was also the case at its premiere in Cannes where they know a thing or two about movies. Ron Howard, a director I have great respect for, got it wrong on just about every level, most notably by resorting to the same visual gimmickry he employed in A Beautiful Mind in an attempt to make sure everyone got what was going on. Don't worry, Ron, we got it alright - you made sure of that! All in all, this is one of those films all involved will look back on and wonder what might've been.

I don't have enough room to write about Tom Hanks' ridiculous haircut (Professor of symbology? Media studies, more like) or the non-existent chemistry between him and his French sidekick - whose character, somewhat ridiculously, has to be portrayed as completely clueless in order for the film to spoon-feed lessons to the audience to make sure they're up on the plot.<br/><br/>It all makes me glad I didn't pay to go and see this, a small consolation given that I'd already been drawn into wading through Dan Brown's book (for heaven's sake, man, overexcited schoolboy prose does NOT a novel make).<br/><br/>Poor Ron Howard had an unenviable task to turn this scrag-mutton into something watchable and, to be fair, the end result of this film-making-by-numbers would probably have been passable - if only we hadn't been led to believe we'd all be going straight to hell drenched in petrol if we didn't agree that this twist on The Greatest Story Ever Told was, er, the greatest story ever told.<br/><br/>Of course, writing this is probably a waste of time.

","I won't get much into the theological and historical aspects of either the novel or the film ""The Da Vinci Code"" because basically, I'd just ramble and would end nowhere. But one thing's clear: the tremendous calls for boycott and banning of the film in our country, the Philippines, isn't really necessary as the film version barely makes the claims of the book any more credible.<br/><br/>With Dan Brown's best-selling novel becoming a worldwide phenomenon, tremendous expectations abound, so it seems natural for director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman to feel a great pressure to transfer a faithful adaptation to the big screen. They did remain faithful, but as with other book-to-film adaptations, you can only include so much and still leave a lot lying on the cutting room floor. This film is essentially a crash course of the novel where everything feels so rushed and we don't really care about the characters. I have read the novel almost two years ago (and subsequently, I've read two books that try to refute the ""lies"" fabricated by Dan Brown). I found the book pedestrian at best, nonetheless a real page-turner. The movie is a three-hour dull exposition that not even the chase scenes can't manage to save.<br/><br/>You probably know the plot as much as anyone else, but here goes: Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a Harvard Religious Symbology professor who is called upon by the French police after the curator of the Louvre has been murdered, leaving with him clues to centuries-old secrets supposedly hidden by Leonardo Da Vinci in some of his works. These messages are said to be so powerful it can shake the foundations of Christianity. Together with a French cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou), they try to figure out the clues while running from the French police across the streets of France to the Rosslyn Chapel to the Westminster Abbey.<br/><br/>The film certainly tantalizes us with an intriguing beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first see the murder at the Louvre. Soon after we meet Langdon and he's called while signing books (in the novel, he was called in his hotel in the dead of the night). He's then thrust into a labyrinthine of puzzles and clues, into Goldsman's soggy exposition that never really trying to flesh out any of the characters for the sake of fitting as much subplots of the book as possible. It might have worked as a miniseries or, heck, even as a two-part movie. But here, the pacing of the story is very uneven.<br/><br/>After their pairing for the Academy Award-winning film ""A Beautiful Mind,"" many were waiting for Howard and Goldsman to bring a sense of thrill to the story. ""The Da Vinci Code"" contains flat, yet likable characters and a rich palette of lush, inventive puzzles. Unfortunately, the film lacks that edge. It's missing the thrilling elements of Brown's novel. Howard does weave some memorable scenes, but the sum is much less than each individual part.<br/><br/>The film does end by asking one important question about faith that somehow was never addressed in the book. Unfortunately the film overall lacks depth to fully substantiate its thesis. There isn't really an emotional thrust to the mystery because we don't know enough about the leads. It lacks a solid foundation altogether. The screenplay spends so much time in placing the characters from one puzzle to puzzle with not much excitement and too much arbitrary exposition to say (though it does seem fun to see Ian McKellen do that lecture). The chase scenes aren't adrenaline-pumping either. And then we're given with grainy flashbacks of the early Christians, the Knights Templar, etc. The novel has all the pages to expound on that; the movie has just two and a half hours.<br/><br/>Despite that, I don't think it would diminish the anticipation for the film. I saw this film a couple of nights ago in Thailand and the theater was fully-packed (most of them were Europeans). ""The Da Vinci Code"" is sure to be an altogether different experience, especially if one has read the book. And those who are not willing to ""compromise"" their faith for the movie's worth may not be enticed the same way as those who are. Then again, in the greater scheme of things, there's no need for a boycott. Whatever controversial message the film tries to say, it does so unconvincingly."

","The novel starts from a preposterous premise, that certain people in this day and age would be willing to kill or be killed for a ""secret"" that would turn the world upside down. And what's this secret? That Jesus wasn't so chaste after all. So what? That's a story that's been around for ages, nothing secret about it. Still, the book sold millions. No idea why. It was poorly written, poorly researched and boring. That doesn't necessarily mean it cannot result in a good film. Good books have been made into lousy films and vice versa. But here we have a case of lousy book made into even lousier movie. Poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly photographed and utterly dull. So, no redeeming factors? Well, maybe you'll find it hilarious, although it certainly wasn't the intention of the deadly serious movie makers, when you see Forrest Gump asking Amélie Poulain: So, how does it feel that Jesus is your grand grand grand daddy?"
"alex430","2","55","112","18 May 2006"," What Happened?
","First, I want to address the few comments I've seen from people who say, ""Don't rag on the movie, it hasn't even come out yet."" Well, most of the reviews are from today and yesterday. The movie has indeed come out in Europe, where most of the current reviewers are from. And yes, I have actually seen the film.<br/><br/>I admit I went into this movie with high expectations. After all, with an incredibly talented cast and director, what could possibly go wrong? I think Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors of our generation, and I thought he would do the role justice. I adore Audrey Tautou, and I think Ian McKellen is great in everything he's in. <br/><br/>But boy, oh, boy did they have little to work with. The dialog was mechanical and almost read like a bad after school special script or a PSA. I think most of the problems in this movie were caused by the sceenwriter, though. <br/><br/>Character development is super weak throughout the film, the changes made from the novel were mostly stupid and pointless. It did feel rushed, although with so much ground to cover, I'm sure it was difficult to come up with the concepts they did use. <br/><br/>As far as the good, well, aside from the corny elements, Ian McKellen was superb, as usual. He's just such a good actor, though, and makes the character of Teabing come alive. Even better than McKellen, though, was Paul Bettany. I can honestly say I've never seen him in a movie, but I was blown away by his performance. He was perfect for the role, and I'm glad to see he's getting a lot of kudos for his performance. <br/><br/>**SPOILERS SECTION***************************************************** Why on earth did they feel the need to change fundamental aspects of the story. From what I can tell from the early reviews, I seem to be one of the few people who noticed how radically they departed from the novel with regard to ""spilling the secrets"" of the Holy Grail. In the novel, Teabing's story is incredible. It is difficult to grasp. Sophie Neveu turns to Langdon to confirm the story Teabing is telling her, which he does. He does NOT question Teabing's account of the Council of Nicea. In the movie, though, what the heck happened? Langdon practically screams at Teabing when Teabing says the Council determined the divinity of Christ. <br/><br/>In addition, the movie doesn't expound on Langdon's true knowledge of the Priory, the Grail, and the history of the Church. Instead, he defers to Teabing and acts almost as surprised as Sophie when presented with certain pieces of knowledge. This NEVER happened in the book. I think this is really, really, really important, because Langdon gives Teabing's claims credibility in the novel. To have Langdon play Devil's Advocate in the film cheapens the story and actually makes the plot much weaker (I could probably write an essay on this alone). I want to clarify that I am well aware that this is a work of FICTION. Yes, I get it. But Langdon's agreement with Teabing on the history and potential threat of the Church is vital to the plot of the novel. Without it, Teabing's hypothesis comes across as the ramblings of a madman. While many of the ideas Dan Brown has put forth in the novel are not entirely historically accurate, they are an integral part of the plot and shouldn't be cast aside because they may be offensive to some people. <br/><br/>All in all, I thought the filmmakers gave into public outrage and smoothed over the ""offensive"" parts or cut them out entirely. I guess this is a victory for all the ignorant people who never even bothered to read the novel, but it's a shame in my opinion. To me, it's the principle. It may sound dumb, but it bothered me so much that I really did want to walk out halfway through. BUT, all this of course is just my opinion."

The film is an excuse for a merciless criticism to Catholic religion , the only one apparently can be criticized . It's plenty of theories for nuts , this is an old wives' tale . There's virtually no empirical proof and venturing into the even more bizarre theory about relationship between Christ and Mary Magdalena .

","Despite the almost universal criticism I heard about this film I went to see it for myself - and I'm glad i did. The critics have it all wrong and i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. It is not the best film ever made but nor is it the awful failure some have made it out to be. Apart from the penultimate scene it is remarkably faithful to the book, so you are not in for any major surprises. As an avid reader of both the Harry Potter books and the Da Vinci Code I would say that the D.V.C movie was much more enjoyable to watch and was more successful than the HP films. No major chunks were omitted nor many embellishments made. It was like watching the book come to life and makes it much easier to understand.<br/><br/>In my opinion the film slightly toned down the anti-Christian ideas in the book while remaining faithful to the plot of the book. The tweaked penultimate scene even plugs Christianity and the love of Jesus. However the overall message remains the same as the book.<br/><br/>I would say all the cast did a great job, Silas was suitably scary and Ian McKellen made the perfect English gentleman. I would urge everyone to go and make their minds up for themselves - I really think the critics have got it wrong this time. Overall it was better than i thought ****"

But Langdon finds that this is much bigger than a murder case and that his own life is in danger. He could be instrumental in revealing the biggest cover-up in human history.<br/><br/>I thought this was a really good film, very much like 'National Treasure'. This is a much more serious movie based upon the best-selling book by Dan Brown. I am told that the movie is quite different than the book. About half the people I know who read the book did not like it.<br/><br/>I did not read the book, but watching the movie makes me want to read it.

Otherwise it was a snorefest - I think Ron had gone for thickshakes with the Fonz at Arnolds. It was a very tedious tale (2.5 hrs) with next to nothing in terms of plot and character development and story you just had to laugh at to make it bearable. Sadly the hype for the film was necessary in order to sell the flop that it was. I cannot say I have read the book but even without that the translation was ridiculous. There were plenty of laboured and unnecessary scenes - in particular the Swiss Bank series - we were in stitches. Overall - avoid like the plague"

Howard has obviously no feeling for dramatic flow, most of the time, it's just Hanks or McKellen talking and Tatou listening to them in awe, her big eyes all open. Many scenes are simply clunky, with no feeling for suspense or mystery. Most of the actors just stand around with nothing to do, only McKellen's performance is fun to watch.<br/><br/>Much ado about nothing, really."

"Pasafist","2","36","72","19 May 2006"," If I had to sum THE DAVINCI CODE up in one word, it would be lackluster
","If I had to sum THE DAVINCI CODE up in one word, it would be lackluster. It's the kind of movie that will have its defenders. But for the most part, they will be defending Dan Brown's Novel, not Ron Howard's movie. It's not that the film is incompetent. It just doesn't try hard enough. It sits there never quite compelling you to do anything but watch it. It's a thriller with very little thrills.<br/><br/>Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), Harvard University's most gifted Symbologist, is in Paris giving a lecture on his new book. When he is accidentally thrown into the middle of a murder investigation, in which he is the prime suspect. His only allies are Sophie Neveu, the murdered man's granddaughter, and Sir Leigh Teabing, an eccentric Brit with a passion for the holy grail. Langdon must outrun an over zealous police chief (Jean Reno), a psychotic Albino Monk (Paul Bettany), and a mysterious man called only The Teacher. In the process he stumbles over the biggest mystery of our age: just what is the Holy Grail? Director Ron Howard does his best to keep us interested in the story. It's been simplified and changed drastically from the source material, probably so that modern moviegoers can grasp the material a little easier. The thing that surprised me most about the changes in the story, were how they dramatically changed Robert Langdon's character motivations. The Langdon of Dan Brown's famous novel is an expert in the Grail symbology and goes as far as to defend it to Sophie. In the film he plays more of the Devil's Advocate questioning more and going as far as to call most of it bunk. This changes the end of the film dramatically taking a bit of real passion out of it. In essence you're left with a postmodern twist on the story that zaps a lot of meaning out of the plot.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman script shies away from the controversy of Dan Brown's book, it feels as if the producers sensed a boycott and got cold feet. I think it hurts the film. Honestly, if your going to court controversy you should jump full in. If not you've lost the battle. Now I wished I hadn't slaved through Brown's book. The film doesn't fill you with much desire to read the book it's based on.<br/><br/>On a purely cinematic level it fails because it's not all that compelling. None of the characters are drawn full enough for you to care about them. They are lost in a film that has a point A and a point B, but the journey to get there is paved with boring car chases, fake drama, sloppy gun play and incredibly stilted reveals. No one seems to have any honest motivation, and problems are solved but not explained. For instance Langdon and Sophie have this thing called a cryptex, they need to solve a code to get a piece of paper out of it. But instead of showing us how Langdon figured out the code it just jumps to him solving it.<br/><br/>My favorite moment was when Langdon and Sophie need to get to a library to figure out a riddle. In Dan Brown's novel they spend hours in a library, in the film Sophie borrows some random guy's cell phone and they figure it out on a bus. I chuckled.<br/><br/>All in all THE DAVINCI CODE is the kind of movie that's made to cash in on one of the most popular books in recent history. Its got star power, its got a big name director, its got a giant budget. But it's missing a human touch. It's missing a central heart. It's not a film about people. It's a film that just sits there and then fades to black. Amidst the controversy, amidst the hype, the boycotts, and the millions it will rake in at the box-office THE DAVINCI CODE is much ""ado about nothing."""

","From reading the reviews so far, it seems to me that the most scathing reviews are from people who also didn't like the book.

The direction was good, and the cinematography was excellent. I think the film's drawbacks are directly related to the difficulties inherent in adapting a novel to a screenplay, and particularly a novel that is as didactic as this one. There was a lot of explanation in the book, and it would have been impossible to include it all in the film version. I think they did the best they could to balance the need to explain what's going on and the need to keep the film under three hours.<br/><br/>There are those, of course, who are offended at the premise of the original novel, and they should not be expected to like the film. There are also those who didn't like the movie on its merits as a film. They're certainly entitled to their opinion. For my part, I don't see how anyone could have done much better bringing this particular book to the big screen."
"jon2005","7","26","50","24 May 2006"," The Da Vinci Code
","The controversy surrounding The Da Vinci Code hardly needs to be introduced. It seemed that very few people were actually going to give the film the benefit of the doubt, while most would criticize it before seeing it. Of course, many more of these critics had not read the book either, and so were pleasantly ignored by the 60 million and more people who went out and bought the book.<br/><br/>When I read the book, I accepted it for what it was  a pulp novel. The kind of book you take on holiday to read while you're at the airport. It wasn't wholly convincing, but I thought it was great fun to read, and very cinematic in style. The writing wasn't classic, but the pace of the novel was such that these points could be overlooked. It wasn't surprising that a film would be made given the book's success and despite initial critical reaction what we are given is, while not perfect, a solid adaptation of the book that will at least give the audience plenty of food for thought.<br/><br/>This is no National Treasure though. If you're looking for adventure and daring action then look to that film. This is a different beast, instead preferring the slow build up approach to story-telling - it is to the mystery/thriller genre what V for Vendetta is to the action genre. Most of the important parts of the book are when the characters are sat around a table talking. This immediately doesn't sound like it could translate to the screen that effectively, but there are enough nice touches to keep the audience interested.<br/><br/>First of all, the story itself, whilst not necessarily historically accurate, it is still absorbing and it genuinely makes you wonder about the truth behind the religion. There are also some nice visual flairs, including some well shot flashbacks, and the way Robert Langdon (Hanks) visualises the unscrambling of the codes is a great way to show the inner workings of is mind. At first it may seem silly but there is very little choice as to how to portray someone thinking. Hanks himself is passable in the role, but is not really given anything meaty to do. However, the same can be said of a lot of the cast, and this is purely down to the fact that the plot is moving too fast, and giving out too much information, to be able to dive into character exposition. Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing is wonderful as a slightly eccentric English Grail expert, and gives a lively performance, which helps considerably given that most of his role is to explain everything to Langdon and Sophie Neveu (Tautou). Paul Bettany plays against type to play the murderous monk Silas, and he will make you wince with his self-flagellation scenes. The other cast members are all satisfactory but nothing special, again because of the speed of the story.<br/><br/>There are a couple of chase scenes which are supposed to be tense, but they turn out rather lacklustre, and one scene near the end comes off as daft (no spoilers, but people get saved by a pigeon, of all things!). The plot may be hard to follow at times, especially if you haven't read the book, so full attention will be needed; however, if you have read the book, the film sticks very closely to the story, omitting some parts for timing reasons, and it is now that we realise why the Da Vinci Code is how it is  the film-makers couldn't do much else with it, as the tone and content of the book has to be retained for it to be a faithful translation: what suffers in the book suffers in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, The Da Vinci Code is worth seeing, if only to see what all the fuss was about. If I was the Catholic Church, though, I would be more concerned with the religious violence portrayed in the film than with the outcome of the plot, which can try all it likes to challenge established dogma but most likely won't succeed because people know the book and film are fiction. Keep that it mind when you see it  don't take it literally and chances are you will enjoy it that much more. At two and a half hours it is a tad too long, and can be confusing to first time viewers, but it is definitely thought provoking, and a mostly worthy adaptation of the book.<br/><br/>Rated: 7/10 <br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

The plot in the novel was actually laughingly and stupidly convoluted, but masked by the interesting discussion of symbolic meanings in Renaissance art.

The curator is murdered in the Louvre. While any sensible person would have been saying prayers or writing a coherent note about his killer, this fellow performs more self mutilation and spends his last moments constructing an anagram and puzzle clues for his niece. It sold in the book - it comes across as preposterous as it is in the movie.<br/><br/>This is the first time in forever I can remember Tom Hanks dialing in a performance.

"drew-225","1","36","74","24 May 2006"," Terrible, terrible, terrible
","I nearly walked out of the theater- it was that bad. There were several reasons why. First, Tom Hanks. He's cute. He's harmless. He's like a playful little puppy. What he is NOT is a sexy Ivy League scholar/grail seeker a la Indiana Jones. The delivery of lines that should have made his character appear informed and intelligent came out stilted and halting instead. Even the addition of his near-mullet couldn't stop me from expecting him to yell ""WIIIILSOOOON!"" or spit out ""Stupid is as stupid does, Sir Leigh."" Second, the slight character changes. In the book, Sophie is educated, intelligent, and independent. She kicks butt and takes names. But Sophie was seriously dumbed-down for the movie- probably in order to make Hanks/Langdon look more intelligent, which didn't work. Sophie the character in the movie actually *whines* ""Can you solve it???"" which is completely out of line with the strength that Sophie the character in the book has.<br/><br/>Also in the book, Langdon is fairly well versed in Grail study, and appears to accept if not support the thesis. In the movie- likely to make it more palatable to religious groups- he's a skeptic. His non-belief makes the whole plot line awkward. If he doesn't believe in at least some of this stuff, why does he continue to pursue it? Third- the interaction of Tatou and Hanks. The dynamics were underwhelming. No chemistry whatsoever. They may as well have been interacting with a blue screen.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of the book, and was really looking forward to the movie. I was woefully disappointed- it really could have been done so much better. Perhaps if someone other than Opie and Forrest had been behind it..."

"daria84","1","35","72","21 May 2006"," Now I understand the need for so much publicity
","This movie needed the publicity to get people to see it. And with that and trailers and all of that, you could get the idea that was going to be one of those movies that you'd have to see at the movies, at least, 2 times. I went to the movies to see it with high high expectations, boy was I disappointed or what? Bad acting, bad dialoge, weak script, and looooooooooooooong, by the near end of the movie all I could think was ""please roll credits!"" <br/><br/>I know it was a thriller, but I think they sold the idea of the whole ""Christ is not what you think he is"" so much that all we cared about was that, an explanation. The rest was just filling. I think the whole explanation is about 30 mins and the rest is them getting chased by cops.<br/><br/>I'd have to say that the only one with a good performance was Sir Ian McKellen, he was good and believable, well Paul Bettany was good too, not great. Tom Hanks disappointed me so much, it's the first time I have to complain about his acting. You couldn't believe him for a second. And Audrey Tatou either, she was terrible! jean Reno was all right, not bad but not great either.<br/><br/>I'm a Catholic and the reason I say this movie is bad has nothing to do with the concept of the movie, as a matter of fact, I found it quite interesting, plus I don't care what people say or don't say or he Church or whatever about Jesus, you either believe or you don't, it's up to you and it depends on how easy is to manipulate your faith. <br/><br/>Go and see this movie or wait until it comes out to video, and ""find out the truth"" The Da Vinci code is a lame movie."
"toshlad_uk","8","24","47","27 June 2006"," Excellent, but it is only a movie after all!
","It's become the fashionable thing to knock this movie; it's as if people go into the cinema actually wanting to hate it! After all the hype I finally got to see the film. I love the book, being a great fan of conspiracy theories and a good ripping yarn, so I was straight off to the cinema as soon as I could after it opened.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that you know the critics are going to hate simply because of the hype and the publicity surrounding it. Being a subscriber to satellite T.V. the schedules were bombarded and chock full of Da Vinci Code documentaries either agreeing or disagreeing with the theories in the novel. I must admit I found it amusing watching certain religious types being up in arms about the book and literary types being sniffy and snobbish because how dare a book be so popular as to have the great unwashed reading!!! As expected the critics panned it, the academics hated it and all of them missed the point. It's a NOVEL, not a historical documentary! Everyone should get over themselves and appreciate it for what it is. A popcorn thriller and a bloody good one at that! Some chunks are missing because you can never fit the full book into the film but it doesn't detract from your enjoyment or understanding of the plot.<br/><br/>The central performances are solid and it looks as if Ian McKellen is having an absolute ball hamming it up as Sir Leigh Teabing. The script is okay without being stellar but it grips you in all the right places as a good thriller should. It may not be on anyone's best ever movie list but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a good adaptation well worth two and a half hours of anyone's time. Don't be led into not liking it because it's fashionable to, watch it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed, but it won't change your life. Well it is fiction, isn't it?!"

","I have read the Dan Brown novel twice in the last two years and with great interest each time. The last viewing of the big screen version was plain laughable and left me wondering of how i was robbed of my precious time and money.<br/><br/>Ron Howard left much to be desired when it came to portray crucial, nail-biting and intense fictional parts. For those who are familiar with the book, it will be apparent of how slow and bland the action is as opposed to the smooth and catchy literary work of Brown.<br/><br/>Actors are well matched to the expected feel of the book characters with the exception of Tom Hanks, who does not suit well as the brainy Robert Langdon, a frail , but nevertheless courageous scientist. Sophie Nouveau character is done especially well and deserves a separate credit for a great performance amidst bland and uninspiring ones.<br/><br/>Altogether this depiction trails for too long to redeem itself from the utter mess it crawls into and just bombs in comparison with the book. This is one 'secret code' you can live without.<br/><br/>The film deserves five stars just on the basis of sheer financial investment and magnitude that went into mirroring the book's text. Otherwise, it feels underachieved and pressed for real amusement."
"SoncoChairman","1","36","76","20 May 2006"," Here's the secret to the DaVinci Code... IT SUCKS!
","I just came back from seeing the film and I couldn't be more disappointed. I am not some religious addict or a freedom fighter for albinos, nor am I a purist who demands that the movie stay close to the book (which it most certainly does, to an awful degree). The problem with the movie is that Ron Howard was so preoccupied with trying to stay as close to the novel as possible that he forgot to tell his own story. I have enjoyed as many of Howard's films as I have disliked, but I thought he knew what he was doing with this one. It seemed like a the first cut of the film. There was no focus, everything was jumbled together and squeezed into a very long 2 1/2 hours. He should have gone the simple route and focused on the plot, not try to deepen the characters with an excessive use of flashbacks. The story is what people loved about the book, the hunt for clues, not understanding Langdon's claustrophobia or Sophie's personal issues. It's the story that was fascinating and Ron Howard forgot about that. Also, there was no suspense. It was predictable and dull. Not even during the car chases was there ever a moment of pure excitement. Truly the biggest surprise at the end of the DaVinci Code was indeed that it sucks."

","After all the hoopla given the subject matter, calls for censorship by opposing parties and buildup to its release in general, what we are presented with is a poor effort at film-making which is insulting to the audience's intelligence. I'll spare the plot outlines since practically everyone and their mother has read the book. Personally, I did not read Dan Brown's novel, but I was familiar with the theories presented prior to its release.<br/><br/>The two lead actors, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou, do a laughable job of portraying their respecting characters. Stoicism is the best adjective to use here.<br/><br/>The story as is shown in the movie lacks any sort of urgent rhythm to it, this despite a script that features a Europe hopping context. Hanks and Tatou go here and there, do this and that, all the while every single detail is said to the viewer as if one were in kindergarten. <br/><br/>""We must find the secret to the Holy Grail because my grandfather died for it."" <br/><br/>""Right, allow me to crack the code verbally and visually so a two year old could understand it. <br/><br/>""Following that we have to go to Scotland in order to use da Vinci's device on stone tablet, which remember, unlocks the secret of Mary Magdalene."" <br/><br/>""I really think this can be done in only a few days with practically no sleep.""<br/><br/>Granted, the book's complexity required explanatory prose, yet the end result is so tediously laid on that the film is chock full of uninteresting dialogue. When the theories are presented, the counter-theories are declared at the same instant, apparently concluding the audience is too lazy or stupid make up their own minds. Controversial source material such as this should be said with conviction by the filmmakers, whether the viewer believes it is right or wrong, and not give politically correct garbage as not to offend anyone. A perfect example is Oliver Stone's JFK, where a clear message is conveyed and doesn't hide its viewpoint for the sake of agreeable cinema. <br/><br/>The European locations are a tourist's wet dream, historically and visually appealing. However, the cinematography comes off as more like a TV commercial than actual cinema, foregoing any form of stylishness for mundane images.<br/><br/>However, Ian McKellen is the only one to get it right in this god awful mess. His dramatics are at their usual best, despite said dialogue and the rest of the movie being so inferior. Bettany too does a reasonable job as Silas, though emotional exaggeration does occur from time to time. Their screen time alone influenced my decision to not give a worse score.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code perfectly captures what casual entertainment represents, avoiding boldness whatsoever. What a waste."

","Just watched an advance preview of this movie.<br/><br/>Damn, you westerners certainly get to watch earlier, even though we belong in the 'faster' time-zone.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a review for someone who ACTUALLY watched the movie - not read the novel before, and not just post comments which should have been posted in the message boards in the first place.<br/><br/>The initial impression when I watched the film was how oppressively dark the movie was - I meant since almost 3/4 of the film took place at night, it stretches the believability factor some what. How can you run around France, and solving clues, evading the police and opening safe deposit boxes etc and yet it's still night? But still, I like the movie, though I wish the pacing can be faster - the momentum is lost. I believe Ron Howard is trying to squeeze as much of the source material as he can into the movie. And he also added elements of debate between Robert and Teabing so that the audience know that, the theories that were brought up are just that theories. Remember people it's a work of FICTION! But I can see why some people from the Church will be upset. It put them in a very bad light - as murderous, deviant and would do anything to protect their faith, even obfuscating the truth - the holy bloodline theory would be blasphemous to say the least.<br/><br/>As for comment on acting, I would say the story overshadows everything. There's a lot of dialogue to wade thru, so much so there really isn't much room for the actors to truly shine. Though it's refreshing to see Sir Ian Mckellen in a villainous role.<br/><br/>So folks, I think it's an entertainment movie. Worth the price of a movie ticket for sure."

","This is a bad movie that would have otherwise been completely overlooked (even given the cast and the director) had it not been for the book that it so religiously follows in almost every frame. Its sole purpose is to rake in the cash, but I am not sure it is going to do so. I confess my judgment on the movie would have been different had it not been for the director's abominable avoidance of risk-taking and his evident playing-it-safe attitude. Paradoxically, in this way the movie is completely opposite to the book - it is aptly made but unentertaining while the book is an interesting read, if a completely obnoxious one littered with quasi-scientific and quasi-historical BS. If you haven't read the book there's really no need to see the movie because it is really dull. If you have read the book seeing the movie will only leave you cold and disappointed.

"jsmits","8","18","35","29 May 2006"," Good summary
","Hollywood has its limitations. They dislike dialog. Well, The Da Vinci Code book contains lots of puzzles that need to be presented, explored, solved and explained. Ron Howard does an admirable job in condensing these parts of the book a bit, and stretching the chases and escapes a tad, and thus creating a very consumable ""summary"", ""reader's digest"" of Dan Brown's book. I saw lots of movies of this length that were boring at times, but The Da Vinci Code is entertaining and interesting from the start. Tom Hanks adds another type of character to his long list. Also admirable for a Hollywood movie is the use of original language: English, Latin and French. The only scene where they probably messed up was in the church dialog with the nun, but I would have to re-read the book to see if maybe I am mistaken."

"chowdhmi","2","6","9","23 May 2006"," Literal film version of the book. Pity it's not in chapters.
","Unfortunately, the biggest thing The DaVinci Code had going for it was that it was a book.<br/><br/>It deals with an awful lot of pseudo-history and religious reference that takes a lot of going through. This is fine if you're reading a book - pick it up, read a chapter, put it down.<br/><br/>You can't do that if you watch a movie at the cinema. You are forced to endure the whole lot in one sitting, and with this film, that's like being force-fed cement.<br/><br/>This film is, admittedly, an almost perfect translation of the book. Everything is in there and, having visited Temple Church, Rosslyn Chapel, the Louvre and Newton's tomb, I have to say, it looks exactly as I envisioned it when I read the novel. A pity about the cast though.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks - Not at ALL what I pictured Langdon to be. I saw him as more bookish and distinguished. Certainly not the anonymous, slightly lumpy-faced nobody that Hanks is. His acting was average, but in no way spectacular or Oscar-winning (Bad luck, Tom. Better luck next movie) Audrey Tautou - Wooden. Spends half the movie with a silly half-pout on her face, shaking her head in disbelief, muttering exclamations in French under her breath (encore, 'Incroyable!'). Having watched her in Amelie and seen how wonderfully expressive and emotional this talented actress can be, this is a real low point for her and I hope she is suitably mature to be able to say at a later date that she was only in this because she is the most familiar Franch actress to the worldwide movie-going public at present and that she is not proud of the performance. Jean Reno - Another stable, typical but ultimately unsatisfying performance from Reno. Nothing to write home about here, although I nearly laughed when he starts crying in the aircraft hangar after confessing to a colleague (who is already aware of the fact) that he is a member of Opus Dei and that he feels he has failed God!!! Reno doesn't cry. He shouldn't cry. His tear ducts were removed at birth. Paul Bettany - Considering his character is so one-dimensional and unsympathetic, Bettany does a good job. Achieving some small pathos as the albino assassin-monk and delivering lines in Latin with a decent accent for the entire film. Not too sure about the dodgy contact lenses, but, hey, that's the effects department's fault. Al Molina - Great performance from a very underrated actor. Far improved from his pitiful Doctor Octopus in Spiderman 2, Molina conveyed a pretty good sense of religious power doing everything it can to maintain a rigid grip over the sheep it leads. Ian McKellen - OK. Where do I start. This film degenerated into comedy whenever he was on screen. Having seen McKellen on stage many times in the last 20 years I am disappointed that he now chooses some of the hammiest roles offered him in Hollywood. Better than Magneto in X-Men, not as good as Gandalf in Lord Of The Rings, his character in the book didn't come across at all as his interpretation on screen. I did fel, however that he does deserve some commendation for lightening this film, which would be truly turgid and sluggish without some comic relief which he supplied in buckets.<br/><br/>So, if you've read the book, you know exactly what to expect. If you haven't you'll be either a) Laughing out loud at the ridiculous premise of the entire story (If you know anything at all about the sorts of religious mythology and symbolism being served up here) or b) Bored out of your mind trying to remember who's good, who's bad, what's going on, what the symbolism means, wondering if you've missed something.<br/><br/>A great film for being true to the book, but as a stand alone movie, dull and uninspiring."

","So I sat, with my drink and popcorn in hand, waiting to see a movie about a book I never read. The audience chattered away, and the people next to me kept commenting how they hoped this movie would do the book justice.<br/><br/>After the credits ran, I was plunged into a world with so much exposition in it that I couldn't tell whether or not I was watching a fictional movie, or watching a reading of a script done by actors who normally do good jobs but this time around proceed to seriously lack ANY emotion (with the exception of Sir Ian Mack, shine on Sir, shine on).<br/><br/>At what would be the movies many tense dramatic points, I couldn't help but sneer, as to the sheer cockiness of Tom Hanks' character when explaining an integral plot point.<br/><br/>The script was sloppy. It was like watching someone on screen say ""We need people to understand how and why we're acting the way we are, so here's how and why, we hope you don't get lost for the remainder of the film"" The movie National Treasure, with Nick Cage, does a better job at explaining the whole Templar thing. Now, yes, they are coming from two different view points, but at least I wasn't hoping for it to end. With this I couldn't care less about what they were doing or why. There just wasn't enough motivation it seemed, either that or the actors did a horrible job of portraying it.<br/><br/>How many endings does a story like this need? 1? 2? well I lost count...and that's not good. Not since The Return Of The King have I seen so many people get up, then sit back down because they thought the movie was over.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this to anyone, fans of the book especially, for this film, sadly, is not worth your time, or mine."

It is right up there with Heaven's Gate, or Antony and Cleopatra, in terms of how much money, intelligence and talent was expended for so bad a result. Just a few instances: Paul Bettany's naked bottom, yet again. In case we had not seen enough of this in The Knight's Tale (where at least it was deployed to great humorous effect -- as a long-time Chaucer scholar, I can tell you that the naked Chaucer was worth a thousand dull articles) we see it not just once, not twice, but -- oh, I stopped looking after a while. And just in case we had not got the message, that this was one weird monk: we saw him whipping himself and the blood dripping off his leg again, and again, and in case we had not got the message, yet again. And what sort of brilliant direction is it, that EVERY TIME some historical event is mentioned (Mary Magdalen at the cross, Constantine, etc) we got to have a full-blown flashback, done in swirly oh-this-is-the-past colours? And who wrote a script that managed to make the dull patches and longueurs in the book even duller and longer? As for the actors: Hanks and Tatou looked plain bored throughout, with a total lack of chemistry between them; McKellen provided the film's only bright moments, and that was it. Finally, I did something I have never done in films before: I did not go to sleep; I just STOPPED WATCHING. I did not see the last fifteen minutes.

I somehow thought that the movie can be much more alluring and gaudier, however, in this case I was apparently mistaken.<br/><br/>The story is about some religious mystery that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) , who is an experienced person in the ancient symbols, tries to solve it.
In my opinion the movie failed to show the gothic aesthetic of Europe , it is as though the story was more focused on indicating the modern aspect of the cities.<br/><br/>When the main actor is Tom Hanks along with the music composer Hans Zimmer, we have to hold our judgments in abeyance, so did I.

"Leofwine_draca","3","2","2","4 June 2016"," Terrible adaptation of a terrible book
","I was left feeling underwhelmed by Dan Brown's bestselling novel, but nevertheless went to see the film version with high hopes. Sadly, I was left watching a totally lacklustre movie that forgets some of the fundamental rules of film-making; for instance, making the storyline interesting, pacy and exciting, all golden elements that director Ron Howard totally bypasses. Look back over this guy's filmography, I realise that, out of all his films, I've only ever enjoyed two, which were RANSOM and WILLOW. Both had a zest and sparkle which is sadly lacking in this bloated, over long blockbuster.<br/><br/>The list of faults which this film possesses is an endless one the music is derivative, the script cheesy and unappealing (Hanks delivering the line ""you are the last living descendant of Jesus Christ"" is hands-down one of the worst lines in movie history). Howard is so keen to avoid upsetting anyone that all of the controversy surrounding certain passages in the novel disappears, and we're left with a boring run-through instead. Also, this guy has no idea of pace. After the movie climaxes at around the 1 hour 45 minute mark, we've got yet another FIFTY minutes of boring exposition to sit through. It really tests the patience.<br/><br/>Even Howard himself seems to get bored with his film at times – witness the shots of Hanks and Tautou walking through London (complete with BRIGHT RED double decker buses, post boxes and telephone boxes, seemingly in EVERY street in our capital – more spoon-fed UK fantasy for the US audience). Instead of having his protagonists just walking with a normal tracking shot, Howard decides to use special effects to blur the people in the crowd around them, turning them into what appear to be shapeshifting spirits. What the hell is the reason for doing this? In a film that strives for realism, this is a total misstep that left me scratching my head. Ditto Hanks' ""vision"" in the chapel that takes place straight afterwards.<br/><br/>The film keeps all the clichéd action scenes from the book intact, except they're even less interesting up on screen – a car chase is ruined by dodgy shaky-hand camera-work, and a tense stand-off resorts to the contrivance of a flying dove to allow our heroes to escape for the umpteenth time. Plus that annoying aeroplane escape is intact (complete with comedy-accented British policemen) and feels as much a cheat as ever.<br/><br/>The film's stultifying climax is one of the worst I've had to sit through – even worse than the sentimental pap that marred the otherwise perfect LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING. The 'joke' where Tautou dips her toe into a pond is cheesy beyond belief and, possibly realising that there is zero chemistry between his two stars, Howard eliminates the romance between Langdon and Neveu that we found in the novel. Speaking of the stars, Hanks (complete with greasy, false-looking hair) gives his worst performance to date; unless it was his intention to make the college professor seem entirely boring. Tautou, who was so good – even perfect – in AMELIE, seems stilted and unsure of herself. The only actor I really liked was Paul Bettany as Silas; his self-flagellation sequences are among the most powerful (and wince-inducing, come to that) in the film, and he evokes the only sympathy you'll find here. Two British old hands, Ian McKellen and Alfred Molina, deal with their roles in different ways: Molina is emotionless, whilst the impish McKellen comes across as a prank-playing granddad, sniggering at the fun of it all, and somehow looking wrong when he dons his flat cap. It's left to Euro-actors Jean Reno and Judgen Prochnow to give the most interesting performances; although Reno is left on the sidelines, his beating of a flight controller at the airport is another powerful moment, whilst Prochnow's shifty banker is present in the only interesting bit of action."

","Well, a heresy is a heresy, after all. For hundreds of years, the ideas and concepts have been molested, falsified, distorted, changed all over and got rid of. And we live in the age of post modernism, when as it seems everything is relative and therefore any stupidity immediately catches the general attention and does become a real fad. Dan Brown with his impossibly poor book, The Da Vinci Code, did exactly that. He wrote an unimaginable mishmash of pseudo-scientific, quasi-religious, sub par ideas that he suffered greatly to collide ands then juxtapose together. See, man, the Theory of Conspiracy has nothing new beside it. We have heard that all before many times. And then, see we all know that this is a lie, outright. Let us be somehow fair to Hollywood. They did their best trying to reproduce that mixture of sheer lies, idiocy, anti-Christian paranoia and anti-Catholic stance onto the silver screen. They did. But again, they failed on several levels. First and foremost, Tom Hanks as Prof. Robert Langdon is weak, bleak, slow and very pale. He used to save a whole lousy film before, but not now. Here, Tom is certainly not the main star; he simply goes with the general anemic flow and lets it happen. Sir Ian McKellen also does not shine. He is what he is  an old man. Add a beard and a cloak, and voilà, you have the same old Gandalf again! Jean Reno plays without his usual gusto and his role is at its best schematic. Maybe, only Jurgen Prochnow saves the day with his impeccable little part, but all is swept away with Audrie Tatou's impossibly weak performance. She goggles her eyes, she utters incredibly silly maxims, and she overplays and exaggerates it all to the level of amateurism. With that all in mind, no wonder that the 2-hours' long torture never gets a desirable cohesion. The film starts very well, as a real thriller, then gets to the point of some detective story, then almost falls down to some comedy and ends up as a second  rate melodrama. I almost wanted to laugh and change the DVD for some lightweight show on TV. What a pity many had to suffer that in the cinemas! Dan Brown, with his main ally, ultra-liberal Hollywood mongers, has made a new fierce attack on Christian beliefs and values. The inedible beefsteak of utterly hilarious ideas never gets to the throat. A mere enumeration of what he tried to depict will leave any seriously thinking individual in total shock. Jesus being married and having a daughter with Mary Magdalene, herself being a kind of pagan female goddess with some sacral sexual meaning, the Temple knights fighting to save the secret, the very idea of Jesus being a mortal man only  these are all old, old fairy tales. They are old, venomous, but not as harmful as some angry believers could get it. We saw that all before, didn't we? Time will show how many new Dan Browns will appear with their abominable books and films full of gods and demons, false ideas and wrong suppositions. And Hollywood will always keep that fire burning, making shallow screening versions, with poor plot and bad play. I pity Hanks, Reno, and Tatou, all others who wasted their talents on that low-key, tasteless treatise. Time will show. People will gladly forget this ditty, never having become a real song. A heresy is a heresy. It was, is and will always be."

","I'd only read around 1/3 of Dan Brown's the Vinci Code, before going to see this film, however I was sat with people who had read the book and bar one scene when Silas should've used a candlestick instead of a book/religious trophy, the film was very close to the book, but that doesn't mean it'll be a great film. The film is just full of dull ""oh my god it's/that/he/she/they..."" type moments, but Howard doesn't embrace that. Instead he makes them dull, better Cinematography could've made a lot of the scenes in the film better instead of boring and mind-numbingly boring. Ron Howard (Apollo 13), is a great director that knows how to exploit the audience for the reactions he wants, however this is quite hard when the suspense and tension dies down before the final 'clue' has been given to Langdon.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks (Langdon) and Tattou (Neveu) had no 'chemistry' what-so-ever, whether or not Ron intended to create 'passion' between Tattou and Hanks, who knows, because the scenes between the two characters look like a half-hearted job at romantic sequence with neither actor caring, nothing is there and it's clear as hell. On top of this you had a stale, yet highly amusing performance from Sir Ian McKellen. It felt at times he was lecturing the audience on the history of the times rather than carrying on the story and with the plot already all over the place, this wasn't needed. The only actor which I enjoyed in the film was Paul Bettany as the religious Opus Dei monk Silas. He fit the psychotic, yet lonely role of lost man perfectly. Jean Reno was same ol', same ol' as yet another detective. Nothing new.<br/><br/>The ending of the film dragged on, was hugely predictable and failed in so many ways that it killed my enjoyment of the film and ultimately was an important factor to why I gave it such a mediocre score. The 'key' scenes were impeded by stone-cold acting that didn't help such a predictable and clichéd script. I hadn't even read the book yet at one point I was able to recreate the script before Hanks had even spoken a word. Following on from this, no tension or suspense, it probably will leave many in a confused state of ""oh so that was the twist."" It was met with a cold silence as it was forwarded to the audience so poorly, Hanks and Tattou didn't connect on any level needed for such an ending and it was something that could've been covered in 10mins and better.<br/><br/>All in all, from somebody that hadn't read the novel all the way through, I thought it was a mediocre film at best. Remove Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, Audrey Tattou, Jean Reno, Sir Ian McKellen and re-shoot the ending, then you'll have a slightly better film. See Brick instead, it's a lot better film that cost nowhere near what Howard spent (and I'm honestly wondering where the $160 million went?).<br/><br/>5/10"

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>A curator is murdered in Paris's revered Louvre Museum. The French police, headed by Leutenant Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) call on the expertise of Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), an expert in Pagan Symbols, when mysterious, blood-drenched patterns are found all over the body. However, Fache's suspicions of Robert have already been aroused and, unbeknownst to the professor, he's slipped a tracking device on him. Then Agent Nevu (Audrey Tautou) intervenes, springs him from the museum and begins a wild chase around Paris full of wild twists and turns. Robert learns the curator was Nevu's grand-father and was involved with a religious sect called The Priory of Sion. It all leads to a monk, Silas (Paul Bettany) sent by the religious sect of Opus Dei and the ultimate re-writing of history.<br/><br/>There's nothing like controversy to get something talked about, and it seems the best results are when that controversy involves religion. Dan Brown's much talked about novel The Da Vinci Code set off much consternation by basically re-writing the bible- and now that controversy has been adapted to the big screen.<br/><br/>The book suffered from trite dialogue but still managed to be a relentless page turner that fired at you with interesting fact after interesting fact and kept you on the edge of your seat till the last page. The film adaptation, then, is as good as can be expected. It's well cast. Tom Hanks is just the kind of lead you need for this kind of thing, but he's not at his best here. Jean Reno also has appeal as Captain Fache (strangely, though, I'd always pictured Michael Gambon in the role!) Tautou and Bettany are also very engaging in support but it's Ian McKellen who steals the show here as eccentric old grail enthusiast Sir Leigh Leabing, delivering the most spirited and compelling performance. And it has a reliable director in Ron Howard. But if you've read the book, the film offers little in the way of it's own variation on the story and pretty much just plays it like it was in the book, making it a bit of a dull and unsurprising thing after a while. If you haven't read the book, do so, it'll be much more rewarding. ***"
"Superunknovvn","7","14","27","24 May 2006"," Misunderstood movie
","As Tom Hanks explained, ""The Da Vinci Code"" isn't a serious claim that catholicism is all made up through some dark conspiracy. It's merely a fun popcorn movie that's pointing out some interesting facts and intrigues with weird theories. A lot of people took it all way too seriously, when ""The Da Vinci Code"" is really only supposed to be entertaining. Then there's been talk that audiences at Cannes laughed at the movie's climax and thought it was ridiculous. Well, that's hardly Ron Howard's fault, is it? He could only stick to the existing novel. What did you expect? If you don't like the book, you're going to despise the movie even more.<br/><br/>Now, that we've gotten this out of the way, let's talk about ""The Da Vinci Code"" as the nice little thriller it is. The movie has its shortcomings, that's undeniable. Even if you haven't read the book you'll notice that things seem a bit rushed. Screenwriters must have had a hard time cramming the most important facts of this rather thick novel into a movie with only 150 minutes running time. Most of the time characters blabber as if they had swallowed a lexicon. The whole cast does the best job possible, but lines like those can't be delivered naturally. Especially in the beginning the movie is slowed down by this blabbering until you are used to it and accept it.<br/><br/>And yes, one has to say that the story is pretty unbelievable and almost laughable at times. It's not even hard to figure out the ending about half way through. Still, there are other movies in this genre that are a lot worse and just as far fetched (some John Grisham flicks come to mind). The problem is that people have been so hyped up, they expect something HUGE and exceptional, which this movie wasn't aimed for in the first place. If you just accept the fact, that this is not going to change your perception of life, then you're in for a very thrilling ride. Two and a half hours of pleasant entertainment, that's all there is to it.<br/><br/>There's nothing special about ""The Da Vinci Code"": not the acting, not the story, certainly not the direction. If you hope for something mind blowing, you're searching in the wrong place. If you're offended by the movie's conspiracy theories, you're no better than Islamic fundamentalist threatening with violence because of some meaningless Mohammed cartoons. If none of this applies, you should have a good time with this motion picture."
"victorbond2007","1","19","39","19 May 2006"," Boring and slow
","I read the novel a long time ago and I have to admit that is was really exciting and interesting. I was thrilled to hear that the novel was being turned into a film, I didn't even care that Ron Howard was the director or that Hanks was cast as Robert Langdon. The result: a boring and slow and disappointing flick...<br/><br/>THE CAST: Hanks seems out of place, he was not the best choice for the character. He doesn't develop the character (it is not his fault), Langdon is a walking encyclopedia, nothing more (as the film portrays him, a book would have done the same job he did). Tautou's performance was horrible, she made Sophie unbearable... Alfred Molina, Paul Bettany and Ian Mckellen were perfect choices, specially Mckellen who rescues the film from total boredom. THE EDITING: Just awful, there is no continuity between scenes... they tried to make it like the book, but it is not the same. THE MUSIC: No hummable or important melody to remember... THE SPECIAL EFFECTS AND THE FLASHBACKS: Totally unnecessary... THE PACE: Sloooooooooow... There is no action. When I was reading the book I pictured incredible car chases and fights, the only thing you get is what you see on the trailer... yeah very short sequences that make the movie slow. Ron Howard was the worst choice and so was Goldsman (Batman and Robin - ¿ring any bells?), he is not familiar with action (develop some action sequences!, go beyond the book! - Novels are VERY different from films)<br/><br/>Finally I do have to mention that there are some good moments, the comic relief by Mckellen is wonderful as well as some of the scenes with Betanny or Molina on them. The locations are true to the book and incredible... but that's it. <br/><br/>If you have read the book, the film might seem boring, if you haven't maybe you'll have some fun. <br/><br/>Lets just hope that Angels and Demons (a much better novel that the Da Vinci Code) is made into a movie and demonstrates us the real talent of Tom Hanks and the essence of Brown's novels."

","I just don't get it. What is with the critics panning this movie? I went to see it last night expecting it to be totally lame but I loved the book so much and have been so looking forward to seeing it that I had to see it in the movies despite the horrible reviews. Simply put the movie was great!!! It was pretty much just like the book. I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled with Tom Hanks playing Robert Langdon but he does an outstanding job. All of the other characters especially Silas and Teabing are exactly as I pictured them when reading the book. Forgetting that it is based on one of the best selling books of all time and that it has upset the Catholic Church (you have to love it for that alone!) it's just a really great movie! It has mystery, action, violence, intrigue and really good acting. The movie starts just like the book with Langdon being set up for the murder of Jacques Sauniere in the Louvre. Sophie warns him and they are off to figure out the identity of Sauniere's murderer using the clues he left before he died. They quickly realize that the identity of the murderer isn't what they are searching for but something much larger that will change history forever. Put this one on your must see list and ignore the critics."

","I thought that The Da Vinci code was a well made film, with dramatic and intense scenes. Paul Bettany stood out as Silas, he was totally different to the other productions I've seen him in. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were well matched as Professor Langdon and Sophie Neveu. I went to see the film without any expectations, which is probably a good thing. I found The storyline gripping and the acting high quality. I know The Da Vinci Code has its critics, however it is worth making your own mind up. After all, not all the critics have the same taste as you. Lastly, I've never read the book, but that made no difference whatsoever. I went with a friend who had read the book and we both really enjoyed it."
"kylopod","5","13","25","4 June 2006"," So-so thriller has gotten a free pass because of its outlandish ideas
","To some people, no two films could be more different than ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""The Da Vinci Code."" One affirms traditional Christianity, the other skewers it. But the two are similar in the sense that someone not raised in a Christian culture might be excused for wondering what the big deal is. Outside a Christian context, it is strange that conservative audiences were attracted to a film as violent as ""The Passion,"" and it is equally perplexing that a relatively formulaic thriller like ""The Da Vinci Code"" would inspire so much emotion, for better or worse.<br/><br/>It is ironic that people defend the film from its alleged anti-Catholic bias by suggesting that it's merely a fantasy, not to be taken seriously. If most people saw it that way, I doubt the film would be so popular. The attention it has received, both positive and negative, is almost entirely rooted in its unique claims about Church history. When evaluated without paying attention to what it says about our world, the film is really nothing special.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie shows some promise. I enjoyed the scene introducing Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) as he delivers a fascinating lecture about common symbols that throughout history have had very different meanings from what we're accustomed. But as soon as the movie's plot unfolds, numerous holes begin to appear. Langdon is sent to the Louvre to help solve the murder of a curator. We already know that the murder was committed by a crazed monk (Paul Bettany), but Langdon is unaware of this fact. As soon as he arrives, people attempt to tag him with the murder, and he must go on the run with a cop (Audrey Tautou) who's helping him for reasons I found unclear, and who's involved because the slain curator was her grandfather. The two must work to solve the series of puzzles the victim left in his dying moments, which hopefully will lead them to better understand the murder and also account for why everyone's after them. Why the curator had to communicate his secrets in code is, again, not clearly explained.<br/><br/>As an academic scholar going on adventures, Langdon's character has naturally been compared to Indiana Jones. But he has none of Indy's charm, bravery, or quick wits, and he never seems in control over what's happening. Most of the time, he's being led along by the story's events, often acting rather dopey and clueless. That would be okay, I suppose, if the movie established him as a Walter Mitty figure thrust by the circumstances into a heroic role. But he rarely does end up acting heroic. Even his intellect doesn't prove all that impressive, aside from his ability to solve anagrams in his head.<br/><br/>The plot gets particularly shaky when Langdon's old friend Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) lays out the conspiracy theory that is at the heart of the story. At first, Langdon is skeptical. Sir Teabing presents not a shred of concrete evidence to support the wild claims he's making about the Catholic Church. He does, however, point out some rather fascinating details about a particular Da Vinci painting. On the basis of this demonstration alone, Langdon becomes an instant convert to Sir Teabing's unorthodox theory! I was practically yelling at the screen at this point.<br/><br/>The Indiana Jones films may have featured some preposterous notions, but those movies were never about ideas. They were nail-biting adventures that worked because they focused on execution, such as mood and special effects. If the religious ideas weren't altogether accurate, the plots at least had internal consistency. Our enjoyment of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" for example, has very little to do with whether we think it plausible that an archeology professor would search for the Ark of the Covenant, much less find it.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code,"" in contrast, depends greatly on its ideas, and its execution is poor. The acting is shaky, with the best performances coming from the supporting roles, and the worst coming from the main players. Hanks gives his weakest performance in a long time, creating a character with little color or vigor. Tautou is woefully miscast; although the IMDb claims that this French actress ""speaks excellent English,"" that was not the impression I got from listening to her labored speech, and she lacks the sense of authority necessary to make her into a convincing police officer. Paul Bettany and Ian McKellen, though, are superb, and I also enjoyed seeing skilled veterans like Jean Reno and Alfred Molina doing what they could with their limited roles.<br/><br/>Adventure movies often gain their strength from colorful villains, but here there are simply too many villains for any one to dominate the story. The focus therefore falls on the two rather bland heroes, and the movie never pauses long enough to make their relationship either believable or interesting. I'm sort of glad the movie resisted the temptation to develop a romance between Hanks and Tautou, given their age difference. But the movie makes a point of showing that they both had traumatic experiences as children. There was potential to develop some kind of relationship between them here, as there was when they have a couple of brief conversations about their religious beliefs. But all of this stays on a superficial level, and I felt no connection with these characters. The villains, with the possible exception of Bettany's monk, are no better drawn, and their motives are poorly established. This causes the film to have a very mechanical, calculated feel. As the movie bounced from place to place, I felt like I was inside one of those old sleuth video games like ""Carmen Sandiego."" Maybe if it had been interactive, I would have enjoyed it more."

","I read the novel. I loved it. I was delighted when I heard that the book was going to be made into a film, that Ron Howard would be directing, and that Tom Hanks would star. When I began to hear rumblings that the film wasn't good, I grew concerned in a protective way -- because I was attached to the book and adore both Howard and Hanks. I went to see DVC the weekend it opened, but, I admit, reluctantly. I might not have gone except out of my sense of loyalty and because I'd made a date months ago with a friend who shared my joy of the book.<br/><br/>I'm SO glad I did. I loved the film! <br/><br/>In contrast to criticism I've read, I didn't feel like the film bogged down. It was wonderfully absorbing, gripping even. In my opinion, Hanks and Tatou shared a lovely chemistry. In fact, I thought that the way in which their connection developed over the course of the film was one of its great strengths. Phooey as well to the much-ballyhooed claim that the film was wordy and didactic. Howard balanced words and action superbly. (In fact, one of my few criticisms is that I would have liked to see more exposition at the beginning of the film. Folks who haven't read the book are likely to be confused about who was murdered and the man's connection to the Louvre.) It was also a great treat -- as always -- to watch Ian McKellen in action. He's a glinting jewel in whatever role he plays and, in my estimation, only grows better with age. <br/><br/>I have to say honestly, now that I've seen DVC, that I'm troubled by the strength - - and depth -- of the criticism that was thrown at the film, especially before its release. In fact, since seeing the film, I've come to think that that's an issue worthy of greater examination. Is it possible, for example, that some folks who didn't want the film to succeed -- because they felt it portrayed the Catholic Church (or, at least aspects of it) in a negative light, etc. -- were a bit disingenuous in their approach; that, rather than admit they hadn't seen the film and that they wanted people to buycott it -- they launched criticism of it at the cinematic level? What of the professional critics? Where have they been coming from?<br/><br/>Of course, I don't know the answer to those questions. I'm merely one simple moviegoer. All that I can say with authority -- because, I exercised independent thinking, ""jumped the broom,"" and went to see the film -- is that I'm much more inclined to believe now in the ""culture war"" that I've been hearing people talk about than I was ""Da Vinci Code, B.C.E.""<br/><br/>To those of you debating whether to see DVC, my message is ""Be of strong heart."" Don't get scared off by the so-called literati -- or hoi-pol-loi. I had a grand experience.<br/><br/>P.S. I was on business in Oakland, California at the time, and saw the film at a wonderful -- and grand -- movie theater called, appropriately, the ""Grand Lake."" (There's a lake nearby although it isn't named ""Grand."") The theater definitely added to my experience. If you live in that vicinity, I highly recommend that you take in the film there."

"itarter","1","17","35","4 June 2006"," Poorly executed with no payoff... a waste of time
","The tension in this film is so clumsily handled that often times Howard gives himself away before he intends to, the brief edge-of-your-seat moments are ruined by obvious hints at was is to come next and by long digressions into seemingly irrelevant information. Alternately, the character development seems to be an afterthought. Back stories are handled as absurd flashbacks that, when the film finally comes to fruition, actually have little or nothing to do with the trajectory of the story. For instance, Tom Hank's character, Robert Langdon, is claustrophobic, but he spends most of his time in wide open church spaces or in the comfort of Leigh's château. His claustrophobia only acts as an artificial attempt at tension in a couple of scenes on planes and elevators, but it has not significant effect on the outcome of any of the supposedly thriller-moments. As for Paul Bettany's character, Silas, Howard has cast him in the role of a ghost... again. Perhaps Howard doesn't know what else to do with him other than make him into some caustic phantasm that wasn't meant for this Earth. And if that isn't bad enough, near the end of the film he actually declares, ""I am a ghost"" just in case you didn't get it. I'm afraid that Howard is a one trick pony who revisits glowing letters from A Beautiful Mind because he simply wasn't equipped to direct this film.<br/><br/>I myself went and saw this film out of curiosity having no real penchant for the book, but an interest to see how Tautou and Hanks could handle a thriller with so much buzz and controversy surrounding it. Don't waste your time, even though I didn't expect to love it, I certainly wasn't prepared for how clumsy and boring it turned out to be. Tautou is far more appealing as French shut in with an overactive imagination and Hanks more charming as a slightly dim southerner with a heart of gold.

I'm sure he's a nice bloke but its somewhat surprising that for a lifelong actor, the acting is always his weakest element. There's some poor casting in my opinion too. Audrey Tautou,Alfred Molina and Paul Bettany didn't do much for me and were particularly poor. In fact Paul Bettany was the only 'over the top' character and slightly embarrassing at moments.

","From a purely entertainment perspective, the movie was pretty good. There was mystery, suspense and accomplished acting led by Tom Hanks and supporting cast. Depending on your metaphysical stance, you may or may not enjoy the movie since it pokes holes in the Roman Catholic religion. What's interesting is that the author of ""The DaVinci Code"" did not make up a lot of the issues, he took existing points that have been debated through the ages and incorporated them into his book. From what I understand, a lot of details from the book was left out (my guess the script writers didn't want to bog the story down with too much information) of the movie. I may grab a copy just to see what difference between the 2 is.<br/><br/>Give the movie a shot, it's a decent movie. Some religious zealot will complain about anything.

","I can overlook the historical inaccuracies that plague the movie. Without them there would be no conspiracy theory to drive the plot along. However, I must have missed something by not reading the book. The premise that seems to drive the plot is essentially ""if we can actually find Mary Magdalene's body we'll be able to look at the DNA and prove that Jesus has descendants who walk the earth today. That'll shake up the power structure of the oppressive church and people will be free!!!"" <br/><br/>But my problem came toward the end. The movie seems to rely on the fact that DNA analysis will be the key to finding the royal line of Jesus that's currently walking the earth. I'll overlook the fact that it's highly unlikely that anyone could prove conclusively that they've actually FOUND Mary Magdalene's body. I was willing to concede on that point because of the great ride of twists and turns and betrayals and layers of meaning that the movie had woven up to that point. But here's my problem: How can DNA analysis on Mary Magdalene alone prove that the person is a descendant of Jesus? Wouldn't they have to have Jesus' DNA to prove that? I'll have to watch the movie again. Maybe I missed something. I guess that's what spoiled the movie for me. The climax of the film was built on faulty logic."
"amy969","1","17","36","29 May 2006"," Very sadly disappointed!
","I read this book twice and was very excited to see the movie. I am not unreasonable about books being made into movies, I realize that there are limitations. That being said I almost walked out halfway through the movie I got so upset. If you have never read the book then you might like the movie, for the rest of you that did read the book you will be very disappointed by the movie. They changed some major plot points without good reason. Just so you know what you're getting into I have listed the main ones that made me angry: <br/><br/>1. Fache tells Collet that he was contacted by Aringarosa (a Bishop of his order - Fache is apparently Opus Dei in the movie) and told that Langdon told Aringarosa in confession that he planned to kill the curator of the Louvre and Fache was trying to catch him without implicating the Bishop who didn't keep the confession a secret.<br/><br/>2. Aringarosa and the Catholic church were in cahoots about the whole thing, they knew what the 'grail' contained and wanted it destroyed so no DNA testing could be done. They convened a secret council to do this and were not disassociating from Opus Dei. Aringarosa was NOT working with Fache to try and stop Silas they knew that Silas had killed people and were OK with it.<br/><br/>3. The Curator was not Sophie's real grandfather, just the grand master of the Priory who was prepping her to be in the order. They weren't speaking because when she was little he screamed at her (the scene shows him rushing in and wiping everything on a desk onto the floor while screaming at her while she cowers) and told her to never ask about her family and then sent her to boarding school - after which she saw the ritual. It made him seem like a complete jerk.<br/><br/>4. When they get to Roslin Chapel, the very easily find a secret sub-chamber that contains all the documents of the Priory and the 'grail' just no body - it has been moved. The members of the Priory show up, she meets her grandma - no brother, and they all hang out.<br/><br/>These were some of the major issues I had with the movie, there were many many many more. The movie could have been so great and it just wasn't. It cheapens the story and the characters."

","Being a university teacher myself, I can only wonder why they call Da Vinci Code ""intellectual mystery"". There is nothing intellectual about it: the characters are not in a slightest way close to what professors are (in reality they don't own private jets), the plot is as primitive as Hollywood could possibly make it, music is too loud and particularly annoying because it is used to explain the situation on the screen, not to accompany the action, acting is wooden (Ian Mackellen is the only exception).<br/><br/>In short: it's a cliché-laden unsophisticated comic meant to entertain those who don't have any idea of the real complexity of scientific work.<br/><br/>I don't see how this bull's excrement can threaten the foundations of Christianity. If I was Christian, I would feel just annoyed by how talentlessly they are toying with symbols. And also relieved, because the movie makes such a joke of itself, that I could hardly sit it out (the same applies to the book).<br/><br/>If you are in for a really serious intellectual mystery, I suggest you to read Uberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum"" where the topic of secret societies is treated with irresistible charm."

The actress has the ability, so I lay the failure on Ron Howard, and ultimately, on the producer, Tom Hanks. He has to become the brains and the brawn of the whole show and fails miserably. Too bad. If he had kept the actual plot, this could have been a good movie.<br/><br/>There are bright spots. Paul Bettany does his usual spectacular job as the monk, Silas. Please, World, make this man a star! Also, the only thing in Hank's favor is that he does manage to look confused in some of the right places. The story is about someone who has not had enough sleep when the plot begins, and doesn't get more than a catnap for most of the intrigue. He's dragged into a murder investigation and hasn't a clue how he got there. He really should have looked MORE confused! Sophie does seem to know how to act like she can handle a gun. Too bad the policewoman was so dumbed and gentled down that she became a non-entity. Definitely not Ron Howard's usual deft touch with his characters."

","There's been so much hype about The DaVinci Code... That itself usually puts me off, but my friends prevailed, and we went to see it today on its opening day.<br/><br/>I've never read ""The DaVinci Code"". However, years ago, I'd read the books which were the subject of the lawsuit against Dan Brown (""The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail"", ""The Messianic Legacy""), so I am certainly familiar with the concepts upon which it was built.<br/><br/>The movie's hype extended to TV news coverage today - exit polls at the cinema... And all said, ""It was very faithful to the book"", which may have been comforting to those who read it, but meant nothing to me.<br/><br/>In watching the film, it took quite some time to figure out what was what, who was who, though some things in the plot were rather predictable.<br/><br/>Audrey Tatou was wonderful and Jean Reno is always great to watch. Tom Hanks, however, in my opinion, was miscast. He was less an adventurous ""Indiana Jones"" type, than he was like the TV character, ""Monk"". There was no real intensity there, and the way he would wince uncomfortably when placed in a confined space, did indeed remind me of Adrian Monk when faced with germs.<br/><br/>I found ""The DaVinci Code"" to be an OK ""chase"" movie, which is essentially what it was, but it was a butt-numbing 2 1/2 hours long (and those seats aren't as comfortable as they used to be!). I have very definitive views about religion and the church, but this movie didn't really arouse anything in me for the first 2 hours or so.<br/><br/>One thing I found offensive was the 'dumbing down' of the lead female character, Sophie. I know that she (and her ignorance) was used as a device to let the audience know what was going on, but it demeaned the character, just as what was allegedly done to Mary Magdalene. Ironic.<br/><br/>Had I known then, when I booked ahead at $14.50 a seat, what I know now, I would've waited for the DVD (I guess I'm also annoyed at myself for getting sucked into the hype).<br/><br/>I rate this film ""Three Wristwatches"", because that's how many times I checked my watch while watching the film.

","Okay, let's get this straight. The most heavily promoted movie in history, and one that deals with sublime organization and submersion in art. The story that touches on many of the greatest minds we know and refers to many greater we do not. The myth that in different threads captivates hundreds of millions...<br/><br/>All that is contained in something less competent than your average cereal commercial? ""Hudson Hawk"" was leagues better. Or if you are afraid of humor in religion, ""Baby of Macon.""<br/><br/>Well, let's pass on kicking Ron Howard when he's down. (I already kicked him hard when he was up: ""Beautiful Mind"" drove me nuts with its similar mismatch of grace in what the subject was and how it was displayed.)<br/><br/>Instead, let's wonder a bit about why such a story in both book and movie form has been so popular in spite of multiple incompetences: from bad history to bad writing in several forms to brutally mundane cinema.<br/><br/>We live in stories, we write our own, usually borrowing one and some of the eager lenders are religions. That's because we like manifold stories. We spin our own, but we like that there are hidden forces somewhere that spin their own stories which trump ours at certain points. Noir, depends on that notion. Greek theater. So we spin a personal story that has a greater writer in it.<br/><br/>The full modern expression of this isn't content with just two threads, the personal and divine, we modern folk like to have a whole spectrum of forces, layered demigods in between us and the supreme machine of fate.<br/><br/>We often cast these as conspiracies. In movies, we see them as detective or con stories, depending on which side of the eye they place us to start. Sometimes they have demons, vampires or ghosts as the in-between manipulators. But the purest form I suppose has the simple noir hero at the bottom, God at the top and several of God's conspiratorial institutions in between, all rewriting each other at all levels.<br/><br/>So Dan Brown, I congratulate you for stumbling upon a pure form and knowing enough to copy it. And shuffling it among scholars, collectors, policemen, moles, and various religious clubs.<br/><br/>Some day, someone really will write this form the way it deserves. Until then, this will stand as comically overpromised as the French military wisdom and competence which is implicit here.<br/><br/>David Mamet often makes trite movies, but he has a tenet worth following. Never have a character explain things. If you do, you have left your cinematic story. Show, drive the narrative in the story rather than explain. That's what kills this here. <br/><br/>Ron Howard. Okay, kick.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"s-a-garrett","9","12","24","21 May 2006"," A chilling adaptation
","To preface my comment, I would like to say that most movies based on books range from superb adaptations (LoR, Shogun) to so awful the writers (dead or alive) are spinning in their graves (Necronomicon, Congo, about a thousand more...). What The DaVinci Code does is make an incredibly solid adaptation.<br/><br/>Frankly, I have no idea about what most of the critics are talking about. The movie ""xXx"" was, strangely enough, an incredible movie because of the characterization of Vin Diesel's character. What I think a lot of people are forgetting about The DaVinci Code's main character is that, frankly, he's not exactly personable. That's right: Robert Langdon is THE HEAD OF THE RELIGIOUS SYMBOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY, he is not Indiana Jones (though Jones was a professor, he was actually characterized as charming, unlike Langdon who is awkward), and he is not James Bond. Tom Hanks, with the punctuated phrasings and awkward movements seem more correct than having him sip a martini and expose the code; it is only at times of deep, intellectual argument that he explodes in anger.<br/><br/>Why does he not act absolutely terrified when guns are discharging next to his head and he being chased by the authorities? Because he did that during Angels and Demons, which occurred two or three years before the DaVinci Code. Enough of Langdon.<br/><br/>Likewise, it is impossible to cram all the information from the book into the movie; the movie does get every plot point down, and as someone who is a fan of the book, I could not complain when I walked out of the theater. Another point is that many people seem to point out that the book is God's gift to literature: if you analyze it, all the book is is short, punctuated chapters that use a ""Description-Explanation-Action"" schema to express a really interesting idea. It's not literature, it's popular fiction. The movie is a fine adaptation of this schema, employing the scenery with great gusto (I was disappointed that they missed out at Kings College, but it was 2:29:00 long movie), the explanations came with full, flash back scenery for those without imagination of knowledge to know what a Templar was, what a Roman city looked like, etc, and the action was superb.<br/><br/>Silas was not the only good part of the movie; though he was freaky enough to exploit Brown's imagery of Opus Dei. McKellan was bound to be the best actor, and proves the Leigh Teabing was in fact the only one in the book that actually had personality. Tautou actually made a grander impression in my mind than the Sophie from the book.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great adaptation. It's certainly not one of the greatest films of all time, but a steady 8.7 would best describe the masterful work of Howard, Hanks, and Tautou in accordance with a really good (yet fictional) idea."

Some scenes like the whip-scene are very brutal and superfluos. Like the book the plot of this movie is really strange and I assume that Dan Brown only wants to talk about a topic no movie before talked about in order to earn money. The actors are good, especially Tom Hanks and Ian MacKellen. The music at least at the end is reasonable.

I was looking forward to the movie, mainly because of the great locations the story unfolds in.<br/><br/>I also imagined the book being good movie material. When I read all the bad reviews, I told myself that most of the times good reviews are wrong. And how often did I end up seeing a movie because of some approving film critic and found the film disappointing and walked out of the theater convinced that this critic has been bought by the studio.<br/><br/>Heck, I wanted to see the movie, so I went to a matinée. There is a lot of things I do not understand . Does nobody looks at the movie after it is finished to see that certain things are not working? And maybe changes it then. Why does the main character always has to be a big star? I have nothing against Tom Hanks, but he did not convince me at all in that role. And why make a movie about the feminine power suppressed by the church and make the main female character weaker than it is written in the book? And there may be a lot of things which are wrong with the book, but it is an interesting read and it is certainly not cheesy. Especially at the end the movie was so cheesy that it made me gag.<br/><br/>And it was boring. There is no excuse for that movie to be boring. And I do not mind long. It is a complicated story to tell. But long and boring? I wanted to see the movie on the big screen. I like the big screen and there are movies which I saw in the theater and then bought the DVD and they had not the same impact on me at home. And why is the whole movie so gloomy and dark? This is not a gloomy and dark story. It is an exciting and colorful story. I regret that this movie is going to make so much money. It does not deserve it. After I came home from the movie I watched part of Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball and she claimed that Jesus was there. Maybe she is a descendant of Jesus and Magdalena? Who knows?"

You don't need to hate the book or the theory behind it, to think this is just a bad movie: (very) bad script, bad directing (Ron Howad ??? come on ... !!!), bad picture, etc. I can't say bad acting, though, because McKellen, Bettany and Tautou were great (though they sure deserve much better), and Tom Hanks probably never realized they were shooting a movie.

","Just watched The Da Vinci Code and I have to say I'm quite impressed with the way they dealt with this Controversial book to adapted film. I read the book over a year ago and I had a pretty good idea of how it was going to be. I went to watch it with no reviews read, beforehand of the film but yes, while watching the film I had to keep comparing it to the much talked about novel. So this is what my account of the film was -<br/><br/>The film starts of a bit slow paced and I wasn't very attached to the first few of scenes because they weren't so vivid and dramatic as I had seen it in my head while reading the book and I was having doubts whether it was going to hold me on the edge of my seat. I felt even the ending dragged on a little tiny bit too much. Also I was having a difficult time Acclimatizing with the characters in the beginning especially Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon but all that suspicion goes after a good half an hour when we start getting right into the crux of the story.<br/><br/>There were some aspects I really liked about this film such as the use of flash backs which really worked in favour of bettering the story understanding. The book goes into great deal with explaining the whole story behind Jesus Christ and the Blood line and I felt that was well assembled on in film. I was watching the film with my parents (who haven't read the book) and wondering whether they were actually understanding the story and it turned out they were following it, which was a relief for me because i literally dragged them in to watch it.<br/><br/>Over all the actors did a wonderful job I was totally blown away with Paul Bettany's performance as Silas. Audrey Tautou was very much in character mode and the same goes for Ian McKellen and Tom Hanks (although I didn't think Tom Hanks hair style was necessary, short hair was the way to go).<br/><br/>I also really loved the cinematography for this film, it was really well done. The whole feel of the film was very much like the book, the colour, contrast, composition, lighting and architect was very much Da Vinci like. <br/><br/>There have been minor changes to the narrative in the film to the book but that of course had to be done. The filmmakers pretty much stuck to the whole plot and how it unravels, which was delight to compare with, with the Book. I enjoyed watching the ending, quite provoking, the way Tom Hanks leaves it to us to believe what we want to and that this whole episode means nothing if want it to mean nothing cause at the end it doesn't effect our relationship with God, its just our thinking.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code, I believe lived to its expectation and Director Ron Howard crafts a very delicate subject with the right touch of spice and presents it in style. I would rate it 9 out of 10 watch it, -1 for the beginning and pace of film :-)"

","This review has nothing to do with the ""controversial"" content of the film, nor has anything to do with any religious issues. This is a review of a film which fell apart in MANY places.<br/><br/>The script was atrocious. Akiva did a really poor adaptation of a no-brainer novel. The plot, obstacles and resolutions were all laid out. All he had to do was pick a point of view, make something film-able (ie. get rid of all the exposition, or make it into something visual rather than just dialog) and give the characters a bit of depth. Either he or the studio were so scared to make a decision regarding this book, that they just let it lay there.<br/><br/>The choice of director was always a bit of a puzzle to begin with. Ron Howard is not even in the top 50 names of directors who come to mind for helming thrillers (Ransom, specifically the third act, was a disaster). And like Goldsman, he too seemed to refuse to make any unique decision regarding the material. So, what we're left with is a dull retread of the novel which, consequently, has no reason for being a film. If you're not going to make any cinematic decisions regarding the original work, then there is absolutely no reason to adapt it to another medium. Look at Jaws and The Godfather for examples of first rate adaptations of mediocre pulp books.<br/><br/>Technically the film was also a disaster. The cinematography was laughable, especially for something with a $120 million budget. The scenes in the Louvre and through Paris should have been spectacular. Instead they were a muddy, unfocused mess. Nobody seemed to know where to point a camera, which lens to choose or how to compose a shot for any tension. None of the scenes has any suspense what-so-ever.<br/><br/>The editing was also pathetic because of the lack of suspense in what is supposed to be a thriller. It also had the worst car chase sequence in recent cinema history. You have Paris, you have a SMART car and you have a huge budget. It should have been executed at a much higher level."

","Dan Brown's novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" quickly became a best seller not only because of its easy-to-read narrative and its thrilling plot of conspiracies and riddles, it received notoriety due to the criticism it makes to the Catholic church and the harsh portrait it makes of the Opus Dei. While the only real fact in ""The Da Vinci Code"" may be its status as an entertaining and well-written work of fiction, it is more than enough to make the transition to film and it is in writer Akiva Goldsman and director Ron Howard's hands to make it possible.<br/><br/>The now well-known plot starts with Professor Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) being killed in one of the halls of Louvre museum by the mysterious Silas (Paul Bettany), a religious man with dark purposes. Before dying, Sauniere leaves a series of clues that only his granddaughter Sophie (Audrey Tautou) will understand, but she'll need the aid of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), famous historian, to solve the puzzle. A race to solve the code begins as Silas seems decided to make them stop in their quest and the french police is after them.<br/><br/>Ron Howard makes a competent adaptation following faithfully the book making the movie almost as entertaining as the source novel. Just like in the book, the plot unfolds smoothly and the film never gets boring or tiresome. While his loyalty to the source novel is really appreciated, Howard's film is overall bland and never takes full advantage of its source. The works of art that Brown describes with great detail in the book are rarely appreciated in the movie and visually the film ends up looking as any other TV crime drama. Brown's novel is definitely not a literature classic, but it deserved a more creative development in film.<br/><br/>Writer Akiva Goldsman takes an straight-forward take on the novel and surprisingly make it follow the book to the letter. Fans of the novel won't find anything missing, however, it is fair to point out that some changes were made although the plot is relatively intact. The only major change was that Sophie's character was considerably diminished, something odd considering that Dan Brown's novel has feminism as its most important value and thus she is a character as skilled and competent as Langdon.<br/><br/>Howard's regular Tom Hanks is surprisingly good as Langdon and while at times his age becomes apparent, his portrait of the everyman makes him a good choice for the role. Audrey Tautou is also good, but her character was nowhere as developed as in the book, making her just a simple sidekick for Hank's character. The one who really stands out is Sir Ian McKellen, who plays Langdon old friend Sir Leigh Teabing; McKellen completely makes the character his own and steals every scene he is in, displaying his domain of the stage and his great talent as an actor. Paul Bettany and Alfred Molina complete the cast and give their respective characters depth and dignity.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" is a very well-done film, but still it feels like a missed opportunity of making something really epic. Howard's uninspired take at times makes the film feel too simple for its original ambitions and may leave fans of the novel expecting a little extra effort in making Brown's story come alive. A bit more of creativity would had helped to make the movie a classic thriller instead of the simple mystery film we got.<br/><br/>Despite its problems; the novel's thrilling plot, the great acting and the superb score (by Hans Zimmer) make the movie an enjoyable experience, and while it definitely could had been a lot better, it is a movie worth watching at least once."

I don't think I've seen a movie of this standards (world-famous, high-budget, starting ticket pre-sales a week before the premiere) executed so badly and giving the impression that everybody was in a hurry to finish the shooting, that it didn't matter how bad the scene was, they wouldn't bother re-shooting it to get a better result.<br/><br/>It was also a pity seeing well-known actors, supposed to be of very high standards, acting so badly. It was really disappointing for me, I hope it was because of the hurry in which they were to finish shooting. I couldn't also expect a worse direction, which was unfortunately prominent throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>Not having read the book, I thought the whole scenario was based in some good ideas, but in the whole it nearly made you laugh. But I guess I could attribute this as well in a very very bad direction, which made each scene seem as emerging from a cheap comedy.<br/><br/>P.S. Sorry for possible mistakes, not a native speaker!"

","(Contains some minor spoilers) Like millions of people around the world I read The Da Vinci Code novel. While I was not impressed with the writing, I found myself lying awake late at night. The novel was a real page turner despite the far-fetched premise and factual errors. I happened to know something about the early period of Christianity, so I knew that the novel had some truth when describing Constantine and the existence of hundreds of Gospels and about the sad demise of the Knights Templar, but these were buried beneath some truly awful dialogue.<br/><br/>I had planned to watch the movie to see what the hype was about, and I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by Ron Howard's take on the source material. I can see how the novel does not translate perfectly into a movie, but Howard has paced it very well, resulting in an enjoyable historical thriller that jumps around some wonderful locations and culminates in the beautiful Roslyn chapel. The acting is very good, Hanks shows why he has won the Oscar on repeated occasions, and McKellen is magnificent as usual. Tautou does not shine as she did in Amelie, but she is more than adequate. Bethany's Silas stands out, he is much better than the novel, and it lends some depth to otherwise flat characterisation. I can see that many people will complain about the anti-climatic ending, but I actually found it very moving, perhaps the best part of the entire movie.<br/><br/>Do not let the critics and the Church spoil this, I think that it was highly enjoyable and I will definitely be seeing it again."

"lilqtpi8913","5","8","15","12 April 2007"," The Book is MUCH Better
","I had long awaited the film adaptation of The Da Vinci Code, seeing as the novel is one of my favorites. My excitement only increased when I found out Ron Howard, one of my favorite directors was going to direct the picture. However, when Tom Hanks was signed on as Dr. Robert Langdon, my excitement died. I never went to see the film in theaters, and only just watched it a couple days ago out of curiosity for my older sister had bought the film and wanted me to watch it with her. She had seen it in theaters, and said it was a mediocre film compared to the novel. I watched it and found myself supremely disappointed. From the very beginning the film seems to be a a bad spoof of a great movie. Silas' character is unbelievable and you don't care for him as you should. Robert Langdon was cast completely wrong (though admittedly, my sister and I have pondered for the past several days over who would be the right Robert with no success.) and his character is very mild instead of intense, and even his claustrophobia is down played and fitted in at random places of the film (very unstrategically, to the point where it just seems silly and annoying). And everyone's character seems to be wrong. All of course with the exception of Teacher, aka Sir Leigh Teabing played marvelously by my favorite actor of all time, Ian McKellen. That man can do no wrong with his magnificent voice and superb acting skills. Honestly that man was the best part of the film. But back to the film.. I found myself feeling detached from the chase to find the Holy Grail aka Mary Magdalyn, Jesus' wife and mother of his child Sarah. I watched from the sidelines, oblivious to what was going on and for what reason even though I had read the novel. The chases, hunt, and overall presentation of the film was lame. The acting (with the exception of Ian McKellen and Jean Reno - aka Captain Bezu Fache). So after all of this horrible ranting of mine, my advice to you, the reader of my comment, to read the novel. And if you don't like to read, then go ahead and watch the movie. You won't understand anything in a truly committed way like you would if you read the novel."

"grahamsj3","8","3","4","16 November 2006"," Excellently done
","Ron Howard's adaptation of Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code is as good as an adaptation of a very popular book can be. Anyone who knows anything about film making knows that no film can achieve the depth of a book. There simply isn't time to establish all the little character nuances and idiosyncrasies that a book can. The job of the film maker is to keep the basic story as intact as possible, add as little as possible that's not in the book, and still make an entertaining, coherent film. Trust me, it ain't as easy as it sounds. I've read this book enough to know that the film makers left out some stuff. But, examination of what they left out reveals that it wasn't really necessary at all. So the screenplay, direction and scripting left adequate information for the viewer to know exactly what they need to know to follow and enjoy the film. The acting throughout the film was excellent. Tom Hanks is super as Professor Langdon. I'd not heard of the French actress Audry Tautou before, but she was great as his collaborator. This is a truly international cast, purposely cast as such since the film takes place in various parts of the world. Sir Ian McKellan portrays the expert Teabing. Paul Bettany is excellent as ""the ghost"" Silas. Altogether, this is a fascinating film. I'm not going into the plot, since it has more twists than a drunken snake. Enjoy it!"
"cosmic_quest","7","12","25","22 May 2006"," Almost as enjoyable as the novel
","Having read Chris Tookey's very disparaging review in the 'Daily Mail', I was of two minds to see this film. I'm glad I decided to ignore Tookey and see for myself as, having enjoyed the film, I now suspect he was allowing his own right-wing prejudices and snobby nature to colour his view of the film as a number of others have done. <br/><br/>Based on Dan Brown's best-selling novel, 'The Da Vinci Code' sees Professor Robert Langdon, a leading American symbologist, caught in the midst of a baffling mystery when he is suspected of murdering Jacques Sauniere, the curator of the Louvre. Determined to clear his name and discover the truth over the clues Sauniere managed to leave behind before he died, Langdon joins forces with the victim's granddaughter Sophie Neveu. But on their trail is sinister monk Silas as Langdon and Neveu soon discover there are those who are not ready for secrets dating back to the era of Jesus Christ to be brought to light...<br/><br/>I wasn't sure of Tom Hanks being cast as Langdon at first as he was a decade older than I would have preferred but, as usual, he rose to the occasion, depicting the honourable, quiet and refined nature of the character. Audrey Tautou was equally as good as Neveu, managing the English dialogue without mangling it while also portraying both the character's inner strength and her vulnerability and uncertainties. However, it was Ian McKellen who stole the show as Sir Leigh Teabing, the scholar who has deceptive schoolboy enthusiasm for all things to do with the Holy Grail. McKellen seemed to have had much fun filming, completely throwing himself into the role. Also, highly noteworthy was Paul Bettany, completely unrecognisable as the unhinged albino Silas, and Jean Reno as the single-minded Captain Fache, determined to get his man.<br/><br/>Like all film adaptations based on novels, this film isn't quite as good as the original source. The ending in the book was far superior compared with the ends scenes of the film, particularly the Roslin reunion where those who haven't read the book might not be so clear who the caretaker of the chapel was. The romantic tension between Langdon and Neveu in the novel was more of a sibling bond in the film, which did work better considering Hanks was a good decade older than the Langdon of the book while Tautou looked about five years younger than Neveu was depicted. There is nothing worse than seeing an ageing film star passing himself off as a young stud so I'm glad my stomach didn't have to contend with the inklings of a sexual chemistry between Hanks' Langdon and Tautou's Neveu!<br/><br/>That said, in many other ways the film was very faithful to the novel and even used imagery to convey points that may have been hard to imagine in the written form, such as how the painting of the Last Supper linked with the theories of the film. It also preserved every piece of evidence, complete with explanation, relating to Langdon and Neveu's quest so one didn't have to have intimate knowledge of mythology or the novel itself to follow the plot.<br/><br/>All in all, 'The Da Vinci Code' is a fun detective film with a unique twist, retaining the excitement and thrills that made the novel such a page-turner. Don't allow overly-harsh critics put you off and judge for yourself whether it makes the grade. As for the Vatican's stance on the film, I would have some sympathy for them if they actually put as much effort into hunting down the paedophillic priests in their flock as they do in protesting over a fictional book/film."
"HelenE-3","2","12","25","21 May 2006"," The Maguffin ate the movie
","I saw this movie because I thought I ought to find out about The Da Vinci Code before responding to the apparent nonsense people say is in it, and I couldn't read the book. I tried, the Spirit of the Eternal Feminine Wisdom knows, I tried, but I couldn't get past the first four words ""Renowned curator Jaques Sauniere..."". That's a real hook. I flicked over a few pages and tried to find some juicy bits, but kept sticking on redundant or ill-formed sentences and the odd bit of contentious assertion. Actually, it took an effort to open the book in the first place because the title is so annoying -- he's Leonardo, dammit, Leonardo. From a place in Tuscany called Vinci. It's like calling Rembrandt ""van Rijn"".<br/><br/>But many inept books make pretty good movies, especially rip-roaring genre tales: the Bourne series, with action chases in tourist destinations around the world is an obvious example of how to do it, and Hitchcock is the great granddaddy of the art (though he often abandoned most of a book he adapted -- what are The 39 Steps?). Ron Howard has a track record of workmanlike, slightly uplifting entertainment, at least, and should be up to the challenge of a page-turning novel.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it is the ideas in the Da Vinci Code novel that are the source of its popularity. Judging from the movie, there is no plot as such, only a series of puzzles that Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu need to solve to move on to another picturesque location. The police and an assassin-monk, who talks Latin on his phone to a mysterious Teacher, are always hot on their tracks, but never interrupt the solution of the puzzle, there are some senior Catholic churchmen conspiring, but the main one is called Aringarosa, so you know you can ignore them, and an aged ""Grail scholar"" called Leigh Teabing (sic) adds camp comic relief and complicates the plot in ways I couldn't fathom on one viewing. Instead of action scenes, with Tom Hanks as Langdon emulating Cary Grant as the innocent caught up in a caper in North By North West, as you might initially expect, things stop, even when the police are almost there, for Langdon, Neveu or Teabing to explain stuff about the history of art, the Templars or some guff called the Priory of Sion, all of it neither familiar to most people nor plausible to anyone who knows anything about any of it. (The great joke about the ""code"" in Leonardo's Last Supper fresco is that the feminine appearance of St John is really an allusion to the idea, promulgated by naughty queer artists like Leonardo because the evangelist refers to John as ""the disciple Jesus loved"", that he was Jesus' boyfriend, a fact well known to art historians but scrupulously suppressed by pious critics of The Da Vinci Code. The last sentence has about as much to do with the film as a lot of the verbiage in the film has to do even with the alleged plot, just to give you an idea of what the film is like. Except that my sentence is more or less true.) There are, to be fair, chases, gun fights, and some reasonably nifty musical excitement, but it keeps stopping for all that talk. Only Ian McKellen, camp as Christmas as Teabing, manages to make the words entertaining. Tom Hanks as Langdon is plain wooden, and Audrey Tatou as Sophie -- there's a clue in the name for anyone who has read the Comic Classics Gnostics -- isn't made nearly as gorgeous as she needs to be, and as she was in Amelie. Their lack of allure certainly isn't the actors' fault (though Hanks might have drawn the line at his haircut), and quite likely not Howard's -- the decision to keep the ""substance"" of the novel in the movie was presumably the studio's as much as his, and was probably unavoidable given the hoo-hah about it.<br/><br/>And Howard and his team are at least competent filmmakers in a way that Dan Brown and his editors (if he has any) are not literary novelists. I did make it through the movie without too much pain and with only the odd inner groan. But the most powerful and moving part of the evening by far was the trailer for United 93."

","Fabulous cinematography, fascinating places, still, in the end a film to no-where. Afterwards, you are saying to yourself, huh? No mystery, no suspense, no truth, no values. Watching was sort of like eating sunflower seeds, a lot of work but no meat. The film came up short of expectations on almost all fronts. It didn't follow the book very well. The casting was not credible, the acting dead pan, really flat. It took little advantage of the depth of talent of the cast. Except maybe Ian McKellen, whose character is self centered evil to the core throughout, and ends up a defeated raving lunatic. Still, for him, that's probably more his natural persona than acting. Tom Hanks falls far short of a Harrison Ford professor portrayal. Audry had none of the verve of her Amelie role or even her Senay role in Pretty Dirty Things. Jean Reno's ""Leon"" talent completely suppressed. The film lacked PASSION! Speaking of which, the whole promise of some great revelation undermining God or His Son Jesus Christ was so clearly fiction, that the film came across as false advertising. National Treasure, or any Indiana Jones film can be watched repeatedly and deliver great entertainment. This film is more like a handsome man or beautiful woman of allure, until they open their mouths and a hollow inside is revealed.

He consistently looks tired and rarely raises his voice to hearing level which dissipates any love for the character i had (although seeing the mickey mouse watch did make me feel that Howard had not completely killed the part).<br/><br/>Alfred Molina seems to waver between cockney London and some kind of Italian accent, but still seems to save some face with his representation of the misguided Bishop Aringarosa. Overall the screen time given to him didn't really give us much of a clue as to his reasons behind wanting to crush the myth of the holy grail, he just seemed to suddenly shout loudly at a poor member of the council of shadows, spill some wine and then we don't see him for 40 minutes.<br/><br/>The saviours of this film that make it in some way remotely watchable are Paul Bettany and Sir Ian McKellan. Bettanys' sheer passion and manically committed Silas is incredibly engaging and plays it with such malice and focus that he literally jumps off the screen. His undoing at the climax of the film almost brings a tear to your eye as you literally see his face crumble at the realisation of being duped. McKellan again rises to the challenge of the role of Teabing bordering on obsessive grail researcher with just that right level of insanity, and his one-liners bring the film out of its monotonous tone.<br/><br/>Quite simply, some of the scenes were baffling, not due to plot, but Howard's decision to merge the past with present in oddly directed montages. images from the past literally seem to dance around the present characters which completely contradicts the dark and bleak tone of the film. it would be like watching a musical number halfway through a Hitchcock film.<br/><br/>all in all this will appeal to some, but if it wasn't for the storyline, this film would be classed as your average Indiana Jones ripoff."

","I read the book and was sorely disappointed in how Sophie Neveu was depicted in the movie. In the book she was much more intelligent and capable. She demonstrated this time and time again. For example, she was the person who embedded into a bar of soap the tracking device hidden in Robert Langdon's coat in order to help him escape. This is not revealed in the movie. She also helped him decode several things many times and he was in awe of her intellect and cleverness. This was not shown in the movie. They do not show her intelligence and do not depict her as close to Robert Langdon's equal. <br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing a strong feminine force and how well she and Robert Langdon worked together.

Many Christian leaders acknowledge that the movie may create an opportunity to talk to people otherwise unreceptive a conversation about Jesus. Nonetheless, there is also a vocal contingent that is urging believers to avoid seeing the film. I agree with both of them. It's giving to Christians that opportunity to speak about Jesus; but I would urge everyone no to watch it as it is a waste of time."
"james.p.taylor","6","12","25","19 May 2006"," Why wasn't this better?
","I've got to be honest from the start. I haven't read the book, I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan and the last film Ron Howard directed that I enjoyed was Willow. I've also avoided all the press attention so that this is all my own opinion.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code (for anyone who doesn't know) sees Prof. Robert Langdon (Hanks) thrown in to a criminal investigation when the curator of the Louvre is found dead in the gallery having written Langdon's name in his own blood. Surrounded by mysterious symbols and cryptic writing Langdon is teamed with a code breaker Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) as he tries to find out exactly what's going on. His search for the truth puts him in opposition with the church and a mysterious monk Silas (Paul Bettany). With a great secret at stake, a secret 'that if revealed it would devastate the very foundations of mankind' there's everything to play for.<br/><br/>I saw the film at a late night screening. What I got was 150 minutes sitting in the dark being slowly bored to death. The film is described as 'a thriller' but lacks any actual thrills. The main problem is how Howard tries to get the ideas and complex information on to the screen. James Cameron, talking about The Terminator, stated that any exposition (explaining how and why things happen) works in a book but kills a film stone dead. The whole length of the film is Hanks explaining to Tautou what's going on.<br/><br/>There are action scenes, but they are so badly edited together you lose where you're up to. Probably the 'best' is a car chase with Audrey at the wheel. One minute she's a mild mannered investigator the next she turns in to Jason Bourne with the driving skills of a rally champion. Hanks clings on for dear life looking like his lunch is about to come back up, a look he keeps for most of the movie.<br/><br/>Why 6/10 then? Two people made me stick with this mess: Sir Ian McKellen and Bettany. As the albino monk Bettany is the most menacing villain I've seen in a while. He draws the eye in to the film brilliantly. As Sir Leigh Teabing, McKellan is there to give more plot points and point Hanks and us in the right direction. His screen presence is fantastic and his slightly tongue-in-cheek delivery of the hokum makes for some lighter moments.<br/><br/>Howard is extremely heavy handed with the direction. A light touch would have helped make the film feel less than it's actual running time. Having people running places rather than having barrages of talking would also have helped.<br/><br/>There's little to recommend the film on the big screen. It feels like a feature length episode of The X-files. There were even cheers and laughs from the audience when the big reveal comes towards the end.<br/><br/>As one of the most anticipated films of the summer its a disaster."

","Ron Howard's The Da Vinci Code postulates that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were husband and wife and that Mary gave birth to a daughter named Sara who married into the bloodline of the Merovingian kings in early France. Based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Dan Brown, the film tackles a great theme, the early history of Christianity, but does not rise to the occasion. The direction is flat and the story is ""complicated rather than complex"". Yet, notwithstanding the knee-jerk reaction of some critics who become apoplectic at the introduction of any ideas outside of their orthodox straitjackets, it is an entertaining and stimulating film that may cause people to think about the role of women in the Church or ponder the veracity of 2000 years of Christian orthodoxy.<br/><br/>Da Vinci Code starts with a murder and a mystery. A curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), is found murdered and Police investigator Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) thinks that Symbology Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is the killer since he was mentioned by Saueniere in a dying message. Langdon is summoned to the crime scene to aid in analyzing symbols painted in blood on the deceased along with cryptic codes left near the body but soon discovers that he is the main suspect in the murder. Together with Sauniere's granddaughter, cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou), he tries to decipher the clues and solve the crime while on the run from the police. She thinks that her grandfather asked for Langdon in order to protect a secret that threatens the entire raison d'Ãªtre of the Catholic Church.<br/><br/>The two suspect that Sauniere was killed because he was a member of The Priory of Sion, a super secret society which is sworn to protect the knowledge of the Holy Grail. The Priory naturally is opposed not only by the Church but by an extremist sect called Opus Dei, personified in the film by Silas (Paul Bettany), a self-flagellating albino monk who together with the French police, hunts the fleeing couple. The skeptical Langdon and Neveu enlist the aid of eccentric Grail researcher Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) to help in their quest. He tells them of his belief that Leonardo Da Vinci hid clues and codes in his artwork describing how to find the Sangreal, the Priory's documented record of their history, and, ultimately, the Grail itself.<br/><br/>The true Holy Grail, according to Teabing, is not the chalice shared at the Last Supper but the missing sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene who fostered the royal bloodline. After many chases and power plays, the two escape to London where they visit the Temple church, founded by the Knights Templar in 1185, and Westminster Abbey where they explore the tomb of Priory member, Sir Isaac Newton. Tom Hanks does his usual fine if not spectacular job as the thoughtful private investigator and Audrey Tatou is a pleasant presence throughout. While neither role offers the actors many opportunities to showcase their dramatic talent, the performances are neither dull nor lacking in energy as some have claimed.<br/><br/>I particularly welcome the exposure the film gives to the denigration of women by the Catholic Church and the role of Mary Magdalene in church history. While The Da Vinci Code never reaches its full potential as a compelling work of art, it is solid entertainment that creates awareness of the differences within the early church and may spur people to read apocryphal writings such as the Gnostic Gospels and The Gospel of Thomas. Of course, the theory, first expounded in the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, is out of the mainstream, yet, it is not as preposterous as Roger Ebert has claimed. Given the paucity of historical records referring to a historical Jesus and the passing of two thousand years, it is no more implausible than many other theological notions, widely accepted as the unvarnished truth."

","As this movie has been touted as one of the most anticipated films of this year, certainly expectations are high. And it does not failed me at all. I had read the novel beforehand and so at least I know what to expect of the movie.<br/><br/>The critics had been saying so much about this movie, it had actually made me kind of dread how the movie will turn out as I had read the book already and like it. Still, I went to the cinema with an open mind. And I realised, having the open mind really works. Yes, it's all just work of fiction and it's up to oneself to decide what is real and not. I am not a Christian myself but yet I like overall how it's presented. Also for someone who had read the book before, I do like that it stays with the book most of the time despite the time constrains with few minor changes here and there in the movie.<br/><br/>The places being featured in the movie are just - fantastique! I like overall how the cast are being presented. Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, Jean Reno as Bezu Fache, Paul Bettany as Silas...it really fit altogether.<br/><br/>For my father who had accompanied me to go watch this, he had certainly asked me a lot of questions (and I patiently replied him back after the movie ended) about what the movie was trying to say. Still eventually, he had managed to get the gist of it. The pace of the movie is the reason why he and I managed to understand the whole thing. For me, it's better because I had read the book beforehand. I know I had said that many times but then for one who had not read the book, you will still more or less get the hang of it.<br/><br/>The final few moments of the movie can really drive home why director Ron Howard had made this movie well. Even if I dare say I was not aware of the novel version beforehand, I think I will still be almost choked up towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>So much had been said about Dan Brown's bestselling novel and this movie adaptation but then I can only give this one advice for those who are going to go watch the movie - watch it with an open mind. It will surely do value to your movie ticket as it does to mine."

I have no idea what they are talking about, after long enough time I forget she was even french.<br/><br/>Basically this movie is an amazing feat of cinema with many elements that Dan Brown could not make us imagine through just words.<br/><br/>Religious or not i think everyone who wants to see this movie should. It is a great story and a great movie.

Recommended for those who have read the book (plenty of you out there); average Hollywood thriller for the those who haven't read it.<br/><br/>The actors do their best at bringing the book's characters to life, with Sir Leigh sticking out head and shoulders above Langdon and Sophie, his character is witty, fun and enthralling."

","Applause to director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman - what a daunting task of trying to condense the 454 pages of detail from Dan Brown's book to screen. The film version will have to stand on its own - it's a mystery-suspense Hollywood movie. The myriad of back-stories are selectively dispensed of or being audio-visually presented in overlapping/simultaneous effect, so the 'historical' explanations and 'technical' rationales are not short-changed. The story is successfully delivered. It's rather marvelous to see how particular descriptions are cinematically interpreted.<br/><br/>I have read the book the summer of 2004. I actually read all four (back to back) of Dan Brown's novels: Angels and Demons; Deception Point; Digital Fortress; and, The Da Vinci Code. Somehow the details I remember most are from ""Angels and Demons."" Perhaps the Rome locations were fresh in my mind as I was just there in April and visited multiple times the Vatican City, St. Peter's Basilica, Papal Mass and all.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou is truly perfect for the role of Sophie Neveu playing along side Tom Hank's Robert Langdon. There is such an air of sincerity in their quest for the 'truth' behind that wooden box with a rose. Tautou's wistful ""Amelie"" expressions mixed with earnest ""A Very Long Engagement"" inquisitiveness, missing nary a hint of regal descent, she is. Hanks the professor, the 'symbologist', the ever resourceful optimist, a problem analyzing continuum, he is. With the always animated, 'fathomless' reservoir of knowledge is Sir Ian McKellen as the essential Sir Leigh Teabing - delightful as ever. The thoughtful and lavish casting and production, along with Hans Zimmer's score, enhanced the atmosphere and made the puzzles of anagrams, symbols, 'cryptex' all the more fun to follow. They did it: all the key points and elements are there on screen. The Da Vinci Code - the movie, is an achievement in itself, thanks to the collaboration of Columbia Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, producers with Brian Grazer and John Calley, and executive producers with author Dan Brown himself. Give it a fair chance - see it and enjoy."
"stardancer385","7","4","6","22 May 2006"," Have faith in the film
","The film version of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" is one film where I am stumped by what many of the critics have said. I had read some reviews before seeing the film, which were mostly all negative. Being a fan of the book, I still had faith that film could not be as bad as they were making it out to be. And I was right. <br/><br/>Many of the critics have said Ron Howard takes the fun out of Dan Brown's novel, there is no chemistry between the two main characters Robert and Sophie, the flashbacks are tacky, and it was uninspiring. After reading these comments, I wondered if we were watching the same film. First of all, the film is not boring but I agree that it did not blow me away as I hoped it would. If one has read the book, they will be pleased. If one hasn't, try and keep up because this is not the type of movie where you can zone out and then come back, thinking you didn't miss anything. But most importantly, if you have an open mind, you will enjoy this film. <br/><br/>Secondly, what makes a film fun? Some would say comedy, some would say action. Others might say an intellectual storyline. ""The Da Vinci Code"" provides us with the choice. Ian McKellan gives a brilliant performance as Sir Leigh that many have said is what finally heightens the film. And my response to that is of course he heightens the film at this point because he bring comic relief to the film when it is needed. Up to this point, we had just experienced a murder, Silas in action, and some car chases. So, well-planned in my opinion. Granted the film is no James Bond film with explosives, car and boat chases, and gunfights every ten minutes; there is still some action in ""The Da Vinci Code."" But again, I don't think this is the type of film that strives for action as entertainment. <br/><br/>The true entertainment lies in the storyline. I guess some have said they didn't have the same quick-pace feeling as they did when they read the book, or they didn't feel as involved in the treasure hunt as much as they would have liked. Again, was I watching the same film? The point of the letters jumping out at us, the so-called ""tacky flashbacks,"" and aided visuals is to make us feel connected to Robert and Sophie as they too are trying to solve the puzzle and make sense of it. As Robert was trying to figure out the password to the keystone by remembering what Newton's tomb looks like, we also see it and put the pieces together as he does. As Sophie recalls historical events to understand things, we have an image presented to us to make us understand as well. Some of these flashbacks also helped me connect with the characters that at a time, I felt sorry for Silas. Paul Bettany's performance no doubt contributed. So maybe words are not often enough to tell a story, as I can't press the rewind button during a film, unlike the fact that I can read over a certain point in a book till it finally clicks (as I'm sure many did while reading ""The Da Vinci Code""). <br/><br/>Now to Tom Hanks and Audrey T. Although not their best, the two give good performances. Some have said Tom Hanks looks lost and is sleepwalking through the whole film. He might look like he's sleeping walking because these people might be uninterested in the film and are sleeping themselves because I didn't see that in Robert. If that's the case, this film isn't for them. Robert does at times look ""lost,"" but I think he is suppose to be. He's trying to make sense of everything that has suddenly been thrown at him, which isn't lost but simply thinking through the given situation. I also read one review that asked ""why is Sophie so interested (in the case)?"" This made me laugh so hard I honestly did not understand why this person was a film critic. The simple answer is because the man that was murdered was her grandfather. It's simply for personal reasons. The chemistry between Robert and Sophie I think could have been played up more, but it certainly wasn't entirely absent. Scenes, such as the one where the two are in the van discussing God and Sophie calms Robert of his claustrophobic nerves, show this chemistry. <br/><br/>Overall, I truly enjoyed the film. I wasn't disturbed by the plot nor did I find it ridiculous, and I'm Catholic. I found it entertaining, interesting, and inspiring. The book inspired me to learn about these theories, not necessarily believe them. And the film inspired me to not only believe what I see with my mind, but that there are other things more powerful that can shape what you believe. And that's your faith."

The film is entertaining, with a great plot, awesome performances, great special effects, interesting characters and very artistic photography, yet most of the people focus on the politics of the film rather than the extreme quality of it.

","Well, all the hype sure is enough to make you see what the fuss is about: the Vatican threatening it, calling it ""anti-christian"", people in India starving themselves in protests, countries banning it, and probably everyone's favorite: Tom Hanks' do.<br/><br/>If you ask me, all the hype wasn't about a Satanist film; it was about a good movie. I haven't read the book, so most was new to me, and I thought it was great. I mainly went to see it to see my favorite actor in the leading role, and I got much more than that.<br/><br/>Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks), a leading Harvard scholar, is suspected of murder, and Sophie Neveu(Audrey Tatou), tries to help him clear his name. But the process is actually much darker, a creepy albino monk named Silas(Paul Bettany) who painfully wraps and beats his body with chains as a sacrifice to Jesus Christ, is killing people after getting commands from a dark voice called, 'The Teacher.' In their adventures, Langdon and Tatou meet up with Sir Leigh Teabing(Ian McKellen) and the plot thickens as they discuss the fact that Jesus Christ may have been married, and had a child whose bloodline runs through today, with the Church covering it up. They go through adventures to escape Captain Fache(Jean Reno) in pursuit of accused killers Langdon and Neveu. They become increasingly close to finding the secret on who Christ's descendant is, and where his ""wife"" Mary Magdelene is buried.<br/><br/>I didn't go to question my faith, I went to see a good Tom Hanks movie; and that's what I got. I think it's a good movie to see during the weekends. I don't consider myself ""evil"" for seeing it, because it didn't waver my faith, I view it as entirely fiction. So to see a movie with action and albinos (not a normal combination), go see 'The Da Vinci Code.'"

In the movie Captain Fache was in Opus Dei, in the book he was not. This didn't quite work for me. And near the end of the movie when Langdon and Sophie are at Roslyn Chapple in Scotland, in the movie they make their way into a secret room and find all this incredible documentation of the Priory, and Langdon reveals to Sophie that she is indeed the living descendant of Jesus. The book didn't quite do it this way but it was eventually revealed to Sophie that she is a descendant. There were a few other minor things, but all in all it was well done. Some people have been saying that Tom Hanks might not have been the best choice for Langdon. I thought he did well, but maybe this was not the roll for him.<br/><br/>All in all I like the movie and would recommend it..7 out of 10"
"Prichards12345","6","4","6","22 May 2006"," Worthy effort, lead acting aside.
","After the awful panning the critics have dished out to this movie I went expecting the worst...and was pleasantly surprised. While Ron Howard's adaption of Brown's best-seller sometimes missteps it's a solid film, absorbing without ever being really exciting. The biggest problem is the casting of the two leads; Hanks walks around in a coma for much of the running time, Tatou is simply dreadful; the lack of chemistry between our heroes so apparent as to bite the viewer on the nose. Together these two soporific performances give the film a leaden pace - a bit of trimming would have helped here. Alfred Molina is wasted. There is also lot of exposition for what should be an adventure/thriller; including a lot of flashbacks while someone does a voice-over doesn't hide the fact.<br/><br/>But here criticism ends. I won't go into the plot, it's too well-known to warrant comment; Howard manages to come up with several real shock moments - even if you've read the book, and keeps the intrigue intact. And if the two leads are flat there is always the compensation of watching Ian Mckellen at work. He eats up the role of Teabing with relish, and steals every scene he's in. Paul Bettany is also terrific as Silas, the monk with a mission, exuding a real aura of menace like a sort of Catholic Anakin Skywalker. The locations are exquisite but the film never feels like a travelogue. I came out of the cinema impressed that Howard didn't go for yahoo Hollywood action, but followed the novel closely. For that he's to be commended. The critical mauling the film has received is truly ridiculous.<br/><br/>As to the controversial nature of the plot - it's fiction, raises some intriguing questions about Christianity, makes you think, and most importantly, is not to be taken too seriously. Humph, another DVD to add to my groaning shelves..."

","The Da Vinci code was a great book, so when I went out with some friends to see the movie, we all knew it was going to be a good movie. First off, I should make clear that this is a fiction story, meaning NOT true. The book and movie are about a man, Robert Langdon, and Sophie Neveu-a cryptologist for the DCPJ in France, find themselves on a journey in which Sophie's grandfather leaves behind an anagram for Sophie and Robert to decipher-""13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5 Oh Draconian devil! Oh lame saint!"" which translated to the Fibonacci sequence, 1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21 followed by Leonardo Da Vinci! the Mona Lisa!"" Langdon and Neveu begin their quest here, Langdon wanted by the DCPJ for the murder of the man who left behind the anagram, Jacques Sauniere. He turns out innocent in the end, and the real murderers caught. The movie was quite different from the book in ways, such as the Cryptext, was a large one, with a smaller one inside. In the movie, there was one large one, with the next clue inside. Personally, I enjoyed the ending of the movie much more than I enjoyed the ending of the book, thus the book is better than the movie at some points, while the movie is better than the book at some points."

This is a difficult movie to summerize without spoiling so i'll give it a shot.<br/><br/>Essentially, brilliant Symbology professor Langdon (Hanks) is called in by the French equivalent of the FBI, to help identify symbols on the corpse of a murdered Curator at the Lueve, that apparently he made with his last few minutes on this earth. By being brought in to help investigate Langdon is inadvertently pulled into a battle between a secret society guarding something of immense power and a sect of the church that will do anything to destroy this society and what they protect."

"enjay_","7","4","6","21 May 2006"," Not as bad as people are saying
","I read the book - just like everybody else - and so when i went to see this movie, given all the bad reviews id heard about it, i was fearing the worst. Most of the reviews complain that all the actors do is just stand around talking, and that, although i guess is right, is not a problem at all if your actually listening to what they're talking about.<br/><br/>For me, personally, it's the first half that's the problem. The film starts off as if its already in the middle of the plot, with everyone in there current situations around the globe all visited in the first few minutes. This prevented us getting to know the characters, there was no build up to the main events of the film - they were happening from the second the title came up.<br/><br/>For me, the beginning needed to be a lot slower. More attention should have been paid to introducing Langdon to us instead of him getting involved in things 5 minutes into the film. From the second he was at the Louvre, everything seemed to going so quickly - they were solving clues in record times and it just seemed, well, too scripted - there was no real pause for thought.<br/><br/>But once that first half of the jungle that is the book is cleared, the characters find themselves at Teabings house, and from this moment on the film is great. It keeps you gripped, interested in what is happening, and as far as i can recall (i read the book a year ago) stuck pretty closely with the book barring a few selected omitted parts.<br/><br/>Its this intriguing second half of the film that gets my votes. Id buy the DVD when it comes out. If the first half were slower (such as more time taken for the opening scene in the book at the Louvre, Langdons conference thing, and, well, basically all the parts in the Louvre after that), this film would have been excellent and everything id hoped for. Some things are even explained better in the film than they are in the book.<br/><br/>Whether the director or the editor is to blame for these discrepancies we shall never know. But Ron, i was expecting a little more care be put into the flow and pacing of this story."

Who can forget Scott's review for the NY Times? ""A Code that takes longer to watch than read"". After watching it I have to say that it was a great film and I shouldn't have been that concerned. Ron Howard did a great job, Ian McKellen was absolutely fantastic and the rest of the cast was really good as well (I quite liked Bettany and Molina as Silas and Aringarosa). Yes, there were changes in the plot and yes, little and not-so-little details were omitted. The thing is that instead of ruining the film, these changes gave it a freshness, an originality that was much needed by the people that have read the book more times than they can remember during the last couple of years, like me. The characters stayed true to the books; as did the things that mattered, so I didn't really mind the little changes. Overall, I give it a 9 out of ten."

Plus, any on-screen relationship would technically be inappropriate because of the leading lady being a direct descendant of Christ...<br/><br/>Did Cobb happen to see the very ending of the film? If he didn't find that in anyway ""powerful and emotional"", see a therapist.

"Chris_Docker","6","10","20","19 May 2006"," A conspiracy theorist's wet dream
","Like a conspiracy theorist's wet dream, The Da Vinci Code arrives on our screens claiming to be a work of fiction but enticing us to believe e semi-revealed and darkly hinted substructure of fact.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks leads the fray in this passable but over-hyped thriller about one cult dedicated to exposing 'the truth'about Christianity (and the Roman Catholic Church in particular) and another cult (Opus Dei, one of the more extreme branches of the Vatican autocracy) dedicated to preserving the status quo.<br/><br/>The plot gets going with a murder and the discovery of a blood line going back to a marriage between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. This central premise is fairly weak: the war between the protagonists is based on the idea that, if this central truth is revealed, then Christianity (and the 2000 years of oppression that goes with, specifically that of women and of science) will simply crumble. It is weak firstly because there is little to suggest that burying one part of a doctrine will cause loss of belief in the whole - where external proof is overpowering, religions generally just adapt. Secondly, to have any real weight, the blood line idea would need to include some suggestion that Jesus'powers could have been transmitted genetically - which is not developed in this film.<br/><br/>Like many a heaven-and-hell film, the Da Vinci Code swells or deadens in the imagination according to whether we hold personal belief in the symbols (to be impressed or frightened by God or the Devil you have to have some suspension-of-disbelief that says they can exist). To some devout Christians, this film will seem heretical, as it questions articles of faith (at one cinema, I was picketed by a man distributing leaflets urging doctrinal belief). To the rationalist who thinks there is little historical evidence for the Jesus Christ of the Gospels anyway, it's a non-starter to quibble over whether the alleged central character did or didn't have sex with, or married, an alleged prostitute - it is just these religious folk arguing over details of their belief system.<br/><br/>The wider importance, if any, of The Da Vinci Code is probably somewhere in the middle. As a movie, it would be forgettable, but the social furore has guaranteed box office and discussion. Those of us who are not overly bothered either way about the historical accuracy of the Gospels have been largely disinclined to research the basis of a belief system that has dominated western culture for two millennium. The film at least suggests one could ask questions. For those doing so, a tantalising mix of fact and fiction have been unravelled - not in any quest for the truth but just for the sake of telling a good yarn.<br/><br/>""How do we penetrate historical distortion"" asks the professor played by Hanks. Well, Tom, not by tripping out on psychedelic symbols that can be interpreted a million ways and one. The movie's assertion that the Council of Nicea 'fixed'what was, and what was not, to be believed is roughly correct, but historians may rightly question the extent of the cover up. There is no reason to suggest there wasn't an actual man called Jesus Christ - it was a common enough name - but it might raise eyebrows among the scientifically minded that the particular man of the Gospels went unnoticed by all his contemporaries and that all 'records'of him were compiled at a much later date. Or that much of the texts, including descriptions of attributed miracles, were lifted word for word from the accounts of lives of pre- Jesus Christ characters. None of this proves he didn't exist of course, but neither does it prove that he did. For our story, we have to believe that he did exist, so accounts of what the Nicean Council got up to have received some poetical licence. Whether the Christ of the Gospels existed or not, he is a remarkable figure that many might find inspiring - and it is this type of catch-all which Hanks ultimately finds useful.<br/><br/>Predictably, the film ends just as messily, with a few nice warm fuzzy truisms and beautiful photography of Rosslyn Chapel. Hopefully it won't get overrun by tourists - last time I was there it was guarded by several goats.<br/><br/>The film has made a spectacular amount of money (which hardly would have happened without the legends of Christianity to plagiarise), and the attendant publicity probably hasn't done the church nay harm financially either. Let us hope it will also encourage some people to develop their enquiring minds."

","I read Brown's book because I thought where there was smoke, there had to be fire. Any book that sells this many copies must certainly be moderately well-written, right? How could so many people be wrong? Well, they were. It was horrible. I did not expect art, but the book was less artful than Tom Clancy. Pedantic, preachy, atrocious dialog, this was a book written by a man who thought that as long as he generated an intricate plot, he could skip the inconvenient step of actually WRITING. This book made Dan Brown rich, but it did not make him a writer.<br/><br/>But still, the underlying core of a good story was there, buried beneath the morass of tortured prose. And so I thought, if anyone could correct the fatuous language, Ron Howard and Sony could certainly afford a screenwriter capable of untangling this mess. I was wrong. It appears that the script merely lifted Dan Brown's horrible language from the book. This is the kind of writing that makes one wish the word processor had never been invented. Copy and paste screen writing. But hearing these words in your mind's ear as you read the book, uttered by characters who aren't really there, is one thing. Hearing these ridiculous lines half-heartedly recited by Tom Hanks makes them even more preposterous.<br/><br/>The worst movie Tom Hanks has ever made. Possibly the worst screenplay adaptation of a book this decade. And it's difficult to determine if and where Ron Howard added value."

","My God! But this film is dire. Tom Hanks and what's her name could easily be replaced by shop window dummies for all the difference it would make!

At no point did I find myself in any doubt of the outcome, nor did I care about any of the laughably two dimensional characters.<br/><br/>One can only suppose that the director and cast all decided 'Well, everyone on the planet has read the book (apart from me apparently) so why bother doing anything more than go through the motions and take the money?'.<br/><br/>The only relief is Ian McKellen's having a bit of fun with his not terribly convincing role.<br/><br/>Awful - if enough people bother wasting their money going to see it it will surely go down in history as one of the least significant, most boring films ever made - even the soundtrack is mind numbing!"

","Let me first confess that I never read the book. My friends all did, and they regretted it. They hated the movie more than I did, because I had NO expectations on its quality, whereas they had a concrete vision of how it should have been. However, expectations or not, I was pretty disappointed. After all this controversy it's been getting over the ""big Christian scandal that's lasted centuries,"" I have to say I was let down. As an avid Christian, I thought this would at least peak my interest a little bit. Insult me, intrigue me, whatever. SOMETHING, please. But the presentation, the bland line delivery, and the groggy pace really hurt the film. As the credits rolled at the end, I walked out thinking that I could never have seen this movie, and my life would be the exact same. That is not the feeling one should get after seeing a movie with as much controversial hype as this. I've pretty much already forgotten almost everything that happened in the movie, and I have a pretty good memory."

","while i respect the leading comment about this film, i have to say we walked out after 1.5 hrs- 45 minutes later than we had first discussed leaving. I respect Ron Howard and Tom Hanks very much, and I adore Ian McKellan, but it seemed such a waste of talent here. Admittedly, we have been saturated with the History Channel's renditions of Beyond, Behind, Over, and Around ""the Da Vinci Code"" and I believe this is why we felt this movie was God Awful. The acting is wooden and stilted, and the fact that everything is explained in cue-card style is annoying. I realize there are those who have not read the book and may not have cable, and perhaps to them there is a modicum of curiosity. But to the 40 million who bought the book (not counting those they lent it to) it is tiresome and pedantic and pedagogical and dull. My husband fell asleep, and I could not help throwing up my hands in dismay. Even the rote explanations were tiresome. While I respect being faithful to text, there comes a time when one must forgo the banality of recitation. Just before we decided to leave the theatre ( a $30 waste to us) I said ""maybe the action will start and he won't ask or explain anything else"" and boom... a rote and long winded discussion of something I already knew! again, I believe much of my problem derives from saturation with information re: the premise, but regardless, I felt the talent was wasted to make a plodding replica of an intriguing idea.

As I read viewers reviews I was excited that a big movie was going to be just as we imagined in the book and wasn't going to ruin the story by changing to much. The first 2/3 of the movie was great, and was just how I pictured it in my head, as I'm sure most people who had read the book felt. There was only a couples of things that were abit different, but it was to bad, and was pumped for the ending.<br/><br/>The last third of the movie was the most disappointing, the whole ending was changed, tho it still had the same points as the book ( Sophie finding out she is a descendant, teabing being captured, after Langdon opens the codex, going to Roslin Chapel etc.) Massive chunks were either taken out or changed, and it felt like the last third was so rushed just to get the film finished.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie the whole vibe had been destroyed and I honestly felt cheated by the movie.<br/><br/>Anyone who thinks this movie was awesome and it stayed true to the book is severely brain dead and must have read another book to everyone else.<br/><br/>As Comic Book Guy says in the Simpson's ..

The film does nothing, and i mean nothing to explain Dan Brown's idea he brings up in the book. You will laugh at probably at least 3 scenes that are not intended to bring humor. The entire explanation for this supposed cover-up is accepted by the main characters in a matter of seconds with no evidence at all, and as you probably know they are both supposed to be highly intellectual people. I love Ron Howard and Tom Hanks, and i think Hanks was great in this film, but the problem i foresee is people will hate it, but the religious right will get the blame for it's flopping.

Had the Da Vinci Code not been an intriguing easy read of a book this would be acclaimed as one of the best movies of the year. Also realize that many people are pseudo-intellectuals proud to have actually read the book, believing it is a literary masterpiece and not simply a pop-culture phenomenon.

"lakshmigirish","9","7","13","29 May 2006"," A fine movie that remains true to the book
","I just got back from watching 'The Da Vinci Code' and I think Ron Howard has made a brilliant movie. He has been so true to the book that no Dan Brown fans can complain. Other than 'The Da Vinci Code', I have also enjoyed reading 'Angels and Demons' and 'Digital Fortress', and I am definitely a fan. I think Dan Brown is a gifted storyteller and achieves what any writer aspires for - people to obviously first buy his books(!), then think about them and discuss them. My companions at the movie had not read the book, so my initial thought was that they were brave to watch the movie first. Yes, things happen at such a fast pace that sometimes you are left reeling! But all three of them loved the movie as well, and are off to read the book now!<br/><br/>Let me warn you here that I am an Indian and have grown up watching movies that are, on an average, three and a half hours long! So two and a half hours is child's play :-), but if the movie does seem a tad too long at the end, I think that is a direct consequence of the book - I thought that Dan Brown outdid himself with the cryptex breaking scene, and anything after that had too much to compete with!<br/><br/>Ian McKellan is delightful (as always). Just listening to his voice asking Langdon the three questions to gain entry makes you realize you are in for a treat! And I feel that Teabing's last scene as he is driven away in the car is longer than necessary to allow for applause!!<br/><br/>For the first part of the movie, I thought other than being very French - avec accent and petite form - Audrey Tatou was very weak and contributed little else, but she kind of gets more involved in her role as the movie goes on, and I think her final scene where she dips her shoe into the pond and gives Tom Hanks a winning smile with a twinkle in her eye was a touch of genius at the end - it relieved both the built-up tension at that point in the movie and elicited the most appreciative laughter from the audience in my theater.<br/><br/>I thought Paul Bettany was fantastic - what a talented actor. After seeing what a likable guy he is (on a talk show), I can now appreciate his acting abilities - the disturbing portrayal of a troubled soul - all the more.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks seemed a bit wooden - for Tom Hanks, that is... I think being such a fine actor, he makes it look so easy - too easy sometimes, almost like he is less than completely involved. Although, to be fair to him, I think he was true to Dan Brown's Robert Langdon, and other than spontaneously morphing into a young Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks could really have done little else to improve on his character!<br/><br/>Technically brilliant, with the past and present woven together with magnificent special effects, and an appropriately haunting musical score to boot. All in all, definitely an enjoyable afternoon's viewing!"
"Proscriptus","3","7","13","25 May 2006"," Just a lot of nothing
","There's nothing wrong with the Da Vinci Code that a new director, screenwriter, cinematographer and editor wouldn't have cured. Fundamentally, it's OK, but the problem is the amateurish feel from beginning to end. It's much like a Movie of the Week on network TV. It's just...lackluster. And I didn't read the book. And I'm an atheist, so I don't care about the religion one way or the other.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's direction on the past has ranged from workmanlike (Apollo 13), to good (A Beautiful Mind), to truly awful (Backdraft), and this is well down on the scale. He seems in part to be hamstrung by his devotion to particular actors; Paul Bettany has yet to turn in a bad performance, but here takes attention away from the main plot line. Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon is fine, but the character has nothing to do, leaving Hanks holding an empty bag with his huge burden of acting history...and perm. It's weight without substance, and more, is poorly paced and just badly shot by Salvatore Totino whose credits include, well, nothing of note, and are unlikely to get any more illustrious from here on out.<br/><br/>The screenplay, by ""Daniel P. Hanley"" and Akiva Goldsman is just lousy. Both are longtime Howard collaborators, and rumours are rife that Hanlet is a pseudonym for Howard. I don't know if the book was this jerky, but the film is a bumper car of stops and starts.<br/><br/>But the worst offenses are from editor Mike Hill, another longtime Howard crony. At 149 minutes, there's at least 45 minutes of total fluff he should have cut. Length is not a substitute for content. It just makes it feel longer than it is."

The film is well cast and moves along to a good conclusion. However I am growing increasingly tired of people talking about the factual correctness or otherwise of this film. People bandy around comments about what happened 2,000 years ago as if we have concrete evidence - we do NOT! All of the gospels were written long after the events and supposed to have happened - we do not have eye witness testimony! Let's be clear about this. Christianity is a matter of faith - if Christians choose to believe that somehow a vigin (mis-translation from the aramaic almah - which means a young woman - by the way for you fellow Latin scholars ""it did not say that Mary was ""virgo intacto"" - was impregnated by a ""holy spirit"" thats up to you. But look at the evidence - scant as it is - that exists. Christians borrowed the faith from the Jews. According to the Jewish faith - Jesus was married (he had to be - he was a Rabbi - you cannot be a Rabbi unless you are married). Also at the wedding in Cannae, Mary Magdalene anointed his feet with oil and wiped them clean with her hair - this is EXCLUSIVELY done as part of an ancient Jewish marriage festival. Dan Brown takes some of these ""facts"" and creates an entertaining story. Just enjoy it for what it is! And if you are so insecure in your faith to get upset about it - well shame on you!"

Before dying, Saunière wrote codes, symbols, a pentagram and a Fibonacci number sequence inclusive using his own blood. Sooner Saunière's granddaughter, the cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) arrives with a message to Langdon, advising him that he is in danger and suspect for the murder of Saunière. Langdon and Sophie join their knowledge and follow leads to one of the greatest secrets of mankind history, the descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene.<br/><br/>The novel and bestseller of Dan Brown was one of the most intriguing books that I had read about a couple of years ago. I was curious about the adaptation to the cinema of this complex and detailed story, and I found it only reasonable, with beautiful locations and a total lack of emotions. The cast uses great names, but first of all the physical appearances of Robert Langdon, the ""red haired"" Sophie Neveu and the ""strong black"" Bezu Fache do not correspond with the description of the characters in the novel. Further, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou do not show any chemistry, but the always excellent Paul Bettany is perfect performing Silas. Of course there are simplifications in the story, it would be impossible to translate all the subplots to the screenplay, but I still found the movie quite confused and presenting too much information to be followed by a viewer that has not read the book.

The riddles were easy, the plot was contrived, and in all seriousness the characters are not developed.

In all honesty it had me fooled until about page 30 when i had an epiphany: This is Dan Brown trying to show us how smart he is, but he's not. The whole way through the book (which i had to read) i kept thinking that it was talking AT me and not letting me find my way to conclusions and events like a good novel would. However, there was great potential for a fun action movie that i thought would be quite enjoyable. and that is what this review is about: a movie.<br/><br/>the movie, much like the book talks at the audience. it is all dialog and facts with no space or time between for interpretation or acting. I think Ron Howard is an Extreemly talented director and all the actors in it are very good as well, i just feel that the material could have been portrayed better rather than be a fictional history lecture. there was little enjoyment in a very interesting topic and people got very huffy because they are portrayed as facts rather than fiction... if you believe Dan brown i feel sorry for you.<br/><br/>why i gave it a 3: it was not very entertaining and the character did not mesh well together, it gets 2 stars for the actors in it who did the best they could with what little they had and 1 star for not having it turn into a HORRIBLE romance in the end like the book...BRAVO Ron Howard."
"claudiagatefiles","1","10","21","23 May 2006"," The Da Vinci Code - don't do it!
","Where to start.....For those of you that just want to get a quick impression of the movie without having to read a full commentary, I will start by saying that it is truly one of the most God-awful (no pun intended!) movies I have ever seen - perhaps with the exception of the Julian McMahon 'erotic' movie Magenta (but then air guitar music is always a sign of a bad movie!). At no point throughout the pain-staking two and a half hours of the movie, does Ron Howard capture the atmosphere of the book. In true Ron Howard style he steers away from delving into any dark territory, preferring to capture every scene with an air of lightness - which may also explain the (mis)casting of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. Tom has this Harold Bishop quality (an aging wobbly-cheeked jolly fellow from Ozzie soap Neighbours - for those of you who aren't familiar with this fab TV masterpiece!) about him which is completely misplaced for the portrayal of a character such a Robert Langdon, who is described as such an intellectual, stiff upper lip kind of man with a much sterner and deeper voice also than that of Mr. Nice Guy Tom Hanks. Having said that, Audrey Tatou made Tom Hanks look great. As much as I loved her in Amelie, she was terrible in this movie, as she delivered each and every one of her lines completely flat! (which is probably more a reflection of the crap dialogue the actors were given to work with, than the actors' own abilities) It seemed as though Audrey Tatou (and the rest of the actors for that matter) was holding the book below the frame and just reading her lines directly from it, which also says something for the movie's adapted screenplay, which seems to have been forgotten in a desperate attempt to pump the movie out as quickly as possible - rushed casting, rushed screenplay - the only thing that wasn't rushed which could have been was the damn movie, which dragged so terribly! The dialogue in the movie appears directly from the book, with seemingly no attempt to adapt it for the big screen - lesson 1.01 - what works in a 600 page book does not necessarily work in a 2 and half hour movie - having failed to appreciate this lesson the dialogue is often cringe-worthy and endlessly expository. Had Ron Howard focused more on capturing the sentiment and tone of the book, then perhaps it wouldn't have been necessary to have the actors spew endless pieces of dialogue, as a result of which the viewers may have been spared of Audrey Tatou's painful delivery! As a side-note, Sophie Nevue would never use the word ""kid"", nor would Robert Langdon say ""wow"" - it seems therefore that the vain attempts at adapting the dialogue in the book totally missed the mark anyway! I could potentially go on forever, but as the movie accomplished that and I'm still shattered from the experience I will spare you + I have already wasted 2 and a half hours of my life watching the monstrosity and so I am now ready to close that chapter! On one single positive note, Ian McKellen was fantastic yet again - but then that guy could make 2 hours of buttering bread look good! So in summary, spare yourselves (and your pennies) - enjoy the book and avoid the movie at all costs!"

","It has been said that when God created man, he put definite limits on his intelligence but no limits on his stupidity.<br/><br/>Dan Brown with both his book and now this flaccid excuse for a movie has certainly proved that to be correct.<br/><br/>He's got to be laughing his rear end off at all of us; all the way to the bank.<br/><br/>Here's a guy who wrote a novel (if you can call that collection of mangled sentences a novel) that did little more than express his distorted personal views of a God he doesn't believe in and his distaste for people who do believe.<br/><br/>Take Adolph Hitler's hatred of Jews in ""Mein Kampf,"" add a weak story line and call it a novel and you'll have what Dan Brown did with his hatred of Jesus Christ, the Bible, Christians in general and Catholics in particular in ""The DaVinci Code."" I'll give him credit for one thing though; he's a master of the BIG LIE.<br/><br/>He seems to fully understand that the bigger and more outrageous a lie is, the easier it is to get people to fall for it. P. T. Barnum understood that and made a career out of telling big lies in a humorous way. It worked. The public was entertained and he got rich in the process.<br/><br/>By comparison, Dan Brown's big lies are neither humorous nor entertaining, they're just lies; period.<br/><br/>Regarding those who have the audacity to protest against Dan's lies, (like the people that were standing across the street from the movie theater holding signs) the DaVinci disciples are fond of saying ""Hey, get a grip. It's just FICTION!"" As if that makes it all OK. With that kind of thinking you can then tell any lie you want about anyone you want; call it fiction, and you can get away with it -- right?<br/><br/>Try this one on for size. Someone writes a novel about your family; your mother, father etc. and all the people you love and respect. In the novel your family members and all your friends are called whores, liars, thieves, and murders. When you protest, you're told ""Get a grip!! It's just FICTION!"" I wonder if you would accept it as such; ya think? <br/><br/>Yea, I know. The book was a mildly interesting murder mystery. If that had been translated to the screen, perhaps it could have been given at least two stars for entertainment value. Not so.<br/><br/>This flick is so dull you'll need a six pack of ""Jolt"" just to stay awake. People in the audience actually snickered at some of the supposedly most serious and dramatic moments in the film.<br/><br/>I really can't give it much of a review at all; it was just too over hyped, too long, too weak and too dull to even deserve commenting on.<br/><br/>I can't grace this slug of a film with anything more than one star. I guess Ron and Tom needed the money. If you value yours, stay home and watch a rerun of ""Shoes of the Fisherman."" It inspires something a lot more productive than Dan's hokum does; that fer sure.<br/><br/>What's next? Maybe Dan will follow this up with a novel about Mother Theresa of Calcutta. Yea, ""The Calcutta Code."" In it he'll give us the inside scoop on how Mother Theresa was actually a conspirator and together with today's descendants of DaVinci she was really planning to take over the world. All that business of helping the poor for over forty years was just a cover up. <br/><br/>Like Dan, Ron and Tom will laugh all the way to the bank. Why? Because almost no one will pay any attention to the negative (but honest) reviews of this dog and they'll still cough up their bucks at the box office window. <br/><br/>This overflowing hog trough will probably be nominated for six or seven academy awards. Sigh. Go figure."
"kingzmessenger","1","10","21","21 May 2006"," I found the movie to be largely boring
","Though the book (which I have not read) is supposed to be very well-written and be a fun, edge-of-your-seat novel, I found the movie to be long and largely boring. I kept thinking to myself, ""Is it over yet?"" My niece, in contrast, said she thought it was interesting. My brother-in-law compared the movie to ""National Treasure,"" but personally, I found ""National Treasure"" to be a FAR move interesting movie than ""The DaVinci Code."" If it were not for the claims of accuracy by Dan Brown (i.e., a fictional novel claiming to be factual---even though Dan Brown admits to it being a fictional novel, at the same time, the book says that all the documents, organizations, etc. are accurate; plus, according to his own website, he apparently believes a lot of it to be true himself) and the wide-spread public controversy, along with 60% of people surveyed believing that either all or part of it was true---if it were not for all the public controversy, I would find it to be a stupid story and hardly worth notice. However, much of the movie did come across as being quite convincing that these were actual facts that were being revealed, and not just some fun story, so because of that, I also found it to be a very bold and diabolical attack against Christianity. However, I do agree that, on the positive side, it does promote discussion of such historical and theological matters, which I see as a good thing. It has prompted me to do research on the issues raised in the movie, and because of this, I have learned more than I knew before. My research has only solidified my faith as a Christian, because I have found the Bible, the four Gospel accounts, and Christ Jesus the Son of God to have an immense mountain of verifiable historical accuracy and manuscript documents (including non-Christian sources) to back them up, compared to the ridiculous, preposterous, stupid, silly and feeble claims that ""The DaVinci Code"" makes. Toward the end of the movie, when they revealed what was supposed to be a huge climax in the movie, I had to suppress myself (out of respect for the others in the theater) from laughing out loud, since it was so ridiculous."
"Quinoa1984","6","10","21","19 May 2006"," maybe the best that could be done from the book- a contrived-to-hell (no pun intended) blockbuster with some merit
","What can I say that hasn't already be written or said about Dan Brown's international smash book about the deepest ""secret"" in Christianity? Having read only part of it (as it is, arguably of course, an airplane book with a hugely elevated status over controversy and popularity), I can say that the movie, directed by Ron Howard and with a cast of French, American and British all-stars, does what it means to do. It brings some food-for-thought, with enough exposition for three typical Hollywood movies. And, at times, Howard and company (i.e. screenwriter Akiva Goldsman) shave off a couple of parts in Brown's writing that aren't necessary while keeping the thoughtful (as well as, dare I say, silly) nature of the writing. <br/><br/>As it is, the Da Vinci Code DOES have a plot that is structured well enough- a symbol specialist, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks in a role that basically calls for the basics of his talents, no more no less), is drawn into a case of murders, a conspiracy involving secret, ultra-dangerous sects of the Catholic church (with a creepy villain in Paul Bettany's character), and a search for an item as old as Christianity itself.<br/><br/>The film traces parts of Europe for the hunt, and along the way there is information compulsively expounded upon about the secrets behind the murders, the symbols, the clues, and how the entire history of the Jesus Christ is possibly- dare the filmmaker/authors say- corrupted and a lie. So it is here that the controversy has been brought through. But the controversy is no more understandable than it was for films like Dogma and The Last Temptation of Christ; religious groups are BOUND to get sensitive by material that faces against their sternly stringent views. That it's transferred into a murder mystery/thriller that has more twists than the International House of Pretzel puts it up for everyone to contemplate. <br/><br/>What helps make the film watchable even as the story goes through more contrivances and surprises than I'd care to count (with the core being a suspension of disbelief of both plot turns and the exposition bits) is the cast assembled. The bulk of the players- Ian McKellan, Alfred Molina, Audrey Tatou, and Jean Reno- are the best that could have been cast, and all that are asked of them are to say the dialog with enough conviction and believability to not be totally dull or just, well, wrong.<br/><br/>While the direction by Howard and his crew is not the most imaginative, he is able to serve all of the ""so-called"" facts and ideas to use without making it into the overly pretentious. While I wouldn't think of this at all of being a great film or with the ambition even to BE one, it at least tries to have the skills of the common Hollywood thriller while serving up more facts than the same thriller wouldn't think to touch. <br/><br/>To put it another way- this is basically Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with half of the adventure, and more than half of the historical and religious implications amplified. As Ebert said, it's ""preposterously entertaining"", and to take it as 100% serious is missing what is aimed for, even if not entirely successful. 6/10"
"fatherjack66","3","10","21","19 May 2006"," What was all the fuss about?
","I have not reading the book and I thought that the film would live up to the hype around the book. I was completely wrong, it is a very dull film and is very muddled in places. It barely held my interest, the only reason it did was because there is very little else to do in a cinmea apart from watch the film. The story is stupid and I have not got a clue way there was a huge fuss about it and loads of television programmes have been made about it as it is ridiculous and only an idiot would believe it too be true. It is too long, miscast(the worst performances from Hanks I have ever seen) and poorly directed (especially the action). If you want to see a better film along the same lines watch any of the Indiana Jones films or even National Treasure starring Nichalos Cage, which is him after lost treasure but is just lot more entertaining. I have too say I nearly didn't go see it and now I wish I had saved my money and not gone."

","Just when I started to think that Ron Howard was getting interesting with A BEAUTIFUL MIND and the underrated Cinderella MAN he goes back to his old ways of painting by the numbers. Once again, he proves he has no style with this lame duck movie, THE DA VINCI CODE. I never read the book, I had no idea what the story was other than it had religious over-tones and still I wasn't thrilled or surprised for 2 seconds. If the end is supposed to be a twist then I wasn't surprised...it was so obvious. Everything about this movie is mediocre and ordinary, from the dull screenplay to the bland acting (Tom Hanks looks pained and the usually charming Audrey Tatou can't act in English)....And there are fine actors in this film...What happened here?...I don't understand. Maybe it would make a better TV mini series, but as a film it was forced and pretentious without any right to be. Now, Ron Howard seems like a good man, so I don't mean to insult him, but as a director he has no style or imagination. I obviously can't recommend this movie. I'm not at all a god fearing Jesus-freak so I'm not biased in that sense. I guess the only way that I am biased is that I prefer better films. Don't bother with this one unless you feel you must rent it eventually."
"vdbke","7","14","32","17 May 2006"," Wonderful movie, sad old critics are wrong in my opinion...
","As most of you will know, ""The Da Vinci Code"" received a lot of negative criticism. It is said to be ""too difficult"" and ""too long"".<br/><br/>Even though I have looked up some information about the scientific background of ""The Da Vinci Code"", I haven't read the book, so I went to the theater without any real expectations.<br/><br/>What we got served was 2 hours and a half of splendid cinematography. Ron Howard obviously chose to use as much information as possible from the book. With photographic flashbacks he manages to both keep the depth of the characters and to not make the film any longer (which was one of the main concerns in my opinion). Acting in this kind of movie is always hard. Adding too much emotion will get the audience distracted from the actual film, while a really robotic performance would lead to a lack of realism. In my opinion both Audrey Tautou and Tom Hanks did a regularly good job. In other words: the acting part was not remarkable nor bad.<br/><br/>I don't think that I am the person to judge other people's opinions (for example, the ones of the critics). I just want to say that I strongly disagree about this movie. Due to the fact that the developers wanted to put as much information as possible into the movie, it indeed became a bit difficult. However, unless you the huge pile of brainless Hollywood rubbish, that doesn't need to be a bad thing. During the pause, I personally thought that we didn't get any in-depth knowledge about the characters, but that was put straight again in the second part of the movie.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is the best movie I have seen in cinema for the last six months and it is, together with V for Vendetta, one of my 2 Oscar nominations so far (with The Da Vinci Code being a certain winner). It is a must for everyone who likes to think while he watches a movie. Don't listen to the critics and make up an opinion for yourself. I guarantee you that you won't regret it!"

I believe the movie had great organization, so much so that I was on the edge of my seat, yet unable to predict the next scene. I love Tom Hank's character. An Intelligent man that knows his theology, applies his knowledge to decode the Da Vinci code. wow. Great rising action to fulfill an even better climax and is rewarded by an excellent ending. What more can you ask for?<br/><br/>All in all, it was a great script lead by an even better cast. Cinematography was almost Identical to my imagination when I read the book. I think it was had the potential to reach a very diverse range of audience. those who do not believe so, all I have to say is its under the FICTIONAL section. So just take the story for what it is, which is a story plain and simple. Don't over analyze. Its simply not fair to the cast or the director.<br/><br/>Audience prepare yourselves. I feel as though the theme was pretty fast pace. However I also believe this is what gave the film its edge. I learned that I should keep an open mind to Christianity after I viewed this film.

","I am 14 years old, and an avid reader but also a very harsh film critic.<br/><br/>In the case of the Da Vinci code, I fell in love with the book, as soon as I read it, and the movie was a similar story. The movie has been harshly judged by critics, and one notable report claimed that it was a load of rubbish, however I am inclined to disagree with this statement and recommend it to anyone with an interest in the Dan Brown books.<br/><br/>The film has a slow beginning, but as soon as the action starts, it continues at a lively pace, but (in my opinion) explaining the majority of it very well.<br/><br/>Ron Howard has brought the book to life excellently on the silver screen, and the casting can't be criticised. Sir Ian McKellen, really settles into his role as the obsessive historian Leigh Teabing, and Paul Bettany is absolutely fantastic as the Opus Dei monk, Silas, bringing a sense of evil and vulnerability to the part, whilst avoiding the usual stereotypical villain portrayals.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Audrey tatou have both been criticised for not having any on screen chemistry, but realistically, if the average person was trying to be murdered by various people, they wouldn't fall in love with the first girl they meet. Ron Howard is just living in the real world.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say this was an excellent film suitable for just about anybody."
"ivona021","9","6","11","4 June 2006"," Ron Howard rules!!!
","I didn't like the book because I thought it was too long for what it had to say, and since reading of the book happens at the reader's pace, the puzzles weren't tough enough to appear difficult to a reader with a substantial mathematical knowledge at his own pace.<br/><br/>However the book did make me imagine the wonderful locations it goes through and I figured it was going to be a really good movie.<br/><br/>I read the critiques when the movie premiered - booing in Cannes, jokes about Tom Hanks' hair, Audrey Tautou's accent, incomprehensible dialogue, whatever. Some friends told me the book was better, some that they didn't like it and they didn't read the book, and fortunately, some told me that it was totally OK.<br/><br/>We saw it last night and we really liked it! I thought it could have been longer, and I wouldn't have even noticed it. The script was fine. Tom Hanks' hair is fine. Audrey's cute and intense, her accent does sound confusing in 2-3 lines but it is believable, and the rest is all fine. Everyone did a great job. I liked it how all the clues were highlighted and how they were passing through ghosts on the way to the Westminster Abbey; the flashbacks were clear and not overwhelming; I felt sorry for all the characters who were manipulated to do horrid things in the name of their faith, and the end of the movie offers the moral of the story much clearer than it was done in the book, and ... Yeah, I liked it very much.<br/><br/>There are 2-3 instances in the movie when the cut to what happens next was too fast, and I imagine the DVD will explain why some stuff was cut out -- probably to save some time, which they shouldn't have done.<br/><br/>And, unfortunately the sound was not crystal-clear which, given all the accents, in the audience full of popcorn and candy-chewing couch potatoes, for whom it is appealing to crack a difficult code fast without need to understand complex sentences, made it difficult to listen."

"Elswet","10","6","11","23 May 2006"," Solid, faithful adaptation, which presents some beautiful portrayals, a little gritty action, and a compelling story.
","WARNING: SPOILERS AT THE BOTTOM!<br/><br/>First off, this review is concerning the movie, not the book itself. <br/><br/>I will begin with the casting. There has been a lot said over the past year or so since the casting list was unveiled, expressing misgivings concerning what has been called the ""miscasting"" of Tom Hanks in the role as Robert Langdon. I am happy to report that earlier misgivings were completely unfounded. Tom Hanks delivers a performance reminiscent of his earlier days when he was more relaxed in his execution, and seems to have rediscovered his remarkable talents.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen contributes a believability to his performance, which is so strong, as to make you consider (if only for a brief while) whether or not he has personal interest in the Grail. He was remarkable as Leigh Teabing, but would you really expect anything less of him? Certainly not!<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou gave a refreshingly capable performance as Agent Sophie Neveu. She portrayed her character with a polished professionalism one might not expect from a relative newcomer to the world of American films. Of course, people who think like that are in for a rude awakening, and Audrey Tautou is just the one to give it to them.<br/><br/>Jean Reno enacted a character which goes through some heart-felt changes. He does so with a style and grace amid the action sequences involving French Police Captain Fache in a portrayal which is reminiscent of his riveting spot lit performance as the Professional. The principle difference between the two characters, and Reno's enactment of them, is that there is much more time for character development in the Professional wherein the audience may get to ""know"" the character. In the DaVinci Code, Fache's (pronounced Fash, by the way) character was one of peripheral standing and, therefore, there was very little in the way of opening character development where his character was concerned. He manages quite succinctly, however, to give you enough of the back-story of his motivations and motives to allow you a brief window into the many-faceted man who is Captain Fache. His performance was possibly one of his best, to date.<br/><br/>And that leaves Paul Bettany. I was concerned, never having seen him portray such a complex character as Silas. I am here to apologize for my earlier misgivings. He portrayed Silas dead on. The raw (and sometimes confused and clouded) emotion he exhibited was spot on and we, the audience, found a certain reality in his portrayal. He was brilliant.<br/><br/>And after all that, I still feel the need to say that Ron Howard was the real star of this work. His choices of camera angles, filming techniques, effects, and overall direction shine through it all in such a way as to solidly cement his name into the list of top directors. Some would argue that he was already there, and he was. But he is affirmed, confirmed, and reaffirmed as one of the best directors in the world.<br/><br/>The work itself was an extremely faithful adaptation. It was gritty, and had us completely involved in the story, even though we were all fans of the book, and already knew what to expect. The execution of the action was shockingly realistic. I would not take children under 16 to see this, personally, and would have to think a bit before subjecting a 16-year-old to it. Silas's use of the cilice (which, according to my dictionary, is a hair-coat much like Robbie Coltrane wears while filming Harry Potter) and self flagellation is quite graphic. However, if they have seen the Passion of the Christ, then they can most definitely handle this.<br/><br/>As far as the subject matter goes, this is neither the time, nor the place for that discussion. I will say that this work of fiction fully utilizes the potential presented by the prior historical research upon which it was based; namely, ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail."" It is a work of fiction lovingly interwoven throughout some compelling historical hypotheses presented by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln in their aforementioned published historical work.<br/><br/>The Catholic Church has issued condemnation after condemnation of this work. They should know better than to condemn a movie, by now. All it does is raise the box office sales, by piquing the interest in people who normally would have no desire to see the work. It bestowed such a high level of exposure that many people who never would have even heard of it, are now going to see it. <br/><br/>Opus Dei has also wrongly condemned the movie for portraying them in a less than favorable light. That is not the case. It is made quite clear that Silas's mental stability is not only in question, but is doubtful. I was obviously just an opportunistic grab for their fifteen minutes of fame, than any true objection they may have had to the film at large.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Book fans may be interested in knowing that there were four scenes omitted from the cinematic version. These scenes had no determination or bearing to the outcome of the story, and were therefore not missed...merely noticed. Namely, Sophie never puts it together that her grandmother was the woman who was with her grandfather during the rite. And she is not told (at least not in our presence) that the gap-toothed boy who attends Roslyn Chapel is her brother. You are shown the photo of the boy as a child, and you realize (if you've read the book) that it is her brother, but they never say it. The Madonna on the Rocks sequences were omitted for time. The ending is different than the novelized version, but more enjoyable.<br/><br/>END SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>That not withstanding, The DaVinci Code is highly enjoyable, regardless of your religious views. It is a work of FICTION, and as such, was entertainingly engrossing.<br/><br/>It rates a 9.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"garbagemailhere","10","6","11","22 May 2006"," critics have never been more wrong
","I saw the movie twice (two different dates wanted to see it) -- opening night and Sunday night of the first weekend. Both times it was sold out and both times the audience was gripped from start to finish. Opening night the audience clapped at the end. Sunday night they did not clap but were clearly deeply into the movie. Is it the best movie ever made? Nah. But it's about a topic that fascinates audiences indoctrinated since birth in all manner of religious myth. The US is chock full of very superstitious and paranoid people, so the movie delivers right into the sweet spot. This is the land of ""Touched by an Angel,"" the land where 80% of people do not believe in the theory of evolution. Can't miss with a film like Da Code. I enjoyed the subversiveness of the flick. It's pro women, it's pro rationality, and it quite rightly portrays Christians (particularly Catholics) to be members of a worldwide cult that has been as prone to violence over the years as anything the Muslims can dish up. Ian McKellen (openly gay) makes the movie. I love his response to the protesting Christians at Cannes, to the effect that they ought to welcome a film depicting Jesus as married and sleeping with a woman, as it finally puts to rest conjecture Jesus was gay."
"nvan_girl","10","6","11","22 May 2006"," Best Movie of the Year!
","This film is great. I believe that it is one of the best films of the year. There are a few things that make the Da Vinci Code is such a good film.<br/><br/>First, the film has an actual plot. Most of the films out there today are plain stupid, plot-less movies that are purely made just to bring in that little bit of money that they somehow manage to make. Da Vinci Code has a plot that is well developed and actually makes sense. It has lots of twists and turns that make you think. The ending of the movie was very well done and true to the book. Unlike some other movies, Da Vinci makes a nice closing at the end that is heart warming and emotional.<br/><br/>Secondly, Da Vinci was very well cast. Tome Hanks was just outstanding as Robert Langdon and so was Audrey Tautou as Sofie Neveu. The rest of the cast like Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany and Alfred Molina were awesome. I don't think that there could be better suited people for the roles.<br/><br/>Lastly, the one final touch that makes Da Vinci so good is the music. Hans Zimmer did an absolutely wonderful job with the music. The score adds to the movie and pushes it up, makes thoughtful scenes thoughtful, and action scenes full of apprehension.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is a movie based on a book. Everyone knows that and the movie will be criticized about it but to be honest the movie is on the same level of excellent as the book. Some of the parts of the book were cut but it doesn't bring the movie down.<br/><br/>I must say I will definitely go and see the movie again and I urge everyone that reads this review to do the same even though there is so much bad criticism surrounding this movie and its content. IT'S FICTION! IT'S NOT A HISTORY DOCUMENTARY, IT'S A MOVIE! (and one worth seeing over and over again)"
"gradyharp","8","6","11","22 May 2006"," The Da Vinci Code: The Movie
","After all the hoopla and controversy parting the waters between the religious right and Catholic Church and the avid devotees of Dan Brown's multi-million dollar success book, the movie version is finally here. THE DA VINCI CODE makes a good movie - and that is enough.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard has assembled a good international cast, trusted the screenplay to Akiva Goldsman, and in fine Hollywood style has transformed an interesting premise of a story from Dan Brown's interested though unsophisticatedly written blockbuster into a suspense thriller. The story of a murder in the Louvre leading a former flatfoot detective turned writer of symbology and a French cryptographer on a chase involving the Vatican, the Opus Dei society, and the Priory guarding the Holy Grail is full of terrific visualizations of some of the encrypted secrets of Brown's novel and in the end the movie allows the viewer to follow the interesting story much more easily than did the book.<br/><br/>The settings are magnificent (cinematography by Salvatore Totino), the musical score by Hans Zimmer sweeps the story along embracing all aspects of the atmosphere, and the visual effects department has done a fine job with some tough tasks. The actors take their characters in stride, given that many of them are over the top figures: Ian McKellen will satisfy every reader's vision of Sir Leigh Teabing; Paul Bettany is appropriately crazy as Silas; Jean Reno offers a Captain Fache who manages to hold things together; Audrey Tatou turns a fine spin as the all-important Sophie Neveu; and Tom Hanks sleepwalks through his rather innocuous conception of Robert Langdon. And the ending is a rather sappy sellout not found in the book - but this is Hollywood...<br/><br/>This film may set box office records - which seems to be the point in making it - and serves to prove what good PR work can do for a movie. Many will put down 'The Da Vinci Code' because of religious reasons or other reasons, but in the end it is a just a good story well told - not a great movie but an entertaining one. Recommendation: a good 2 1/2 hour diversion, but not one to rush out to see until the crowds dwindle a bit. Grady Harp"
"rogerpoirier2","5","8","16","7 June 2006"," Why much publicity for so little!
","I just have seen the French version of the Da Vinci Code yesterday and I have been as surprised as disappointed. Why all this fuss about this movie? Moreover, how can this far-fetched story trigger such controversy about Christian religion? As example found in the same kind of story/thriller a film such as National Treasure (2004) is much better done and seemingly benefited of a budget up to its pretenses, which is not at all the case with the Da Vinci Code. Dialogues, actors and rhythm are unsubtle. Good guys, like the bad ones, are much stereotyped. I am French and not Catholic, but I sincerely wonder why the Catholic Church and the Opus Dei feel their image and reputation are threatened by this movie."
"movie025","10","8","16","19 May 2006"," Nuanced conclusion : Very entertaining and quite spectacular, but don't take it too seriously.
","As many readers of ""The Da Vinci Code"", I was curious about how the film would be. So I went to the movies yesterday to find out how it has worked out. I took my brother with me, not only for company but also to form an opinion on this movie that wouldn't be too unilateral.<br/><br/>Directing a film which is based upon a book of which are sold more than 40 million copies worldwide is one of the reasons why there was a lot of pressure on the shoulders of director Ron Howard. People will even pay attention to the most minuscule things that Howard has had to leave out of the movie, they will start to complain and say how it should have been done, or in the worst case, they would rather have seen another director for this film. However, I think he has dealt with it very well, or better, he has done a great job. My brother says that he hasn't done it as bad as many would think. Another thing is that just as the book, the movie is fiction. The objective of author Dan Brown was to reduce the differences between fiction and non-fiction as small as possible.<br/><br/>Well, now something more about the movie. I think that the historic images and locations are magnificent, but it are the actors who carry the movie. Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. At first, I was surprised that they chose him, at second thought, I had all the confidence in him, and yes, he didn't let me down. Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu. I heard that many were surprised that she was chosen for the role. Conversely, I think she was perfect. She is easy on the eyes and now I know she has a lovely French accent as well. Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing. He was funny at certain times and mean at other times, but what really occurred to me was his diction and pronunciation. It was impeccable. He certainly was stealing the show. Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa. I know he is a versatile actor and here he has done it very well. Jean Reno as Bezu Fache. The author of the book created this character with Jean in his mind. Therefore, further comments aren't needed. Paul Bettany as Silas. No one could have played it better than him. You really could see the pain, fear, relief, and joy in his eyes at different moments. At times I felt some compassion for him. My brother, on the other hand, finds the acting reasonable, above average. What appealed to him the most, was how they had put on screen, the thinking processes of Langdon and the stories on the ancient times, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, I think that the movie has lived up to my expectations. I knew the plot, nonetheless it has been almost a year since I read the book. Hence, there were numerous moments where I was surprised. My brother thinks that the film goes immediately into a flow acceleration in the beginning. Too many things happen in such a small time span. As a consequence, the spectator doesn't know what the movie is all about. This applies to those who haven't read the book (yet). I have to agree with him on this. However, Howard makes it up by especially focusing on the end of the movie in order that all the questions, which both actor and viewer in particular have, will be answered.<br/><br/>To the people who have read the book, I know that the book is much more thrilling and exciting than the movie. There's no question about that. My advice to them is just pretending that you haven't read the book (yet) and let the movie surprise yourself. That's what I and my brother have tried to do. Afterwards you can compare the movie with the book, if you want to. To the people who haven't read the book (yet), it's a rather intelligent movie. Thus you have to stay concentrated, in order to understand it. But there are some parts where you can loose your concentration for a while as the various escapes. Our nuanced conclusion is that it is a very entertaining and quite spectacular movie. However, keep in mind that it's just fiction. So don't take the movie too seriously. It merely wants to show another part of the truth."
"HL-UK","1","11","24","16 June 2006"," Big Disappointment
","I watched this movie last night and found it a complete disappointment. I read the book and whilst I thought the idea was original (although very badly documented), I found the ending was one of the most stupid ones in history. The film struggled to make sense of everything in the book in 2.5 hours and in doing so, makes the characters spit out all deductions in a very unreal way. It might be that what makes acting (even from T Hanks and Sir Ian) look so poor. Good part of the audience had left before halfway down the movie. Its not unwantchable but extremely disappointed, so I guess best thing if you are going to watch its have no big hopes. The adaptation is incredibly mediocre, in my view, and so unbelievable."

","Well, first off....I must admit that I didn't read the book yet. Every time I saw it standing in a book shop I was tempted, but I just didn't have the time to read it yet. So I was glad to see that they finally made a movie...I thought the atmosphere of the movie is captivating, even though I saw the solution at the end coming. The photography of the location was excellent and even though I never was a great fan of Hans Zimmer I must say he did a great job on the soundtrack, which is subtle but yet very emotional at times. Also the main actors (I just adore Ian McKellan) fit and were believable in their roles. All in all I would strongly recommend this movie over to anything that is currently in the movie theaters..."

","I sat through this movie thinking 'wow, I didn't realize it was this poorly written when I read the book' - the acting was decent, but the movie, and I think perhaps the book (though I read it when it initially came out and don't remember it independent from the movie) relies entirely on its provocative claims to support it as a story. if these claims are not new to you, (and they shouldn't be new to anyone who has even a passing familiarity with conspiracy theories, or religious studies), then the movie is mildly entertaining at best. I got in with a readmission ticket from the theatre, (they messed up another movie I saw), so I didn't have to pay. given I had nothing else to do those few hours, I don't' regret it - but I don't think it would've been worth paying to see. on a good note, I was surprised when I got out of the theatre how much time had gone by. while it was a long movie, and I was familiar with the plot line, it didn't bore me too badly. it was alright to kill some time with, but I don't think it should win any awards."

","Like any book turned movie, the book is usually better. In this case the book is drastically better. I wish I did not see the movie, it does not provide justice to an amazing book. The book contained elaborate puzzles, great characters, and easy to follow transitions between scenes.<br/><br/>First the puzzles. The movie ignores one puzzle altogether, SOPHA. It seems the director/producer had a choice to make: either add suspense through action or keep the suspense from the puzzles. Unfortunately, they elected the Hollywood approach by adding extra pointless scenes. After reading the book I was expecting the movie to be constructed similarly to The Usual Suspect, but sadly the movie was more like The Game or even The Borne Identity.<br/><br/>The movie is jumpy at times, they do a poor job of informing the watcher what is happening in the scene. Even when they have added in the appropriate information it was usually after the long after the scene ended. The movie inadequately explained Sophia's history with her grandfather, including the sacred ritual she saw him conduct. If you did not read the book first, the movie watcher had to be scratching their head.<br/><br/>The last major problem I had was with the characters. First Silas and Teabing were amazing, very similar to their characters in the book. The movie did a poor job of explaining Silas's past, but nevertheless both the characters and actors (Bethany and McKellan) were extraordinary. Sophia's character in the book was very intelligent, clever, and useful. The movie did not display any of these features. Instead she is viewed as a tough cop, and defers to Langdon during most of the search. They carefully cutout and edited the scenes that showed her true characteristics (The Grand Gallery and The Bank Vault). It is unfortunate.<br/><br/>Lastly there is Robert Langdon, the movie Langdon is not the real Langdon. Langdon appears ignorant at points in the movie, but others times quick and cunning. He solves the puzzle on the plane in a matter of seconds (but in the book takes much longer and needs the help of both Teabing and Sophia, and actually does not solve the puzzle himself). I won't even begin on the ending scenes with the Star of David, Langdon never solved that puzzle.<br/><br/>The biggest problem was the changed Langdon's view of the Holy Grail. He spent his entire life researching symbols and strongly believed in the story told by Teabing. The movie, maybe to the pressure of the church, decided to make him more a skeptic.<br/><br/>When the movie was complete I thought to myself, wow the movie critics were correct on this one. After I watched the movie I had to go back and reread the book. I suggest everyone do the same."

","Occasionally, there comes along a movie which falls frustratingly short of what it could have been. ""If only"", you think while watching it, ""just a few more ingredients had been right, this could have been a classic"". Such a movie is The Da Vinci Code; a film where all the ingredients are present but frustratingly do not jell enough together to create the necessary chemistry. Had the cast, writer and director gone that extra mile and worked that little bit harder, perhaps the Da Vinci Code would have achieved the goal of being one of the all time classic turkeys; worthy to stand with Can't Stop the Music and Plan 9 From Outer Space.<br/><br/>In fact, while there is a fair proportion of TDVC that is laugh out loud awful; sadly much of it rises to the level of competence which prevents it from being as enjoyably bad as it could have been. Not without trying, it has to be said; certainly Akira Goldsman's script gives good value for money with some excellent lines straight out of Basil Fawlty's suggested specialist subject for Sybil of ""Stating The Bleeding Obvious"" <br/><br/>Such as <br/><br/>Sophie on seeing her Grandfather after 20 years: ""He's older than I remember"" On discovering a clue pointing to the Mona Lisa ""But that's just near here"" (The Mona Lisa? In the Louvre? Whatever next?""). <br/><br/>Goldsman also proves a master of plotting; making sure that such idiocies as every single police car surrounding the Louvre deciding to leave to chase a tracking device in a bar of soap. This, by the way, is Robert Langdon's preferred device for escaping a murder charge rather than relying on the alibi that at the time of the murder he was giving a lecture in front of approximately 500 people before going on to do a book signing. Goldsman also manages to keep most of the lunacies of the original source material intact. (So, the Holy Grail was the body of Mary Magdalene, kept intact by the Priory anticipating the day when DNA testing would be able to suggest a vague kinship between her and Sophie). <br/><br/>Praise to actors Paul Bettany and Ian MacKellan. Paul Bettany manages to portray a psychotic albino assassin with a penchant for self-flagalation with all the subtlety and nuance that that description entails, resulting in one of the most memorable comic villains since Richard Kiel's turn as Jaws in Moonraker. Ian MacKellan, meanwhile, practises for his next performance as Widow Twankey with such a portrayal of pantomime villainy that, as he is carried away in the cart, I expected a cry of ""And I would have got away with it as well if it hadn't been for you pesky symbologists).<br/><br/>Sadly, not deciding to play the game are Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou who, rather than attempting to out-ham everyone else, decide that their job is to turn up, say the lines clearly so that everyone can understand them and go home. It probably didn't help their cause that the script (and original source material) gives absolutely no depth to their relationship other than Sophie asking a lot of questions with Robert replying. A sort of revival of the classic Dr Who and Leggy Assistant role without the entertaining camp factor and haze of nostalgia. <br/><br/>Perhaps one day, a replacement will be found for the definitive Bad Movie. Until then, please try harder next time Ron."

","I hadn't read the book yet, so I could judge it on a movie level, and not on a adaption level. There was all this hype about it and I couldn't find why. The acting was a bit sour. Tom Hanks, an amazing actor who could have done so much better, just merely talked, Ian McKellen was decent, but did not put as much into the character as I think he could have, Paul Bettany, who actually convinced me of his character, was the only person who actually acted. The 'informal' flashbacks where more like promos for educational movies as where the time they were saying them. This one of the first times I, who pretty much enjoys any type of movie, actually had to force myself to stay awake."

","There is a cardinal rule to writing good fiction - SHOW, DON'T TELL. Large parts of this film seemed more like a lecture than a story. If you can imagine having all the right ingredients to a good casserole - and then turning over food preparation duties to a bad cook - you have THE DA VINCI CODE.<br/><br/>This cannot be Ron Howard's finest hour as a director nor Akiva Goldsman's finest hour as a screenplay writer. The writing either had no emotion behind it or Howard's direction was non-existent. Either way, there's only so much a veteran actor like Tom Hanks can do in such a scenario.<br/><br/>P.S. As a non-Christian and a fan of Hanks, I was predisposed to ""like"" the film when I saw it. I didn't. The only good thing to come out of this film is that fundamentalist Christians dislike it just as much as fundamentalist Moslems (Jesus is considered a prophet in Islam) - giving the two religions a common bond that could inspire better understanding between them."

","In November 2004, I attempted to post comments on the book (quoted below) under this movie which was in the ""filming"" status. For obvious reasons, the posting was not accepted. Those comments ended with ""I'm quite curious as to how the movie version will be tackled, as the main attraction of Da Vinci Code is mental rather than visual  quite a challenge to Ron Howard."" Having now watched the movie, I think Howard has sidestep the challenge altogether - he didn't try to bring to the audience the puzzles the readers were treated to in the book. Good move. Dan Brown had made allowance for that and wrote the book as if it were a screen play so that the story would have a different existence as a movie. He was partly successful. The movie ""The Da Vinci Code"", in Howard's competent but uninspired hands, is a decent suspense thriller but not much more.<br/><br/>The cast has helped to make it more enjoyable than otherwise. Not the leads Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou. The former is in a least challenging assignment that he's had in a decade, while the latter is at least adequate, and actually looks better in the ""normal"" role than many of the offbeat characters she has played. It's the foursome of exceptional movie talents that has lifted DVC a notch - Ian McKellen (LOTR, X-Men), Paul Bettany (Master and Commander, A beautiful mind), Alfred Molina (Frida, Spider-man 2) and Jean Reno, probably the best known French actor to the Englsih speaking world.<br/><br/>* * * <br/><br/>Comments on the book I attempted to post a year and a half ago:<br/><br/>quote <br/><br/>This Suspense thriller with Vatican as a backdrop is not such a rarity. One such, the main theme of which is remarkably akin to that of ""Da Vinci Code"", is Canadian writer Charles Templeton's ""Act of God"" (1977). (One of Mr. Templeton's other novels, ""The kidnapping of the president"", was made into a movie in 1980). Rather than divulging the twists in ""Da Vinci Code"", I'll use ""Act of God"" to demonstrate this main theme. With much simplification, let me just say that the main character, a cardinal in New York aspiring to be the next Pope, stumbles across an immense discovery, Christ's remains. This puts him in a diabolical dilemma, of whether to allow this secret to be revealed to the world. The impact on not only the Catholic Church, but on Christianity at large, will be at catastrophic proportions, as this discovery would seem to directly contradict Christ's resurrection. Granted that educated Christians in general have come to accept the symbolic nature of a lot of things written in the Bible, the majority (particularly in less developed countries) would still likely take everything literally. The consequence of the revelation, therefore, is so devastating to contemplate that the cardinal resorts to murder in order to stop it.<br/><br/>While the plot of ""Da Vinci Code"" is very different, this central theme is almost identical  the startling nature of the ""secret"", the immensity of its implications, the potentially devastating impact of its revelation. What is different thought in ""Da Vinci Code"" is that this secret has in fact been revealed to the world at large over the last few of centuries, manifested in various art forms, from Renaissance arts to Disney characters. While I find this theory to be carried just a little too far, I do like the thought of looking at my most favorite opera, The Magic Flute, from yet another mystical angle i.e. one of the vehicles for revealing this monumental ""secret"".<br/><br/>A suspense story succeeds or fails on its ability to provide good ""hooks"" to keep the reader glued to it, and to subsequently provide satisfying explanation in the twists. A great master at this art is the late Isaac Asimov, dean of science fiction, who not only leaves explanation of ""hooks"" right to the end of a novel, but even to the end of the sequel! And the twists will have you marveling at the ingenuity. While not quite reaching this plane of achievement, Da Vinci Code has its interesting aspects. With a simple structure of very short chapters (a little over a 100 in total), it is easy to read through. What makes it stand out is that in the first half of the book, you'll find a hook at the end of just about every chapter! Personally, I find this slightly irritating, but at the same time amusing. Most of these hooks are in the form of puzzles and games, some subtle, some less so, but mostly entertaining. Midway through, there is a lengthy, satisfying explanation of the main mystery. As we move on, more of the earlier questions are answered, while new hooks and twists are thrown in. Towards the end, we encounter the more familiar type of twists, i.e identity puzzles.<br/><br/>With its most unabashed proliferation of hooks that wouldn't miss a single opportunity to present themselves, Da Vinci Code nevertheless hangs together coherently and also provides a well paced, fluid read. I'm quite curious as to how the movie version will be tackled, as the main attraction of Da Vinci Code is mental rather than visual  quite a challenge to Ron Howard.<br/><br/>unquote"

","While it doesn't appear to make sense for somebody who loathed the book to watch the film, I did decide to keep an open mind given the cast. What a mistake! The book's bad enough, not because of its ""controversy""; I'm not religious at all, and I actually find the concept the book goes into quite interesting. However the novel, if you can call it that, is such a poorly-written ham-fisted attempt at a trashy pulp fiction mystery with one of the most obvious ""twists"" in literary history, you'd actually feel sorry for Dan Brown if he wasn't so filthy rich.<br/><br/>The sole reason the book has gained popularity is because it's so easy to read, and the reader can feel intelligent and thus good about themselves because of this. Much like U2 is a band for people who don't really like music, The Da Vinci Code is a book for people who don't really like reading. A bookcase with this novel in is otherwise bare.<br/><br/>So onto the film. I thought maybe they'd be able use one of the book's many weaknesses (its lack of any sort of depth) as a strength if they were adapting it. Not at all, the wooden acting from people who should know better; the style over substance cinematography, the useless flashbacks - it was like an episode of Lost but slightly LESS believable.<br/><br/>No doubt this will sell loads and loads of tickets, because today supposed controversy is much more important than plot, acting and entertainment.

","While Dan Brown's novel is finely written mystery thriller based on the well-known genre formulas, the film version is built up from well-worn clichés and uninspired film-making. It is hardly believable this is one of the the most awaited films of the year. The movie doesn't contain a single really remarkable scene and leave the viewer rather dispassionate. The screenwriter Akiva Goldsman didn't find a code how to translate the strenghts of the book into a movie. In fact, those who haven't read the book must remain quite puzzled by the fast and incoherent torso of the plot. On the other hand the weaknesses of the novel are even more towering, especially the habit of both central protagonists to give a short lecture on semiotics or secret history at the most improbable moments, usually on the run. Talented actor Tom Hanks was not able to cope with the role of professor of symbology Robert Langdon properly. While the novel had been trying to celebrate the feminine part of humanity, Audrey Tautou with her role of chic French cryptologist did not break out of the familiar type of rather passive heroine serving as a disciple to the brighter male character. So the hero of the day is Sir Ian McKellen with his much more complex and fulfilling role of the history expert Teabing. The movie looks more like a sketchy yet boring summary of the book with an attitude You know all this from the novel so let's go on"" And then there are those horrible flashbacks into the past constructed from the ready-made iconography of the Middle ages or granddad's little girls and designed for those lacking imagination or wondering how four people can hide on the floor of a car within a few seconds. And all that pathos, the pathos. OK, the public will always crave for gaining the power over the monolith of the past. There will always be some popular consoler who will give us a hint that everything we know from the school is wrong and that anyone can find his own holy grail because it have been right in front of our eyes all the time. You don't even have to be an academic to find the hidden truth; reading between the lines in the bestselling novels is sufficient. Spoiler warning: Who cares that instead of the true grail - which has to be principally inner, non-material - the goal of this quest is represented by a charming young lady with noble blood?

","In the three years since it's publication, ""The Da Vinci Code"" has of course gained a cult following and has finally arrived on the silver screen. I will admit that there are some scenes from the book that the movie omitted due to time constraints, but the movie overall does a very good job. We might expect a Ron Howard movie to tug at our emotions, but this one does no such thing. It blows your mind as much as the novel does.<br/><br/>And then there's the characters. As Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, trying to expose a 2,000-year-old religious cover-up, Tom Hanks makes the most of his role, even with that weird hairdo. As Det. Sophie Neveu, trying to find out what was behind a certain murder, Audrey Tautou plays with the audience: she looks sweet, but this woman can gravitate between nice and acerbic. As Sir Leigh Teabing, Ian McKellen does as great a job as we can anticipate from a famous British actor. As Capt. Bezu Fache, Jean Reno is as good as always. Also starring are Alfred Molina as Cardinal Aringarosa, Paul Bettany as Silas, and Jurgen Prochnow as Andre Vernet, all doing a very good job.<br/><br/>Does the movie have any problems? Well, there seems to be a lot of running around, so you wonder how much that adds to the story. Also, I don't know whether or not this counts, but there's the possibility that the presence of someone like Tom Hanks distracts from the plot. And one has to wonder whether Audrey Tautou is there mostly for looks. What about the probability that this story is pretty unlikely? Maybe, But overall, I don't think that these factors subtract from the movie's quality. I really liked ""TDVC"", and I'm sure that you will.

"ocdetails","7","7","14","20 May 2006"," Say what you will about the context, but this movie did well in following the novel
","This type of story has always appealed to me. I honestly don't know why it caused so much controversy. So what if Jesus had a child? God is devine too and he had a son, didn't he? The thing that people need to understand is that Jesus wasn't a Christian. He was Jewish and followed Jewish laws. One of those laws was that they had to have children to obey God's first commandment to 'multiply and replenish the earth.' There is likely no way to prove a bloodline for Christ at this point, but the plot of The DaVinci Code provides an excellent theory of how such a bloodline might be documented. The one thing the movie could have done better in would be in the background of all the hidden clues in famous works of art. It did show the Last Supper and explained that one, but there were many other pieces of art explained in the book that helped the reader see why this theory is so easy to believe. It is the omission of those explanations in the movie that cause me to rate it 7 out of 10. I am hoping there will be an extended version available when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>Look at this movie as fiction. It is exploring a theory as provable as the thousands of JFK assassination theories. Regardless of what your faith causes you to believe, you can't deny that the points Dan Brown makes in his book are very intriguing and worth thinking about. Believing that Christ had a child and was married doesn't make you any less Christian. Just remember that Christ was a Jew and followed different laws than you do. You also have to remember that the Bible was voted on by men and not assembled by a devine being. You can't discount the fact that more clarification about Jesus and his life could exist and weren't included in the Bible.<br/><br/>If you liked the book then you won't be disappointed in the movie. It leaves some things out and it tweaks the end a bit, but there isn't anything missing that would lose someone who doesn't have the background of the novel. It was an enjoyable movie that I look forward to adding to my collection."

Then let's say that rather than the author intending that book to be a total, complete fabrication, he insisted repeatedly (including in the preface) that while the story is fiction, the historical events in it are based on fact. People would be understandably upset. So Christians, while they may enjoy the story, are understandably bothered when they read an author with a lousy track record on history (some of the most basic facts about Leonardo da Vinci are completely false; similarly most of the so-called ""evidence"" of conspiracy) claim that ""almost everything our fathers taught us about Christ is false.""

Its rapid pace, intriguing and colorful characters, and controversial subject matter made it one of the best novels I had read in a long time. Naturally, as the book made heaps of money and garnered a massive fan base (as well as many, many enemies), a movie was announced. What could possibly go wrong? The novel, itself, played out like a movie. Surely, any writer and director could put it on the big screen successfully. When Ron Howard was announced as the director, I was even more optimistic. Again, what could possibly go wrong? The casting seemed rightexcept for Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, but this argument has been made countless times before so I will merely ignore itand Akiva Goldsman, the screenwriter, had written some very powerful stuff in his lifetime (a side note: ""Batman & Robin"" was not one of them). So, I say again: what could go wrong? This movie seemed like a sure success--one of the year's best movies. But, suddenly, critics walked away from the movie, shrugging their shoulders and exclaiming, ""So what?"" Most critics panned it completely, wasting very little time when it came to trashing it in newspapers and internet. The word ""boring"" was uttered in nearly every review. ""Dull"" often followed it. But, were critics correct? <br/><br/>You probably know this plot right now. In fact, you have probably already read the book or watched the movieor, at least, heard the plot outline on the evening news. There is hardly a person in this modern world that hasn't heard about ""The Da Vinci Code"". But, for you people who have been living under a rock or off in a cave somewhere, I'll go over the plot. Museum curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), is killed and Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon (Hanks), is summoned to the scene. Sauniere, after being shot in the chest, decorated himself with numerous symbols with his own blood and the police need Langdon to interpret them. On top of that, Langdon was supposed to be having dinner with Sauniere the night he was killed and Sauniere left a cryptic message on the floor beside his body referring to Langdon. And what would a dying man do before he finally is killed, Captain Bezu Fache (Reno) asks. Obviously, he would want to identify his own killer. Langdon knows this and knows that something just isn't right about the entire scene. Alas, cryptologist, Sophie Neveu (Tautou), comes to his rescue and the two uncover some very strange coincidences about the markings on Sauniere's body--coincidences that were not merely slapped together by a dying old man. Soon, the two realize that they are on the edge of a religious mystery that could shake the very foundations of Christianity.<br/><br/>While many people used the line, ""So dark the con of man"" to begin their review, I decided against it. I chose the quote I did because it sums up how I feel about the views expressed in ""The Da Vinci Code"". Do I believe that Jesus Christ was really married to Mary Magdalene and that the Church has been covering it for thousands of years? Um, nonot that I really think it would matter. Who says that a married man couldn't be divine simply because he took a wife? I don't believe anything that is proposed in ""The Da Vinci Code"" and you shouldn't either. This movie is a ""What if?"" kind of film. What if this happened? You know the drill. Chances are, if you are a normal person, the first time you heard about ""The Da Vinci Code"" was when there was some riot or petition occurring to ban it. Yes, the Christians who worked so diligently to boycott this movie actually only made more people see it. How is that for irony? Now, I am a Christian and have been for my entire life, but I must admit that many of these ultra-conservative Christian groups freak me out a little. So, like I said, don't listen to them. See the movie and judge it for yourself. I did that with the book and enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>So, back to my original question, were critics right when they slammed ""The Da Vinci Code""? Well, yes and no. On one hand, this movie ruined the pace of the novel, slowing everything down and cutting out some of the more intriguing parts in favor of scenes of slow, piddling dialog. Gone is the novel's brisk, pulse-pounding pacing and lightening-quick action. The film is also far too long for its own good, making it seem more pretentious and self-loving than the book did. The novel was a fun readintelligent and complex, but fun. The movie is far more about telling a complicated story without much of an entertainment factor. On the other hand, Ron Howard's direction is amazing and the movie manages to retain just enough of the book's entertainment factor to keep the audience entertained. On top of that, the performances, for the most part, are nicely-done with the highlights being Ian McKellan as Sir Leigh Teabing and Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu. Overall, ""The Da Vinci Code"" falls victim to the age-old ""The Movie Is Never As Good As The Book"" formula, but critics greeted it with a much colder reception than they should have.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Though probably disappointing to fans of the novel, ""The Da Vinci Code"" retains just enough of its spirit and intrigue.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)"
"Turriff","6","5","9","10 December 2006"," If you've read the book...
","I finally got around to watching it! <br/><br/>The Holy Grail of Religion Studies movies!<br/><br/>Thats right...<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>Let me preface this review by saying that in general, those who approach religion in an academic setting (like myself and my colleagues) generally don't have much time for stuff like The Da Vinci Code, where completely false theories are given credit they don't deserve, and millions are convinced of something absurd.<br/><br/>I don't feel that way. I liked the book. It was fun. It was not an insult, because reading a page-turner with cliff-hanger chapters and a ridiculous plot is a good way to waste a day. So intellectual elitism aside, I think the book is worth the few hours it takes to read. And I think Angels and Demons is even better...<br/><br/>But I need to suggest that if you read the book, you can probably skip the movie. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table. A lot of time passed between my reading the book and seeing the movie, so maybe I slipped out of the groove, but the adaptation seemed dogmatic, and lacking in any real creativity.<br/><br/>The historical flashbacks were a good idea, I think, and and interesting mechanism to get around the storytelling that takes place in the novel, as were some of the visual effects used to demonstrate Prof. Langdon's thought process. There are hardly reasons to rush out and buy/rent this movie, however. <br/><br/>Some of the performances were pretty good, all in all. Its always a treat to see Ian McKellan, and I liked Hanks, even though I remember there being a general outcry around the time of the release. It's true that I didn't feel the chemistry between him and Audrey Tautou, which may have improved issues, but French/American relations have been strained, so I don't blame them.<br/><br/>One of the best parts was watching the City of Paris, where I spent a month this summer. Nice place, that Paris...<br/><br/>So, overall, I give the movie a ""Only if there is nothing else on TV"". My Girlfriend didn't watch it, so no vote there...<br/><br/>The book is worth a read over the holidays if you have nothing to do, as well...<br/><br/>Just don't believe everything you read..."
"judywalker2","5","5","9","22 November 2006"," Not interesting enough for me to read the book
","I have to confess right up front I didn't read the best selling book and this movie is not interesting enough to make me go out and buy it. I could never understand how this news concerning Jesus would 'shake the world'. Once again it seemed to me the same old thing, man's desire to bring everything down to his level. The characters, with the exception of the ""Teacher"" are not very well hashed out in the movie. Ron Howard, who usually does a good job< really doesn't let the characters grow on you before they are running for their lives. Doesn't really set up much of a connection. I agree with everyone who said that Tom Hanks was really, really, really wrong for the part of Langdon. He has no, I repeat no charisma at all in this movie. He's really out of place. All in all it was boring."
"FilmFanAndReviewer003","8","5","9","14 June 2006"," A Superb Adaptation Of Dan Brown's Controversial Bestseller
","Because I love the book so much (and because I had heard from a lot of people that the film really was not that good), I went into ""The Da Vinci Code"" a couple of weeks after its release with mild/low expectations. I honestly never thought that the film could retain the fast-paced and energetic feel of the book, I didn't think that Tom Hanks could portray Harvard professor Robert Langdon very effectively (haircut or not), and I didn't see how a book that goes by so quickly could take up 2 1/2 hours of screen time.<br/><br/>I was proved very wrong.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" is a superb adaptation of Dan Brown's controversial bestseller. It manages to keep the feel of the book present throughout, it meshes fact, fiction and history together seamlessly, the flashbacks were not irritating or unwelcome at all, and the casting is top-notch.<br/><br/>For those who have been living in the middle of nowhere for the past three years or so, ""Code"" tells the story of the murder of the curator of the Louvre, Jaques Sauniere, which leads Harvard professor Robert Langdon and French cryptologist Sophie Neveau on a scavenger hunt to unlock the secrets of the clues Sauniere left behind for them, leading them to a startling revelation about Jesus Christ , the Church, and the Holy Grail.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the casting is top-notch. Tom Hanks effectively portrays the intelligent Langdon, Audrey Tautou fairs well as Sophie, Alfred Molina is fairly good in whatever little screen time he has, and Jean Reno is stellar as usual. Two actors that really stood out were Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany. McKellen has always been a favorite of mine, but his portrayal of Sir Leigh Teabing is unforgettable, providing the perfect blend of intelligence, wit, and comedy. Paul Bettany is chillingly cold as Silas, the albino assassin. His scene of self-mutilation is arguably the film's most disturbing sequence.<br/><br/>However, ""Code"" is not perfect. I still did feel that the film was rather long. Cutting about ten to fifteen minutes at the end wouldn't have hurt. Also, the whole subplot of Sophie meeting her relatives from the book is, although shown differently, still there, which bothered me because I never liked that point in the book and I was hoping that they would discard it in the film (this could have helped with the aforementioned length issue).<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is another example of how to effectively translate a beloved novel to the big screen. It's not perfect, but its very close (one particular scene near the end that I was not too fond of in the book was done much better in the film). The cast is top notch, the directing is fine, and the film makes for a thrilling and entertaining 2 1/2 hours.<br/><br/>My suggestion, however: Read the novel first.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2"
"shamsee","9","5","9","13 June 2006"," Near Flawless transformation from Novel to the Big Screen (However, nothing else can better illustrate the loss of 'Sacred Feminine')
","One thing that 'Priory of Sion' value and the whole novel is all about is the 'Balance' between Man and Woman. <br/><br/>From ""Mona Lisa"" (the reason she is supposed to have the 'all knowing' smile) to Da Vinci's ""Last Supper"" (the true Chalice that holds the blood of Christ), the concept of 'Balance' (Equality) between Man and Woman is re-enforced. <br/><br/>However, that point either completely missed the creators of this movie or they didn't care. Eitherway, nothing highlights the 'Im-Balance' between Man and Woman today than this movie. <br/><br/>In the Novel, the character of Sophie played by Audrey Tatou is not supposed to be completely helpless and clueless. In fact her character contributes equally to the effort of solving the mystery, just as much as the character of Robert Langdon played by Tom Hanks. They BOTH take turns in finding the answers to different puzzles.<br/><br/>It is Sophie who translates the Annagram ""So Dark the Con of Man"" and not Robert Langdon. It is Sophie, who rescues Robert Langdon, by first sending the cops on wild goose chase, by removing the 'bug' from Robert Langdon and planting it on a dump truck. It is Sophie, who takes the valuable painting hostage, and threatens to tear it apart, unless the guard trying to arrest them disarms. It is her training by her Grand-father all her childhood, that makes her the best person to understand the clues left by him. In the novel, just when they are about to open the Vault, they get one and only chance to enter the correct account number, which they don't have. If they enter it in-correctly, then the contents of the the vault will be forever lost to them. While Robert Langdon is about the enter the scrambled Fibonacci sequence, left by Jacque Suniere written in invisible ink next to his body before his death, it is Sophie who figures that the sequence is way too random to be a password and would be too difficult for her Grand-father to remember. An unscrambled sequence would be a better password to remember as it can always be figured out. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, in the movie, the credit for all those efforts is entirely given to Robert Langdon's character. This pattern continues throughout the movie. This is truly tragic! After coming so far, even today, its impossible for this world to accept that a woman can make a meaningful contribution, aside than being eye-candy. No, the only appropriate role for her is to be a damsel in distress who has to be rescued by her knight in shining armor.<br/><br/>Even bigger sin is to portray Sophie's character as one who truly doesn't care about solving the mystery. She seems to be upset at being thrown into this mess, and it seems that she doesn't really care about something so important that it could shake the foundation of Church and change mankind forever. Anyone dealing with that prospect would find themselves enthused about the resolution of the facts. However, in the movie, Sophie's character is 'apathetic'. That is exactly opposite of how she is portrayed in the Novel. In fact, she truly wants to find out what her Grand-father wanted her to inherit. She does not want to be left behind by Robert-Leah team.<br/><br/>Apathy is one of the reasons behind woman being treated as inferior over the ages. A man is the one who ask 'Whys' and would go to any length to get them answered. Woman supposedly only care about surviving, pleasure and material things. All things that are unworthy of being the main purpose of life. <br/><br/>By portraying Sophie's character as 'Apathetic', the same libel has been thrown upon her as on every woman since dawn of mankind. She doesn't care about 'IMPORTANT' things, so it is natural to keep her out of matters of 'IMPORTANCE'. <br/><br/>Aside from messing up the underlying main theme of the Novel, the main focus of 'Kninghts Templars' and 'Priory-of-Sion', this is a nearly flaw-less movie! Usually one finds that novel was way better than the movie, but here the difference is minimal. You could for all practical purposes either watch this movie or read the Novel and you won't miss much, aside from what is pointed out above. <br/><br/>Some of the facts are unnecessarily distorted like Jacque Suniere was not really Sophie's Grand-father, but in fact he is shown to be her real Grand-father in the novel. She even has a brother that she is re-united with in the end. Most importantly, the reason, a man would entrust the most powerful secret in history of mankind to a man he has never met before is once again given a sexist explanation in the movie. Sophie is too clueless and too helpless to resolve the mystery on her own so the wise Grandfather tells her to find her Knight in shining armor, Robert Langdon. To an extent that maybe the case, however, even more important reason is that Robert Langdon had written a manuscript that his publisher had sent to Jacque Suniere to get his praise for the book and in that he unknowingly spells out the location of the Grail itself.<br/><br/>That was the main motivation for the old man in contacting Robert Langdon. Once he knew his life was coming to end and he could not reach the one person he could trust his secret with, who he knew was not compromised, but who he has failed to fully prepare. His last thought was to team up his Grand daughter with one person beside him who knows the location of the Grail but doesn't know that he does - Robert Langdon.<br/><br/>I recommend every man and woman to watch this movie!"
"BookWrm89","4","5","9","5 June 2006"," The film disappointed me...it could've been so much better!
","I loved the book and was hoping the movie would be just as entertaining, but it wasn't. As has been stated before, the movie dragged in several spots. It could've been edited much tighter than it was. My main issue with the movie came because of the filmmaker's decision to change two major plot points from the book for no apparent reason. (Caution, spoilers ahead...)<br/><br/>First, making Sauniere not be Sophie's grandfather. That was just arbitrary and really didn't need to be changed. Second, changing the reason why Aringarosa and Silas were after the Priory and the ""Grail"". In the book, they were like rogue agents working for their own specific purposes, but the movie had them as part of this secret organization within the Catholic church that was (and always had been) trying to kill off the family and the Priory. In my opinion, this change gives the Catholic Church every reason to be upset about the movie (theological implications aside).<br/><br/>The only bright spot in the whole movie was the decision to cast Sir Ian McKellen as Teabing. He brings a sense mischievous humor to every role he plays that makes you want to root for his character whether he's playing a villain or not.<br/><br/>My recommendation...if you haven't read the book, you'll probably enjoy the movie."
"ReismanM","8","5","9","29 May 2006"," Controversial? Yes. Bad? Absolutely Not.
","There has been quite a bit of controversy over this movie since its release, as one can clearly tell by looking at its rating on this very website. Nobody would have probably expected the rating to be this low if asked to predict how good of a movie it will be 3 weeks ago. It is obviously opinionated, as it is one man's, Howard's, fictional theory on some of the backgrounds and origins of Christianity.<br/><br/>Coming from somebody who has NOT read the book, I thought it was a great movie. Great acting, great directing, great story; didn't seem to be lacking anything in any category. But then again, I did not go in to seeing this movie with all that high of expectations, having not read the book and having read others opinions on it. The person I saw it with has read the book, and they said it was not bad by any means, just slightly disappointing.<br/><br/>Did people question JFK, and all the opinions thrown out by Oliver Stone? Of course they did. Did that change it from being a good movie? No it didn't. This movie seems to be almost in the exact same situation, but there are so many more people that believe very strongly in their opinions on the subject. For someone who is for the most part indifferent about religion, such as myself, this movie is highly recommended."
"Torchwoods","10","5","9","28 May 2006"," Fun movie
","A fictional movie about a fictional subject, Religion. A fun watch though. I love mythology. Jewish myths, Christian myths, Greek myths. All of them are fun ways people explain their world in their own mind. This movie takes a fictional look at a fictional religion. I can't believe people get so upset over this stuff. A lot of the detail from the book is left out, I assume for time. The people in the movie come out a bit lifeless but otherwise a fun movie.<br/><br/>Those that believe in these myths might take it a bit poorly. Just keep in mind its just a movie. If you view it as an attack on your religion, your just wrong. religious beliefs attack nonbelievers all the time. Fair is fair after all."
"ginahardin","9","5","9","23 May 2006"," I read the book and loved the movie
","Critics be damned but I loved the movie. When I read the book, I found some of the explanations long and drawn out. (I actually listened to it on audio book to and from work for a couple of weeks) Having said that, I was actually looking forward to the movie so that some of it would just unfold instead of a living text book, if you will. There were a few parts that hearkened a bit to Dan Brown's heavy and professorial prose but then I decided to give them a break. When I was in college and grad school I was sort of the weirdo. I am smart, sort of, I guess! but also blonde and originally from Miami. Not exactly what you would picture as the studious intellectual. But I am smart and had many clever friends who sometimes liked to speak in lofty terms and argue arcane points and flex their mental muscles. I felt the same way when Langdon and Tibbing discussed the Priory and the Grail. It was a bit annoying but then again, sometimes smarty pants scholars are annoying. That is part of their ""charm"" So, bottom line... If you have read the book then you should know what to expect in the movie. 30M people can not be wrong. Maybe I am too simple? Yet again, I have had it with the critics telling what is smart and engaging. You watch movies for a living! You don't create them. Talk to me then when you have put yourself out there. Until then, I will stick to making my own decisions. I was never bored, never looked at my watch and will buy this movie when it comes out on DVD."
"perkeo","8","5","9","22 May 2006"," A worthy adaptation of the book
","In spite of its detractors I feel this movie is a worthy adaptation of the book. Oddly enough the books feels faster paced than the movie at times and of course the fans of the book will miss several details, but here are two reasons I would still recommend this movie: The acting of Ian McKellen is extraordinary, specially how he projects the excitement of the grail quest. But for me, the Finale alone is worth the price of admission; Tom Hank walks towards the Louvre pyramid following the Rose Line to a crescendo of stirring music by Hans Zimmer until he reaches his goal, kneels down, and strikes a Grail Knight pose. The hair in your back will stand up. It just amazing how good music can make a scene unforgettable."
"imdbfilmcricket","9","5","9","22 May 2006"," This is a very good film. Why all the fuss?
","Ron Howard did a very good job. Seems it would have been hard not to, given the source material. Since it wasn't that long since I read the book, there really wasn't much in the way of suspense for me, but I did appreciate the way the film was put together, particularly the method Howard used for illustrating scenes of the past. The actors all do well. It was interesting to see Jean Reno's statement that the author had him in mind for the role of the French policeman, because when I was reading the book, Reno seemed the obvious choice. Now to the religious nonsense. The book is a work of fiction, the film is a work of fiction. If the idea that Jesus had a family bothers you -- try not to think about it. Don't read the book. Don't see the film. If you still feel bad, lie down quietly with a cool cloth over your eyes. For people free of that hang-up, though, I recommend The DaVinci Code as a good film well worth watching."
"rjaugust1","9","5","9","22 May 2006"," Well done, enjoyable, and worth seeing.
","Well done production and effects. Follows the book as to all the details. I enjoyed it and so did the group I was with. Recommended for the open minded who wish to be entertained. I don't see what the critics were complaining about. The relationship between Hanks and Tautou is perfect, given that they just met and are in the midst of an exciting, incredibly complex mystery. McKellen adds another layer of fun and excitement as they unravel the code. All the supporting cast performs quite well. The ""factual"" basis of much of the story, with kernels of truth (Council of Nicea, Constantine, etc.) as well as pure speculation (divinity or not, marriage or not, etc.), requires your further investigation. There's enough in the Holy Grail story to want more intellectually, but DaVinci Code is a masterpiece of a book and movie."
"zephyr24-1","7","5","9","22 May 2006"," Anagrams and Symbols
","Da Vinci Code when viewed strictly on its own merit worked flawlessly as a well-executed mystery thriller. There's mind-boggling suspense, unexplained theories and unresolved mysteries within the span of the film's 150 minutes.<br/><br/>However, when it comes to the subject material, staunch Christians were riled no end by Dan Brown's fiction, calling them blasphemous lies. The published book certainly didn't quite create a stir back in 2003. Yes, the thing is, in a bid to confine the movie to a reasonable 150 minutes on screen, part of the intriguing plot in print was left out, making viewers who haven't read the book beforehand guess more than they should.<br/><br/>Dan Brown's postulations were taken too seriously by some quarters. He never really claimed that they were true but merely conjectures based on his research or understanding of the faith.<br/><br/>Now, the acting. I am generally pleased with the performances by the cast despite criticisms that Tom Hanks didn't look the part of the character David Langdon in the book. Well, I thought he did well. After all, Hanks gives the character of the symbologist his own flavor, his facial expressions conveyed a sense of urgency in solving the mystery and clearing his name.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou who plays professional cryptographer Sophie Neuve is perhaps the only likable character throughout the show. The role might not demand much of her as the sidekick of Hanks' Langdon but Tautou gives an adequate performance coming to terms with her grandfather's death and discovering her true identity.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen's over-zealous Sir Leigh Teabing adds to the mystery when Langdon and Neuve turns up at his door seeking for help to unravel the hidden truth. McKellen's acting prowess is undoubtedly splendid.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany's in his role as the obsessed and self-mutilating-in-the-name-of-god Silas was scene-stealing (he was almost unrecognizable). The conviction in his eyes and behaviour would be one of the highs of the movie as he seeks to further the cause of the religion.<br/><br/>My only disappointment was with Jean Reno. But again, his role was severely limited so we could only see his Opus Dei character Captain Fache pull a long face and all the stops at trying to foil Langdon's and Neuve's plans at every juncture.<br/><br/>No one should really complain at the adequacy of The Da Vinci Code as a functioning thriller despite some of Dan Brown's more ludicrous assertions. After all, we must remember this is fiction not theology. The way to enjoy the Da Vinci Code on screen is to watch it with a free and unprejudiced mind. (B+)"
"AdamDHarris","8","5","9","20 May 2006"," Praise Sir Ian McKellen in this fine adaptation!
","The DaVinci code, i had read in reviews was a complete mess. Therefore, wary of a complete bomb, i wasn't expecting the greatest film of all time, and it wasn't the greatest film of all time. But, it sure as hell wasn't bad. <br/><br/>The start began OK, but until the arrival of Ian McKellen about 45 minutes in, i was beginning to fear that it was about to head severely downhill. Hanks looked one dimensional, Tautou looked like the 'fill in the gaps' support. Thank goodness for Ian McKellen. He really got Hanks going, the middle scene at Teabings château, one of the least interesting in the novel, became the best scene of the film. Suddenly, Hanks had some live, some buzz, and from this point on, its as good a film as it could have been, by no means the greatness Dan Brown wrote, but as good as i had hoped. <br/><br/>The final 10 minutes after McKellen & Bettany (Superb) had no more part to play, left you feeling that once again the two leads weren't quite reaching top form, but, the final ten seconds, closed what was a excellent, but not superb, piece of fiction.<br/><br/>Overall, a fair 8 out of ten!"

","I'll be short; The Da Vinci Code is grim and boring. A couple of shots are out of focus, the dialogue is god-awful and the plot is muddy and malformed. Audrey Tatou is wasted in the role of the asinine Sophie, and there is a reason why everyone is talking about Tom Hanks' mullet rather than his performance. The hammy dialogue that works in the book does not translate well to screen, and actors who are unconvincing in their performances fumble through the originally interesting and controversial content of the story, rendering it incomprehensible. The one shining light is Paul Bettany, who gifts us with a genuinely compelling performance, even though he is a self-mutilating, nun-murdering albino monk who wears sandals.

Anyway, I felt that although the storyline was interesting and almost gave you a crash course in religion and theology, the characters lacked personality. Now I know it wasn't the actors because I've seen these people play some very challenging parts and always pull it off but the fact that Dan Brown's characters were so empty and badly created meant that this film didn't have that special factor to it. In my opinion the film was good - it had many great settings, brilliant acting and interesting story lines but in the end I think Dan Brown is a mediocre writer at best. I Just finished Angels and Demons (this being after I read the Da Vinci Code) and I that has confirmed my suspicions about his 2D characters. WEll thats what I thought..."

","I was a bit concerned I would be lost seeing the movie because I seem to be one of the minority who has not read the book. It was definitely not a problem. Of course, I had heard about the basic premise of the book but knew none of the characters or the plot line of the story. It may have actually been an advantage. I have heard reviews discussing how there was too much dialogue in the movie. My thoughts are that the movie was made with the assumption that the viewer had not read the book. The dialogue spent a reasonable amount of time explaining what was happening. I found it to be extremely helpful. <br/><br/>There was plenty of action and surprises and I did not have one minute where I was bored. The acting was good and the characters well cast. I think Robert Langdon could have been played by quite a few actors out there today but I was happy with the choice of Tom Hanks. Audrey Tautou did a decent job with her portrayal of Sophie and changed appropriately as she discovered her role and background. Paul Bettany was terrific and the rest of the cast worked very well to tell the story. <br/><br/>The locations were great, the special effects were well done and I particularly liked the scenes done of past times. All in all, an entertaining movie, good directing and a well told story."
"alvintiamy","6","9","20","19 May 2006"," Disappointing! Where's the thrill in this thriller?
","I have to admit that I am very disappointed. This film is supposed to be a thriller, right? But where's the thrill? I was expecting to be entertained and to be in the situation of the characters themselves. The critics are right. The movie is boring. Of course, the first viewing will be fine. But if viewed multiple times, this film is likely to bore anyone to death.<br/><br/>I've read the novel from which it was based and I can say that if this film was viewed by a non-reader, they will be lost and confused. I have a feeling that most of the people (apparently non-readers) in the theater I was in didn't understand the movie well. They just come in to check out about the film and satisfy their curiosity.<br/><br/>There are several reasons why I really want to see this. 1) To see how they present the key scenes 2) To see the locations! 3) To compare my own vision of the film vs the director's vision (just like any other movie adaptations) 4) To see Ian McKellen on the big screen for the first time since The Return of the King... 5) To see how they handle the mystery of the Holy Grail or whether they will stick to Dan Brown's theories or not.<br/><br/>As you may notice, I'm not after the film's faithfulness to the source. I actually didn't mind it now after I got used on LOTR and Harry Potter were adapted. HP2 is very faithful to the book that it takes away the excitement from the viewers. They never let the viewers engage in breaking the codes. Many fans hate HP4 because it deviates from the book but I say, it is the best movie in the Harry Potter franchise (as well as HP3). In DVC, it's like I'm watching just to see how things will go, there's a little element of surprise. I want to see more. The movie is too long. It would be better if they removed the ""Robert the claustrophobic"" subplot in the movie.<br/><br/>This film is TOO faithful to the book. Even the lines are lifted from the book word per word and it's a good thing. They edited the film in such a way that it follows every chapter breaks in the book. Unfortunately, it doesn't translate well onto the screen. I wish the screenwriters add something more to make this movie more exciting. At one point, they even showed a flashback on how the Langdon and Neveu escaped from the plane (just like in the book). But in the film, the scene is out of place. I have to say that being too faithful to the source material is not always a good thing. If I am to blame someone, that would be the author Dan Brown. Yes, his book made many non book-readers to pick up a novel and read (including me). But when I re-read the novel, the flaws are evident. It becomes too shallow. And because of that, the movie suffers.<br/><br/>One of the key elements in this movie focuses on a ""secret that if revealed, would devastate the very foundations of Christianity"" Given the prerelease controversy surrounding the novel and the book, the secret the movie is talking about is already revealed to everyone that it isn't a spoiler anymore. For non-readers, the only thing that they have to figure out is the identity of the Teacher and a thing about Sophie.<br/><br/>As for the actors, Tom Hanks is obviously miscast. BTW, I liked the way how Langdon think visually. The planets, anagrams etc. Langdon here is not the same as on the book because the Langdon here is doubtful. He even engage in a debate with Teabing. Audrey Tatou (Sophie) is very pretty. I've seen her in Amelie and she was amazing. Jean Reno (Fache) is the kind of actor who's always in a Hollywood movie in need of a French actor. I think he is the most sought-after French actors today. Paul Bettany is very creepy as Silas. Too bad he wasn't given enough screen time. I was surprised to see Silas naked because he was wearing something in the trailer. In the movie, he's totally nude and I pity him for his ""corporal mortification"" thing. Ian McKellen (Teabing) delivers a great performance once again. It's in the way he speaks, wit, humor and eyes that make him a lovable character whatever role he is playing. He gives credibility on even the most crappiest line. Many people are surprised to know that Ian McKellen is gay. Someone in an internet forum said that he is the most straight-looking gay actor.<br/><br/>There are several scenes that I don't like very much. There are few action sequences in the film but many of them were poorly done. One of them is the SmartCar scene. It's not handled well. The camera is shaky that you can't understand what's happening. Most of the movie is talking scenes (just like the book). The theories are presented in a nice way through flashbacks. These flashbacks are nice. They could create a separate movie through them.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone will have their faith shattered just by viewing this...especially Filipinos. And I don't think that the movie is blasphemous. Maybe I got used to it. That was my first reaction before reading the book. But once I read the prologue, I never stopped reading.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is not actually an excellent book but it is good page-turner. The movie adapts the book too faithfully that the real essence of adventure and thrill is lost. If you want to be entertained, go and watch National Treasure. It's a better movie. Dan Brown's novel succeeds because of its controversial premise. But I have to say National Treasure is a better thriller."

People leaving looked underwhelmed and confused. One guy yelled out to his mate on the other side of the hall, ""It ain't good, eh mate?"". He agreed. It doesn't take Robert Langdon to figure out that it's not a good sign when audience members complain audibly about the film the moment it ends.<br/><br/>Cast wise, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou make a great team but the absurd plot obviously kept them from reaching their full potential. It didn't help that they were being dictated by a wooden script that didn't even know what to do with itself. As being the blast of fresh air that he always is, Ian McKellen saves the film. His soothing deep voice was definitely comforting and helped to reassure me that the creators of this film wern't completely brain dead.

The almost countless conspiracy theories of Opus Dei got so numerous I practically gave up 3/4 into the film. In the end, I gave up on trying to make sense of it and accepted it for being what it is: fiction. <br/><br/>Overall, to put it in short terms, The Da Vinci Code is way too outrageous to be taken seriously.

","I must confess that I actually paid full price to see this movie upon its release early June - this pains me tremendously since in spite of my best intentions and the constant nudging of my friends to get some value on my ticket purchase, I could not stay awake. I must've fallen asleep a dozen times during the course of the film! As I can't remember the last movie I snored through, I chalked up this snooze fest to being too tired to sit through the film, lack of decent dialogue, no screen chemistry between any of the actors, preposterous plot zig zags, one too many sloppy action sequences, and zero comic relief. I appreciate absurd fantasy as much as anybody, but there wasn't anything remotely funny or intriguing that I could ream out of this dud. True, I was asleep for almost 2 hours, so could it be that this film was more than a succession of busy nothings? Well, I had my second chance to view the Codeand this time I didn't have to pay extra! It was the featured movie on my flight today and I was somewhat gladdened that I'd be able to make a final judgment on whether this film had any merit whatsoever. Good news is that I managed to stay awake this time. Could this be attributed to the fact that the ride was very bumpy and without a real meal, I was suffering the pangs of hunger? Sad to say, this overwrought tale was not the meal ticket it could have been. It certainly provided no brain nourishment at all. Upon second inspection, my initial assessment was validated. This movie is devoid of basic ingredients required of any passable movie: intelligent plot, credible characters, comedy, a slice of life What were Hanks and Tautou - two of my favorite actors – thinking when they signed up as automatons for this feeble, fetid potboiler? Truly, the best things about this film were the villains. Each of them - especially Silas and Sir Teabing – was a zillion times more fascinating than either Sophie or Robert ..unless of course you have a curious empathy for one-dimensional, muppet-haired, sanctimonious numb-skulls.<br/><br/>So I've completed my penance for falling asleep the first time and I've also reconciled myself for giving this film one star things are indeed looking up this year!"

This probably tops both of those for sheer ""Turkyness"".<br/><br/>It's sad, because a lot of talented people were involved with this, as well as a great deal of money, yet it was all wasted on this idiotic script.<br/><br/>Seriously, I can't believe this screenwriter is taken seriously by anybody. I think my 11 year old stepdaughter could write a better screenplay than this -- especially since there was a book to base it on! And the ""Big Revelation"" at the end?

","Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE was long and complicated, so I didn't expect the film to cover it exactly. I don't expect any movie to mimic any book word for word. Only Kenneth Branaugh's HAMLET did that.<br/><br/>The movie adaptation turned out better than I could have expected. Sure they changed some parts. Some parts, of courses, were left out. Overall, they compacted the story. It, however, still worked well. Ron Howard kept the Plot tight, and not one piece of dialogue was wasted.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks played an excellent, realistic college professor. No slickness and No glossy Oscar-worthy clichéd nuances. He played the role straight like it needed. All of the other actors did equally well, but I hold special recognition for Jean Reno and Paul Bettany. Reno WAS Fache and Bettany did his best to balance eerieness and sad piety in Silas.<br/><br/>One warning: YOU MUST PAY ATTENTIION. Like A BEAUTIFUL MIND, 12 ANGRY MEN, and the best episodes of LAW & ORDER, you can't wallow in the clouds while sleepwalking through this film. The best plotted movies waste nothing. Each shot, nuance, word, transition, and musical note forwards the plot or adds to the characterizations.<br/><br/>Again, I don't think the production could have turned out better.

The day that I was due to see the film I had already heard on the radio negative comments from critics so when I walked into the cinema I had doubts in my mind as to whether I would like it. Bottom line - fantastic film. I have only two negative points, the flagellation scenes were quite disturbing for me to watch and I felt that because of this the film should have been made at least a 15 rather than a 12A.

The acting was mediocre at best (with the exception of Paul Bettany), and there was no chemistry whatsoever between Langdon and Sophie. I went into it expecting it to be lacking somewhat in depth, as movies based on books usually are, but it went above and beyond my expectations in terms of the hack job that they did on the book. The mystery and excitement that made the book so wonderful were completely missing from the film, and the writer made changes to the story that were unnecessary and unforgivable. There were several parts where my friend and I actually laughed out loud because of the ludicrous changes that were made to the storyline.

","Director Ron Howard has made a variety of interesting films over the years that rarely allow his work to be pigeon-holed, nor in many cases particularly respected. ""The Da Vinci Code"" continues with that legacy. Here he has adapted Dan Brown's overrated best selling novel that was easily torn through on any given Saturday afternoon. The book was well-researched but not great literature, however it made for an entertaining read.<br/><br/>The film equivalent stars Tom Hanks, who was no doubt the most recognizable and diplomatic choice for the lead role. He fills the shoes of Dr. Robert Langdon, the embodiment of a smarter, whip-less Indiana Jones, who finds himself caught in the mysterious circumstances surrounding a ritual murder in the Louvre. The quest he finds himself at the center of opens a can of worms able to cause a litany of consequences beyond the scope of the film itself.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" is a solidly made, complex religious thriller with a beautiful visual landscape to share that might have been too faithful to the manipulations of the novel, but it's nonetheless a worthy substitute. This is classic Hollywood film-making just the way someone like Ron Howard does best!"

Abusing of successive twits (and of the spectator's gullibility and patience), this longish movie contains scenes that are quite hard to believe, and would be credible only if it were an animated cartoon (e.g. the guard who's blackmailed by Hanks and Tatou in the Louvre). Tom Hanks, the protagonist, perhaps interprets one of the worst roles of his career, and there is little connection between him and Audrey Tatou as a couple. She, incidentally, has a mediocre performance too. In short, The Da Vinci Code, a high budget film with good actors, is long winded, banal and mediocre. A good movie for a CableTV afternoon?"

","It is a brutal, bizarre and ritualistic murder in a fashionable Parisian Meusum, which initiates notable director Ron Howard's sensational film, The Da Vinci Code. Based on Dan Brown's controversial book which purports to trace Jesus's Maravingian's blood line through the centuries on into the modern era. It begins with cryptologist Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) visiting France, lecturing and book signing when he is suddenly jolted into a dangerous and certainly puzzling high speed police chase which begins pin-ball style in the wet streets of Paris and flying across and into scenic Switzerland, Rome and even historic England. Accompanying, Langdon, is mysterious policewoman Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) who helps Hanks and learns to understand the mysteries of her own involvement. Chasing Langdon is Interpol Inspector Captain Bezu Fache, (convincly played by Jean Reno) who is seeking not only to capture the good doctor, but to destroy him and his quest. Adding to the murderous and intricate pursuit are church fanatics like (Paul Bettany ) as Silas and religious Zellots like the infamous Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (Alfred Molina). In addition there are other menacing arch-types like, Andre Vernet (Jürgen Prochnow) and superb arch-villain Sir Leigh Teabing, played to the hilt by Ian Mckellen. The film's fine casting holds up well enough, despite Hanks's long tooth appearance. Vintage film buffs can readily see this film suspiciously mimics National Treasure. Difference is Nicklas Cage sought lost treasure, whereas Hanks seeks only the Holy Grail. Still, the great cast lends credibility to a otherwise dubious storyline. All in all a fun film with no harm done. ***"

In short Dr Robert Langdon is led to find out the top secret of Christianity.<br/><br/>The whole plot goes as an ordinary thriller does; Something happens, some people get involved, here come some quests, the people crack the quests and find out the truth. So it's not so impressive though it's the first time I heard the story and despite well-researched background information.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen really stands out, and his position as a leading role seems clearer to me than Tom Hanks. Langdon is supposed to be a very intelligent person, but this is something I really can't feel from Tom Hanks, and his character is a bit flat indeed. Audrey Tautou is another good choice of the film, but this film would be too commercial for her. Jean Reno, just like Audrey, should have taken another film.<br/><br/>This film is really just so so.

","I've read the book, and the film doesn't follows the book too close... Yes, I know... the main plot line is there... but there are a few ""minor"" changes as another reviewer said, that to my understanding, changes in a big way the whole thing... For example... in the very beginning of the movie... In the book, Langdon is tooked off the bed at midnight in the Ritz Hotel by Lt. Collet... In the movie, Collet goes to the book-signing in the hotel's lobby... Was that change a needed one in order to make the story ""more appealing""? I think not... If so, Brown himself would write that way the meeting between Collet and Langdon. Another example is when the Teacher kills Remy... the movie reveals the identity of the Teacher too early!!! And I can't remember that in the book, Fache tell Collet he is himself a member of the Opus Dei. Aringarosa is shot by Silas, yes... but Silas himself carries him to the hospital in the book, is not gunned down by policemen as seen in the movie. And the movie doesn't make any reference to Sophie's brother, who lives in Rosslim with Sophie's grandmother... so... there was no ""minor"" changes... there was a huge rewriting of the story. If Peter Jackson successfully adapted Lord of the Rings to the Screen (a more difficult task, by the way) why in the heck didn't Howard with DVC?

","There's been such a lot of controversy regarding the book that the movie was bound to be something that people watched out for eagerly. Despite a lot of adverse criticism, people flocked to the theatres to watch the movie and judge for themselves whether all the hullabaloo was really worth it. To that end, I think, unwittingly, the people who were calling for a ban, actually ended up promoting it!! I was amongst the people who waited for the movie to be released in theatres in India and made my way to the hall the moment it was released.<br/><br/>Having read the book, I was a trifle disappointed by the movie. From the point of view of portrayal of the characters, the actors have done a fairly good job. But the sum total of the movie as a whole, could have been better, I feel.<br/><br/>The book deals with the plot very systematically ... proceeding step by cautious step. The plot is developed very logically and convincingly. It's true that the ending is a bit tame, but by and large, the book's action is fast paced and gripping.<br/><br/>This is sadly lacking in the movie. I realise that with the limited time frame within which the plot has to be unravelled and wound up, it is impossible to do justice to the storyline. However, I still found the treatment to be very sketchy and superficial. There were people in the audience who had not read the book. It was difficult for them to follow the entire action ... that is, there were gaps that remained ambiguous since there was no explanation, no foot-notes about entities such as the Opus Dei etc. The reasons behind Silas' actions remain a mystery. For the average Indian audience, or for people who are non-Christians, a lot of what was portrayed on screen, left questions in their minds.<br/><br/>The movie fails to live up to expectations. The atmosphere of suspense (Dan Brown's book is essentially a thriller), never really gets a chance to be built up.<br/><br/>The book is ""unputdownable"" ... but the movie, apart from satisfying the curiosity of the public, thanks to the furore over it's release, is eminently very ""missable""!!"

Then the Ape of Literary Adaptions, as he is so called by his fellow primate friends, will disappear and make sure another wildly successful novel doesn't turn into a bad movie.<br/><br/>This movie had so much going for it that one might have considered the overwhelming obstacles of a literay adaption such as this trivial. Director: Ron Howard. Writer: same as Beautiful Mind. Cast: Tom Hanks, Ian McKellen, Paul Bettany, Alfred Molina. AND its based on a great book written by Dan Brown. Alas, the movie just does not and really cannot live up to its literary ancestor.<br/><br/>The excitement in the novel The Da Vinci Code lied not in intricate car chases, rousing fight sequences, or stupeyfingly impossible stuntwork, it lied in the mind. Puzzling pieces of information and history together to come to a satisfying conclusion was the power behind the novel. Well, all that putting together pieces business comes from the head, unless the characters think out loud, which is pretty much all they did in this movie. It turns out to be quite boring. Tom Hanks himself looks pretty bored with it. I could have sworn I heard him whisper ""someone give me a flippin volleyball. We'll claim it has something to do with the sacred feminine.""<br/><br/>Honestly, the only thing keeping me interesting was the cast. They're all good actors. Ian Mckellen was good as always.

","Saw it with the wife and friends over weekend. Having read the book may have been an advantage, as the couple we were with said they were hopelessly lost for the first half of the film. Ron Howard is a talented director who does a very good job with this material. I would think that some of the puzzles and most of the historical background would be pretty hard to convey in film. In fact I could almost see Howard wincing as he was forced to use those History Channel like recreations of the past with intentionally blurred film, computer generated crowds, and costumed non speaking role extras. Even with millions in the budget, it still looks made for TV during those scenes.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the movie keeps moving, and Audrey Tautou is not hard to watch at least for me. <br/><br/>As an adventure yarn, it reminds me of the Hitchcock films. A common ordinary man is thrust by circumstance into international intrigue. Forced into the situation, he uses common sense, American (British) values, and an amazing amount of luck, to defeat an organized and powerful foe. He also saves the female lead while at it.<br/><br/>If you see this movie as an attack on your faith, I would suggest re-evaluating your beliefs. Those Catholics who are true believers would never have their faith shaken by a work of fiction like this movie. No more than a movie about the ""Protocols of Zion"" would shake the belief of an orthodox Jew, or the works of Salman Rushdie would affect true believers of Islam."

While it is a long movie, the pace kept moving so nicely that you don't even realize it takes 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>The movie does stay true to the book, although some may consider this a chance for the movie makers to bring more life to the characters and the dialogue. My personal feeling is that most (not all) people who didn't like this movie did so for reasons other than being entertained.<br/><br/>From this disenfranchised group comes a lot of discussion about the basic facts and premise of the movie that Jesus had a child. Well, logically speaking a Jewish man living at that time period of Jesus's age would have probably been married. But with all that aside, if you just go to be entertained for a brief period of time, this will do the trick. I certainly am not one to agree with critics, either movie or literary, so am glad that this has been getting the attention."

Marveously filmed, it has outstanding performances from Ian McKellan and Paul Bettany. Tom Hanks is not well cast as the lead who is a professor and Hanks does not come off as professorial.

Naturally, the book has more information and anecdotes, but the film's story manages to take in and present all that was most important and interesting in the source material.<br/><br/>This is also the film's biggest problem. It is JUST LIKE THE BOOK. So many people have read the book, so many people have read into other sources that support the book and the theory that the film represents is known virtually worldwide now thanks to the book. So... why make a movie about it? Cash in? Most likely. Also the very last shot seems to wander a little too far and goes to state the obvious from what everything that preceded it has implied.<br/><br/>That aside, the film is very well made with stellar production values and yet another epic score by the one and only Hans Zimmer. So fans of the book (all 2389589249084 of you) will undoubtedly enjoy this movie, just don't expect anything truly new. You've seen/heard it all before, but seeing it on screen is sure nice. 7/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: violent content"

","After watching this movie you will wonder where the time went. The action and plot flow seamlessly throughout the entire film. This movie obviously is not for the hard-line catholic as it would definitely cause some feelings of heresy. Watch it in the theater and then buy it..If you weren't awake the last 3 years you would also be interested to know that the movie is adapted from a book. Now as far as adaptions go I can only guess since I haven't read the book yet. There did seem to be a greater attention to detail that you normally find in a 'big Hollywood movie' while avoiding the normal pitfalls of 'dumbing' the movie down. This is evident from the historically accurate retelling of little known facts relevant to the subject matter of the movie. If you like code breaking, hidden agendas and conspiracy theories this is a must see movie."

","After re-reading the book a month ago, I walked into this movie a bit leery how it would be treated on screen despite my faith in Ron Howard who is 1 of my 3 favorite directors (Spielberg, of course, and Chris Nolan being the other 2). But Howard gives us another very entertaining and smart movie. Dan Brown must be very happy. He should be. This is one of the most faithful movie adaptations ever. Nothing of any importance was left out and the movie benefits by turning intriguing words and ideas words into beautiful and often emotionally moving pictures plus the performances are top notch. It is very nicely cast. Audrey Tatou is the standout here. Tom Hanks gets better and better as the movie goes along (and at over 2 and 1/2 hours it goes a long way). In fact this movie gets better as it goes along. It picks up an emotional weight near the end that the book didn't give me. The writing and the editing are superb. It is a bit talky at times, but it never dragged. Whatever you feel about the book is how you'll feel about the movie. (I would actually give the book 8/10 or slightly lower than the movie.) For Ron Howard fans this isn't APOLLO 13 or Cinderella MAN, but it is close."

","Question #1: do you think the story's premise makes for a thrilling, suspenseful action-adventure? Question #2: do you think the story's premise has a greater-than-zero percent basis in actual fact?<br/><br/>If you answered ""yes,"" to the first one, and ""no,"" to the second, then go see the movie with a clear conscience. Otherwise, stay home and wait for the DVD to come out in three months.<br/><br/>As for me? All I saw was a good old-fashioned, edge-of-my-seat chase flick. With a religious angle no more blasphemous than the one used for, say, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Just grimmer and grittier, is all. Otherwise, the 2.5 hour-long running time seemed to literally fly by, for me! I found it that enjoyable.<br/><br/>I think Tom Hanks did an excellent job, as Robert Langdon. I look forward to more American co-productions featuring Ms. Tautou. I haven't seen Jean Reno this double-dealing since the first MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE movie. And, I hope Ian McKellen gets a double-nomination, for next year's Best Supporting Actor Oscar, as both Sir Lee and Magneto! <br/><br/>The one who played the Cardinal, though?

Silas was very creepy, but Paul played him extremely well and so does Tom Hanks. In my opinion, Tom Hanks has always done well at every movie he has ever been in. The girl who plays Sophie had just the right amount of confusion and fright in her voice and facial expression and I was so impressed on Ian Mckelllen!

","Many people have put a lot of effort into building this movie up or tearing it down based on the religious implications it contains. To these people I say, shame on you. This basis for judgment is simply ridiculous; no Hollywood blockbuster is, or should be, capable of tearing down any of the tenets of Christianity for anyone with even an ounce of faith in said religion. Those who are threatened by this film were clearly plagued by doubt and insecurity in their religion to begin with. Further, those who believe this film strikes some sort of winning blow to Christian ""lies and oppression"" comprise the most detestable class of arrogant, pseudo-intellectual Christian-bashers alive. THIS MOVIE AND THE BOOK UPON WHICH IT WAS BASED ARE FICTION AND ARE ADVERTISED AS SUCH. THEY ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. With that said, I am not a Christian and am not in any way educated in the art of film making. I judge movies based on entertainment value and philosophical content. With that out of the way, here is what I thought of the film: The Da Vinci Code is over two and a half hours and I am generally pretty antsy in long movies. I didn't find myself checking my watch once. This movie made me laugh, it made me jump, it made me cover my mouth in surprise, it made me sad, it made me excited, it intrigued me, it engaged me and it entertained me. While there is pretty much no philosophical value, I enjoyed the film very much and would highly recommend The Da Vinci Code to anyone. And I will also be reading the book."

I haven't gotten around to reading it yet and knew very little about it. Well, we all loved the movie and did not have any trouble understanding it. We talked about it all the way home and are still discussing it now and then. The acting was excellent by everyone in the movie, and Tom Hanks' hair looked just fine! It was imaginative, exciting, and thought provoking. It really seems absurd to me that there is all this controversy about this movie. It is just a movie - just entertainment - not a documentary.

The acting was excellent and appropriate. The initial scene with Silas self flagellating was very well done and you could feel the pain of this deeply disturbed victim of life's circumstances bursting from the scene. Howard's rendition of Silas was brilliant! In fact all of the main characters were true to form! The movie exceeded my expectations, superior casting and directing, excellent cinematography, enough action to keep it moving and yet time to pause for the plot to sink in...very well done!

","By now, your head will probably be scrambled with the mixture of reviews this movie has gotten. It suffers from hype and that is the only element detracting from it. When a movie generates as much publicity as this one has, too many critics can't wait to slate it. Interestingly, the negative reviews concentrate on childish things like Tom Hanks's hair. Which leads me to believe that if you are looking for faults, they can always be found. Ignore the reviews (even this one)though and just go and see this stylish thriller. The plot sticks quite closely to Dan Brown's novel and holds the audience's interest in the same way. Hanks and the beautiful Audery Tatou work well together without trying to create chemistry. The supporting cast all put in descent performances, although Jan Reno's considerable talents maybe a little waisted as the stereotypical French Detective. There are moments of humor too. But, like the novel, the purpose of this film is to get you thinking. Even though I found the religious theories a bit far fetched, this is still the most entertaining movie I've seen this year."

","Well this was not a bad film at all. I went with three other people and everyone liked it immensely.<br/><br/>One could call it inoffensive, since the subject matter has potentially explosive content.<br/><br/>But, that's what Ron Howard tends to do with what he's given, take a message and make it palpable for a wide audience without getting everyone angry. He's too nice perhaps.<br/><br/>Still, the film got me right away, and I was pretty much glued to it the entire length.<br/><br/>I had not read the book, although I am very familiar with the subject. Yes! Dan Brown, should pay the people who wrote Holy Blood, Holy Grail, because that is all their idea! Dan Brown, did however write a marvelous story, that is entirely his own. Brilliant stuff. So borrowing ideas is not a crime, but perhaps he should have included footnotes. I liked how the historical flashbacks were done as well, as washed out black and white.<br/><br/>Silas, (Paul Bettany) pretty much carries the movie. Some of the scenes were just skin crawling creepy. Perhaps there was a great film lurking in there, had the film sustained the intensity of the Silas scenes, it could have been a masterwork.<br/><br/>Still it's an important film, as the subject matter raises questions about the origin of a faith that was in fact, taken in a completely other direction 3 centuries after it's inception."
"lori1974","7","4","7","22 May 2006"," Some dodgy casting but overall a great adaptation
","This film was always going to be slated by the critics because it was never going to live up to the book or it's own hype.<br/><br/>However, a credible performance from Sir Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, and an outstanding performance from Paul Bettany as Silas make this film well worth watching. Tom Hanks however, is not up to the role as Robert Langdon (sorry Tom) and you do have to ask how he actually got the role and whether the casting director had actually read the book. Don't get me wrong, I love some of his previous films (The Green Mile, You've Got Mail) but Dan Brown portrayal of Robert Langdon's character is of someone who is charismatic and passionate about his symbolism, Tom Hanks' portrayal of Robert Langdon shows neither.<br/><br/>As the debate rages on whether it is better to read the book first or after......<br/><br/>For those that have read the book, yes there are bits missing (mainly mention of his near death experiences which are dealt with in Angels & Demons and the under-lying sexual tension between Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu), but as this film is already nearly 2 and a half hours long, to add in the missing sections would have made the film far too long, plus nothing critical to the story was missed. For those that haven't read the book, you will still understand the film and will not lack any background information.<br/><br/>I would love to see them move Angels & Demon to the big screen too however, as Mr Langdon is supposed to be younger in this book (as it's a prequel to Da Vinci Code), hopefully they will cast a younger, more charismatic actor in the lead role."
"LesDoodis","7","4","7","22 May 2006"," Why was it slammed?
","I'm not sure why everyone slammed this movie so hard. It wasn't as good as the book, but movies rarely are. It is very hard to tie in ALL the material and our imagination is much better than what can be put on film. Granted, it wasn't the best movie, and won't set any records, but it was a well done movie. My only thing is the acting. It wasn't that great and I thought Hanks could have done much better. They did leave parts out that might have made it more interesting and they did change the ending, but I had expected that. I do think that if the book had never been released or so big, the movie would be much better. I don't feel I wasted any money on this, if you want to slam a book turned movie, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" was much worse. So go see it, but don't try to compare it with the book, it will disappoint you, just go to see it as a movie."

","Let's just get one thing straight, I am not some nut who believes every single thing about this story. I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it, it was a great page-turner. When I heard Ron Howard was signed to adapt the book I was thrilled. But after hearing that a lot of critics looked down on this movie, I decided I would go in open-minded. I was definitely impressed. This is a faithful adaptation that many people should go and see because it is a fast paced thriller that doesn't let down.<br/><br/>For those that haven't read the book. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou) are drawn into a web of conspiracy after the discovery of Sophie's grandfather's death at the hands of an albino assassin, Silas (Paul Bettany). He has given them a set of clues that lead them to find the 'Holy Grail.' But hot on their trail is Captain Fache (Jean Reno). They seek the help of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) and soon the race is on to discover what the 'Holy Grail' really is.<br/><br/>As adaptations go, this is a very good one. Although the book is definitely better, the movie isn't far behind. The acting is fine. My only problem was Tom Hanks, who I think was miscast. It did take some time getting used to him as the lead. Tatou, McKellen and Bettany are all great, though. Everything technical about the movie was fine. The only other problem I had with the movie was that it was too fast paced for me (if that makes sense). I found that some scenes could have been longer, because I found the movie a little rushed.<br/><br/>But as an entertaining cinema flick, you couldn't do any better. It's a great movie and I am not disappointed.<br/><br/>A solid 4/5."
"jan-erik-wahlberg-1","9","4","7","21 May 2006"," Informative but not entertainment
","I went to see the movie with my wife, who very frequently falls asleep in the middle of a mediocre performance, but this time she was alert and enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. Personally - we have both read the book, I read it twice - I agree with the criticism concerning Mr. Browns skills as a writer. Having said that, I have to point out that the poor writing, though making the directors and screenwriters work more difficult, also provides the movie makers with the leverage needed to sophisticate the dialogue. Ron Howard and his team haven't quite succeeded in making the substance lacking dialogue any better, but the movie is nonetheless more palatable in this respect than the book. Maybe the movie as such is a bit too informative for the average American viewer and requires some education in history beyond that of the local school system. Tom Hanks' performance as professor Langdon has been criticized for being dull and dimensionless, but hey, the man portraits an art historian and symbolist! What do you expect, Indiana Jones? On the contrary, Mr. Hanks' somewhat hapless personality build of the witty professor in the middle of a situation beyond his control is in my opinion well founded and skillfully performed, a more action movie-like approach would have spoiled the idea completely. Ms. Audrey Tautou, the doll-faced french actress with the very winning smile, does not fail, either. She is somewhat lost and perhaps a trifle emotionless in the beginning, but she does rise to the occasion and ends the movie with a skillful touch of comedy. Jean Reno, reliable as ever, makes a fair show of a problematic character and deserves to be complimented. Ian McKellen works with great routine but is not fascinating, though genuinely British in both speech and attitude. Paul Bettany is downright scary and draws a very believable picture of the effects of religious fanaticism on the individual. Which brings us effectively to the point of discussion on the heartrending cries from various friends of our Lord, who feel that both the book and the movie are sacrilegious and should be burned - with the author, naturally. At this point I usually toss the ball back to the critics and remind them of the fact, that if our Lord finds Mr. Brown's or anyone else's books or other works offensive, he will deal with them in his own good time. No human interference is needed, as this is one authority you cannot escape from, right? Should some mortal authority find himself annoyed or even offended, that's OK, but limit your indignation to fair and pertinent criticism."

","Being such a huge admirer of the book and having heard so many negative comments regarding the film, my expectations of this movie were low. Howard tries to do right by the book but he seems to have lost track of the fact that for a story to work, it needs a heart. This is where 'The Da Vinci Code' grossly fails, in my opinion. There are some dazzling visuals, stunning locations and a good score but the pacing is slow and this is not good for a long movie. I do not have problem with a long time length as long as a movie can keep me engaged but this one just drags forever. I actually fell asleep after the first hour (part of this could be due to the fact that I was tired as I rarely doze off during a movie) so I just continued the next day. Tom Hanks is mostly wooden and perhaps miscast. His chemistry with Tautou is non-existent in the first hour but picks up eventually (thanks to the female lead). Audrey Tautou is quite alright. Jean Reno plays the typical French copper (but I cannot picture anyone else for the part). Paul Bettany is unrecognizable and suitably menacing. Ian McKellan is great. To add to the positive side, the art direction is impressive. I liked how the interiors and architectural designs looked. France and England looked great too. Well, that's about it. Many people who have liked the movie seem to have not read the book but I would suggest that one read it because it has far more to offer than this film ever will."

Back in Norway, I found myself reading the book with great passion. The subject discussed in the book was what made the book interesting at all, the events themselves being OK. As I finished the book, I thought for myself: a grand 5 out of 6. That's how good I found the book. The next day I downloaded the movie off the internet and found it...pathetic! What I saw was a movie for children, a National Treasure duplicate. I was saddened by the way the story had changed and turned for the worse. It was like as if the movie had been made in a week: everything happened too fast (no time to breathe) and the end...aw, don't get me started. Take a gum and stretch it. You'll notice that from the point you started stretching the gum, most of the substance still is located - the stretched part being long and thin. That's how the movie is!

","The hype, the controversy and stupid reviews are finally laid to rest. I watched the movie today and to say it in one word: amazing. I always held that the biased reviews it got from the western media is basically because the movie was never opened for reviewers until the final moments. So, the anti-Code was already lurking amongst the reviewers who along with misguided activists tried to scuttle it.<br/><br/>The movie, just like the book, starts with murder in the paraquet hall of the Loveru museum. Its like watching the pages of the book unfold right in front of your eyes. The lead Tom Hanks does a wonderful job as Prof. Langdon, so does Audrey Tautou. Perhaps the most wonderful thing about this movie is its portrayal of histroy using cinematic magic. You will witness crusades being fought, the marching of nine Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Jesus Christ and the great sarcophagus of Mary Magdelene. Not to miss is the Councils of Nicaea 325 AD where the Gospels were scrutinized for the first time.<br/><br/>I was amazed to watch The Roseline Chapel, Sulpice Chapel, the Temple Church and of course the interior of Loveru, never missing the 666 glass planes considered to be as one character puts it ""the scar of Paris"". Oh my! did i forget to mention the most beautiful painting of Leanardo, the La Belle Ferroniere. This is the first painting the movie starts with when Jacques Sauniere runs for his life. According to the novel The Secret Supper, the La Belle Ferroniere is a real life Cecilia Gallerani whose daughter was an inspiration behind Mona Lisa and the portrait of St.John in the last Supper.<br/><br/>The most proficient character is that of Sir Leigh Teabing, played by Ian McKellen, the dialog delivery and his explanation of the history of Holy Grail is the center of the movie. Alfred Molina's performance as Bishop Aringarosa brings out the dedication the faith commands. he says ""it is doctrine, not rules, we follow"". True to it, his angel albino Silas resembles the young Darth Vader of Star Wars"" Episode III, with black cloak complete with hood scared the hell out of me when he crashed flying on Teabing.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Akiva Goldsman raises the stake. Hans Zimmer's music score is what I didn't like in the movie. I expected more refined Gothic and gospel music blend. However, the music during the vehicle chase scene is cool.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would say: Watch out for the traffic heading from Punjab to Delhi."

B grade action stars like our friend Michael Dudikoff know more about drama. Maybe it was the fact that the movie is all exposition and no narrative. The dialogue is contrived, conversations are put on solely to drive the limited plot and the liberties the screenplay takes to further the 'dramatic' content turn the story from something that was a plausible theory in the book to absolute non-sense in the film.<br/><br/>No member of the catholic church should boycott this film, it will do it for itself.<br/><br/>I am slowly coming to the realisation that I can never have my two and a half hours back but who do I write to for my 15 bucks?

When Leigh talks about the theory of the ""last supper"" is like a lecture class. Long and draggy.Just like the whole movie. <br/><br/>It does not bring the tension it should have, ie when the truck driver suddenly points the gun at Langdon and Neveu, I don't feel worried about them at all. And when they are in Teabing's house, I just wish Silas would appear faster to stop the whole boring conversation. ""coffee or tea?""...that should be completely scraped! It's not the book, it's a movie!!<br/><br/>Waste of the cast and an interesting story. Da Vinci Code is doomed to be a failure."
"tomsko-1","4","7","15","21 May 2006"," Uninspired
","This was not a movie I have waited to see. The book is terrific pulp, a real turn-pager. In Ron Howards hand the adaption to the big screen is no less than boring. The cinematography is great, and why shouldn't it be? Yo have the Louvre,Westminister Abbey and other postcard locations. It's beautiful. But the acting is wooden, and the dialog anything but natural, it's Tom Hanks worst role since Bonfire of the Vanities in 1990. This is The Da Vinci Code for dummies.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen does a great job as Teabing, and looks to be the only one who has a fun day at work. He gives us the theory of Jesus as a mortal with a great wink in the eye, a inspired choice. Rather than that I found the movie to serious, with no space for a good joke to loosen up the tension."
"alantlwilson","6","7","15","20 May 2006"," inconsequential and all a bit pointless
","Nice cinematography and a surprisingly engaging albino baddie, along with a deliciously camp Sir Ian, in some great locations, but, er, but...<br/><br/>I think the trouble is that, after a good strong start, the story gets to be rather laboured, and ends up disappearing up its own rather imposing rear end. I ended up not caring who any of them were; a problem with plot defined characters and a rather complex and tendentious plot. If Jesus wanted to marry Mary Magdalen, er, why not? Why would Miss Neveu revealing herself as Jesus great great whatever heal all the wrongs of the world anyway? If you know the most basic factual information about the context, from Isaac Newton to the geography of London the whole thing just gets silly, really, in its own meandering pretentious way."
"requiett","6","7","15","20 May 2006"," So dull the con of man...
","Before I begin, I will state that Dan Brown is a lame author with a weak style who happened upon an old Gnostic theory and made it mainstream. His clichÃ© plot structuring made for a very dull read, with a few moments of intrigue scattered throughout. So with such a weak source to work from, this movie was almost certainly doomed to suck or achieve mediocrity at best. It would have been better served as a documentary on the History Channel.<br/><br/>I will certainly say that Ron Howard did a somewhat respectable job of bringing this tripe to the big screen. In fact, many of the methods I observed in this film seemed to be more creative than usual for Howard, probably due to the lack of creativity in the source material. I would go so far as to call some scenes almost downright impressive to watch, coupled with Hans Zimmer's tragically beautiful score, such as the very final scene in the film.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks fills his role very methodically, as he always portrays himself. That was no surprise. I did notice a lack of personality on behalf of the other actors, most notably in Ian McKellan and Jean Reno who also seem to ""fall short"" of interesting. Again, I will blame the source material, because these are very highly respected actors with great experience, and a very colorful resume. Because of the controversial nature of the film, perhaps it was intended that everyone be cast as cold and stoic as possible, so as not to ""overshadow"" the cold logic of the plot.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, this movie was inevitable with its book's bestselling status, almost certainly bound to suck, damned by the critics for its absurdity, and a great way to sell more copies of this detestably bad book."

The score is too heavy for the flick and although I usually love Zimmers work this time around it missed the mark.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly it will make a freaking mint in money just based on the fact the book did so well and it has turned into a money making franchise.<br/><br/>Anyways, just reinforces my belief that Hanks is too over rated as an actor..."
"carols-7","5","7","15","19 May 2006"," some good parts, but too many boring parts
","First, without getting into the historical/religious argument, but looking at it exclusively as a movie, I would say that its biggest problem is a lack of suspense. There are some good moments, and a few scenes where I nearly jumped out of my chair, but there are way too many dead parts. And the problem wasn't that I had read the book and therefore knew what would happen. I've seen many movies of books I've read that managed to keep me enthralled. But not this movie. I was looking at my watch too many times. And it's a shame, because it could have been so much more! And as to its historical/religious arguments, now that's pure fiction!"

","This film has had a lot of hype to live up to and I think that many people will probably say it doesn't.<br/><br/>Now thats not to say its a bad film, but unless you are intrigued by the plot before you sit down, then you'll probably wonder what all the fuss is about, long before the quest comes to an end.<br/><br/>The film is excellently shot and the locations and special effects blend seamlessly with some very nice looking sequences which show us Langdon's mind 'at work' but I think that most people will probably be wanting this film to go down similar lines to Indiana Jones ones and it doesn't. It stays pretty faithful to the book.<br/><br/>Personally speaking, my paths have crossed with the Da Vinci Code a few times now so if anyone wants an inside glimpse of one of the locations just before filming then be sure to check out my blog at www.paulhurst.blogspot.com/2005/09/rosslyn-and-its-secrets.html<br/><br/>Also, I'm pretty sure that in the bus scene, one of Dan Brown's sources for his novel features as an 'extra'. I may be mistaken, but I think I saw Lynn Picknett sat on the top deck. She specialises in the occult and champions the feminine cause. Its not surprising that lots of Dan Brown's so-called 'facts' about femininity in church history comes from this lady and her writing partner who also sits next to her, anyway thats just a bit of trivia thrown in really!<br/><br/>Watch it if: You have read the book and enjoyed it Don't if: You get bored easily or you are hoping its like an Indy film"

"desert-taipan","10","11","27","17 May 2006"," An Open Mind is Important
","In response to the first comment, I think it's important to make a few key statements.<br/><br/>First of all, it could be argued that the Bible - particularly if it is merely accepted at face value - is preventing people from exploring history in a more objective sense. Those who only believe The Da Vinci Code (a work of fiction) are doing themselves just as much of a disservice as those who only believe the Bible (itself also largely a work of fiction). Both of these books do contain historical truths, but both also contain embellishments and fictions.<br/><br/>Far from being an anti-Christian film or premise, I think it's important to understand that The Da Vinci Code simply seeks to explore the history of Christianity in a more objective context. Emperor Constantine's virtually autocratic construction of the New Testament, for example, is an important point for both Christians and non-Christians all over the world. Why were other Gospels not included in the Bible? The answers are obvious, but nobody ever seems to consider the simple idea that the Bible is a construction of man more than anything else.<br/><br/>So, I would say to Christians, perhaps this movie should shake your unwavering faith - because an ""unwavering faith"" is in and of itself probably not an entirely healthy thing. But I would also say that true Christians - those who understand the history of the religion as well as its context in Western civilization - have absolutely nothing to fear.<br/><br/>At least, the movie can be ignored by those who aren't interested.<br/><br/>At most, it can become a tool for further discussion and hopefully a more objective analysis of Christianity and how it affects the world today."

I'm sorry I stayed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Davinci Code is possibly the worst film I have seen at the cinema this year. It is so bad, in fact, that it completely degrades the movie goer. Of all the theories of where the plot may go I had read, or come up with myself, the book or Ron Howard's answers were so incoherent and downright unintelligent that none had even suggested themselves as possible solutions.

"moonspinner55","7","5","10","3 July 2007"," Implausible but fast and exciting; a good ride...
","Dan Brown's bestseller had all the surprising twists and turns of a Sidney Sheldon novel--add to that a plot concerning a secret sect of the Catholic Church involved in a conspiracy and a treasure hunt to the Holy Grail and you've got a pretty entertaining thriller. Ron Howard directs this adaptation fluidly (it may be his best directing yet), however the opening moments involving a murder and some nasty self-flagellation are off-putting. Tom Hanks is very good as a famous writer and professor who lectures on the study of symbols as language; he's pulled into a murder investigation in France and soon finds himself on the run with a French female officer who was the granddaughter of the victim. There's a bit of heavy exposition with the arrival of Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, a learned acquaintance of Hanks who helps sort out the clues left by Audrey Tautou's grandfather. Jean Reno's police captain presents a different problem--he's left too ambiguous without enough material. Otherwise, ""Da Vinci"" is a fast-paced game of wits topped with exciting flourishes and European travel. *** from ****"
"dizzjay","3","5","10","28 January 2007"," Visually Stunning Moments
","This film has some visually stunning moments with shadows from the past overlaid on the present, a good score, and a strong supporting cast. But that's about it.<br/><br/>There is a major weakness in the story: the main characters are not in control of the action, the characters are driven by the plot. The main characters are victims of circumstance rather than taking control of their own destinies. This leaves us with weak central characters lacking the depth that would draw an audience to identify or sympathize with them. Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu is reduced to a talking doll. Not for one moment is she believable as a police officer.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is equally unconvincing as an action hero on a mission to find an earth-shattering secret. He is given claustrophobia in an attempt to add some dimension to his character, but it is an unnecessary embellishment. If it was meant to give him some vulnerability it is canceled out by the fact that he is completely unfazed after being attacked, shot at, threatened, held prisoner at gun-point and facing several harrowing near-death experiences. When he finally reveals the answer to the puzzle that is the fulfillment of both his personal quest and professional career, there is no excitement, no thrill, no professional or personal satisfaction. The secret of the ages is reduced to an anti-climax.<br/><br/>The resulting film is a long, violent chase through exciting locations. The main carrier of the plot is not, as one would expect, the solving of the mystery, but the violence. The story itself is so weak that they try to spice it up with extra violence, adding scenes of Templars being stabbed and burned to death.<br/><br/>The weaknesses of the film over-balance the strengths leaving us with a forgettable below-average film  and it is not the fault of the actors or the filmmakers, but of the basic story all the technical brilliance is hung on."

","I read the book and enjoyed it, so it's always tough to see the movie interpretation. As with any book adaptation, the Da Vinci Code movie lacks much of the back story and set up that made the book so alluring. Most everything that was in the book was included in the movie, but it was very squished. This was probably done to keep the movie from becoming a marathon, but it was upsetting to see some key scenes crushed into a few seconds. Everything that was included was well done, though. Tom Hanks pulls off a satisfactory Robert Langdon, even though it is difficult to think of a chummy comedic actor playing a university professor. Sir Ian McKellen is spot on, as usual. I'd recommend it."

This movie is a mystery and much more cerebral than I think most people want to deal with. I think it was wonderful and Ian Mckellen is the BOMB. He played Tebing wonderfully!!! Paul Bettany played Silas to a T!!!!

I think Director Ron Howard cut out all the right bits (for example, the backwards writing part was solved in the film instantly, whereas it took FOREVER in the novel).<br/><br/>If people go into this movie hoping to see another Lord of the Rings, they 'll be disappointed.

"LadyLiberty","7","5","10","21 May 2006"," The Da Vinci Code Does the Job
","When I was looking for a movie to see this weekend, the fact that I really kind of enjoy a good controversy was alone enough to make me buy a ticket to see The Da Vinci Code this weekend. That I'd enjoyed the novel immensely was almost secondary.<br/><br/>In The Da Vinci Code, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) works at Harvard as a professor specializing in symbols. His particular area of expertise involves religious symbology in an historical context. He happens to be giving a lecture in Paris on the very evening the curator of the Louvre is murdered by a mysterious Opus Dei monk named Silas (Paul Bettany).<br/><br/>Because the body is surrounded by symbols, Police Captain Fache (Jean Reno) seeks Langdon out for help. The curator's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou) specializes in code breaking for the police, so it's no surprise that Fache and Langdon find her on the scene at the Louvre as well. But what Langdon doesn't understand is that he is himself the prime suspect in the murder.<br/><br/>While the professor innocently helps the police with the meaning behind some of the symbols he's permitted to see at the murder scene, Sophie works along a parallel course. She's just as anxious to solve the murder as is Captain Fache, but she also knows that Langdon is not only not guilty but that he could be of crucial assistance in finding the responsible party. Interpreting the messages left for them by a dead man, the two soon find themselves on a trail followed by thousands from time immemorial: a search for the Holy Grail itself.<br/><br/>Though of mythical proportions, there are experts who believe the Holy Grail is real and that it might actually be found. One of them is Sir Leigh Teabing, an Englishman retired to the French countryside. Fortunately, Teabing is known to Langdon, and he and Neveu contact him to learn what they can. The police, of course, are wasting no time and they're not on the trail of the two fugitives. Unknown to those on either side is the fact that representatives of Opus Dei are determined to get there first to ensure that some secrets are never told.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who has won Oscars® for some of his past performances, is perfectly fine here. Playing a relatively staid (and frankly bookish) professor doesn't allow him a lot of room, though, to really show what he can do dramatically. Audrey Tatou is very pretty and also perfectly fine, but again, much of her role doesn't offer the opportunity to do more than go with the flow. Paul Bettany, who often plays the quiet, studious type, is positively menacing here, and good for him! But the standout performance comes from Ian McKellen who steals virtually every moment of every scene he's in, and does so handily.<br/><br/>Special effects that involve illustrating historical events while the professor narrates are beautifully rendered (pay particular attention to the way an explanation of Sir Isaac Newton's funeral is handled). The sets are just; the editing was nicely done, too, especially given the fact that a great deal of information had to be distilled into a two and a half hour movie. And that brings me to commenting on the script.<br/><br/>Writer Akiva Goldman had a tough assignment adapting The Da Vinci Code for the screen given the incredible amount of detail  some of it quite esoteric  that author Dan Brown included in his novel. Although the screenplay isn't unflawed, I also would agree that he did just about the best job possible with the material he had to use.<br/><br/>Those who suggest that The Da Vinci Code is difficult to follow without having read the book are, I think, giving audiences far less credit than they're due. And those critics who apparently found the film so lacking when they were given a preview of the finished product at the Cannes Film Festival last week apparently don't represent regular audiences at all: The people I saw the movie with actually applauded at the end, something I very rarely see any more.<br/><br/>The best recommendation for seeing The Da Vinci Code may not come from me, but rather from a young man seated behind me with his girlfriend. As the closing credits ran, I heard him say, ""Wow. I didn't think I was going to like it. But it was good!"" It is.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: If you haven't been living in a cave, you've doubtless heard more than you care to about The Da Vinci Code from those who'd like to see the story silenced. In my own mind, that attitude is really the only wrong one to have.<br/><br/>If people want to use the story as a springboard for discussion, good for them. If religious groups would like to use the story to educate their followers, good for them. But if those who don't like some aspect or another of the story intend to stop all of us from hearing or seeing it, well, that's bad for all of us.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Da Vinci Code is rated PG-13 for ""disturbing images, violence, some nudity, thematic material, brief drug references, and sexual content."" Neither the nudity nor the sexual content is, in my opinion, remotely an issue here; the drug references are subtle enough that I don't even remember them. The thematic material is, however, much too complex for younger children to understand or to appreciate. Additionally, some scenes of mortification are far beyond what youngsters ought to see. I'd say that The Da Vinci Code is best suited for those of about age 15 or so and up."
"DaveDiggler","4","6","13","19 May 2008"," ""The Da Vinci Code"" Suffers from a Repetitive Narrative
","""The Da Vinci Code"" is the third film Ron Howard has directed since his masterpiece ""A Beautiful Mind."" Howard makes no mistake about crossing over to his roots and implementing techniques similar in his Oscar winning film. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is much like John Nash (Russell Crowe) with one big difference; Langdon has no psychological problems that nearly ruin his everyday life and the people around him making him far less sympathetic. Langdon has a phenomenal ability to break codes. He's, supposedly, merely a master of symbols, but when some random guy he's never met writes something that is incredibly insignificant to his life, Langdon cannot only figure out that it's an anagram, but he can break it in a matter of seconds. Who ever said stupid people go to Harvard? This Langdon is a genius and he figures out anything even though he's put in a situation he has never prepared for and is completely new to. As he cracks the codes, Howard uses the same highlighting techniques to show us what he's looking at as he did with John Nash who looked at a bunch of numbers and found a strategic pattern sequence, proving to be ""the best natural code breaker I ever saw."" Well that guy hasn't met Robert Langdon. This guy is so good at breaking codes he can figure out somethings in code in the first place.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" has potential, but it's also extremely ambitious. Where ""The Da Vinci Code"" struggles is not only with the thrilling chase of finding the truth and the hunting of people who try to expose them, but for the fact that it tries to come off as realistic when it's utterly unrealistic as it relies on a barrage of coincidences and false interpretations of history. ""The Da Vinci Code,"" surprisingly, becomes boring two hours into the film as the quest of Langdon feels unrelenting. We feel the film has come to a rest once we find out the big secret that isn't all that impressive or shocking, but it keeps going and going and going. Not only is it repetitive, but it's long, drawn out, with one chase after another and one guy popping up after another. After about an hour it gets to the point where the entire country is chasing Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu, who somehow always seem to slip past these dumb, bozo-looking cops. In certain parts it becomes extremely ridiculous. For a long two and half hours Langdon and Neveu discover something, then are nearly captured (Sometimes getting caught and pulling a James Bond, and escaping capture), then finding a hiding place to talk about the discovery they found before nearly getting killed. This same act happens about four times. That's the plot for the first 2 hours and 20 minutes. Discovery, chase, escape, talk about discovery, then discover something else, and repeat. Since they never get caught, we get the feeling that they will always trick out, step aside, and out smart the clumsy nation that is after them. This is not at all thrilling and the endless talking is going to put people to sleep even if this stuff is pretty interesting. Some may argue it's not supposed to be taken seriously, but it doesn't come off as fantasy. It comes off as a fantasy trying to be realistic.<br/><br/>The best parts of ""The Da Vinci Code"" come from the style, the smart source material, and some of the performances (most notably, Paul Bettany who also popped up in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and gave a very strong performance there). Bettany is incredible and delivers one of the best acting performances of the year as the tortured Silas. Silas, is the man doing Gods will. He's unknowingly killing people for the wrong reasons, but because his church saved him he believes he's doing good. He believes and trust them so much because they reached out to him when no one else would. He even inflicts pain upon himself to serve penance for all things he does for the greater good. He's a mislead soul, lost within the corruption of the powerful. He plays this role to perfection that could have easily gone over the top. He plays it with the perfect balance as he's not too restrained where he's not believable and not too far over the top where he's laughable. Too bad Tom Hanks' mullet is incredibly distracting and the furthest thing I think of when thinking of a Harvard scholar. Hanks is merely average here. The look, style, and cinematography are truly mesmerizing. The flashback sequences are phenomenal and the art direction is on an Academy Award worthy level. There are many different locations in many different cities across many centuries and the look every time has its own feel that adds to the film. The source material is smart and dumb at the same time. There are some historical inaccuracies, but it's a mildly well written script with a lot of great myth and mystery. The material is both a strength and its greatest weakness. There's quite a bit in Ron Howard's film, ""The Da Vinci Code,"" to like, but there's also a lot to hate. A lot more."

","This should have been an absorbing if not great film. I'd not read the book and taken all reasonable steps to avoid press coverage and interviews, so the plot was fresh to me at least. But it was a long, drawn-out affair, with historical detail shovelled inelegantly into the lives of characters who didn't really seem to develop any identity, nor any convincing interest in each other. There were some ingenious plot ideas hidden in there somewhere, but perhaps even this lengthy film did not have the space they needed to be revealed in a manner that did them justice.<br/><br/>Perhaps this was simply an unfilmable story - better suited to a quality many-part TV adaptation perhaps, if anything at all.

"filmfan92","4","6","13","29 May 2006"," Ain't No Masterpiece
","Starring Tom Hanks. Directed by Ron Howard. With Alfred Molina and Ian Mckellen. A movie with credits like that should be an embarrassment of riches. Instead it's a talky cloak-and-dagger chase film, interspersed with jerky flashbacks and faulty accents.<br/><br/>By now, most people know the plot. Tom Hanks headlines as Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor asked to solve the murder of a Louvre curator. The curator has left a series of clues, written in blood, that lead Langdon, along with cute tag-along Sophie Neveu (Tatou, struggling with her first major English role) to uncover a vast conspiracy. Oh, but it's not just any conspiracy. This cover-up involves a Catholic sect (Molina hams it up as a sinister bishop), an Albino assassin (played with quiet menace by Paul Bettany), a crippled history buff (Mckellen, excellent as usual), and a shocking secret hidden in DaVinci's ""The Last Supper"". The book, heavy on history and light on action, was great in small doses. But a non-stop 150 minutes spent listening to Hanks describe the time of Christ amounts to a much less enjoyable experience. The film never shakes from its somber tone, and director Howard tries to cut down on the talking by using grainy flashbacks that look like a high school production of Hamlet. Devotees of the book will find this a forgettable thriller that stays faithful to its source. Everyone else will be let down by a great director and a great cast, who produce an average film."

","I was honored to have seen Da Vinci Code on the 19th of May, the first evening of its release. I was thoroughly titillated by the dialogue's ability to bring forth an interesting story. For the life of me, I cannot fathom all of these 'critical"" remarks and spoilers. The movie carried me along, without one boring moment. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed the book (which I found to be a disappointment, though not surprisingly so. I had read Angels and Demons, Brown's earlier book, having been pulled into that largely because of my interest in the theme of dastardly doings at The Vatican. I'm afraid it's a matter of an attraction one sometimes feels for what one experiences as an atrocity in the modern world -- a vortex of unchecked power reaching across our physical and spiritual lives. I've escaped intellectually but still have a fascination for how someone would portray darkness within this institution and get away with it. Ron Howard did a perfect job of it. I take exception with criticisms of casting. Tom Hanks surprised me in being well-suited to the role. I liked the portrayal of Robert Langdon as less than a super hero who (refreshingly) doesn't end up screwing the female supporting /lead. The lack of special effects that could have overcome a thought-provoking story was impressive and well-judged. I fear that we are facing a generation of critics who grew up with special effects and don't recognize the beauty in telling a story through dialogue. This is art. It made me a listener and a thinker -- not that I had not thought on such subjects before. In that the film was perfectly balanced between action/story/dialogue it was divine. I suspect that some bishops have been in touch with chosen critics who are incapable of reviewing the movie objectively. The other three people with whom I watched the move -- two of whom are published authors -- were as notably impressed as was I. I don't believe that I stand alone and hope that the voice of those who actually see and appreciate the movie can be heard above the din of those critics who pan the film. It's worth every effort to see this film. If you are addicted to action, you will be glad to hear that at least on two occasions you or those all around you will be heard to gasp, scream or otherwise testify to the the film's ability to wake you up and startle you. Silas was fascinating, as fascinating and as much an extreme example of what we can become if we embrace the more radical practices and ideas of some powerful arms of the Church. If these things make you uncomfortable, consider yourself blessed. They are real and have no place in the light of day. Kudos to Ron Howard, Dan Brown and others for exposing them on film, no matter how effetely. It's a beginning, and a beautiful and artful one."

However, Ian McKellen is awesome as Leigh Teabing, but he is pretty amazing in every role. Bettany carries off the albino killer Silas well, however the suspense surrounding the character in the film is not like it is in the book. I don't see what the church is fussing about because from the film, there is no doubt that this is a work of fiction, whereas in the book, doubt of the Church comes more easily. Angels and Demons would have made a much better movie, without as much controversy, and if they do make it, i hope they get a better director."

","The movie itself to me moved slow and was confusing as heel from the beginning of the movie. The point to me why oh why did they even make this film when they should have been making angels and demons first to fully explain the character that was Robert Langdon. Langdon to me along with all of the other characters in the film had no such character development in the story. But the thing to me that really got to me was the sequences that really got it dragging on during the end when they had all of the fade outs. I was just sitting there with my movie evaluation paper since I work at a movie theater but oh man I was thinking like when the hell is this movie going to end. It was a boring waste of two hours and twenty three minutes. The part like when Robert was like I can't go inside of that because he was claustrophobic which they didn't get into too great of detail but briefly explained it when Ian McKellan or codename the Teacher, which if you aren't a complete idiot you would figure it out that he was the man who was the employer of Alfred Molina, and Paul Bettany who dies from Police after he shoots and thinks that he kills Molina in one scene. Jean Reno to me pulled off a great job, and with Audrey Tatou also did a good job in the film, but Tom Hanks severely got on my nerves which I never thought could even be possible since he was one of America's greatest actors ever to have crossed over from Bosom buddies a dumb comedy to great films such as Forest Gump, and even Philadelphia.<br/><br/>The writing in the film was horrible, because who wrote the film but no other than Akiva Goldsman the man who wrote the two greatest campy and horrendous films in Hollywood Batman Forever, and Batman and Robin. Akiva's lines were horrible, and also the plot of the movie had some great gaping holes in the story. Akiva should be banned from Hollywood but the people in this world like the ones who gave this movie a ten should be given a CAT scan but everyone has there right to their own opinion so I will not hold it against them. Ron Howard did a good job Directing the movie, but the film would of been ten times better if David Koepp would have wrote the film since he to me is one of Hollywood's finest writers, and so now the one movie that I had so much hope for turned out to be a horrible movie that had so much potential, and yet I still wonder why they did not make the Angels and Demons book into an adapted screenplay for the film.<br/><br/>I encourage everyone to go see it since this is only my opinion and everyone should make their own opinions about the film. It's one of those you like it or you hate it films I guess."
"vpatrick","6","6","13","20 May 2006"," Great performance of Ian McKellen!
","When I entered the theater I didn't know what to expect. As with every movie made from a book, it lacks many subplots and it somehow fails to reproduce the mystic atmosphere in the original writing. The movie is good, performance of the actors is excellent, and I must say, Ian McKellen's act was by far the most convincing.<br/><br/>As for the movie, we must state it is a fiction from the very beginning, as is the book. Did Jesus and Mary Magdalene have a child? Unlikely, but this is what the movie and the book try to make you see. As for the religious part, people believe in witchcraft, spirits, ufos, extraterrestrials and even devils but not God... It's much easier I guess.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, this type of modern literature, that catches (read traps) most youngsters into the world of IFs and possibilities is shamefully widespread. Coelho-like spawn that shadow true literary masterpieces are very trendy these days. What most people don't see is that they come and go as the rain.<br/><br/>I'd give it a 6, and that alone for artistic performance. If you want something spectacular, try something else instead."

","I went to the film not expecting much and I didn't get much either. It was a rather cliché solve-the-puzzle-while-running-for-your-life plot, not unlike Indiana Jones or similar movies and series. The only thing different is the idea of Jesus having a wife and children and the Church actively working against it. I didn't care one way or the other, so I didn't find anything really interesting in this. Now, what I would have liked to see is the whole thing revealed to the world and the social and religious changes on the world. Now THAT would have been a great book.<br/><br/>Conclusion: reasonable acting, reasonable plot, shamefully small role for Jean Reno. I also have a conspiracy theory about this film. I think it has a hidden meaning that Magneto would kick Doc Ock's ass if they were to fight."

There's not much new to this film, but just Tom Hank's goofy hair and some french accents. I have never really read the book so I had only a little clue what this film was going to be about. I came out of the movie theater with a lot of information, but was still confused on most parts. There is still tons of question that still need to be answered and what I've heard from many fans from the book was, that they were missing some key points in the movie. But there were a few positives. Although Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors, his performance in this film was pretty dull and could've been a little better. <br/><br/>But it was Paul Bettany and Ian McKellen that made the acting carry the film. There performances were very enjoyable and they played their parts perfect. The screenplay was written really well by former writer of Ron Howard, Akiva Goldsman and had nicely used dialogue. Overall, the film was decent and could've been a lot better. For its 2 and a half hour length, I thought it went way to slow and felt like it was almost 4 hours, but that's just me.

The book wasn't that long, yet somehow they couldn't find the time to fit the whole thing into the movie?They left out HUGE parts of the story. I don't know how they ended the movie without them.

But no, by the time I left the theater, I was livid. It took me days to get over it, and to this day, anytime I hear someone say what an amazing movie it was (which is few) I just want to slap them and tell them they have no idea what they are talking about because they obviously never read the book.

","The Davinci Chode Wow, once again Ron Howard proves that he's one of the least talented people working in Hollywood. His latest flick, THE DAVINCI CODE (2006, one and a half stars), is no different than his other work: trite, uninteresting, and visually boring. Even in a film such as THE DAVINCI CODE, one that you'd think have sleek, catchy images, the cinematography and composition is bland. It's not ""bad,"" but it's not anything above mediocre. It's pathetically simple. Like most of Howard's body of work, the dialog is HORRIBLE (almost as the romance dialog in STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES (2002, three stars)) and the characters (and the acting of the actors playing those characters) are two-dimensional. How can such a talented actress such as Audrey Tautou disappoint me? The answer: Ron Howard. The religious controversy behind the film is bogus. The plot is too ""fantastic,"" absurd and over-the-top to cause anyone to question their Christian beliefs and renounce their faith. Additionally, the execution of the plot is predictable and cliché; I've never read the book, nor did I know much about the plot and yet I still guessed the twists. But hey, I hear the source material was poorly written too. Apparently, Dan Brown has a knack for intriguing, controversial plots but he can't write for crap. Nonetheless, its no excuse. Avoid this film at all costs. It's the first highly overrated film of the year. Go see a movie you KNOW will be crappy instead. At least then you won't be disappointed. Final word: at least NATIONAL TREASURE (2003, three stars) was a comedy...<br/><br/>QUESTION OF THE DAY: Which is worse: ""The Davinci Code"" or Tom Hank's haircut for the movie?"
"billystewart4","9","3","5","21 May 2006"," Well done considering the amount of information in the book
","I know, I know; there is a lot of talk about the controversy surrounding this movie. Here is the basic point. I believe in God and I believe that Christ is the son of God, who died on the cross for my sins. The work of fiction (the book) was an engrossing and extremely entertaining read (as were Dan Brown's 3 other books, Angels & Demons was exceptional).<br/><br/>The movie was very well done. It managed to carry the major themes of the book while keeping the film moving where it could have been very bogged down. Kudos to Goldsman for the screenplay. The acting was good, the storyline engaging and the plot twists well handled. All in all, I have to give this film 9 out of 10; being that there can only be so many films that rank as a 10 and this is just shy of that level of perfection in my mind.<br/><br/>Please, get off your high-Christian-horses and understand that this movie and book were not attacking anything. They are works of fiction based on a legend that has been around since the 12th century. Do some research (just a little) and you will find that there are numerous books available regarding the knights templar and the secret that they protect. Most of the theories are a stretch and may be considered sacrilige if you are too touchy, but if you look at this subject as a study of history, you will find that it is an extremely interesting subject.<br/><br/>THE MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT! I will buy it on DVD. I hope for Angels & Demons to be done soon. But, I guess that will create more unnecessary hysteria from christians who cry blasphemy without reading the books first. Ah, so what, If The DVC was this good, Angels & Demons will have to be great."

","I'm sure I would have enjoyed this movie much more if I hadn't read the book in the 24 hours prior to seeing it. From the very start, I felt like too many details had been dropped or completely missed. Overall, the movie captures the adventure and ""treasure hunt"" style of the book, but I found myself regularly disappointed.<br/><br/>I don't know what all the fuss is about, Audrey Tautou was not as impressive as they say. This might be the result of a bad screenplay, i.e., the scene on the plane with Silas!?!?. Paul Bettany and Ian McKellan made this movie, although their physical appearance does not really match the description of Silas and Teabing from the book. Of course, Tom Hanks was a worthy Robert Langdon, but I'll never be able to read Dan Brown's character without seeing Tom's face. (I have the same problem with Harry Potter...) <br/><br/>The movie itself was really slow before the climax at the end...I felt myself wanting more action. Also, there are some parts of the book that were altered in the movie and therefore, the result is a lack of explanation. For example, after the scene at the Templar Church, Teabing is put in the TRUNK instead of the rear of the car. Of course, Ron Howard tried to make up for this with a riverside scene, but he could have left that out and included the first cryptex instead. It's those small things that reading the book right before seeing the movie ""ruined"" for me.<br/><br/>Of course, some of the best lines from the book were preserved, such as the three questions Teabing poses to Langdon at Château Villette's gate. Well delivered by McKellan and Hanks.<br/><br/>This movie will probably be best enjoyed by those who have not read the book... Otherwise, go find a copy of the book and read it again."

I'm gonna go beat it to wrestling videos"". Its what would be considered an ""intellectual thriller"" with as many twists and turns as a merry-go-round.

If you are interested in learning more about telling fact from fiction in both the movie and Christianity in general I would recommend the books ""The Lost Scriptures: Books That Did Not Make It Into the New Testament"" and ""The Nag Hammadi"" an English translation of some of the gospels suppressed by the church."
"ktboundary","9","3","5","21 May 2006"," The genie is out of the bottle.
","A well crafted film and an honorable adaptation of the book. Thoroughly enjoyable. Fans of Dan Brown will not be disappointed. I was captivated by the fast moving pace of the film and found it neither boring or long as some of the cynical detractors are now claiming. Though not a flawless creation, it certainly deserves more than the half-star it was given by many of the so-called ""impartial"" critics. This undeserved low score reveals the hidden agenda underlying their treatment of a controversial subject matter.<br/><br/>The true nature of Jesus is perhaps simultaneously the films greatest asset and its greatest liability. The explosive nature of the material both compels the viewers attention and at the same time demands a level of reverence out of respect for the faithful. Any other subject would have received a different treatment, possibly conceding a greater latitude in its artistic expression. There are few laugh lines for instance as one might expect in dealing with a subject this serious. The film and book do take dramatic license with many facts as many have already pointed out. But credit must be given to the Da Vinci Code, and books like Holy Blood Holy Grail, for illuminating the humanity of a historical Jesus and returning harmony and balance to the Christian world via the sacred feminine. Something Catholicism in particular is greatly lacking. At minimum Da Vinci is clearly trying to speak to us across the ages, a cursory examination of the apostle John/Mary from The Last Supper, and Mary from The Madonna of the Rocks reveals that they are one and same person, even wearing similar hair style and clothing.<br/><br/>I'm mystified by the casting of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, though clearly an accomplished, versatile actor he does not convey the distinction of a Harvard academic. Perhaps my opinion will change after repeated viewings as Hanks does provide an acceptable performance. His portrayal of Langdon does seem to deliver the inner turmoil of dealing with such a sensitive topic. I imagined Silas much less photogenic than the lanky Paul Bettany, this characterization should have been more of a tortured, hulking brooding type. Bettany executes his role well but seems more like a figure from the pages of GQ rather than the haunted, freakish Silas of the book.<br/><br/>The charming Audrey Tautou is exemplary in her role. She has been a favorite since 'Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' and I could imagine no other actress in that role, with the possible exception of Anna Friel who might have conveyed a more fiery independent character. There doesn't appear to be any chemistry or magic between Tautou and Hanks. They deliver their lines well and it's difficult to find any sort of technical complaint, but one gets the impression they have little in common, you might never find them sharing a coffee together for instance. Jean Reno, Ian McKellen and Alfred Molina are perfectly cast in their roles and deliver exceptional performances.<br/><br/>In all this is a highly successful film bringing much of the book to life, featuring wonderful, scenic photography of France, England, Scotland, and portrayals of the holy land, and dramatic flash-back scenes illustrating the historical significance of those locations. Concerning Christianity, the genie is now out of the bottle and many of the faithful are now in full disaster recovery mode. The irony is that, to my knowledge, there are no theological provisions against a married Jesus, it certainly does not change his message. There is no turning back however as we, armed with our new knowledge of the past, will continue to ""seek the truth""."
"bopdog","9","3","5","21 May 2006"," Delightful thriller. Minor logic 'problems', but belief stuff aside, this is a brilliant and rousing chunk of movie magic and movie fun!
","The spiritual 'truths' of 'The Da Vinci Code' are not the point. What does seem more important, and worthy of our consideration vis-a-vis the movie, is the phenomenon whereby whenever something powerfully new is in the offing, and then the old-school die-hards resist it. It seems to be a story about how humans will do virtually any evil thing to protect their ego's stand on whatever topic is at hand.<br/><br/>This movie is not anti-Catholic. The so-called 'codes' and secret societies depicted in the movie are illogical, and pure hooey, in my opinion. I personally think that whole aspect is silly. I have read the book, and thought it was all pretty silly then, too. Upon seeing the movie, I was not convinced otherwise.<br/><br/>Having a world-wide religion broaden its base, and begin to appeal to the feminine, to the Universal Mother principle, is undoubtedly a very good thing. Perhaps some version of this, minus the hokem and hooey of Dan Brown's book, of course, is in fact The Next Big Step for mankind.<br/><br/>That aside, the movie itself is extremely well made. It is very effective, well acted, and an exciting way to spend an afternoon or an evening. I heard some homegrown English critics on BBC Radio 4 this past Friday, reviewing it. One woman said she was gratified that the British actors acquitted themselves admirably, especially contrasted to the timid and hesitant character played by Tom Hanks. As much as her pride in the British actors was well-placed, her panning and criticising of Tom Hanks was unfounded, and grossly unfair. The character he was portraying WAS a timid and hesitant character. He played an academic who was swept up in a storm of mistaken identities and mistaken guilts and purposes. This is called 'act-ing', and is what a great actor such as Hanks excels at doing. I thought Hanks did a fabulous job of being someone--- an intelligent, well educated, and basically good and wholesome someone--- who got caught in events way beyond his control, that he neither understood nor could control. Audrey Tatou (Sp?), the French actress who played the other main character, also did a wonderful job. It was refreshing first to hear her speak English (because I speak English, of course). Second, it was nice to see her play a 'real' person this time, rather than the simpering fluffs she played in 'Amelie' and another role I cannot remember the name of just now.<br/><br/>Ian McKellan was amazing, as usual. Isn't funny that it now seems that he is in HALF the movies coming out of Hollywood these days? He deserves the success, as he is a great and sturdy actor. Paul Bettany, also in director Ron Howard's previous film, 'A Beautiful Mind', was great, as was Alfred Molina--- who continues to defy categorization as to his nationality. Funny, the BBC 4 Brit-praising critic did not mention him! Molina is such a chamelion--- another great actor. He is a native Londoner, and his generic Euro-Dark looks allow him to repeatedly play Frenchmen, Spaniards, Italians, or whomever else the script (and subsequent paycheck!!!) calls for.<br/><br/>The cast--- superb all around. Marvelous! So, forget the churchy stuff, or not, as you will. But do leave your logical brain at the door, and you'll have a wonderful time at the movies with 'The Da Vinci Code'."
"icklebeckster","8","3","5","21 May 2006"," Good thriller
","I really enjoyed this film...it did what it said on the tin. I think it was always going to be a difficult book to remake because of the long periods of discussion and puzzle-solving. I went with someone who hadn't read the book and we both found it a thrilling ride right until the end. It was a feat by the script writer to make sure the complex plot and conspiracy theories were clear while keeping the pace moving. The action scenes were exciting, there was a good relationship between the leads and the less prominent characters played their part. It drew us in and that's what a good blockbuster does. The locations looked great too. <br/><br/>There has been a lot of complaints calling this boring, slow and woodenly acted. I disagree.

"bjthomas-2","8","3","5","20 May 2006"," Surprisingly Good!
","Having enjoyed the book without being blown over by it, I decided to see the film although I wasn't particularly excited. Most of us would agree that Hollywood often ruins good stories, but The Da Vinci Code didn't suffer such an indignity. The film is a surprisingly good rendering of the book.<br/><br/>Though the main characters deliver somewhat lacking performances, the peripheral characters are triumphant; particularly Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany as Leigh Teabing and Silas respectively. Certainly, there are those skeptics out there who have a tough time accepting the seemingly outlandish leaps made by the main characters in order to solve the mystery. Yet, if one can manage to put aside her skepticism momentarily, she will certainly see a plot of thrilling intricacy.<br/><br/>The film certainly calls some common Catholic beliefs into question, but it also acknowledges traditional points of view through Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon. It is a terrible shame that such a great number of Catholics (many of whom make up the 17% of voters who rated this film a 1 without even seeing it) seem incapable of reckoning with opposing beliefs. I encourage everyone to see the film as a work of fiction rather than as an actual affront to Catholic traditions."
"swusterb","9","3","5","20 May 2006"," Drop Expectations and See a Great Adaptation
","I'm seeing a lot of lukewarm responses to this film, but I think the reason why is all the speculation that went along with people as they went to see it. In my opinion, that's what kills most good films: people have presupposed expectations of a film and when the film goes in a different direction, then they just write it off as stupid or pointless because it doesn't match what they were thinking. I feel this film is suffering from this syndrome.<br/><br/>First of all, let's consider the director: Ron Howard. The films he has made in the past have been geared towards pleasing a large audience. This is what he brings to this film. He took the heart of the novel and preserved it in the film. Therefore, allow me to take issue with some of the comments made about the film being too wordy. The book itself is very wordy. It's a concept novel that contains a bunch of what-if situations strung together into a mystery/thriller, and requiring a whole lot of explanation. The film is a perfect reflection of what the book was all about. To spice up the large amount of exposition, Howard puts in filler footage so we can more easily imagine what is being described. Works great for me, because the only expectation I had going into the film was that I would be able to see what the boom only described.<br/><br/>Second, let's consider the actors: Tom Hanks. I love him; I'll admit that right now. I remember seeing ""Splash"" and ""Bosom Buddies"" as a boy, and I've grown up watching his films. My comment to my wife as we left the theater was that I felt he really did a good job of portraying the character of Robert Langdon as there weren't a lot of the idiosyncrasies (such as facial expressions, voice, etc) that are trademark Hanks (only one that I recall from the entire film). Taotou was perfect as Sophie, the young person coming to terms to what her grandfather was all about. And my wife and I agreed that Jean Reno played the perfect Fache; we cannot imagine anyone who could do a better job with that part. Ian McKellan may not have met the book's physical description of Tiebing, but he was excellent in the film using a wide range of emotions (I loved his display when Hanks and Taotou arrive at his place).<br/><br/>Thirdly, we have to keep in mind that there has been a lot of hype over the premise of this movie. However, I think it's important to point out that none of that hype was touted by the filmmakers. Both Hanks and Howard simply stated that they wanted to make an entertaining film, and that's just what they did. The fact that so many people protested and made a big hullabaloo (great word, eh?)needs to be forgotten before entering the theater.<br/><br/>One things to keep in mind is the source material for this film: it came from a book. Being an English teacher, films based on books are a kind of specialty with me. I have seen many failures, some near-misses, and a few stellar entries. This film is one of those that sticks closest to its source material. It keeps almost perfect pace with what the book developed; the buildup and relaxing of tension/suspense is mirrored exactly. The expository sections that have to be there are there, and yet enhanced by the filmmakers to make them less dry. This is one of the best book to film adaptations I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I, for one, loved the film (my wife, for another, loved it also), and I am hoping it is really successful because I would love to see ""Angels and Demons"" on the big screen sometime in the near future."

So not only is Da Vinci Code obviously fictitious and blasphemous, and a copied work, but Brown seems to be OK with basing his unoriginal lies on the thoughts of a child molesting con man.<br/><br/>-There are also other inconsistencies in the book, even as a sick fictitious work, Brown's conspiracy theory that the Louvre windows are supposed to add up to a certain 'code' prove wrong again. Historians have written to the Louvre and the Louvre wrote back and confirmed the # of window panes were not what Brown suggested, but instead was 673 panes of glass.<br/><br/>It's understandable the curiosity surrounding this book and film, but once you know the truth you have to ask yourself if you really want to believe a pack of lies, or if you'd rather learn the true history of God from the Bible and see for yourself that it actually works."

","So what's all the fuss about? Tom Hanks is a visiting American professor of Theology in Paris and Audrey Tautou is a cryptologist with the French police. Hanks is accused of murdering Tautou's grandfather and she believes him when he says he's innocent. The investigating detective, Jean Reno, has another agenda going as he's a member of Opus Dei. <br/><br/>The DaVinci Code is a murder mystery chase very much in the style of such Hitchcock thrillers as North By Northwest and The 39 Steps. It's not as good as those two, but not bad either. Ron Howard has made an entertaining enough film and should put a lot of money in his pocket with all the protests going on. As is usually the case, they're driving up the box office. You can't buy the kind of publicity that fundamentalist Christians are giving this film.<br/><br/>So what's the protest for? We've got a couple of secret religious societies protecting their secrets and killing a lot of people to do it. One of the secrets is that Jesus was in fact a very human soul who did human things such as get married to Mary Magdalene and have a daughter. Supposedly she went to France with her child and is in fact buried in France. And there are descendants walking around today.<br/><br/>The novel by Dan Brown certainly was well received and sold millions of copies. But folks it is when all is said and done, a NOVEL. It's a work of fiction from an imaginative author, nothing more. In fact at the very beginning of the opening credits it says that the movie is taken from the NOVEL by Dan Brown. <br/><br/>Ron Howard will need several Brink's Armored cars to haul away all the profits he will make with The DaVinci Code. Ironically the same people who are beating him up over this film were praising him last year over Cinderella Man. That was a good family values film and it was, I liked it a lot. I liked this one too.<br/><br/>By the way special mention should go to Audrey Tautou. She conveys an Audrey Hepburn like quality in her role and hopefully this will be a break out film for her."

","When the book was released in 2003 following the huge success of Dan Brown's other novel Angels & Demons. No one not even Dan Brown himself could have Imagined what a huge global phenomenon The DaVinci Code would be, the book has been translated into almost every language it's old out millions of copies all over the world, and I happen to have a copy at that. SO when I heard they were making one of the greatest books in modern history into a film to tell you the truth I wasn't real all that optimistic, so when I went to go see the DaVinci Code in theaters during it's opening weekend I was floored and utterly stunned by how amazing and accurate this film was to the book, albeit they changed some things but that's the film industry for you. Now seeing it again after four years and it's still amazing.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks turns in an amazing performance as Robert Langdon who will soon be considered one of the greatest literature characters of all time, Langdon is something of an enigma, he follows no code or by no means any standards and he always puts everything of himself to save lives at no cost to his own. Tom Hanks brings to life a character that people have come to love and admire. And he's done it with his own style and grace, Langdon isn't just some character on a page anymore no he;s been brought to life in an exceptional way the only the likes of Ron Howard and Hanks could.<br/><br/>The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown was a global literary phenomenon but now it's also a global film phenomenon as well. I know allot of of fans put down this movie due to some minor changes that were made but if you look past that this movie will not disappoint.<br/><br/>Unlike most books brought to the silver screen, this one is faithful and very thought out. It's not some half baked movie like Kiss the girls or it's sequel.No the DaVinci Code was made to be exactly like the book as much as possible and they did very well in my opinion, this movie is not prefect and it doesn't pretend to be, this movie is well thought out and made but at some parts it falls a little short of overwhelming. But if you see the bright side to this film and if you look at it for the great movie that it is, you definitely won't be disappointed. All in all The DaVinci Code delivers great any day entertainment."

","Java Man reviews ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2006, PG-13) Directed by Ron Howard Written by Akiva Goldsman. Based on the novel by Dan Brown. Starring Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina, Jurgen Prochnow, Paul Bettany & Jean Reno. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>Harvard Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is making a scholarly presentation in France when he is suddenly interrupted by Inspector Fache (Reno) of the Paris police. They go to the Louvre where Langdon's friend and colleague, museum curator Jacques Sauniere (Marielle), has been murdered by an Albino monk (Bettany). Before he dies, however, he manages to carve religious symbols into his skin and scrawl anagrams on the parquet floor with his own blood. Also at the scene is the department's Cryptologist, Sophie Neveu (Tautou), who warns Langdon that Fache is about to arrest him for the murder. The two escape and begin a complex quest to find the meaning of Sauniere's symbols, the identity of his killer, the mysterious men he works for and the location of the ultimate Macguffin: The Holy Grail.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 2 1/2 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS<br/><br/>Opus Dei is a Catholic organization, like the Knights of Columbus. But instead of sponsoring bingo games and holding raffles, they evidently busy themselves with 2,000-year old conspiracies that involve Albino monks, shadowy Cardinals, the Priories of Scion, Knights Templar and, of course, that naughty Mary Magdalene.<br/><br/>Because of its highly symbolic and mysterious liturgy, and because it is the oldest continuously operating institution on earth, the Catholic Church is an easy target for conspiracy theories. And some feel that this movie, and the pot boiler of a novel upon which it is based, might give offense to the Church's hierarchy. The truth is, the plot is far too ludicrous for anyone to take seriously. The group that should be most upset are art historians, who may cringe when McKellen's character manipulates Da Vinci's The Last Supper as though he were using the latest update of Photoshop.<br/><br/>But a preposterous plot can be overcome by appealing actors portraying characters who involve us in the action. This is nearly achieved by the supporting performances of McKellen as the eccentric liturgist, Reno as the suspicious cop, and Bettany as the creepy Albino. But ultimately it is the leads who let us down and fail to provide the steam needed to keep the pot boiling. Tautou tries hard, but Hanks is far too remote to even register as a complete character.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is brilliant, with fascinating European locations, suitably sinister interiors, sweeping cinematography, and sharp-eyed editing. An example of Howard's cutting technique is a chase scene that takes place in the Louvre. As Hanks and Tautou dash through the Da Vinci gallery, Howard cuts several times to details from Leonardo's masterpieces; these powerful images seem to come to life and briefly become characters themselves. The problem, of course, is that inanimate works of art become more fascinating than the living characters rushing past them.<br/><br/>A pretty picture without personality is like Mona Lisa without her smile."

","I read the book and enjoyed it. I thought the character interpretation was fine, but I would have liked to see the same ending as in the book. But I think people should read the book to find out the difference not for me to divulge it here.<br/><br/>But basically, the cinematography was special, and it was a fine example of how a complex book story line can be converted well into a film script.<br/><br/>And for all those doubters most of Dan Browns explanation of the feminine sacred is actually historically correct. Regarding what the church chose to publish in the New Testament. Search for St.Marks Secret Gospels on the Internet and see what you think too? Except Constantine the Great actually was never Emperor in Rome as such he headed Constantinople and started the Greek Orthodox church more than the Roman Catholic. There was a schism and power struggle between the two at one stage.<br/><br/>There is a St.Mary Magdalene church in UK, in Launceston,Cornwall, where Mary is annointing Jesus' feet. Dates back to 15th Century tower and 16th Century church."

","Interesting subject matter and gorgeous set pieces can't change the fact that this was a pretty dumb movie.<br/><br/>There were actors - there were some pretty amazing actors - but not much acting. Furthermore, outside of Dan Brown's carefully thought-out novel, it doesn't seem like there was a lot of actual writing done either.<br/><br/>Much research went into the historical references. Not much went into decent storytelling or convincing film-making. It's more like an essay on the history of religious symbols disguised as a movie, than an actual movie. If you're making a thirty-minute TV documentary, then that's one thing. But if I'm paying $10 to see this in a theater, or $4 to rent it, I want something better acted and written.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" wasn't particularly entertaining. It wasn't anything.

","With a Dan Brown novel you can put it down before going to sleep - and maybe that's its greatest attribute.

A faithful adaptation of the novel - faithful in a Harry Potter way; it's all in there whether it's good or not - but with such a clunking script it defies description. E.g. Tom Hanks: ""I need to get to a library. FAST."" Bad enough, but they go by double decker bus! The cast make valiant efforts to lift the thing but without success. Plot point are verbally highlighted lest we should miss them in a kind of Roadrunner/TV Batman kind of way. The whole thing feels like a Sunday night ITV adaptation of a novella with which they try to maximise advertising revenue by spreading it over two 90 minute programmes.

Sir Ian stole the show with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou as bystanders (as it was in the book) as Leigh Teabing and Paul Bettany produced acting displays worthy of any Shakespearean ensemble.

","THE DA VINCI CODE Mona Lisa smiles because.<br/><br/>She knows that the Holy Grail is still missing and Jesus is still a bachelor. Even though Don Brown and Ron Howard have tried very hard to bring to their own conclusion both mysteries.<br/><br/>Although most of the French press at the Cannes Film Festival laugh at Don Brown theory of Jesus being married to Mary Magdalene and have a progeny still living today. Also the Vatican threw a warning to all Catholics, that Jesus was not 'a married man of divine inspiration'. Of course all that controversy suited the movie into bankable publicity.<br/><br/>In my book, the movie is a prime rate political and historical thriller. The acting performances throughout the film are the best seen in this decade. Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon is equal to his talent and credibility Audrey Tautou (Sophie Neveu) is perhaps the talent revelation of this movie with Paul Bettany, as Silas an albinos monk who wears a bloody silica on top of flogging himself to expire his sins. Only Ian Mc Lelland ( Sir Leigh Teabing ) doesn't seem to belong to this story.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is a skilled movie maker. He knew how to weave this very complicated story concocted by Don Brow, a prolific writer who sold over 60 millions of his book THE DA VINCI CODE which became the most sold novel in the world at all time.<br/><br/>The locations are breathtaking and rarely have we never seen such of powerful locations on the silver screen. The photography and the editing are Oscar material.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book and I found easy to follow the complicated and fast story line. But if you pay attention and get involved in Sophie Neveu and Robert Langdom chase you grab the spiritual force behind this great picture.

"Frogfisher","9","4","8","1 June 2006"," Solid and entertaining...
","Now I'm one of those people who loves the book mostly for the subject of the mystery.<br/><br/>And therefor I simply had to see this movie. <br/><br/>So should I make the usual comparison with the book or just review the movie? <br/><br/>I always try to make the best of a movie for what it is. And in this case the word ""thriller"" usually is attached to the movie... but as I see it this movie is more of an adventure movie... with a more realistic background than Raiders of the Lost Ark and Tombraider... but the story is still a treasure hunt. <br/><br/>The character work is not superficial but not that deep either, some efforts have been made to develop our main characters, but nothing big. This is probably an effect of the clearly much discussed storyline. Silas and Bishop Aringarosa is where Dan Brown himself have made most back story to show their common background...unfortunately this doesn't get as much attention as Sophie Neveu and partly Robert Langdon. But all characters are believable... and Ian McKellen is a joy as Leigh Teabing. <br/><br/>I for one misses the story line of Silas and Aringarosa and later Captain Fache... there is a lot of good material in this story... Ron Howard has been able to make Silas a tragic villain for sure but Silas's background and why he suddenly is the loyal servant of a bishop doesn't make it... I would love to have seen more of this... and the line ""I'm a ghost"" could have been used more as to show this difference between his old violent self and the new ""angel"" self. And the last turn of betrayal by Aringarosa and Fache turning his back to Aringarosa does nothing to make Aringarosa seem more human and tragic... he becomes more evil. I can understand why Christian would have something against the movie over the book where he is much more human, they make the church seem much more cold and calculating in the movie.<br/><br/>As for story.. it is highly entertaining and well put together. It is actually one of those few movies where we don't end in lose ends. We get a nice closure on most subjects. Akiva Goldsman has been able to write a rather solid script where the important things survives and only useless subjects doesn't make it. we get the story we need, but then again not much more. This is the way a movie work. I feel it is always important to view a book and a movie of the book differently. Some things just needs to be dropped and changed to make it a working movie. And for Da Vinci Code they make it work. <br/><br/>The Length of the film is rather long, but I actually forgot it. The pace of the film is not fast but far from slow... we get a lot of information over a short period but the mood of the film is slow, the ""car chase"" from the embassy where the music and the fast pictures make huge contrast is a good example and I sat there impressed i stead of one the edge of my seat. It is a slow fast movie, unlike most movies being fast. But with a lot of fast movies a lot happens to fast and we get to much information and at one point one sits and things ""when is the movie over anyway?"", in Da Vinci I instead was able to just enjoy the movie! <br/><br/>Over all this is a solid movie for what it is, not as a mind changing movie, but a highly entertaining movie with a story line that just seems to make people go nuts. A shame actually, for once some people ought to see a movie with out making it all real! <br/><br/>It get a 9 from me!"

The actors that were chosen to play the roles of the characters were almost flawless in how they interpreted a particular character's thoughts, feelings, and personality.

Listless and trodding at times big-screen adaptation of Dan Brown's mega blockbuster hit novel about a vast conspiracy involving the Catholic Church, a mysterious murder in the Louvre enlisting 'symbologist' Robert Langdon (a seemingly miscast Hanks who does all he can from being completely lost in the proceedings) and a plucky French policewoman (Tautou) who team up to uncover some hidden truths that lead to deadly outcomes. Filmmaker Ron Howard pulls out the stops but it is Akiva Goldsman's dense screenplay that seems to boggle the globetrotting adventure thriller (which I must admit being the only one on the planet not having read) to engage the viewer in spite of some epic production design and on-locale lensing.

","I'm one of the viewers that had the pleasure of reading both of Dan Brown's novels, The DaVinci Code and Angels and demons. Ron Howard does a good job of keeping the story, suspense and loads of information suitable and watchable for a feature film. I thought Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou did very well considering they had to compromise their acting to perpetuate the flow of the plot and keep the subject matter interesting. Their chemistry or lack thereof was appropriate and truthful to the book. I'm glad Ron Howard didn't resort to any sexual tension between the two, because that isn't what their relationship is about. Tom Hanks proves that he can do the serious high octane subtlety and Ms. Tatou makes a beautiful and appealing leading lady. Paul Bettany (Silas) is terrific as the crazed albino henchman for Bishop Aringosa. My only letdown was the casting of the roles of Fache and Colette. Those French actors didn't do much for me. Ron Howard uses the symbolic messages of history and Christian rhetoric while the main characters narrate their hidden truths. This was done very well and was beautiful to watch. It's also a good way to conserve screen time by cramming a ton of information into a two and a half hour movie. Ian McKellan as Leigh Teabing draws up on his British theatrical skills to deliver a believable character. Da Vinci Code will be most appreciated by those who have read the book.

","I've marked contained spoilers but to anyone who read the book will already know the most controversial aspect of the movie. That Mary Magalene was pregnant with Jesus Christ's baby and that there are living descendants today. Also, there's no historical proof that Jesus Christ is God but the concept of one god has lead to the slaughter of millions throughout the ages. Free thinking women have been condemned as witches for having the concept that god is actually a woman. The Roman Catholic Church have excluded women for being priests and have condemned Ms. Magalene as a whore. What scriptures were not allowed during the tine of Constantine has Jesus and Mary as married.<br/><br/>That is powerful stuff and to have that as the back story of a thriller in which Hanks and Tartou solve anagrams and related clues has had certain groups crying blasphemy. For myself, this is not the first time I've been hit with the Goddess Concept. Living a big city like Los Angeles, one is able to run into all kinds of people.<br/><br/>I love seeing the influence of other directors and how they impact those like Ron Howard who in turn will influence others. I saw very recently ""A Very Long Engagement"" which starred Tartou searching for her husband during the first world war. That director, Jenet, like using voice over while displaying what is being referred to. This story telling technique was quite evident in Truffaut's ""Jules and Jim"". Howard's use of it makes the exposition of the back story quite a feast to watch. One gets glimpses of Constantine's court, the Crusades, etc.<br/><br/>Akira Goldman's screenplay does capture the whole story of Dan Brown's book. The lighting of letters as Hanks deciphers the anagrams recalls his and Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"". The effect is quite visual and recalled images of Langdon's (Hank's) mind does help immensely in pushing the story forward.<br/><br/>Ian McKellan has the best role, that of Teebing. I generally pleased with everybody, Jean Reno acting with the same quiet intensity as Robert DeNio, Paul Brettany as the crazy monk. I love movies that have a shared male/female protagonists and Hank and Tartou do not disappoint, underplaying their roles as they were required to do.<br/><br/>Opie Cunnigham, you did it again. You made another movie that I most likely will see again and again."

The music really helps the movie along. Overall, a great movie well deserving of a 10. Those who give bad reviews just don't want you to think about the ""message"" it delivers."

","I went to the film to see what all the fuss was about. I just about burst out laughing in the early scenes when I realised this James Bondian film was being taken as actual fact by some people.<br/><br/>The evil, handsome, masochistic, religious nutcase, almost albino monk Silas, played by Paul Bettany, ranks up there with the best of the Bond villains.<br/><br/>The Lourve in Paris dripping with French flavour and French dialog gave it that snazzy, international, ultra-wealthy, Bondian flavour.<br/><br/>Ian McClellan, as a grail scholar, was a hoot to watch and a treat to the ear to listen to, especially his line ""starting with him"".<br/><br/>The movie had more plot twists and double crosses than an Agatha Christie mystery. You never knew who the good guys were even after the movie ended. I have never seen a movie with so many competing sets of villains, each of whom is convinced he is the good guy. You experience the movie from the point of view of the bewildered Tom Hanks, a mild mannered university professor swept up into the supercharged world of Christian fanaticism, where faith justifies any crime. Hanks seems to be saying over and over to himself ""What the heck is going on? Who ARE these people? Why are they doing this?"" This echoes your own bewilderment. However, the bewilderment is not merely irritating, but tantalising. You figure that any moment you will figure it out.<br/><br/>The reason the movie is controversial is that it puts not only individual Christians in a bad light, but the entire religious establishment. Both the ""heroes"" and ""villains"" are equally nuts in this movie, fueled by ridiculous self-righteousness and exaggerated importance of trivia.<br/><br/>To me, it was absurd people would kill each other for centuries over a difference of opinion whether Jesus had a daughter born after his death.<br/><br/>The rather strained narrative sections use a novel cinematographic technique of showing history reenacted in a surreal sort of hologram, with a cast of thousands. Christian viewers had their noses rubbed in it as Hanks and McKellan reviewed the dark side of the history of the church, though Hanks lies in claiming science supports the existence of a historical Jesus.<br/><br/>I found myself wanting to shout out to the actors to ""look out"" since again and again they took no precautions whatsoever as danger closed in on them. It just about drove me crazy how many times the protagonists were such dolts when it came to self-preservation.<br/><br/>Many things rang false to the point of being silly, e.g. the use of Halmark Greeting Card English on supposedly medieval Italian artifacts, and the initial premise, that a dying man would spend his last hours composing an elaborate religious treasure hunt for his granddaughter, starting by carving clues into his body, or the utter lack of security on the famous paintings at the Louvre.<br/><br/>There are some delightful politically correct touches, such as the advantages of the tiny Smart car, and the use of penis symbolism in the military.<br/><br/>It's a long movie, but you won't be bored. Just the locations/sets alone are enough to keep you entertained.<br/><br/>There are a few realistic scenes of ritualistic self flagellation and mutilation. I had to look away. If you take young children, take appropriate precautions to avoid terrifying them."

","One must remember to suspend your disbelief when watching movies. I haven't read the book and I was totally sucked in by the wonderful story telling of Dan Brown and the movie making of Ron Howard. Even if the subject is somewhat controversial. One should remember that it is, after all, a story based loosely on historical fact. Much as the bible is also a story and is based broadly on historical fact. <br/><br/>At issue is the theory that Jesus may have been married and had offspring. This single theory is skillfully interwoven in the plot line of a romantic who done it that is exciting and thought provoking even though it is somewhat predictable from the beginning. Even with it's predictability, it is still a movie that you should Run to see movie, get some pop corn and an overly expensive beverage and enjoy."

","Ron Howard and his cast gave me the chance to have, once again, some of the guttural quivers that I experienced when reading the DVC. It was exciting to see my wife enjoy this thriller as much as I did. Whether or not Jesus has descendants amongst us is not a problem for this one-time Baptist Minister.<br/><br/>I find it almost oxymoronish that many must find Jesus to be God for their faith's confirmation. My reasoning is that for Jesus to have been the adequate sacrifice for all human sin, he would have had to be perfectly and literally human. If he were Deity, the sacrifice is totally incongruent.<br/><br/>I have written an article that treats a view of Jesus that might be thought provoking for the less timid souls. It is called.

","I'm a stickler for detail and I hate when books are transferred to movies and parts get changed for no discernible reason other than 'the director thought it looked good'.<br/><br/>Happily Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman have not done this. Yes one or two small changes took place, which I felt was a shame as one in particular (the outer cryptex code being Sofia) strengthened the idea of her grandfather's love for her.<br/><br/>Acting: Tom Hanks: Not my personal choice for Langdon. However he is an accomplished actor and performed well enough to appease my disappointment.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou: Superb. She was Sophie Neveu to a T. Having thought of other actresses I now cannot imagine Sophie as anyone else.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany: Silas Lives! Bettany brought the whole range of emotions of Silas to the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>Jean Reno: Well. What can I say? Another masterful performance, even if some will say 'type-casting'. He was great.<br/><br/>Sir Ian McKellen. As always a pin-sharp accurate performance by one of Britain's finest actors. I was initially concerned at how such a well built actor would portray a man crippled by polio, but as always Sir Ian rose to the challenge.<br/><br/>Script: Absolutely perfect. Faithful to Dan Brown's original in virtually every aspect.<br/><br/>Locations: We all know St Paul's refused permission to film inside, but to be honest it made no difference.<br/><br/>On the whole a really cracking movie whether you ignored the book, glanced through it, or made yourself an expert in the time between announcement of the movie and its' release."
"cjma2004","10","4","8","25 May 2006"," Loved it!!!
","I loved the movie! To those ""critics"" that have said that Tom Hanks gave a ""wooden"" performance....Did they even read the book?!?!? He's playing a professor, his character is not supposed to be ""lively"", or ""animated"" or whatever. Anyway, it was a very good movie. I read the book, have seen the movie, and loved them both. Neither of my two teenage sons have read the book, and they loved the movie as well. Also, they had no problem following the movie; which proves to me that reading the book is not necessary. The movie does a great job of explaining and ""illustrating"" whatever background is necessary and important to the story. Awesome book, awesome movie!"

","Forget what some of the critics have said..Da Vinci is exciting,action packed and beautifully photographed. I did not read the book therefore the surprises were genuine for me. If it is controversial for some it is also thought provoking in as much as the premise is something we may never really know. either way, I found it fascinating and millions of others will too. Would it be so terrible if all this were true?..I have visited Ireland several times and clearly noticed that many of the churches were named after female saints..there were at one time..2-3rd century a woman bishop..women led the church. St. Patrick was sent there to change all that..not the silly snake story. A learned clergy friend of mine has told me of his studies and this has been documented..hidden ..but verified."
"indie04-1","Null","4","8","25 May 2006"," Very well done
","I think it's quite a good film and I don't know why the critics didn't like it. I hadn't read the book and it was gripping from start to finish. There was never a dull moment and the pace was even too fast at times, before the brain had had the chance to absorb all the new concepts and for emotion to arise and subside.<br/><br/>If one really allows oneself to think, the scenes that hinted at Mary Magdalene carrying her precious burden, fleeing from persecutors were very touching. So were the brief scenes that hinted at the witch hunts that put thousands of women to death soon after the Catholic church came to power. There was hardly any time to let the emotion of that sink in, before we were onto the next scene. This is not a criticism, just to say that a lot was packed in a very brief space amount of time in the film and the pacing was just right to hold the attention of the audiences.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks had a very cerebral role and I think he did a very good job. I don't know how else he could have portrayed all the inner workings in the mind of his character. Teabing was an eccentric, so it was easier for Ian McKellen to bring lots of spice in his portrayal.<br/><br/>I think Audrey Tatou was a very good choice. I just think that her hair was too stiff and she had on too much make-up. A more natural look would have been better for the kind of character she played.<br/><br/>Dan Brown deliberately ended the book where he did. Now it's up to us to think what we want and to discover our own potential. If one man can reach certain heights, so can all of humanity."
"dfranzen70","7","4","8","23 May 2006"," Entertaining if controversial
","Unless you're the kind of person whose faith is so unsteady that a mere Hollywood movie can shake it, you'll probably find much to enjoy in The Da Vinci code. It has a bona fide leading man in Tom Hanks, a cute French femme fatale, a centuries-old mystery, and Gandalf/Magneto/Ian McKellen. It's longish, and perhaps a little overplotted (though not for the millions who've read the book on which it's based), but when it was over I felt satisfied that director Ron Howard had gotten it right. As usual.<br/><br/>The curator of the Louvre is found murdered, but before finally expiring he leaves a cryptic message in his own blood that induces Chief Inspector Fache (Jean Reno) to contact a visiting Harvard scholar, Robert Langdon (Hanks). Fache thinks the message indicates Langdon's guilt regarding the murder, but another officer, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) feels otherwise. What was the curator trying to say? The chase - and effort to prove Langdon innocent leads the duo around Europe, immersing them deep in the legends of Jesus Christ, the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, and Mary Magdelene. It's important to remember, though, that the book on which this movie is based is a work of fiction. For the learning impaired, that means the author makes no claims of authenticity - the storyline has been concocted for the purposes of entertainment.<br/><br/>Along the way, Robert and Sophie meet up with Sir Leigh Teabing (McKellen), a Grail scholar/devotee/nutcase. McKellen spins a yarn about what everyone's really after, managing to deal a couple of serious blows to the basic tenets of Christianty as we know it in the process. And no, of course I'm not going to note what those surprises might entail, although by now most people have an inkling or two.<br/><br/>While Robert and Sophie struggle to find clues regarding the curator's murder - and clues pertaining to the Grail itself - other, more sinister forces are afoot. An albino monk (Paul Bettany) has the mission of finding the location of the Holy Grail - and then preventing at all costs anyone from ever finding out. Then there's a semicorrupt bishop and the Pope, but they both just have cameos. Not the real bishop and Pope, though; that would be quite the casting coup.<br/><br/>Hanks is well cast. If we're to believe the rumors, Bill Paxton was Howard's first choice. If you're Tom Hanks, how do you deal with your favorite director wanting Bill Paxton over you? It's gotta hurt at least a teeny bit. On the other hand, Tautou was chosen instead of some pretty strong competition, like Sophie Marceau and Julie Delpy, and she has excellent chemistry with Hanks. They're not supposed to be lovers, just two semirandom people thrust into increasingly odd situations. Both roles are well written, and the actors are well up to the task.<br/><br/>As good as Hanks and Tautou are, though, McKellen is extraordinary, owning every one of his scenes. Sir Ian has given plenty of commanding performances in recent years, and although this one may someday be dwarfed in retrospect by the roles of Gandalf and Magneto, it's no less compelling.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci code is perhaps even better than the book, because the book wasn't terribly good. A riveting, well-paced religious-mystery/thriller is supplemented nicely by a fine cast."

","This spectacular film might turn out to be Ron Howard's magnum opus. Certainly it's his best piece of work to date and stands head and shoulders over anything he has thus far done, a body of work that is by and large quite good.<br/><br/>A mixed genre murder mystery, political intrigue thriller and drama woven into Catholic Church religionist mythography The daVinci Code is a physically beautiful film, graphically eye-popping with an excellent music score, superbly filmed throughout England, Scotland and Paris there's enough eye-filling scenery here to alone cover the price of the ticket. The nicely woven script engages from the very first scene and remains gripping to the stunning, final half hour reveals that are tiered like a wedding cake. There are, of course, some contrivances knit into the continuity but one can easily forget them and simply enjoy the film.

","The DaVinci code was a solid remake of a thrilling book. It has been held up to a standard far too high for a film of this sort. The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, although a fascinating and exciting novel, is far from a Pulitzer Prize work of literature. Thus, the movie created in its wake, should be held to a similar standard: a mystery thriller. As far as a thriller goes, the DaVinci code is fabulous, on par with many of the motion picture remakes of Stephen King novels. The movie tactfully depicts the author's intricate and captivating novel and is exciting to watch. The DaVinci Code is not an Oscar winning piece, but is that an appropriate expectation? Taken for what it is, a fun, interesting, and exciting journey through history, the DaVinci code is a good film and is worth watching."

","The Da Vinci Code is a great movie to start the summer off with. Respects the storyline of the book, with one or two changes or omissions (but hey, as it was it lasted 3 hours, so...), but overall, everything is pretty much as one would have expected it to be when reading the book, it's fast pacing, twist turning, and fun, filled with good historical details and conspiracy theories that are not necessarily true (most have been talked about for many years, many many other books and other movie (such as Last Temptation of Jesus Christ). Personally, I love the ideas it presents, the idea that Jesus was a man like every other, who loved and lived, who had a life makes everything so much more real than what I've been taught my whole life. Added to that a gorgeous French and European backdrop, conspiracy theories of the church, secret organizations with famous intriguing members, all add up to what I think are 3 very fun hours. Also, good acting on behalf of all actors. Never really understood all the criticism, considering after all that this is a work of fiction, both book and movie!!!!!!!) No one has said that anything presented in the movie is the absolute truth, so just go and enjoy it as what it is... a very entertaining and engrossing movie, specially for those who love treasure hunts and the such.

"reidster21","10","4","8","21 May 2006"," An extremely well made film
","The task that Ron Howard was given--to explode the truth onto the world--goes off without a hitch in this movie.<br/><br/>I have seen many critics of the book and the movie bashing it for its long run time and because of the fact that in certain parts it feels boring. All I can say is blame the author, not the director.<br/><br/>This movie follows along with the book in a very accurate fashion--the changes that were made were mostly made out of necessity. The many twists and turns will leave a former reader or virgin viewer on their toes. Hanks proves to be an excellent casting choice for Langdon, Tatou plays a very convincing Neveu, but the two best actors in this movie by far are the gentlemen playing Leigh Teabing and Silas. Ian Mckellan cements himself into the cast of one of the greatest actors (in my opinion) ever to hit the screen in his extremely convincing performance.<br/><br/>Don't let the controversy or critics mislead you--this movie is excellent. I am Christian and found nothing about it to be offensive. The historical references were accurate, the fictional parts were clearly fiction, and the whole movie combined together to be one of the most entertaining pieces of pop historical fiction I have ever seen.<br/><br/>That being said, this is not something that a closed minded viewer would enjoy. If you are easily offended (I am not) or overly manipulatable, this probably isn't for you. However the overall rating people have been leaving for this movie does not accurately reflect the brilliance of this movie's creation.<br/><br/>In order to accurately assess the quality of this movie, I rated it based upon the idea that it was its own individual artistic creation completely separate from the book.<br/><br/>This is like Indiana Jones ""The Last Crusade,"" only a lot more real, a lot more intellectually stimulating, and with a hint of mystery. Go forth!"
"Beckalina7","8","4","8","21 May 2006"," What's your problem?! I really enjoyed DaVinci Code the movie
","I read the book. I read Angels & Demons. I don't think Brown is the world's greatest word-smith, and while reading both I often questioned the plausibility of some of the situations. But he does know how to create a page turner and expose the reader to an amazing travelog and awareness of historical art, architecture, facts AND - MYTHS. It is a NOVEL. Those who are so threatened by the tale need to get over it. How much of our literature and movies are twisted and turned to make an exciting story? Most of it.<br/><br/>Now to the movie --- I thought Ron Howard did a beautiful job telling the tale of the book. He didn't leave out anything too important. What - you want to sit there over 4 hours? My son didn't read the book - and he was able to follow the plot. The story has wild twists and turns. It is fast-paced. But I thought it was well told and I especially liked the way they superimposed other images - often historical - to tell the back stories. There were actually some things I better understood after seeing the movie - like the motivation of Remy Jean.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou was captivating and Ian McKellen was a perfect Sir Teabing. The big reviewers are criticizing Tom Hanks for being boring. It is one of his more subdued performances, but I didn't find him dull. And the portrayal of Silas actually brought more understanding to his actions and devotion to Opus Dei - rather than presenting him as a one-dimensional villain.<br/><br/>I am personally not threatened by the thought that Christ might have been married or had a child. Over the centuries a lot of our church doctrine was decided by men controlling things in a back room. I was actually surprised at several points in the movie where Howard especially brought out statements that one's faith should not be diminished by what was being revealed in the plot. But those with closed minds about this NOVEL aren't going to appreciate any of this.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the scenery and viewing the historic sites. I sat through the entire movie, not wanting to miss a moment. No potty or snack breaks during this one. So I don't get the complaints about boredom. I'm ready to go see it again. Don't get turned off by the naysayers. Especially if you read the book, I think you will be pretty happy.<br/><br/>Now if they ever try and do a movie of Angels & Demons -- I think that will be a crazy one. The twists and turns are much more unbelievable and implausible!<br/><br/>Addendum: After reading the mass of negative reviews on this site - I'm guessing a conspiracy by the ""religiously offended"" to blast this movie here and wherever they can. (And for the others, with their snobby and blasting criticism -- I wish they would name what they consider a GOOD movie - so we can put their criticism in perspective!) Wonder how many blasters actually even saw it. One woman picketing a theater in Chicago was quoted as saying she was so upset about the blasphemy of Jesus having sex - and if they say he had sex - then every kid will think they can have sex with anyone! Great connection. The movie's theory is that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene in a loving relationship - not someone who slept his way across the holy land! Folks - you are out of control!"

Each to his own, without saying, but the audience at the packed screening I attended appeared to uniformly lap up this terrific thriller. Such a marvelous conceit for a story, and surprisingly well executed by Howard. Are our collective attention spans really so dire that hearty discussion of ideas feels like 'excessive exposition'? There was nothing at all languid about this piece. Howard actually harnessed the visual form to make 'history come alive' as it were. Earth shattering, no. Thought provoking escapism, yes. Huzzah team and huzzah Brown!"

I doubted Tom Hanks after the slamming he took and was very pleased to see ""they"" were dead wrong.<br/><br/>Is it, perhaps, the religious right that is doing most of these reviews? I am serious. I am able to discern for myself that this is FICTION and why do people always think we cannot handle deciding the truth on our own? People who cannot figure out that this is novel of fiction would most likely not even be interested in it.<br/><br/>That said, if you haven't read the book, you are in for a great ride. If you have read the book you will be surprised at how well it goes over."
"lallamavolador","8","4","8","20 May 2006"," Excellent movie
","The reason many people do not like the movie is because it discusses history and requires thought, but it is quite a magnificent movie. At first I was unsure if Tom Hanks was going to be able to pull of the character of Robert Langdon but in my opinion he did. I do admit that you do need to read the book in order to fully grasp the concept of the movie. I understand that they needed to condense the movie in order to keep it from being too long. I think they did the movie perfectly. The movie was very well done and the acting was superb. My suggestion to anyone watching the movie is to read a spark notes version of the book, it would help you keep track throughout the movie.<br/><br/>To all the people that say it was boring I beg to differ. It was an interesting story and the concept that are brought up are quite remarkable. I was interested during the whole movie and so was my friend that never even read the book. My friend loved the movie. Just pay close attention to details and you will understand and catch on with the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>The concept that I love about the movie is how everything is not right in front of you like ordinary movies, the movie makes you think things that you would have never pondered, it leaves the mind open to imagination.<br/><br/>Ignore all these reviews, if you have a bit of class and a mental capacity higher than the average teenager I promise you will love this movie."

","Dan Brown's book is a very gripping one. And the film based on it is made in a good quality way with the great actors. I heard that it's not interesting for those who have read the book. No, the film caught me from the very beginning and didn't release me till the end although I've read the book both in Russian and English. Someone wrote in internet that the both of the main heroes are sexless - no sexual feeling aroused between them during the whole plot. But they are dogged by the police, they have to solve one puzzle after another they come from different worlds and the only thing which is united them is the Saint Greal. The authors of the film are also condemned in long and dull lecture about the history of Christianity etc. My husband told me that he would be glad if they told a bit more about all that as he had heard a lot of new things and it was made rather gripping in the film the whole that scene in Teabing's house. And one more thought. How can the book or the film damage the basis of Christianity? They just have raised a great interest to the history of Christianity and to art by the way too. A lot of people try to read more about the subject, to see the pieces of art in original and to know about the artist much more... I liked the film and would advice to see it. The actors are great and the producing is not bad too. Even if the basic idea of the book and the film is absurd (though I don't think so) the authors of the both book and film make us think.

Not much is known about Mary; I doubt many (in the church or not) would be surprised one or the other whether she had children via another man.<br/><br/>It seems more than a small plot problem -- it makes the whole movie not make any sense.<br/><br/>Also, it sounds like the Priory had been trying to protect Mary's sarcophagus for two thousand years to preserve evidence of a bloodline. Did the medieval people think, ""Hey, I bet one day there will be DNA testing...""?<br/><br/>Also, how would you know the body in the sarcophagus is really Mary Magdalene?"

","Hello there, Well where to begin - Not a bad adaptation to film, in fact this is one the few films i have seen where the Director pretty much stuck to the whole narrative structure from the Book. Which is good but i also think he had to do that to sustain the uniqueness of the story. The actors played there parts to the core. I am a great fan of Tom Hanks and seeing him after so long was a Joy, however i did have some reservation on his character because Robert Langdon was much more enthusiastic about this whole dilemma. The other important characters were very much like the people in the book - Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and Paul Bettany (Who was spot on).<br/><br/>The film produced some interesting qualities that the book didn't have Vice Versa such as the exquisite special effects and added Flash Backs and more. They managed quite well to show the whole history behind the paintings, Da Vinci and Jesus Christ. Which would have not been an easy thing to do, because it was a complex story to understand from the beginning. The whole out look of the film was very much the way as i imagined it perhaps because these locations where shot at were actually real places. <br/><br/>It took time to dwell into the film and i felt the film could have been a little fast paced but other than that the film does justice to the book and justice to the screen play. I say the film is Epic in proportion because it had that very olden day touch and large in Canvas feel. The movie is entertaining and worth watching, 9 out of 10."

","First of all I must say I didn't read the book (reading is not one of my favourite hobbies), so I wasn't one of those who went see the movie knowing already the entire story. For me it was all new! The movie wasn't really as I expected, because I thought it would be a lot more around a ""theological discussion"" and not this ""religious thriller"". Even so, the plot is interesting and has great suspense until the end of the movie, when all ""mysteries"" are reveled <br/><br/>Now talking a little more about the Dan Brown's masterpiece itself, ""The Da Vinci Code"", I think what really matters there is that he's trying to change something in history, especially in our Christian societies. We all used to see the Christianity through the point of view of some untouched dogmas. There are some ""truths"" from we can't even have the littlest doubt, because they are just like that, and they will be this way foreverWe cannot change it, because it's sacred, it would be a Heresy! It's called a Dogma, and the Catholic Church has plenty of them. But the Dan Brown's novel tries to change some of these Dogmas, transforming some details of the life of this myth called Jesus Christ. And if he was a human being, with wife and kids, like all of us? Would it change the faith of people? Would people disbelieve Christ's words just because some Dogmas about his life were changed? I don't think so, but the Vatican doesn't have the same opinion<br/><br/>One thing is for sure, ""Son of God"" or ""just human"", Jesus Christ is one of the most important personalities of all Mankind's history. His life changed many things, and it's still being important to many people; so, either we like it or not, Jesus Christ's life will still be discussed, theorized and even ""invented"" (in some details) for many years, as it has been so far!"

","I ignored all the critics who put it down when first released and was prepared to accept this film for what it was: a fun, fictional adventure. Unfortunately, I think that the critics were being rather generous when they gave it a light panning. <br/><br/>My first complaint comes from the unbelievable level of predictability about the story. At the time, I had not read the book, but I knew how it was going to end after about 40 minutes (specifically, I knew which character was going to turn out to be of JC's bloodline). I also picked the twist with Ian McKellen's butler/driver. Just to name a few.<br/><br/>To add to the boredom, the film wasted a lot of time explaining the history behind the grail and explaining who all the various groups were. While this could have been done in an intriguing way, Howard failed miserably. It seemed very confused and ultimately has little impact in the context of the story. The threads simply didn't tie in at the end of the film. <br/><br/>While the film had a broad target audience, it seemed to me to be rather childish. The action and the plot development was simplistic and often silly; seemingly appealing to the lowest common denominator. The fact that this junk was so popular is a sad reflection on our general taste in book/film.<br/><br/>But overall, the MAJOR PROBLEM with this film was that the performances and film generally were completely and utterly humdrum. With the exception of Ian McKellen, none of the cast injected any life into this drab piece of cinema (including Tom Hanks). I blame the film makers directly and I think this is why it has attracted so much criticism.<br/><br/>Even mediocre mainstream films like Flightplan will end up sucking you in for a while. But contrast, I was very indifferent about the Da Vinci Code throughout the first viewing. I didn't find the characters or plot especially engaging and I really didn't care whether I saw the end of the film or not. Kind of film you would flick over after five minutes if you caught it on cable one night. I was disappointed and expected a lot more."

","This movie has been so polemic that I don't know how to start writing about it. Well,I read the book and I liked it a lot. I will not say that the movie was the worst thing I watched in my life, but it wasn't so great as I expected. I know that is impossible to have in a movie all the things that happens in a book,specially a book like the Da Vinci's Code, but the thing I miss the most is the fact that the book helps you think,you find the conclusions together with the characters, while in the movie, everything is just split in your face without you have a time to breath or to conclude anything by yourself. Sometimes, there is a lack of emotions in the movie while discovering some facts, and this doesn't match with all the great suspense and fascination the characters have in the book.<br/><br/>Another thing I have to say is that Audrey Tautou,Tom Hanks and Jean Reno do not match with the description of the characters in the book. (But in Jean Reno's case we can understand a little more why he was cast: his rude manners match with Bezu Fache's) Tom Hanks is too silly to be Robert Langdon, who is a very intelligent teacher from Harvard. Two actors I think were great and look a lot with their characters is Paul Bettany as Silas and Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing.<br/><br/>Ps: Annoys me as Hell to see people who supports this movie to be banned.

","The Da Vinci Code struck me wrong in a few ways, which was disappointing. I haven't read the book and I got the impression that possibly in the book they would have gone into more detail with each of the puzzles. In the movies, the abbreviated puzzles just seemed to solve themselves too quickly.<br/><br/>More importantly, the motivations of the characters kept throwing me out of the movie. Why can't the police manage to capture the heroes? Why are various people trying to ""cover up"" various things? And why preserve a secret with clues and puzzles rather than just saying it straight out? The over-sized subtitles popped me out of the film, too.<br/><br/>So I spent most of The DaVinci Code with my mind on the theater instead of the movie. Also I didn't get a visceral sense for the (no spoilers) family tension plot, the conspirators plot, the father-son badguys plot... for some reason it didn't work for me, didn't draw me in. There was nothing wrong with the acting, I just think not enough time was given to develop the relationships. Perhaps this should have been a 3-hour film, or they should have taken out chunks of the plot complexity so that what remained could have been developed more.<br/><br/>Finally, the central secret of the film seemed sort of silly to me too. It all adds up to not really wowing me.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Fans of the book<br/><br/>-- Anyone else, but only on a rainy day when it's on cable Or better yet, just skip it. 5 out of 10."

","Dr Robert Langdon is a historical symbolist from Harvard in Paris to present some of his work when he learns of the murder of friend and colleague Sauniere, curator of the Louvre. Inspector Fache calls Langdon to the scene under the pretence of helping translate the symbols and text that Sauniere left behind him as he died but really he believes the historian is his man. The police cryptologist does not agree though and she helps Langdon flee the scene and so begins a race against time to expose the identity of the killer and the wider quest for the Holy Grail.<br/><br/>I'm not a snob but when it comes to books I do so little reading that I am pretty selective about what I read and the massive thriller tombs beloved of long-haul travellers and beach holiday makers generally don't appeal to me. Even with all the fuss and hype over this book I never bothered to check it out and when the film came out, all the fuss just put me off. Now that it has safely reached television it arrives in front of me with so-so reviews, lots of copy-cats and several screenings per day  it takes a better film than this to stand up to such once it is stripped of its marketing campaign.<br/><br/>For those caught up in the story then I'm sure that this film will do a sterling job but for me sitting a bit further back from it, the plot is really too contrived and silly to engage. OK, we're not in the realm of the terrible National Treasure 2 here but still I was watching this mostly feeling quite cold and uninterested in the material. Thanks to the budget it looks very good and visually it did make me feel a bit guilty for not being able to take it more seriously but ultimately looks are not enough and the running time is far too long for something so dull that takes itself seriously to the point of being hard to enjoy.<br/><br/>Howard's delivery doesn't help too much as it feels like he doesn't want to make it too exciting at any point for fear of taking away from the ""seriousness"" of the material. So he and his cinematographer make the European locations and religious imagery all very classy and impressive but yet there is little in the way of entertainment or dramatic value. This is backed up by some surprisingly bland performances  particularly from Hanks. He is too soft and nondescript in the lead and his intellectual apathy was another barrier to me being drawn into the plot. Likewise I didn't think that Tautou managed to find much within the character to work with. Reno floats round in the background, Bettany is so-so while names like Molina, McKellen and Prochnow all fill in round the edges without anyone lifting the film to be better.<br/><br/>Overall then this is a very ho-hum affair that failed to engage me even if it was sporadically interesting. The delivery is too serious and plodding considering how silly the vast majority of the plot was and ultimately I didn't find the film to be much cop in regards drama, action, acting or anything really."

"Rooster9","4","5","11","14 November 2006"," Blah: It breaks the promise of The Library Scene
","I once read that there are two surefire ways to kill a movie: drown the production in excess and saddle it with lifeless colors. One producer even went so far as to blame the failure of the Cohen brothers' film ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" on the fact that it was a ""big, brown movie."" Well, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a big, brown movie.<br/><br/>It's a flat, by-the-numbers adaption that sucks the life out of the book (despite its pompous idealizing and overzealous soundtrack). Yes, it captures all the plot points. Yes, it scrupulously honors the book's themes. But in the process of capturing and honoring, it forgets to have fun. Of course the book had some big ideas, but it was all in service of a pulp fiction thriller. The movie forgets its pulp roots. <br/><br/>There are moments that Brian DePalma would have milked for B-movie thrills, that Steven Spielberg would have infused with wit and child-like wonder, that Bryan Singer (as fond as he is of brooding heroes) would have given humanity and a well-deserved shot of adrenaline. This should have been a Saturday matinée serial (the kind which Spielberg and Lucas love so much). And, in fact, the best scene in this movie involves a classic serial moment: The Library Scene.<br/><br/>You know The Library Scene. It happens early in the original ""Lost World"" 1925 film when Professor Challenger reveals that he has discovered dinosaurs in South America and convinces journalist Ed Malone to join him on an adventure to the jungle. It happens in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" when Indy explains to a pair of officials the mystical history of the Ark and the perilous nature of the quest they must undertake. It happens in ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" when John Hammond describes the dark island overrun by escaped dinosaurs and convinces Malcolm to infiltrate it. It happens in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" when Gandalf tells Frodo the mystery of the ring and the terrible journey he must make to destroy it. <br/><br/>The Library Scene may be the most exciting scene in any adventure film because it is so full of promise. It lays out a map of things to come -- danger, thrills and discovery. In the case of ""Da Vinci,"" the Library Scene comes late... half-way through the movie, showing us not just what MAY lay ahead but what we've already missed out on. With the brilliant monologues of Ian McKellen (Gandalf, once again), this movie's Library Scene is tense, involving and full of promise. Unfortunately, the rest of ""Da Vinci"" doesn't live up to it. It becomes too serious, and, in the final scene, ridiculously melodramatic. In fact, that final swooping camera shot displays, quite literally, the fanatical devotion the filmmakers must have had to their source material. Is Tom Hanks on his knees? Is he actually WORSHIPPING Dan Brown?<br/><br/>I didn't necessarily expect Indiana Jones. But I would have liked the filmmakers to spend more time on the drama and the thrills and less time on the ""big"" and the ""brown."""

","It matters not whether you believe in the premises contained in the Da Vinci Code, it was an exciting book. I am so glad I rented the DVD before outlaying real money on either the cinema or buying the DVD. I have not seen such wooden performances or lacklustre direction for a long time. It was like watching disinterested people reading extracts of the book. Ian McKellan excepted, it seemed that everyone involved couldn't wait to get it all over and done with. The lighting was consistently gloomy, there was no spark at all between any of the characters, the camera angles boring and even the backdrops were unimaginative. Films as bad as this depress me."

","Given all the controversy surrounding the film, the end result couldn't help being a disappointment - but, coming from Howard, I had no real expectations anyway! The premise is intriguing in itself - personally, I wasn't bothered by its questioning of Christ's divinity and the possibility that a descendant of his may still be alive - but the plot is simply too complex to be absorbed in a single viewing (I never read Dan Brown's novel).<br/><br/>Reportedly, it's a pretty faithful adaptation of the source material but this results in a lot of padding (too many stops for exposition, including needless character development) and, consequently, gross overlength for what should essentially be a gripping conspiracy thriller. With regards to performances, while I'm not usually a fan of Tom Hanks I didn't mind him all that much here (although his hairstyle was an eyesore!), liked Audrey Tatou and Ian McKellen was typically imposing - but the rest (Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and especially a ludicrous turn from Paul Bettany) were quite boring! <br/><br/>What had been the film's most discussed sequence prior to its release - Jesus' wedding, actually shot in Malta - was barely seen in the released version! I wonder if there was any pressure on the film-makers for this scene to be removed and, hopefully, it will be included as part of an eventual DVD edition..."
"Emmitt_Smiff","5","5","11","29 May 2006"," Quite Frankly, it's just average
","Before I delve into ""The Da Vinci Code,"" it's important to point out two things: I haven't read the book, and I'm a practicing Catholic so I'm quite familiar with the religion's doctrine. Having said that, I have to admit that perhaps I would've enjoyed Ron Howard's film a tad more had I been more familiar with the novel. As it stands, in sheer movie form, the picture is confusing, implausible and, worst of all, incredibly dull.<br/><br/>Despite the presence of A-list European actors, as well as great locations, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is very much Hollywood with its endless car chases, fortuitous coincidences and contrived dialogue. I can see this being attractive on the page since the situations move along quickly and the proceedings take place over a 24-hour period. But in cinematic language, it all translates to emotionless melodrama that is at times too verbose, and at others too earnest.<br/><br/>There's no question that the material is heady and controversial, though many of us are already familiar with the Mary-Magdalene-as-the-Holy-Grail theory from other sources. Harvard University symbologist professor and author Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is lecturing in Paris when an albino monk named Silas (Paul Bettany) murders the Louvre curator Sauniere at the museum. Langdon is lured to the crime scene by French police officer Fache (Jean Reno) because of the bizarre and ""devilish"" messages the victim scrawled on his body before he died. Enter police cryptologist Sophie (Audrey Tautou) who manages to get a message to Langdon that Fache intends to arrest him for Sauniere's murder, and so she helps him escape. As they keep one step ahead of the police and the murderous Silas, Langdon and Sophie use their combined talents to decipher encrypted codes that have to do with an ancient secret society called Priory of Sion, the conservative Catholic sect Opus Dei, and the location of the Holy Grail.<br/><br/>So without a hint of exhaustion, hunger or even a bathroom break, our duo  who barely know each other, mind you  find themselves in an armored truck where they escape, laughably, from their captor (Jurgen Prochnow), and eventually land at the home of wealthy Holy Grail expert Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), and here the proceedings finally get interesting. McKellen delivers the best performance of the picture as he explains how church leaders have suppressed the feminine aspects of religion since the beginning of time, and how the truth about Mary Magdalene's role in Jesus' life could cripple the church. Cool and controversial stuff that is quickly deflated with Silas secretly infiltrating the villa as the police take their time knocking down the gate.<br/><br/>The action then moves to England, but by that time I'm sitting there with more questions rolling around in my mind than answers. If it's all a set-up (readers of the book know whom I'm talking about), why get the police involved? Or for that matter Opus Dei Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina)? Ultimately, it really doesn't matter. The lack of chemistry between Hanks and Tautou, the stodgy pacing and the wordy script has by now removed whatever provocative element promised.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" is essentially just another average Hollywood thriller. Nothing more"
"Doylenf","6","5","11","24 May 2006"," Pulp fiction...ordinary thriller given too much attention because of controversial theme...
","If you approach watching a film like THE DA VINCI CODE as a thriller (and forget all the mumble jumble about the history of the Roman Catholic Church), it works on an elementary level. The background score (a very busy one) by Hans Zimmer gives it the required element of suspense even when two characters are merely giving you a lot of exposition to make the plot easier to follow.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it would take someone more familiar with this material to truly enjoy the movie as a serious look at the dark side of Christianity and its symbols that never quite make complete sense. And so, I will review the film on the level of a thriller that has added a controversial theme to attract a large audience ready to put on its thinking cap and at least ponder what might have been.<br/><br/>Ron Howard has seen to it that the controversial elements have been toned down considerably from the book, without eliminating them entirely. But on the debit side, most of the photography is too dark (intentionally so, I presume to keep an air of mystery going), the explanations come at a slow pace but there are too many to keep the plot from moving forward the way it should in a thriller of this kind, and the acting is, for the most part, not extraordinary.<br/><br/>TOM HANKS gives a very understated performance in a role that is, for the most part, rather bland. He plays the role straight, without any emphasis on his lighter side, but one almost wishes for some trace of wit or humor in the role. His French cohort AUDREY TAUTOU has an accent that makes some of her key words undecipherable (at least to me) in a film where every bit of relevant material needs to be handed to the viewer who wants to catch all the clues.<br/><br/>Only Ian McKellen sparkles in a supporting role, bringing flashes of humor and intelligence to a well-written role. Alfred Molina as a Bishop has little opportunity to be more than slightly interesting. The most striking and intense supporting role goes to Paul Bettany as Silas, the albino who has his own interpretation of what he must do to please the Lord. He has a few masochistic scenes that dole out the required chills and he has a look of quiet menace and desperation in his eyes.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say this should please readers of the book. Howard has done as good a job as possible with the bulky twists and turns of the novel and translated a popular work of pulp fiction into a movie that will undoubtedly be seen by audiences looking for a summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Summing up: A good workmanlike job by a movie that really doesn't ask the viewer to take it too seriously. It's more like an espionage thriller with a dose of religiosity thrown in."

Similarly, I thoroughly enjoyed how Ron Howard slipped some of these same updates into the movie, using both sides of the arguments at times to highlight the reality that there is a lot of disagreement over truth, fiction, and leaps of reasoning.<br/><br/>I wish more movies gave the viewer this much latitude to think independently."

Their on screen chemistry is non-existent, almost as if watching a father teaching his daughter and I think even the latter would be more interesting.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's might do well with feel-good American movies but a European thriller is probably not his thing. Watching the movie feels like I am tourist taking a short cut tour, rushing through all the attractions of Paris and London. And this movie has a typical American blockbuster feel to it (which I hate). I want to feel the awe and wonderment one will get visiting the Louvre, the Saint-Sulpice, the Roslynn etc. It's like a bad tour guide showing you the Mona Lisa and before you can gaze at it, he already moved on to the next gallery. It's almost Mr. Howard thinks nothing of the these pieces of history - he was just in a rush to tell you this great story.<br/><br/>If one didn't read the book, he wouldn't understand the mystery, the enigma, the magnitude of the story, so much so that some audience laughed at the revelation in the end.

","I just left this wonderful film and want to put my unadulterated thoughts on paper-having purposely not read any viewer comments on IMDb. I probably am one of the few in the western world who have not read The Da Vinci Code so I am writing purely about the film I just watched. Earlier in the week I saw another superb movie, The World's Fastest Indian and it too was brilliant but for enormously different reasons-it was kinda like comparing Titian to Picasso-both brilliant painters but having little in common other than the paint on the canvas.<br/><br/>Ron Howard directed a superlative action movie: fast paced, doors that open onto unexpected tangents with unexpected characters, historical depth and unusual motivations. In short, I found the movie a first rate thriller with huge depth and wonderful acting. Ron Howard brought out the best in Hanks, Tautou and especially Ian McKeller. I enjoy visual movies greatly and I thought that Howard used the camera to its very best. There was much camera movement and interesting useful flashbacks at points needing further elaboration.<br/><br/>The visual beauty of the film was enhanced by Salvatore Tortino's beautiful camera work as cinematographer. For some reason, on this film, I noticed the blurred backgrounds of the many closeups called for by Howard-really startlingly beautiful closeups of big shots of people.<br/><br/>Religious extremists will be outraged by the underlying philosophy of this movie but that philosophy plays a small part in the movie. From an anti-religion person like myself, The Da Vinci Code was an excellent mystery/thriller made wonderfully delicious by its subject matter-a two thousand year old mystery.<br/><br/>Now I will read the novel and then go to the movie at least one more time. I have been a critic of American movies in the past, and from today's previews before The ...Code I will remain so, but this film is the exception that proves the rule. Watching, The ...Code was a great experience and I recommend it to everyone except religious extremists.<br/><br/>This morning I sat through The Code again and enjoyed it far more than I did the first time two weeks ago. I enjoyed: Howard's direction even more; I thought his camera angles and shot selection perfectly suited the film; I enjoyed the acting more than at my first screening; I was very impressed with the editing and was most impressed by the script writing after having read the book in the intervening weeks.<br/><br/>All concerned should be extremely proud of their efforts!"

","Although I'm a Christian, I must admit I did like the book. As a work of fiction, I found it to be a fairly good yard - at least for the first part: up until Langdon and Neveu leave Teabing's home, I found it a gripping read. From then on, the book got a bit muddled on its purpose and dynamics and turned a lot less satisfying. A good thing about the film is that it is a lot more constant, in the sense that I didn't feel cheated with this ""second part"" after seeing the events up to that point. The problem is that it is uniform of the wrong side of good, and it all feels too long and drawn out. While I loved Audrey Tautou in ""Amelie"" and ""A Very Long Engagement"", where she played endearing and funny roles, I think she just feels too fragile as Neveu. Tom isn't nearly as bad as I feared as Langdon, but feels uneasy in the part as well (I think someone like Sean Bean would have been better). Sadly, the two of them, while competent, don't spark. And that is really the ""sin"" of the film: it's not bad, but everything about it (the directing, the actors, the screenplay with inevitably too much exposition) feels too safe to the point of being bland."

","Personally, i did read Dan Brown's novel and i found it really interesting. Even though the author claims that some of the facts and events are real, we should not just stay there. Why not start reading the book and get the great things it provides? I cannot understand all the hate. It is a book of fiction we must not forget that.<br/><br/>As for the movie, of course the greatness of the book cannot be put on screen, we all know that! All the details are not included and in some ways the story is a bit confusing-especially if you are not into it(consentrating in the movie). However. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou do their best and that is good spot.<br/><br/>Adventure, action and some suspense scenes takes the movie to another level! I must admit that i was disturbed and thrilled in the same time.<br/><br/>Lastly, we cannot forget the soundtrack and the sound design great Hans Zimmer made for this movie..<br/><br/>I absolutely recommend Ron Howard's adaption.<br/><br/>All the fans of mystery, suspense , conspiracy theories will find this movie brilliant!"

It never stops to draw breath (which may be just as well!) and is decently performed and well directed.<br/><br/>I have two criticisms. One, Tom Hanks seems miscast and, two, the film seems to think it is a lot more significant than it is.

","I haven't read the book. And who would want to after watching this garbage. The DaVinci Code is the Worst Movie I have ever seen. I never felt at any point in the story that I cared for these characters. That I wanted them to find the ""Holy Grail."" I felt no suspense or thrill in this movie. I felt more interested in ""DaVinci Decoded"" on the History channel than this pile of steaming poo. When something is this awful, all i can say is Ron Howard, learn your craft please.<br/><br/>MI-III was not the best script, but the movie was amazing technically and Tom Cruise's performance was top notch. Ron Howard, please pay attention, this is not 1970's- learn some new things please. Learn how to use the green screen, or to move the camera. Please, someone teach this man some craft.

","The Da Vinci Code is a movie that is an adaptation of Dan Brown's bestseller of the same title.<br/><br/>It is a story of Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who was called late at night at the Louvre museum where a curator has been found murdered.Together with French police cryptologist Sophie Neveu ( French actress Audrey Tautou),they solve a series of secrets hidden in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci which may unravel a religious secret that may shatter the foundations of Christian beliefs that has been held by man for more than 2000 years.It basically tells the viewer that Jesus fathered a child with Mary Magdalene and held a family line in France that was kept in secret by the Vatican and the Catholic group known as Opus Dei.<br/><br/>The film softens its religious issues that was described in the book.It never discussed so much about the origins of the bible nor Jesus' divinity.Nobody who watched this film will definitely undergo any religious crisis.<br/><br/>Also,the novel is a lot better than the film.I have to keep myself awake in its 2 hour and 46 minute run.But the visuals were great.It was shot in Paris,London and in Scotland.Great acting too.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was excellent as usual.Audrey Tatou is promising.Despite of its slow pacing brought about by too many talking among the characters,Ron Howard did a wonderful job of directing the film which basically based its most of its plot from the novel.<br/><br/>Unfortunately,the film's script never lived up to the greatness of the book's story in terms of suspense.Anybody who read the book should not expect the same from the film.Highly recommended to anyone who loves good thrillers and who admires Tom Hanks as an actor."
"ac_lumauig","1","2","3","6 March 2011"," NO. Seriously.
","(Is there no 0 or negatives on the vote list?) The movie was horrible. I mean first off: Tom Hanks. Really, Hollywood? This is the thanks Dan Brown gets for his masterpiece?<br/><br/>JUST READ THE BOOK. The movie was really, really bad and did not do the book justice. AT ALL. It was edited to avoid controversy, probably. Seriously. Robert Langdon's character wasn't even portrayed correctly. Horrible excuse for a book-turned-movie title. The only notables were Magneto and Bezu Fache.<br/><br/>On a side note, i'm thinking that the movie was toned down to stay safe, just like how Hollywood refused to show Battle Royale. Come on, when did Robert ever say he prayed to Jesus while he was in the well in the book? PATHETIC. Utterly pathetic. And why didn't they kiss?!?! Where was the chemistry?!? (although my girlfriend hit it right, who WOULD wanna make out with Tom Hanks sporting that ridiculous hairdo?)<br/><br/>Lastly, the last scene sucked. It really did. It lacked the incredible impact of you, after getting over the shock that you're actually chasing after the lost truth about Jesus Christ, after jumping from car to city to country, after almost being shot multiple times, after solving a murder of a famous curator, after effin' realizing that your companion was a descendant of Jesus Christ and she was protected by modern day knights, after finally discovering the grail and being in the presence of THE sought after goddess. I didn't feel it. It may have been the lack of an appropriate build up, or maybe Tom Hanks just wasn't doing it right. I dunno. <br/><br/>Final statement, read the book and stop there. Seriously. The book was great, the movie was just.. Insulting. It gave the audience the wrong idea-- or lack, thereof."

","Loved the book. After reading some of these and local paper reviews, I almost passed on the movie, but went and saw it anyway. I don't understand all the negative feedback. Some of the acting was a bit dramatic and over the top, but so is the storyline. The score was beautiful,I didn't find it to be a distraction (as some have noted)at all. See it for yourself, I think they did a pretty good job translating this complex story without a narrator filling in the blanks. I don't know what people expected, but the script is pretty dead on with the book. Perhaps too much so with regard to the dialogue. Great story, well worth the price of admission."

What an amazing directing and photography work. This is history and adventure, development from the beginning to the end, suspense, alteration of the facts. Over all, never dumb, never boring, so clever! A marvelous thriller, faithful to the book. This work by the author Dan Brown is a superb piece of art and the director, Ron Howard, honored that. And the choice of the actors was very well done: Tom Hanks is a very competent actor, and Audrey Tautou is such a compelling actress. So, this is a very high quality film."

","If you heed the advice given by symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) to Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) mentioned in my summary line above, you should be OK. If you don't, you could get caught up in all kinds of conspiracy theories regarding what happened following the Last Supper and the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Some historians believe the chalice used by Jesus at The Last Supper to be the Holy Grail of Christianity, and I thought this was where the story was going. A cup is mentioned at one point but then it veered off in a different direction. The secret so many people were apparently willing to die for was to preserve the legacy of the human descendants of Christ on Earth, which could only have occurred if Jesus himself had a wife and family and the lineage survived up until the present day. The way the story relates this possibility is intriguing enough, but does tend to confuse with mentions of such occult entities as Opus Dei, the Priory of Sion, and the Knights Templar. The expert on all this was an enigmatic figure referred to as The Teacher, ultimately revealed to be Sir Leigh Teabing, portrayed by the always excellent Ian McKellen. The actor to watch in this piece is Paul Bettany, who's character Silas engages in self mutilation as a devotee of Christ; he's a truly chilling and scary character. There's probably not much middle ground for viewers of this picture, you'll like it or hate it based on the reviews posted here. Once it got under way, I approached it as a mystery thriller with religious overtones and didn't get caught up in the conspiracy angles. It holds a lot more intrigue that way."

They both felt like they aesthetically fit into how they acted. Especially the main female. Something always felt innocent and mysterious with her very dark eyes, fair skin, and speech patterns.<br/><br/>The story itself was a interesting plot to follow and had it's twists and turns. It wasn't anything super genius or anything but it was definitely a well put together story. However, the setting was definitely an interesting setting.

","""The Da Vinci Code"" is the first film from Oscar-winning director Ron Howard's series of adaptations of the Dan Brown novels. It combines elements from all kinds of genres, such as mystery, drama, history and thriller. And it all revolves around the complicated topic of religion. I would not say that I am generally a fan of religion-centered films, but if the quality is good, then I can watch it. And I also like lead actors Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, so it was really high time I would check this one out. But I was very much disappointed. The film tried to be so so much, so epic, so relevant and in the end nothing stayed, apart from the try-hard (that even rhymes).<br/><br/>It was a very pompous film. They obviously put huge focus on costumes, sets, makeup etc. and in the end with the ultimately extremely uninspired writing, this is all that stays. It is a great example of style over substance. A major problem here is the runtime too. The story is rarely convincing and having to sit through this, almost 3 hours, at some point turns into a really painful watch. This film dragged a lot and I would have loved it to be 45 minutes shorter or even more. Not even Tom Hanks, who is always very likable, could elevate the material for me here. I guess, even for him, not every movie can be a winner. So yeah, I certainly do not recommend the watch and at this point I have zero interest of seeing any of the sequels to this one. No idea why they are making new ones even at this point, more than a decade later, unless they really got a lot of better which I doubt. Watch something else instead."

","If anyone thinks this mess of a movie and its poor presentation is a quality film then they are just fooling themselves. It's OK to praise a quality director (which he is) but at least let his latest effort earn that praise. It doesn't make you a true movie connoisseur to rave about an idiotic movie just because huge names are attached. It makes you a pathetic follower who can't use his or her own head and feelings to decide what is good. Forget the individual award nominations that are based on reputation. This movie is just flat out bad.<br/><br/>Though unoriginal in its allegations, The Da Vinci Code proves that some misguided theories never entirely fade away. They just reappear periodically in a different disguise. This movie's claims resemble those of numerous fools throughout history, who have contradicted the united testimony of the Apostles and the early church they built. Those witnesses have always attested that Jesus Christ was and remains God himself. It didn't take an ancient council to make this true. And the pseudohistorical claims of a modern movie or novel can't make it false. That aside, it's just a dull film."

","I just got back from seeing this appalling stain on the toilet bowl of human expression and felt moved to actually write a comment about it.<br/><br/>I should point out that I thought the book was: 1) the most appallingly badly written book I have ever read; 2) fatuous nonsense; and, 3) possibly some kind of enormous joke at the expense of the unwashed and credulous masses who seem to have lapped it up as if they had been presented with the secrets of the universe.<br/><br/>I should also mention that I really couldn't care whether Jesus Christ spawned an army of bastards, it is none of my concern. I am not a Catholic, although watching this film made me want to become one as a sort of protest. <br/><br/>Before I begin reviewing, there is one thing I must, I absolutely must ask. Please, dear sweet American cousins, please understand that there isn't actually a law that requires all Englishmen to drink tea to the exclusion of all else. We do not have members of the aristocracy called Tea-anything. Certainly not Teabing. In fact, in a brief search of the London telephone directory I was unable to find a single person whose name began with Tea. Tea is drunk in this country, it is true. But, and its a biggie, we drink coffee too. Its okay, I know you may not have taken that in, feel free to get your breath back and read it again. That is right, the British do actually drink hot drinks other than tea. Don't worry if you want to sit down for a moment to take that in. There... you have just taken your first steps into a larger universe.<br/><br/>Now that I have nailed my colours to the mast I can get down to the film. <br/><br/>I have read numerous reviews lauding the quality of this film and, despite having hated the book I thought ""why not, this could be okay"". I came out of the film feeling as if I had just been subjected to two and a half hours of cancer delivered directly through the eyes. I would have walked out but somehow I was captivated by it all. ""Surely,"" I kept saying to myself ""nothing can be this consistently abysmal. Dear god, surely not"". I was wrong, it really was THAT bad.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' performance made me think that there was a guy from the Jim Henson Creature Shop behind him desperately manipulating him while Ron Howard shouted ""Quick, move the eyes! Move the eyes!"".<br/><br/>Ian McKellan, usually so dependable, failed to raise the film to at least the stage where I didn't feel like I had just had my brain rubbed down with fine grade sandpaper.<br/><br/>Audrey Tatou managed to look like she had starred in this film while in some sort of drug induced zombie coma. I had heard rumours that Ron Howard was some sort of Voodoo priest but I never believed it until now.<br/><br/>As for Paul Bettany - many people on IMDb have praised him for his role in this film. Playing a psychotic albino monk... right. After all, there are so many psychotic self-flagellating albino monks around to model his role on. I have a feeling that at some point in the future someone is going to interview him about this film and he will say ""Well, you know, I wanted to build a conservatory on my house"".<br/><br/>Fortunately my memory of the film is now starting to fade. I suspect that I will have suppressed memories of the film lurking in my subconscious for a long, long time. There will probably be therapists in years to come sitting people down and saying ""Mr Jones, I have some bad news... it seems that you may have once seen The da Vinci Code."" Before handing out the hankies as the terrified patient sobs hot tears of rage and pain fuelled self loathing.<br/><br/>Here is a quick questionnaire to determine if the da Vinci Code is a film you should see:<br/><br/>[] Do you have one brain cell and are you desperately in search of something to bash it against? <br/><br/>[] Do you think that the Catholic Church is run by space lizards and David Ike really is the messiah? <br/><br/>[] Do you think that the London Underground is a political movement? <br/><br/>[] Do you think the ""Little book of Calm"" is a philosophical masterpiece? <br/><br/>[] Is your primary form of communication a sort of guttural grunting?<br/><br/>If you have answered yes to all of the above questions then congratulations, you ARE the target market for the da Vinci Code."

","Well after all of the hype I don't know what I expected. I know I was disappointed after hearing Tom Hanks was to take the lead, when I read the book I did not picture Robert being anything like Tom. But to be honest, Tom Hanks was the least of the movies problems. I know the story, and I know it is easy to judge a movie as bad after reading the book, so I asked my partner who had not read the book what they thought. She thought it was a let down, not what she expected at all. I asked her if she felt it was suspenseful and she said ""no"". I am fairly easy to please at the movies, but I was very disappointed in this movie. <br/><br/>There was a good story to work with, the book was very suspenseful, but it was like Ron Howard took all of the suspenseful parts of the book and either discarded or downplayed them. The Monk is no where near as intimidating as he was in the book, he came across as a token 'badguy' but quite impotent in his work. The relationship between Sophie and her grandfather, and the cause of the breakdown in that relationship was almost nonexistent and I felt it was an important part of the story. I think Ron Howard thought we would all want to see Tom Hanks overact his claustrophobia throughout the movie (which had no real bearing on the story) than delve into the childhood of Sophie. <br/><br/>Overall I would say if you haven't read the book see the movie, but if you have read the book stay home and rent 'National Treasure', that was a much better version of the Da Vinci Code."

","I entered the theatre excited about this film. Having read the book 3 times, it was a film I genuinely kept track of, and one I've been wanting to see for a while.<br/><br/>I left, however, with a big hole of doubt over whether the film can be called 'good'. It seemed that with the hype, the quality of the content of the book and no doubt the budget Howard had, he's simply buckled under the pressure, blown it.<br/><br/>He frankly could not have put a higher quality cast of actors together. Hanks and McKellen both have fantastic CV's and top films under their belts, but the former certainly for me failed to spark at all. McKellen DID however, produce some good moments, and steals the show in the scenes that he appears in.<br/><br/>I felt shocked that the chance to produce ONE of THE best movies of all time has been blown apart. Part of the problem is how to merge the book onto the screen. When hiding someones identity it becomes difficult on screen, without mentioning the location of something , the book merely says 'he mutters the location', we know it's been said but don't know the actual location. In the film, you cannot hear it be said and it creates problems.<br/><br/>Even though the film was 2 and a half hours long , I felt so much was left out. I was waiting to lean forward and snatch the excitement from the screen, boy, what a let down.<br/><br/>Having Hanks as Langdon was a stroke of genius, had the film worked, I couldn't have thought of anyone who would have been better, alas, it appears he's been wasted.<br/><br/>Only having one Cryptix was baffling when book readers know there are two, even approaching Langdon by the French authorities changed from a midnight hotel room approach to a book signing session. I'm not entirely sure why the latter was needed, as it didn't offer anything else.<br/><br/>The flashbacks in the movie were poor to say the least, not everything was explained, and it had to be spelt out for us in bold letters by the characters eventually telling us what happened. Whilst I'd read the book and knew Langdon was scared of enclosed spaces, if someone could not figure this out, they'd have to wait over 2 hours thinking 'Why did that guy ask for the stairs? A health freak?!'.<br/><br/>Some of the stuff cut out can be excused, others cannot. An entire chapter of the two lead characters buying of tickets and faking a cab was cut, and the explanation of the park with the prostitutes was also left out. More mind numbing though, the three or so chapters in the book dedicated to them figuring out that 'the pope' was not correct and that it was Alexander Pope they were after was figured out in 15 seconds on the screen.<br/><br/>Other ridiculous holes show that Teabling is the 'teacher' 15 minutes before it should have and is in the book, and the characters breeze up to Newton's tomb, completely eradicating the tension in the book of 'will they wont they.' Other basic mistakes include the butler confusingly jumping in too soon at the Knights Templar church and not explaining how the gun was smuggled in.<br/><br/>For all the slaughtering I've given the film, my 2 friends who had not read the book thoroughly enjoyed it no end.<br/><br/>Some parts where good, Silas was freaky(although I thought albinos where suppose to be red eyed, not very light blue?), but yet again his character wasn't fully explained.<br/><br/>The fantastic parts where the 'rollover flashbacks', London suddenly became 15th century in some parts, and Newton's tomb flashes before Langdon's eyes in stunning CGI format.<br/><br/>I felt the end was also a plus, with Hanks revealing the CGI location of the pyramids whilst speaking the words.<br/><br/>Maybe 4/10 is me being harsh, but as a huge fan of the book , I just felt the opportunity to produce something absolutely stunning was not achieved."
"tyrambo","Null","5","12","18 May 2006"," What a draaaaaag. But a nice movie, anyway.
","I've never actually read the novel when I saw this (Which was just a couple of hours ago), so I guess I really can't make a comparison, but I am guessing that the novel was not as slow-paced as this movie. Though some parts definitely were in the booger-picking-bored level, this film definitely deserves some merits.<br/><br/>There's nothing special about the acting, except maybe for that of Ian Mckellen's, but there was just something about Audrey Tautou in this film that I found so magnetic compared to her appearances in other films. Tom Hanks was a little bit more stern here in this movie, but I guess that projected look is what makes him perfect for the film (He always looks like that regular, normal guy who who just happens to get caught up in something - which is exactly the job description for this movie).<br/><br/>Sequencing was very dull sometimes, and some historical cut-scenes weren't as emotionally effective as they should have been. The story in itself was very good, though, and the reason why nobody could sleep on any of the parts, despite it being boring, was that everyone knew something interesting would always pop-out out of nowhere. And they did.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, as well, that aside from a few very gory scenes, some of the claims against Christianity and the Opus Dei may be too much for the devout to handle (But, well, I came in a faithful Catholic, and came out unmoved. The ""blurred line between fiction and reality"" that they claimed about the book was not present in the movie, or at least for me), but, nothing too offensive. In fact, the movie review board here in the Philippines - where the majority of the population are Christians - were supposed to give in at ""X"" rating, but since no clear and direct attacks were made against the Christian faith, only an R-18 rating was given, which I think was very fitting. Why some countries would give this anything less is beyond me.<br/><br/>All in all, the only thing I took with me outside of the theater is the thought that Audrey Tautou and I are unexpectedly meant to be. This was a wonderful film, but nothing I will remember and appreciate beyond a week after viewing it, and probably something I won't pay for again."

","I'm going to be brutally honest here; I never liked the book ""The Da Vinci Code"". It was not the absurd plot or its brazen slurring of religious faith that caught my distaste, as many similar trashy novels have been produced and I have enjoyed them. None of them are especially thought provoking but they provided mild entertainment on long train journeys. However, Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" I disliked mainly because of diabolical rhetorical and linguistic techniques employed by the author. The characters were utterly flat and impossible to care about, in particular the appalling ""British"" upper-class stereotype of Sir Leigh Teabing whose dialogue consists of several ""I say""s plenty of ""Old chap""s and even one ""Tally-ho!"" Like so many American writers and actors he bases his entire knowledge of British accents on ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Jeeves and Wooster"" oblivious to the fact that British people have not spoken like this for one hundred years.<br/><br/>You may wonder why I have chosen to disclose my opinions on the book when IMDb is a film website, and the reason is that I find in order to build up an honest review of the film you must first understand my outlook towards the book. You might think that my distaste of the book meant I entered the cinema with a closed mind, hating it before I had even seen it; however that is not the case. After all, I have already mentioned that it was not the plot or the anti-religious sentiment which I disliked but merely the way it was written. In fact when reading it I kept thinking that it would work far better as a film, providing the script and actors were up to scratch. After learning from the early previews that Tom Hanks, Sir Ian McKellen and Jean Reno were to be in the film I entered the cinema with high hopes as to the success of the film. I was certainly expecting an entertaining film; perhaps even a *good* film. Unfortunately this was not the case The word which springs to mind when watching this film is ""uninspired"". Every aspect of the film reeks of ""dull"" and I spent a great deal of my time watching it checking my watch struggling to keep awake. Aside from the self-flagellation scene performed by Paul Bettany, not a single scene for the film had me on the edge of my seat, for the most of the film I was as far into my seat as it was possible to get.<br/><br/>The script is almost straight from the book, which is not necessarily a bad thing as I have already said, I thought the book could have worked in film format, however when the script is said through actors who just look *bored* it contributes to the bland feel of the film. Tom Hanks' performance is beyond disappointing, having loved his acting in ""The Terminal"" and ""Forrest Gump"" he gives us 149 minutes of yawns. Of course, not all blame can be placed on him as Dan Brown's character of Robert Langdon was such an empty shell in the first place it would have taken a god among actors to fill it. That brings me on to the only redeeming feature of the film: Ian McKellen. I have already mentioned the dreadful stereotype of Sir Leigh Teabing which Dan Brown offers as a ""character"" so for an actor to take that and turn it into someone with a believable, and identifiable personality is utterly incredible acting feat.<br/><br/>Many did not like this film (and the book) because of the daft plot and the anti-religious sentiment, but those two aspects have never stopped a film being dismal before. Films like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" are still enjoyable even with the two factors stated above. The reason *I* didn't like the book and the film was because of the soulless, characterless piece presented. I was hoping for an improvement over the book, sadly I was wrong."
"Galina_movie_fan","3","4","9","13 June 2006"," Wait for DVD:
","There are several serious ""crimes"" in movie making - unfunny comedy, unmoving drama, and non-thrilling and boring thriller/mystery. ""Da Vinci Code"" the movie has committed several of these crimes - as a mystery it is boring, as a thriller, it does not thrill, and its attempt to drama lacks any interesting characters I could care about. I am the last person to believe that the book was a work of art but it was fun to read. It was dynamic, well paced, and it gave (at least it tried) an insight to the characters' motivations and reasons. I don't even mention the references to history, Art, history of Art and religion that made the book one of the best selling works of fiction of all times whether we like it or not. How the movie made of that book happened to be lifeless, slow, and non-involving is beyond my understanding.<br/><br/>If the most alive in the movie is Giaconda's (Mona Lisa's) smile and the rest of the characters all look and move like Zombies; if there is more chemistry and interest to each other between Christ and Mary Magdalene from Da Vinci's fresco ""The Last Supper"" than between Hanks's and Tautou's characters, and if the movie that takes place in the spectacular locations does not even look interesting, I'd say, ""Houston, we have a problem."" My advice to the potential viewers - wait until the movie goes on DVD and watch it then. Meanwhile, read Dan Brown's book."

"benoit-3","3","4","9","21 May 2006"," A very poor and joyless adaptation, probably financed by the Opus Dei
","I saw the film in a packed Toronto house. The crowd was silent and attentive, with the people around me repressing just a few yawns toward the end. <br/><br/>I liked the exposition parts, which gave life to some very involved explanations with the help of interesting low-resolution visuals and historical recreations. But, as a travelogue or illustrated appendix to the book, the film suffers from anaemic colours and pallid photography. A lot of the scenes take place at night or under cloudy skies or in murky indoor locations. Sad to say, but the novel had better visuals...<br/><br/>The action scenes are jumbled and close-cropped - TV-style - so it's hard to get a clear idea of what goes on. In one isolated flash of genius, the film shows an instant replay of what just happened from a different point of view in order to answer questions the viewer might have. It works - as it does in the book - and this technique should have been repeated in other instances, especially after the big showdown in Westminster Abbey, which peters out like a wet firecracker without it.<br/><br/>The monuments shown, whether real or stand-ins, are rarely presented in all their architectural glory even when the camera pulls back for an establishing shot (which is not often). You never feel like you are in Paris or in London. I kept thinking I'd prefer the matte paintings of old to this kind of botched and pedestrian location photography. There is never any sense of awe, wonder, amazement, grandeur, majesty, magic, joy, celebration, mystery, intrigue or emotion and you don't feel the excitement of discovery or urgency, which should be an essential ingredient of any treasure hunt. Howard paints all scenery as well as all human interactions with only one colour: grey. The music is equally lugubrious and oppressive and sounds like it was penned during an acute bout of Prozac withdrawal.<br/><br/>Changes were made to the original story, some of which are justified when they speed up the action, while others are missed opportunities to reprise what worked best in the novel. Especially abhorrent is the change that was made in Sophie's family tree, which can only be explained by a misplaced sense of prudery. It robs the ending of any human warmth and closure. Any hint of sexual attraction between the protagonists has also been surgically removed, so as not to mix s-e-x with all the ""seriousness"" that goes on. The screenwriter has even gone out of his way to not offend any religious sensibilities by planting a lot of ""ifs"" and ""buts"" in every argument and even a discreet disclaimer about the ""Prieuré de Sion"" hoax. From that point of view, the film was made by a yellow-bellied prude hedging his bets at every turn and unwilling to listen to a second opinion. It is so reticent about its own subject matter that it may be suspected of having been financed by the Opus Dei to defuse the controversy. It's easy to imagine Howard wearing a cilice all through the shooting of this picture and taking time out for bouts of self-flagellation in order to remind himself that no despicable fleshly enjoyment at all should be derived by anyone from this picture. It feels like a film about Catholic dogma directed by a Puritan Quaker.<br/><br/>A good part of the film is in French and acted by competent French actors, which makes Hanks' horrible pronunciation stand out like a sore thumb. I mean the guy is supposed to be an international scholar, for Magdalen's sake, and he still takes half a minute to struggle through the words ""Bois de Boulogne"". I guess Hanks' time is too valuable to sit in front of a language coach for half an hour, which also explains why his character acts at all times like he is slightly annoyed because he has other, more pressing engagements and this whole shoot is playing havoc with his social calendar. Audrey Tautou is charming and believable and one feels for her character's many predicaments as well as for the horrible cuts that were made to her back-story. Jean Reno has to struggle with a part that makes him even more of a one-dimensional heel and a chump than his character was in the book (yes, it's possible), while also making him sadistic, incompetent and a gullible religious fanatic, which he never was in the book. Ian McKellen gives his all, as usual, and tries, in vain, to save the film single-handedly. He certainly deserves an honorary keystone. The Silas character (Paul Bettany) has been reduced to a sideshow non-entity trotted around for pure shock value. We never learn where he came from or what the hell that accent is supposed to be (French-Spanish-Latin retard?). His last words (""I am a ghost"") are particularly appropriate since he couldn't very well say: ""Is that all there is to my part?"" <br/><br/>In conclusion, it's an unnecessarily timid adaptation that is more than a little depressing, if not outright morbid, in its delivery. The flashbacks about Silas' childhood and his relationship to his protector, for instance, and Sophie's falling out with her grandfather, are not long enough to reveal anything of interest and only add to the atmosphere of randomness and confusion. I personally did not see where the budget went because it's certainly not on screen, even if all the historical flashbacks were CGI, and some palms had to be greased at the Louvre and Mr. Tom ""Nice Guy"" Hanks insists on a solid gold bidet in his private quarters.<br/><br/>When I left the theatre, the colours of a springtime sunset in downtown Toronto were absolutely breathtaking by comparison. Final thoughts: The book had its faults but it was certainly better than this and that is the only disclaimer that should have been put at the beginning of the picture."

Paul Bettany, on the other hand, played an excellent Silas. His last scene really evoked a sense of sympathy within me and this stayed with me until I read the novel.<br/><br/>The music of this film could have been better, not that it was bad, but it's not something that would stay in your head after you leave the theatre. However, this film, I believe, is not in need of a famous soundtrack, as it is, first and foremost, a film adaptation of an international bestseller.<br/><br/>It is based on a work of fiction, and it is made solely for entertainment purposes, and with that in mind, the film is not at all bad, in fact I must say that I am impressed with its faithfulness to the original.<br/><br/>So, why 6? It is due to the hype generated prior to its release and the cast which one would naturally have expected more. Hanks just did not have anything that would have left me thinking like he did in the Green Mile. Tautou didn't have that appeal that she usually does in her other films. However, McKellen and Bettany were just plain, excellent.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I was enlightened at the end of the film, although I had lost interest half-way..."
"joebloggscity","6","4","9","21 May 2006"," Entertaining and faithful to the novel but sadly much of the puzzle element has been sidelined
","After what appears to be the biggest publicity ever given to any film tie-in to a book ever, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is now in front of us. Masses of newspaper coverage of the ""implications"" of the film have been thrust upon, with the question now if the film in itself lives up to its hype or not.<br/><br/>The film surrounds the chase for the ""holy grail"" by an academic Hanks with the grand-daughter of a murdered museum curator, whilst being chased by the police and an albino monk out to murder them, with ""revelations"" about the Christian faith abounding to surprise us or not! Personally, i'm not going to bother with the semantics of the novel, seeing that as best left to academics. In any case, that is a main thrust to the novel, although I feel it has been watered down for the film which might have been due to the nature of the limited time of a film, but the director does do a good job in compressing the novel into what he can.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in that rather in the novel we are presented with puzzles to join in with the solving, there is nothing of this really in the film, rather the puzzle and solution is a given. Da Vinci also appears to be sidelined, with little examination of his link to the whole issue, as was done in the book, but the main obvious change to the book is that the film appears to back track on the novel's belief that the ""revelations"" are fact! In light of the controversial nature of the book this is probably a good thing.<br/><br/>As for the acting, the roles are genuinely adequately done, with Hanks doing very well. It was never going to be too easy, with much excitement removed by the fact that the book is already too widely read to cause mass shock by its release. Nevertheless, the film matches the book fair enough, and to be honest I think much has been over rated about the book which in itself is no classic piece of literature but is a great thrilling read none the less when you first read it.<br/><br/>Overall, an entertaining movie that is faithful enough to the book, but I miss the puzzle element strongly. Most importantly the film and novel should be taken at face value only. Further evaluation is for a more rigorous academic outpost. For those in the know, keep an eye out for cameos by the templar theory authors in the film. Enjoy!"

And you know it is so frustrating. Then comes the parity. Sometimes it is not even matching with the actual story of Dan Brown! Director will say it is because of screen-play but it is unacceptable for the viewers who have already read it. I guess maximum of you. Then comes the information. If you have not already read the book, simply you will be unable to find out what is Priory Sion or what is Opus Dei! I think Dan Brown himself will be unhappy with this. The movie never reached a thrilling point at all. Lastly, one of my friend pointed it out, which I agree that the chemistry between Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou really didn't work well. Unnecessary importance has been given to Tom Hanks, overlooking Audrey, which really differs from the actual story. But I like Jean Reno (Bezu Fache).

"madmax_thegamer","6","4","9","19 May 2006"," As a book, awesome....as a movie, average.
","One of the bestselling books of our time is making the jump from the medium of print to that of film and attacking theaters everywhere. Now The DaVinci Code may not have been the best work of literature to ever grace our bookshelves but it did hold your interest and keep you turning pages. The mystery was stacked on, the puzzles and riddles the main characters were to solve were detailed and intriguing. The story moved along at a nice clip and you did not really want to put the book down once you were into it. Because you were there with the characters, experiencing what they did, you were part of the adventure.<br/><br/>Sadly, in the jump to film the adventure loses out. Running right around two and a half hours in length, the movie seems to lack something. Perhaps it was all the detail in which Brown explained what was happening, perhaps this story was meant to be told and simply not to be seen. As far as visuals go the movie is gorgeous. Filmed in many of the actual locations you get a nice view of the world abroad. The story more or less make a seamless transition to film with many key instances remaining intact, some were cut for time and others i assume were just cut. There are minor changes from the book but none that will take away from the experience. Summer thrill seekers might be disappointed also, as this movie does not have many gun fights or car chases, the action sequences that are presented are sort of mundane and dull and also short lived. Ticketbuyers searching for a thinking movie will also be rather disappointed, because everything in the movie is pretty much spelled out for the average mind to grasp. No making connections and thinking of things on your own, the path is already laid out.<br/><br/>Then we move onto the actors themselves. Most performances were so so at best, with Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany making their characters stand out the most. Tom Hanks does what he can but just seems to lack something this time out. His Robert Langdon, while not terrible was far from terrific. For me it just seemed to much of a forgettable experience, the action was not as proclaimed as i remember in the book, while some of the humor was removed as well. Perhaps Browns other book featuring Robert Langdon, Angels and Demons, would have made a better movie-going experience. It has more action sequences and just as much puzzle and riddle solving. It however, is not surrounded by the controversy that DaVinci Code is, and perhaps that is what Paramount was banking on. In the end, not a terrible movie but not a lasting memorable favorite either."

Grand daughter of Jacques Sofie Neveu, a cryptologist, is compelled to find the killer and to understand what her grand father was hiding. Helping to uncover these secrets, crippled Leigh Teabing tells of secrets held by the Christian church and the location of the holy grail; the riddle Jacques has left for Sofie and Robert to solve.<br/><br/>With all the hype and controversy surrounding both film and book alike, this screen adaptation Dan Brown's book The Da Vinci Code has suffered. Dan Brown's book has become the highest grossing book of our time, also been attacked against the Catholic church for the theories about Jesus and his lineage. The Da Vinci Code in all was an entertaining page turner, blending fact and fiction, a great farce of a read. For entertaining as the book is, it hasn't survived the translation to screen that well.<br/><br/>With all the facts about art, mathematical equations, secrets sects, religious cover ups, Browns's narrative kept them in a steady flow and had a natural element to them. Screen writer Akiva Goldsman fails to grasp that flow, the interesting facts are awkwardly injected and miss important information about them; probably to make you read the book if you haven't already. Akiva hasn't changed things around, it is a faithful adaptation, but its so straight forward for anyone who has read the book, it doesn't bring any new surprise.<br/><br/>The translation to screen isn't the films only problem. The performance are well under par. Tom Hanks is no where near his best, he nearly wears the same expression the entire time. Audrey Tautou is a beautiful actress, yet she is nowhere near her best. Paul Bettany as the albino Silas just stays off a flat performance. Delivering the better performance, Ian McKellen is the only one bringing energy and enthusiasm to his character Teabing. Jean Reno reforms himself after his terrible acting in The Pink Panther. Alfred Molina is sorely underused as Bishop Aringarosa.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is a disappointing adaptation.

Brown certainly has sparked hefty debates but a film adaptation was always inevitable and when released, it caused as much as a storm as when the book was released.<br/><br/>The storm that came with this in 2006 was an ashamed feeling of disapprove for the way director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman approached this astonishing story. This was banned in numerous countries for its strong opinions and depictions of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene but the uproar came for the film itself. Badly made, unfaithful to source material and atrociously acted and directed, Da Vinci fell into the category of the world's worst blockbusters. Personally, amongst all the negativity, I rather enjoyed watching two fine actors looking to solve a delicate mystery.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that whatever your beliefs, the book is well scripted with a sharp and intriguing motive to keep you hooked right till the shocking finale. Even the long winded debates were interesting as we learnt of different groups in Christianity and the film took all the heavy ideologies onboard in an attempt to portray the book as was written.<br/><br/>At two and a half hours, this film somehow leaves out a vast majority of debated conceptual significance but the importance is all relative come the end. For someone who enjoyed the book, I find the simple explanation as to why this movie ""failed"" is that it leaves out this hefty amount of debate.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was criticized for his blunt performance and sadly, the hype was right. There was no spring as there was in Big, no drama like in Cast Away. From the book, it seemed Langdon was a more spirited soul that exuded adventure but there is something lacking here. Tautou is buoyant and necessarily silent in all the right places gives a good pairing along the way with Hanks; one of the final scenes exceptionally sentimental.<br/><br/>Ron Howard, who was also slated, delivers an unsurprising style of mystery. His continuous use of close shots for unsurprised expressions do nothing to help the feel of the film, which means the reliance is all on the plot, which is enjoyable and still exciting.<br/><br/>Yes, it isn't the book but as with the Harry Potter series for example, we all came to our own conclusions and drew up our own imagination so it was never going to be perfect. Da Vinci Code is a good film with a strong conceptual plot that generates debate and excitement."

","Considering that they were working with a really wordy book, they all did a really good job of telling the story. This is decent entertainment. Forget the hype pro and CON. Go into this expecting an interesting mystery movie and I don't think you'll be disappointed. I never read the book, so I had few preconceived notions of what to expect. I am familiar with all the members of the cast from previous endeavors and enjoyed all of their performances. The backdrops of various cities were exceptional and in some instances, breathtaking. While I don't think that, as a director, Ron Howard will ever attain the skill level of someone like Alfred Hitchcock for this genre, he does a decent job here and displays a maturing of his style as a director. The main characters are supposed to be talkers and brainy debaters. While the actors play them how they should be played. This is a movie where you are supposed open your mind and heart and just think a little. If you want a non-stop action summer movie, this isn't it but is it a bad summer movie ? No not at all. Is it a bad adaption of the Da Vinci Code ? No, it's everything it should be and Ron Howard is very faithful to the book and so are the actors. Newsday also called the film over-scored by Hans Zimmer , I couldn't disagree more. The score is wonderful. This is probably Ron Howards most unfairly hated film since Willow. While reading the book, the ending didn't do much for me but actually seeing it yourself, it's just beautiful and breathtaking and I loved it. So just give this film a chance and don't think it's your job of being a Christian to hate the film, just open your mind and sit back and relax."

","Since this movie was received with negative reviews by critics, I saw this film with so-so expectations. I had only read the book once before this film came out. I must say that people who loved the book will not be disappointed. Tom Hanks, Ian McKellan, and Audrey Tatou were just simply amazing. This is one of Hank's best films ever made. I also give credit to the screenwriters and the director, Ron Howard. Hanks plays Robert Langdon and basically he has to solve a code written just before this guy dies while evading the French police. As I said before, this film is like the book and probably only few more movies will ever get this close to being exactly like the book. I also liked the score. It was pretty good. I rate this film a 10/10."

","I had heard that this film was bad before I watched it, but I tried to view it with an open mind...<br/><br/>My conclusion is that it's an OK film, but only if you haven't read the book. Firstly, because you constantly know what's coming round the corner, so there are no real surprises...<br/><br/>Secondly, because they've condensed a very long book into a 2 hour movie, so they obviously had to miss out several elements of the story... so some things remain unexplained, which is irritating to me since I felt like some details were pretty essential, plus I can imagine it'd be annoying to someone who hasn't read the book, as the story/characters lack the true depth they should have...<br/><br/>And finally, because they change certain elements of the story (for no reason, as far as I can see) which seems a bit stupid since so many people have read the book and will be expecting things to progress in a certain way...<br/><br/>Also there are a few little inconsistencies in the languages used at certain points and I found Tom Hanks' acting quite irritating (but that might just be a personal thing!) So, watch it if you haven't read the book, as I can imagine it'd be reasonably enjoyable... If you've read the book, watch it just out of interest, but don't expect to love it!"

","Terrible adaptation of the well known book. The script just could not figure out a way to translate the book into a story that makes sense on the screen. The intricate details of the book were either skipped or rattled off glibly as badly written dialog. Bad casting of Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno in the lead roles led to acting that range from average to dismal. Hanks looks nothing like the character described in the book and was obviously chosen only to boost ticket sales. He simply falters in this role despite how talented an actor he is. Ian McKellen was the only actor that managed to make his role believable. Ron Howard's self-conscious and clumsy direction weighs the movie down further. Skip it and just read the book."

","I'm agnostic but given that, I am broadminded enough to see how Christians, Catholics in particular, would be highly offended by this movie/story. It portrays them in a very bad light. Personally I don't think Al Jazeera could have come up with a better story line to belittle the Christian faith. Okay, with the offensive aspect of this story aside, this is why I think it sucked...<br/><br/>Maybe I went into this movie with high expectations. Ron Howard directed and produced it. He has a pretty impressive list of blockbuster movies under his belt. Movies like Back Draft, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Apollo 13, Cocoon and Splash to name a few. Back Draft and Cocoon are two all-time favorites of mine. So I thought he would do this picture justice. Ditto for actor Tom Hanks. Road to Perdition, The Green Mile, Forrest Gump and Sleepless in Seattle are some of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>So what in the heck happened here? Maybe I should have read the book and that would have filled in some blanks. Half the time I didn't know what was going on or was just hoping the ""Ghost"" would off another person to get the story going again. Things were waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too drawn out and too confusing. It is one thing to keep the audience guessing but quite another for them to try to guess why in the heck they paid to see this movie.<br/><br/>Unless you hate Christians, I really don't see any reason to see this movie. I'm sure it will go over big in Muslim countries. Now I understand why it pretty much tanked here in the US."

That remains to be seen and yes, the Ron Howard does have it's high points, especially if you didn't read the book, but also exposes the plot holes the book contains.<br/><br/>For example: It's impossible for an albino to be an expert marksman, simply because those afflicted with the condition suffer from bad eyesight. Also, Dan Brown uses theories to support his own conclusions in his book, which at times are flimsy at best.<br/><br/>With an All-Star cast of Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou and Sir.

This is clearly a fictional story and shouldn't be treated as anything else, but if one goes leaves the movie with a clearer sense of their own beliefs, then Howard did his job.<br/><br/>Which is why one wonders why religious leaders are quick to condemn this feature. The questions it raises, brings one closer to his or her religion - Catholic or any other belief - not send someone away.<br/><br/>Overall, this is good entertainment.

"bastiaan0740","6","3","6","9 October 2006"," A bit of a let down
","**SPOILERS!!**<br/><br/>Whilst anticipating the movie, I had plenty of creative ideas of what it would be like. I imagined Da Vinci leaving a giant puzzle, bits and pieces spread throughout all his works, with all kinds of challenges to procure and identify these clues, which would later be pieced together to form a complex and intriguing mystery, perhaps a super-invention being way ahead of its time, all the while being chased by evil pseudo-Christian organizations, gangsters, the police and perhaps entire nations. So I got a bit disappointed with the final result. The cops needlessly keep chasing our innocent hero without really adding anything to the story. There is no real mystery unraveling, in the middle we get to learn it's all about finding a map someone hid in a bank, which is the object of interest for the rest of the movie, a bit of a let down. In the end they find what they're looking for with the map's help, namely learning the true heritage of Agent Sophie Neveu (which everyone in her community apparently already knew anyways) and the location of Mary Magdalene, an interesting historical find but nothing so world-changing to warrant such secrecy and betrayal, and the movie ends. The puzzles limit themselves to a dying man, leaving needlessly complicated clues in his final minutes just to find a well guarded map, protected by a medieval locking mechanism that is supposed to pose a challenge in this day and age. The evil templars apparently send only one single, self-tortured guy to get the job done, later even unable to take on a wheel-chaired man. In the beginning his character and organization seemed to have potential, but at the end he just gets used and misguided and ends up shot. The bad guys have no real interest in finding the 'holy grail' in order to accomplish their own projects, but rather in keeping things the way they were and trying to kill our heroes in order to keep the church' secrets, which downgrades the point of the quest even more. There is some betrayal in the movie from so-called friends switching sides and having their own agendas, but basically these friends help them, switch sides, but it seems to have little influence on the unfolding story. The character of Tom Hanks is given some extra color with having experienced some youth traumas, but it really doesn't add anything to the movie. Also the childhood of Agent Sophie Neveu seems like a desperate attempt to give the character some depth, but at least that ties in to the story. In all, this movie had a lot of potential, but it fails to deliver.<br/><br/>6/10."
"Lyceus","5","3","6","11 September 2006"," Entertaining
","'The Da Vinci Code' was a revolutionary book a couple and a half years ago or so. Although it looks more like a movie script than a novel, and every book written by Dan Brown has the same plot with very few changes, it was addictive and it charmed readers from all around the world. I don't think you can believe anything Dan Brown states, but it's an entertaining book... and so the movie is.<br/><br/>It isn't a great film, but you can enjoy it and you won't feel bored with it. The cast is really good, and I have no complaint to make about it. It's quite accurate to the book; however, I'm surprised that many things are changed. Most of them are just moved from one point of the story to another, but others are harder to understand. For example, Sophie is red-haired in the book, but her hair is black in the movie. There are only one criptex in the movie instead of two, and Langdon and Sophie don't need to visit the library in London because they find everything they need by using a cell phone. The most important omission in the movie is that Sophie doesn't apparently discover her brother is alive. People who have read the book can easily identify him in the movie, he's obviously the young guy at Rosslyn, but this important plot (which is for me as important as the Grial plot) is missing. Another change is that Robert and Sophie's relationship was deeper in the book. The final scene, however, is perfect. This is the end in the book, which I like (although many people dislike it) and it's perfectly depicted in the movie."

","This movie for which the Greek Orthodox Church expressed its' formal disapproval and urged people not to see it, thus magnifying their natural curiosity and making more popular, is a movie I very much liked despite that the opinion of the critics internationally and in Greece was in general negative. I had read the book without which I think is rather impossible to understand the movie. The mental problems of the book have been obviously simplified for the needs of the movie but in general I found it considerably close to the story line of the book. The best actor was Ian MacKellen who was the perfect choice for Teabing. The movie was bringing forth the ideology of the book concerning the hotly debated religious issue whose writer claims that is based on true facts. The movie and the book have generated a huge amount of secondary literature which explores every conceivable aspect of the problem on which no reason exists for to dissertate here. I think that a movie is watched as a recreative experience and not as a medium of expressing views on metaphysical problems which after the French Revolution have become matters for the individual conscience in the Western world at least. As a form of sophisticated entertainment I found the movie very satisfying, shooted in fine locations, involving fine works of art, beautifully built churches, action and surprise, clever dialogue, adventure, timeless and insoluble questions, the city of light= Paris, fine actors- what more do the public and critics want? More explicit sex?"
"echozdog","7","3","6","10 August 2006"," I know it's a cliché but....the book was better.
","I read the book before I saw the movie and loved it. It's easy reading page turning pulp fiction. The fact that so many people take it seriously is amusing. The protesters I passed at the theater seriously need to spend time doing something more worth while.<br/><br/>OK I'm agnostic, but I think Christ was right in almost everything he quoted in the bible. If he is the son of god or not is not going to be determined by a Hollywood movie. A lot of people believe it and that's not going to change.<br/><br/>What I guess I liked about the book was I didn't know what it was about before I started reading it. Knowing what the ""Holy grail"" is before seeing the movie probably took a lot of punch out of it for me. Also knowing the ending probably did too. BUT this has to be the least effort I've ever seen out of Tom Hanks. It seemed as though he's reading the lines off a teleprompter with ZERO emotion. Bland very bland. The movie followed the book almost too much. Thus my imagination is always better than what they can throw up on the screen. So I gave it a 7 only because I was entertained, although it did had a few eye rolling moments here and there. Plus there were quite a few filler scenes that could have been cut. But I paid $2 so I'm not complaining...."
"monkeysontoast","7","3","6","16 July 2006"," Could've been better...a lot better; but ended up being decent enough.
","It wasn't bad! I actually enjoyed it a good bit. Not a GREAT movie, but good. First and foremost, I have to say that, of all the films I've ever seen, casting Paul Bettany as Silas was probably one of the best casting decisions I've ever seen...he was absolutely perfect. Each and every scene of his in the film was electric...he commanded attention, and was able to simultaneously draw fear and sympathy to the character, as in the novel. I've always noticed Bettany in his movies, but this one really solidifies it for me...the man is incredibly talented (and I hope he wins out for Joker in the next Batman...I might actually go see it if he does, ). Um, anyway, so...aside from a few wooden moments from Tom Hanks, and a few cringe-worthy lines, (ie. ""No, this can't be, what I think it is"" ), the movie was pretty durn good. I found it well-paced, true to its source, well-acted, and interesting. It reminded me a lot of a slower, less action-packed version of National Treasure, which I realize many people hated, but I loved it (I love historical fiction, 'treasure' hunts, conspiracies, puzzles/codes, etc). My only major qualm was that, as someone who had read the novel, it was painfully obvious in parts that they had tried their best to make the movie less offensive than its source material...one critic said the movie was ""nervous about offending someone"", and that's true...although I'm not entirely sure how obvious that would've been to someone who didn't read the book. That's the major reason I gave the movie a 7/10, and not an 8."
"martijn-56","5","3","6","4 July 2006"," Doesn't live up to treasure movies from the past
","I usually only write positive comments when I do but this is an exception. Since there have been treasure hunt movies around for a while, it is almost inevitable to compare. Although the cast was not bad in this movie, surely Indiana Jones and also National Treasure were much better. Indiana Jones had the tempo but still also the incomparable nostalgic atmosphere and the effects, where National Treasure was a more modern technique treasure hunt that made up for the lack of nostalgia by the intriguing scenes of e.g. stealing the Declaration itself. Well we have seen them all. The point I want to make is that this movie lacks the right tempo and atmosphere. Also the supposed chemistry between the couple was nowhere to be seen in this movie. The atmosphere was not there either. This despite the fact that the locations were nicely picked and the movie followed the book quite closely. What made the book entertaining was the tantalizingly slow solving of the riddles themselves and the smart flash-forwards. The couple was constantly chased but they didn't know it. In this movie they solved the riddles even quicker than in National Treasure. That took away what could have been the most entertaining part and also the only way to build up tension in this movie. I never had the feeling of being involved in it, nor in the panicky feeling of an endless chase for the grail and of having to stay out of the hands of the police. Probably an extra half an hour could have done the job to slowly build up the tension. In National Treasure there was indeed a beautiful treasure, but here the immensely important grail papers (who were not found in the book) looked more like some notebooks behind glass. They were just mentioned but the scene that showed them was too short. Also the vault behind the church, which according to the book is known but never dug up, could have been a great opportunity for a movie. Make it a night scene with trying to find the right brick to open the secret cellar beneath this church. Could have been a classic treasure hunt scene but this movie missed the opportunity."
"mhajs","3","3","6","7 June 2006"," Horrible adaption to the big screen...
","* <br/><br/>*** Some minor spoilers ahead *** <br/><br/>Ever since I finished reading all 4 Dan Brown novels, I've been expecting that a filmmaker would deliver a masterpiece on the big screen. To begin, I wish they could have just shot Angels & Demons first, then The Da Vinci Code. But rather than that, they did Da Vinci first instead. In my opinion, the result is a disaster.<br/><br/>For those who haven't read the novel, the story is about an American teacher, Robert Langdon, who is an specialist in old history, symbols, religion tales and some other interesting stuff. He's famous in the academic world and whenever there's some fanatic trying to figure some possible hidden meaning in a painted picture, or a text in a book, they seek him. There's just a single scene in the entire movie I really loved and that was when Langdon is presenting some symbols to the public in a presentation. <br/><br/>Both movie and book tell the story about a man who is brutally murdered and Langdon is asked for help by the french police. The main problem with this movie is that director Ron Howard simply took the book and threw it away to the big screen. The scenes seems rushed (Langdon and Neveu in the book have great chemistry and even share a kiss at the end, but in the movie, there's no chemistry at all and maybe it was even wise not having shot a scene where this happens).<br/><br/>Besides that, Howard changed some details here and some other details there. Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu is horrendous! Ian McKellen as Teabing is another let-down too. In the book, he's very charismatic and even when he takes over, Dan Brown never expects us to believe he is evil. In the movie, in a failed attempt to try giving climax to it, Teabing rises like some traitor, with almost no purpose at all, threatening Langdon and Neveu as we never would have imagined.<br/><br/>This movie seems to have been made as if the actors interpreted it like it was some stage script show, making everything artificial. The flashback scenes are not that great and the characters are not believable at all. The book is much better. The only two actors I sincerely enjoyed were Alfred Molina and Paul Bettany. Not even Jean Reno saves the show in this one, and let me tell you: I was really looking forward to seeing Fache."

","First of all, I would like to state that I am a born-again believer in Jesus Christ the Son of God and I am not ashamed of that fact. I read the book ""The Da Vinci Code"" after reading a small booklet, called Da Vinci Code Separating Fact from Fiction. It had small quotations in it from the book, and because of it I wanted to read the book. I believe the plot was well conceived with action and a murder mystery making sure that the reader was turning the next page. I can see where many people will be confused even though this a 100% piece of fiction. It seems just like a piece of truth, but something is just not right. I enjoyed reading the book knowing that it was fiction and it was good to see the film to compare it to the book. The movie had many changes that I noted in my mind as I was watching it.<br/><br/>* SOME MINOR SPOILERS BELOW* In the book, a taxi takes Sophie and Robert through the park while in the movie they walk through it. In the book, there are two decoding machines where in the movie there is only one. There were a few other minor differences, but overall I believe it was a good adaptation from book to screen when they only had three hours to work with. My recommendation is to read the book after you see the film or read it and then watch the film. For Christians I would say it give it a shot and watch it or read the book. If you are sincere in your faith and you know what Romans 8 talks about no film or book should move you from your faith in Christ. It should force you to take a look at your life and make your faith stronger. Have you read the Bible Lately it is good stuff! The Da Vinci Code is a good film that is a good murder mystery who done it film. I makes you think and look inside at what you believe. Both Dan Brown and Ron Howard did a good job at making this book come to life. Take it at face value and then do your homework. Overall I give it a two thumbs up and 8 our 10 stars."

The locations are interesting and give authenticity to the film version. The plot is no more outrageous than the book, and whilst it may challenge some beliefs, I doubt if many would take it too seriously. Overall this is an entertaining and thought provoking thriller with enough action to support the complicated clues that litter the landscape.

","Ron Howard's film of Dan Brown's third and most successful novel, The DaVinci Code, may or may not be a great film (we'll see how it holds up in 25 years), but it is great film MAKING which illustrates the maddening tendency of self proclaimed film ""experts"" to denigrate anything which recognizes that FILM isn't the only art form which contributes to our culture.<br/><br/>""They"" trashed the first two Harry Potter films which, in faithfully putting the essence of J. K. Rowling's well written and popular books on screen proved infinitely more satisfying than the two from ""movie-movie"" directors which followed, reducing even better books to tawdry CGI excuses. Now ""they"" carp how The DaVinci Code, similarly capturing almost everything which made the novel such a satisfying, pleasurable experience is somehow ""lacking in cinematic chemistry.""<br/><br/>Balderdash! What might they have done to the great literary/film translations from Rebecca to Gone With The Wind of the past!?<br/><br/>I went into the theatre having read the generally disappointing reviews and prepared to resist Tom Hank's rather long haired interpretation of Brown's expert on symbology, Robert Langdon (not the image I had formed in my head while reading the book), and offended by the campaign of the lunatic fringe (including a few actual Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church) which seemed bent on proving that the least credible of the fictional portions of Brown's book were in fact gospel by rabidly savaging the book and film, only to find that Howard had transferred the bulk of the book to screen with enormously involving tact and skill. <br/><br/>While there was the usual necessary editing of content for time constraints, Howard's film managed to honor the essence of the book in superb fashion with few serious omissions going to the essence of the story until near the end when the leads arrive at Roslyn Chapel. Even there, with the exception of one seriously missed visual (a not immediately recognized pattern on the floor) and a foolishly added one (downstairs), the editing actually improves on some of the minor weaknesses in the source material. <br/><br/>Yes, the full reason for Sophie's estrangement from her grandfather has been soft pedaled (and slightly altered in the details of the showing) yes, multiple ""codexes"" have been combined with the loss of one code the reader had fun guessing ahead of the characters in the book, and yes, only readers of the book will know who the young man in the Chapel actually IS, but none of this changes a great story in any way which matters.<br/><br/>Without exception, the casting and cinematography are as good as we've seen this decade. Hanks grows beyond his simple good guy image in a performance with simple dignity and surprising depth, matched every step of the way by his Sophie, the perfect (and new to me) Audrey Tautou recalling and surpassing the best work of Genevieve Bujold. <br/><br/>If the Akiva Goldsman's sensitive screenplay removes one aspect of the Langdon/Sophie relationship - which, in the book, appeared to wrap Langdon even deeper into the ongoing mythology of the Magdeline bloodline (a ""mythology"" certainly as historically and religiously credible as the sexist Pauline heresy which has dominated the Christian church since Peter and Paul wrested control of the movement from James and Mary), it actually enhances Sophie's screen image as the fictional film story ends.<br/><br/>Even the much complained of ""albino murderer"" is actually given (through superior casting and direction) a sensitive portrayal which blends what had been a mere showy plot device into the fabric of the story so well few honest observers could object. <br/><br/>This is an excellent, satisfying mystery thriller which it's difficult to imagine any other film maker improving upon (though the source material might still make an excellent grand opera). It's easily the most satisfying major film this year and more than worth anyone's time who loves either the Brown book, a historical mystery (has Josephine Tey's ""Daughter of Time"" been filmed yet?) or simply a good movie."

My question is, to prove this wouldn't they also need a strand of Jesus's DNA to show that Jesus and Mary Magdeline had produced a blood line.

The characters were quite spot on (if compared to the book), and I especially enjoyed Sir Ian McKellan's Leigh Teabing: he becomes more fanatical as the movie goes on. Tom Hanks did a good job portraying Robert Langdon, although the hair definitely bothered me. I think for me, the most enjoyable thing was how closely they stuck to the novel. Of course a few ""hollywood"" adjustments were made, and of course the book is better (isn't it almost always?)but still I enjoyed the movie, and didn't find it nearly as slow moving as I expected, having read the reviews.

I was very skeptical and thought Tom Hanks was not the best choice for the movie, not by a long shot. When I read the book I thought Robert Langdon would have been more of a Gil Grissom from CSI, but after seeing Tom Hanks in the roll, he actually did an awesome job. Then I saw Audrey Tautou and thought that she just looked like the ""adorable"" girl that a movie always has. Sophie needed to be a tough chick. She did a great job. She wasn't the ""pretty"" and ""cute"" girl you would expect her to be. I really enjoyed the character of Silas. Paul Bettany did an AWESOME job. He was also in a Knights Tale where he walked around naked. You get to see his ass again in this movie, and I am not complaining. A few of the lines in this movie were really lame. The worst part ever was when Sophie tried to walk on water, and made the joke about water into wine. So then Robert says ""God speed!"" That was pretty much just retarded as ever.

Personally, I'm not much into religion, living in America, when Religion is forced by the hand of censorship, I found myself drawn into the story, something I really can't say has happened to me in a long while. The cinematography is great, and there was some great wise ass, comic moments between Hanks and Mckellen. I really have to say I was glad that it was Ron Howard at the helm, and not Oliver Stone. Hanks finally, and ironically, got away from the preachy garbage he's been doing, and finally, seemed to give a creditable acting performance, something missing since saving Private Ryan.

"ImagoDei","9","3","6","29 May 2006"," Ron Howard proves his genius
","Turning Dan Brown's lengthy and detailed novel into a movie that works was a hairy, hairy problem. (Brown himself said that his own screenplay would have worked out to a 20 hour film -- or longer!) Yet Ron Howard's take on the book is a tremendous success. The filming is marvelous. The story is well-told, and clear to follow. It's true to the source material, keeping in just enough of the background as needed to tell the story. The acting is fantastic. Most impressive, Howard avoids cardboard characters and treacly sentiment (like the requisite romance between Langdon and Sophie that was in the book), and avoids a total sell-out of the book in order to appease Bible-thumpers.<br/><br/>The major criticisms of this movie that I have seen are 1) It's not as good (or as detailed) as the book and 2) it's sacrilegious.<br/><br/>Neither of those I find really significant; in response to #1 I can't imagine a *better* screen version of the book than this.<br/><br/>And as for #2: oh well, that's the problem with free speech... people say things you don't agree with.<br/><br/>Rank-and-file Catholics like to believe that all the facts of Christianity were written down on a long sheet of paper by God himself, and that only someone inspired by Satan would question the foundations of Christianity. What Brown's book (and now movie) show is the FACT of just how much play there was in the development of the Catholic/Christian Mythos. The Catholic Church and Christian faith were the creation of MEN, who each believed that they were on the right track to God. Their arguments and disagreements went back to the very earliest days: Paul thought that the ""Three Pillars"" of the Jerusalem disciples -- Peter especially -- were bone-heads and had it all wrong about Jesus; at least that's what he says in his epistles! While I am not asserting the truth of any of Brown's particular claims or plot devices, what IS important is the search for truth. If we know anything of God at all, it is that God is truth. And the ""cut and dried"" version that the Vatican presents is most certainly NOT the truth.<br/><br/>For example, if priests are literally Jesus on earth, then how can ANY priest be a pedophile? If popes are infallible, then why have they been wrong about matters of faith and morals, and even declared heretics by later generations? Is believing in the American system of government (separation of church an state) in FACT a heresy, as stated and reaffirmed in the Syllabus of Errors? And what about the Malleus Maleficarium, where the pope expressly gave German bishops the authority to kill in the name of God?<br/><br/>This is a great job of turning a book into a successful movie. I hope the legacy of this movie, once the furor dies down, is the emergence of a more sane view of Christianity, a faith that centers on the spiritual experience of the common man, rather than the terrible self-contradictory ""just shut up and do as we say"" power-trip that the Vatican has promoted for so long.<br/><br/>Or, in other words: Don't fear God... Fear men who can justify doing evil in God's name."
"shanfloyd","7","3","6","29 May 2006"," Faithful adaptation, excellent casting... and Howard didn't disappoint us.
","Let me begin with what I think about the book. I think though it is poorly written, it is extremely clever in creating sensation. The characters are one-dimensional, the story too cheesy, but the plot and the theme are extremely interesting, revolutionary and its controversy well-marketed. And yes, the codes were entertaining.<br/><br/>Now for the film, which obviously created more sensation than the book, delivers enough satisfaction to both... those who read the book and those who hadn't. My companion haven't read it yet but she enjoyed the film as much as I did. Howard created a very faithful adaptation of Brown's novel. He only omitted a few rather unnecessary portions of the story for the sake of time and left out one or two steps in the story's code-breaking sequence, which was perhaps good for a moviegoer who haven't read the book. For example, the film deals with only one cryptex. The film also introduces one or two added scenes that only added to the entertainment... like Sophie's joking attempt to walk on the water in the end.<br/><br/>A strong feature of the film is its casting. Each main character is casted according to his/her nationality. Tom Hanks gives us another perfect professional performance as Robert Langdon. He's indeed not the way I imagined while reading the book but Hanks's expertise got over that feeling. On the other hand, Audrey Tautou's Sophie Neveu is absolutely what I imagined during the reading -- strong-willed, intelligent yet soft in demeanor. Tautou, an enormously talented actress as she is, makes Sophie one of the film's strongest points. There's much critical praise for Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing and I agree with the critics here. And finally for the two Opus Dei people, though Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa is under-utilised, Paul Bettany steals every scene he's in as Silas. His self-torture scene at the beginning is priceless.<br/><br/>Then what are the film's flaws? One is certainly its wooden dialogues. Well, the basic plot may give rise to laughter when you present them with such flat words. And some of the viewers in the theatre indeed giggled when Langdon let out Sophie's secret in the end. I believe its for the film's attempted simplicity for the 'virgin' audiences. Still, there should have been more smart lines. The next thing is the rush the film runs with. Yes, one has to adapt a 500 page novel in a two-hour film. Still, some key secrets demand slow detailing... otherwise much thrill is lost. That's exactly what happened. At least the final secret about the Merovingian bloodline needed more time to grow. I think three hours should have been the film's ideal duration.<br/><br/>Lastly, an appeal to the viewers: please don't rate or judge the film from your religious standpoint. Films/books are pieces of art and entertainment. I'm frankly surprised by this film's IMDb rating. It certainly is worth more. It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitely the year's one of the most entertaining films."
"dearmond-1","8","3","6","28 May 2006"," Interesting fictionalized account of the Holy Grail and how it may relate to Mary Magdalene and whether she married Jesus or not.
","I am going to have to reread the ending of the book. The ending may have been changed, but I am not sure how much if any. I won't discuss it now so I won't ruin it for others. I found the movie moved fast, too fast for viewers who haven't read the book. The British accents and some French accents went to fast to be totally comprehended. I appreciate their trying to keep as much of the book in the movie as possible while trying keep the movie from becoming too long. I got caught up in wondering how much of the book would be kept. It has some scenes that are borderline gruesome, but they are necessary for the plot. I am of the opinion that the Church has overreacted to the movie. They seem to think that the movie is treating the Jesus-Magdalene issue as fact, whereas I feel the movie is treating this as a contention that may or may not be true. Everyone should have the right to make this decision for themselves."
"harliiwood","10","3","6","28 May 2006"," The best movie I have ever seen...
","My Review of The Da Vinci Code and it does contain SPOILERS: <br/><br/>I didn't read the book, so this review is simply based on the movieperiod. I'll stop just shy of calling this the best movie I have ever seen. What the heck, I will say it. This is the best movie I have ever seen. Maybe it's because I studied art history in college, maybe it's because I love history and mysteries, maybe it's because I struggle with my own faith, maybe it's because I'm a nerd, or maybe a combination of all these things. Not sure. In any case, from the very beginning the movie moved quickly and kept my attention all the way through. I was literally on the edge of my seat and just shaking. I felt loads of tension from every sequence taking place during the film. There was so much going on, so much I tried to focus on to make sure I didn't miss anything. I don't want to give too much away, but here are just a few thoughts and there ARE spoilers: <br/><br/>1. They introduced Sophie as the Police Cryptographer and as the movie progressed and we learned who she was, how she was raised, etc. I expected her talent in this area to be explored more. Instead, Langdon solved 99.9% of the puzzles or codes. That was a loss in my opinion, as if she was just there for the eye candy and back story.<br/><br/>2. In no way is Opus Dei shown to be this powerful, clandestine, fanatical group of Catholics. What is shown is ONE council of men made up of Catholic bishops who happen to be Opus Dei. Again, I have not read the book, but based on the film, this is just a splinter group that may or may not have the authority and backing of Opus Dei proper, and definitely not the Catholic Church, which the movie makes very clear.<br/><br/>3. As a Christian, the movie makes me think. Is it likely to change my mind about my faith? No. I'm not afraid of pondering the possibilities and accepting the idea that many people do believe this story as legitimate. That doesn't affect my own faith unless I let it. To me, it's simply an excellent, excellent historical thriller, i.e. fictional with some major genuine historical threads.<br/><br/>4. Again, not reading the book, I'm not sure what was changed, but I have a hard time accepting Fache's/Parisian Police Chief's reaction to the Bishop when he realized what was going on. Having built up this supposed Opus Dei cult-like phenomenon, it was hard to accept him not going along with everything the entire way like a good devotee of this system of beliefs.<br/><br/>5. I still don't understand why or how Christianity, after the death of Christ and the supposed charge to Mary Magdalene to carry on His church would turn into a pagan faith and result in that whole scene where Sophie witnesses her grandfather and the members of the Priory of Sion engaged in ritualistic sex. It just doesn't jibe to me, but I need to read the book.<br/><br/>6. Ian McKellan is a most excellent actor. That is all.<br/><br/>7. Brown did his work, as did R. Howard, I'm sure. The info about the Templars, etc. fit with some National Geographic and Discovery Channel documentaries I've seen. It all makes sense to a degree.<br/><br/>I want to see this again and again. I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I am so, so glad I didn't allow negative reviews to prevent my seeing it for myself. I don't know what movie they saw, but it's not the one I just came from.<br/><br/>GO SEE IT! You won't be sorry."
"uefamily","8","3","6","28 May 2006"," We thought it was fun!
","My husband read the book and thought that the movie was ""good"". I had not read the book and thought that the movie was ""good"" - we enjoyed it; thought that it was fun. We also wondered what movie the critics saw, or maybe they were expecting too much - or, maybe, they're part of the church's conspiracy...? Hmmm? I'm not Christain and I am female, so I enjoyed much of the discussions in the story. We liked the actors, the direction, the music, even the flashbacks. The same team that did A Beautiful Mind is here, again, with the same problem: how do you show, in a movie, someone's thought processes? My husband wanted to know if things were too obvious - but I've seen Dogma, so I ""got"" that fairly early (if you've read the book, etc., you know of what I refer). Anyway, read the book, see the movie, have fun with it!"
"margholl","10","3","6","27 May 2006"," Finally an Intellectual Film
","After so many mindless films full of sex and violence it astounds me that there is so much objection to one that provokes thought and further study of religion. As others have said, it is FICTION, it is a THRILLER. It is ENTERTAINING.<br/><br/>I think Da Vinci Code is thought provoking and very intelligently done.Only the history that is fact is presented as fact, and what is not fact is presented as THEORY, with the exception of the bloodline of Christ, which is of course the point of the film and book. The book and film both give us a look at what it might be like if this theory were true. And it could be. There is nothing to prove or disprove it. It's just a theory and Dan Brown isn't the first to think of it. It also isn't the first film that blended history with a little artistic license.<br/><br/>Oh and yes, I am a Christian. I am not offended. I would be very disappointed if the talent of these actors, this director and this writer can be overlooked because people can't handle a little controversy. I was thrilled with both film and book. I plan to see the film again and I will by the DVD when it comes out. The scenery is wonderful and the acting outstanding. I would venture to stay it might be over the heads of anyone who doesn't read and study. Just a thought."
"dlitt-1","8","3","6","27 May 2006"," Well worth the price of admission
","First let me say that I have read the book. Unlike many of the literature critics out there, I liked it too. Do I care what some critic that just wants to be cool says about the movie, I suppose I do because I went into the movie with low expectations. Instead, I was surprised at how true to the book it was, and how well crafted the movie was, especially the cinematography. I've read that there is no chemistry between Hanks and Audry Toutou, Is there supposed to be? In the movie, the relationship is not presented as a love interest, just two people thrown together in a brief adventure. If I have a complaint, it's that the Silas character was miscast. The accent was a little hokey and for some reason, he just didn't seem real, more like a cartoon villain. This must have been a pretty hard movie to script. The writers have over 40 million people that have read the book and despite what the movie critics and even the literary critics say, the Da Vinci Code is a great ride- again. Score another bulls-eye for Mr. Howard."
"Okonh0wp","9","3","6","27 May 2006"," Howard makes good out of a losing situation
","Critics so far are giving Da Vinci code mixed reviews but when you're making a film based on a book that apparently has sold more copies than any book since the Bible (as Roger Ebert notes: ""good thing it had a different ending"") the expectations are going to be hard to live up to. The other mistake critics are making is that they're judging the film along the lines of how controversial it is, and are lampooning the usually middle-of-the-road Ron Howard for once again playing it too safe. That makes no sense to me: a movie has to have picketers at its premiere to be considered successful? The fact is that Howard is in a damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don't situation with the material and he skirted the controversy smartly by just focusing on making a good movie and even if by sticking to the book he won't get the credit for the great story, that's still exactly what he did.<br/><br/>For those of you that didn't read the book, The Da Vinci Code is an intelligent thriller that starts out with a murder at an art museum in France, and a Harvard professor of symbology, Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called upon to help decipher the victim's dying message. Making their way into the story at intersecting points and building up the suspense level are a French cryptologist and granddaughter of the victim, a police chief with a vendetta (Reno), a bishop who heads a controversial sect of Christianity (Molina), a murderous albino monk (Bettany) and an obsessive British aristocrat (McKellan). The story is filled with cliffhangers and surprises at every turn and the film pretty much follows that same pace, being careful not to cut out too much of the interesting tidbits that made the book so interesting in the first place. The story's genius, after all, comes from playing with familiar historical events suggesting they didn't happen exactly the way we thought they did.<br/><br/>For those of you who have read the book, don't worry, it's not by any means an exact copy of the book. Things are cut and moved around and at least a couple of key elements are changed for the better. For example, Bezu Fache, the policeman, is a member of Opus Dei in the film, which makes for more sensible character motives, and Robert Langdon is a religious man which makes for a slightly more open-ended approach to the religious controvoursey. What really makes the movie work, however, is the casting. Audrey Tatou, Paul Bettany, and Ian McKellan are all vastly underrated actors who give Tom Hanks great support and enhance the movie. McKellan's devious scholar seems to comes straight out of an Indiana Jones movie, and Paul Bettany makes Silas the albino monk sufficiently scary but surprisingly human at the same time."
"sredman-1","10","3","6","27 May 2006"," I loved this movie!
","I was interested to see how well the book would be adapted to the movie. I had read the book in a day and a half because I just couldn't put it down. I was also wondering how interesting the movie would be. As a thriller, the thrill came from not knowing what would happen next, and having read the book, I already knew what would happen. The initial reviews were discouraging, saying the movie was too long, had too much exposition, not enough ""chemistry"" between the main characters, etc. I was pleasantly surprised. The time frame for the movie is about a day. After all, how much chemistry can you develop when just getting through the day uses all your energy? The 2+ hours were gone before I knew it. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and hated to see it end."
"cathie454","7","3","6","26 May 2006"," Not bad at all
","Not as bad as I expected, after reading many, many negative reviews. I love Tom Hanks in almost anything, but I just don't think he was right for this part. I read the book, and it never occurred to me that Hanks would play that part... maybe someone less well known, more scholarly? But he was OK, and Audrey Tautou was perfect for the part of Sophie. Paul Bettany as Silas was excellent. The action scenes were good and the cinematography was excellent. I'd read the book, so I could follow the story but I think people who haven't read the book might have a hard time during the first half of the movie, at least; the book was quite involved, with a lot of explanation to it that just wasn't possible in the movie. I'm sure Ron Howard was thrilled with all the controversy! Any publicity is good publicity!"
"RennieP","8","3","6","26 May 2006"," Ron Howard took the book seriously - more power to him
","I'm assuming the reader of this review has read the book so a synopsis of the plot and a list of the main characters are not necessary.<br/><br/>The big question prior to the release of this movie was how would Ron Howard tackle the job? Especially since he had a guaranteed box-office success no matter what he did, considering the success of the book and the controversy surrounding it.<br/><br/>Ron Howard could have made a bland action flick that avoided the controversial religious claims, or he could have made a romantic comedy with a stupid French policeman, or he could have cut the number of locations and codes by 50%, or he could have done all sorts of things.<br/><br/>In fact, Ron Howard took the book seriously, and the movie, although not following the book slavishly, does include most of the controversial claims from the book. I think he did the right thing and that the movie has a more memorable impact as a result.<br/><br/>Just about everyone has noted that the movie is rather long (2 1/2 hours) and contains a lot of dialog. But this is a direct consequence of taking the book seriously.<br/><br/>The movie is well-made, the actors (especially Ian McKellen) all do a good job, the action scenes are exciting, the locations are beautifully photographed, and you leave the cinema feeling that you got your money's worth. This is especially true if you disliked the book because of the religious claims and went to see the movie to get your feeling of outrage about these claims confirmed.<br/><br/>Anyway, I liked the movie. I was even pleased to see that Ron Howard corrected one of the two errors that Dan Brown made regarding the architecture of the Louvre.<br/><br/>Rennie Petersen"

I am young so therefore not highly religious and since I had read the book so many times and understood that it was FICTIONAL, I thought why not and went to see it. I loved every minute of it. I agree that the main point of the controversy is that people do not understand that its FICTIONAL.

","The Da Vinci Code, set in Europe, is a fictional mystery--thriller about the origins of the Catholic Church. Robert Langdon, a Harvard religious symbolist lecturing in Paris, is called to a murder scene at the Louvre. The victim has scrawled symbols and a message in his own blood, to leave a clue to his killer's identity. Langdon is there not only as an expert but also as a suspect; his name was found on the victim's daily schedule. Sophie Neveu, a police detective and estranged granddaughter of the deceased, arrives unannounced; she has reason to distrust Police Captain Fache. Langdon suspects he's stepped into the middle of a two-millennium old war between the Church and the Divine Feminine. The death message indicates the victim is of the Priory of Sion, keepers of the Holly Grail and the secret of Mary Magdalene relationship with Jesus. Opus Dei, a devout Catholic organization, will defend the Church and stop at nothing to squash these secrets. Langdon and Neveu elude Fache and a race is on to find the Holy Grail, avoid the authorities and not fall victim to Opus Dei. Racing across France and Britain Langdon enlists Sir Leigh Teabing, a Holy Grail expert and close friend. Clues come from artistic symbols, Fibonacci numbers, a cryptex, and a rosewood box. The path leads through European history, Westminster Abby and Temple Church, ending at Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is a super duper film, as a friend of mine would say. The screenplay honors the novel and truly brings the author's words to life; the plot is fast-paced and intellectually challenging. The filmmaker's phase-in short flashbacks and thought images to capture and collapse the book's descriptive passages; this tactic effortlessly informs the viewer. The great locations and settings are a visual feast and offer a great backdrop for the plot. The film runs a fast 2-hr. 15-min. with ease and could hold one's attention longer. The final scenes back in Paris include a great symphonic soundtrack leading to the final scene.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code could have been cast in the tradition of Indiana Jones, a bigger than life macho hero and a sensual blond hot pants heroine. Rather, the characters are more scholarly and academic. Tom Hanks, as Robert Langdon, is a very subdued character dressed in shades of black and always with a seriousalmost panicked---facial expression. Audrey Tautou, as Sophie, is a rising French actress unfamiliar to most U.S. audiences. Ms Tautou delivers the right blend of composure and horror, for someone about enter the history books. Ian McKellen is in his traditional role of elder coach, teacher and adviser; a perfect fit. Paul Bettany, as Silas the Opus Dei killer, is truly a scary character as an albino. Bleached hair, pale white skin and glass blue eyed, he faithfully prays and flagellates after each violent action.<br/><br/>Editorial Comment: Professional reviewers are criticizing The Da Vinci Code (the film) for everything from too much salt on the popcorn to addition of new dialog. The Da Vinci Code (the novel), a worldwide best seller with over 60 million copies sold, has been on the New York Times best seller list for 163 weeks, as of May 2006. The film grossed over $77 million on opening weekend and won't leave theaters anytime soon. Director Ron Howard has been nominated for 40 film awards worldwide, including four (4) Golden Globe Awards, and has won one (1) Academy Award. Leading man Tom Hanks has been nominated for over 80 film awards globally, including 5 Academy Awards for best acting, of which he won twice. This film is better than the professionals would have you believe. Time Magazine severely panned The Sound Of Music [1965] only to reissue a glowing review in their magazine after realizing the customer is always right. Stay tuned."

"capunk2441","8","3","6","23 May 2006"," What can you do when the book is already pure genius?
","Ron Howard's movie Da Vinci code received a lot of flack early on by critics saying there was no flow to the movie and there was no connection between Tom Hanks (Langdon) and Audrey Tautou (Sophie). However, I beg the differ, and give, if not, more credit to Howard for not slaughtering the already genius and Best-selling story.<br/><br/>One of the hardest tasks in film-making, is the one of taking a very successful book with a huge following and transferring it to the big screen. We have seen few successes with this (Jurassic Park, Lord of The Rings, etc.). Dan Brown's book, Davinci Code, already contained a great story which captivates and draws in the reader. Ron Howard has the task of trying to unite everyone's imagination into one movie by also not trying to offend anyone of different perspectives. Indeed, I do agree that it was less descriptive, but it took me 1 month to read the novel, and the movie is about 3 hours.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks performs well as always, however I think a slight miscast on casting him as a knowledgeable Professor. There is good flow to the movie and we are not drowned by long slews of dialog explaining every detail of Da Vinci's work as well as the Templar Knights. I believe Howard did a good job of extracting the essentials and tying them in for the audience to grasp the principles of the book. I am sure for those who have not read the book, and only saw the movie, consider it one of the best of the year. Howard continues to earn my respect and deliver good, entertaining movies."

I was skeptical about Tom Hanks being Robert Langdon, but he pulled it off. Ian McKellan was priceless and Audrey Toutou was very good as Sophia. Paul Bettany was just the right brand of creepy for the role of Silas. The locations were awesome and the art and churches were as much a part of the cast as the actors were. I think it was a very good adaption of a very complex and intriguing book. I hope this series will be continued and we'll see more Robert Langdon stories."

Not to mention that it has some great actors in the main roles : Tom Hanks ,Audrey Tatou,Jean Reno,Ian McKellen and others should be proof enough that this is indeed a good movie. What I don't know is if it's best to read the book first or see the movie.There are some advantages to having read the book first because some passages and explanations are missing from the movie and it would have probably been impossible to introduce them anyway. I believe that Ron Howard is a good director and he does have experience with movies based on books,biographies or historical events . Also I feel that the movie should not be judged by people in order of their religious beliefs, as some tend to, because the author of the book and the ones who made the movie are not making you believe in their theory ,they just want to create a good story ,with an interesting plot based on some scientifical research that may or may not be fact.

","After much anticipation, I was disappointed to read the negative reviews of DVC. Having seen the movie, I can see why reviewers have disliked it, though I think much of this criticism is misplaced and misunderstands what the movie and the book it accurately translates is trying to do.<br/><br/>I loved it. In spite of its tremendous complexity, the movie adaptation is true to the book in nearly every way. Great care has been taken to recreate Dan Brown's vision, and the result is superb.<br/><br/>Even without some of the stodgy editing, the movie's much-maligned heaviness is unavoidable. It is apparent to me that great care was taken to include in the movie only the essentials - there is much dialogue but most of it essential to the story. The movie is tight, and it is apparent to me that great care has been taken to use every moment in those 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>A common criticism I have read is that various characters' flashbacks are superfluous. I disagree. In addition to rounding out the characters, many flashbacks are important to the story, particularly Sophie's. Hanks' character's childhood experience might be an exception. But the flashbacks are always brief anyway; they don't get in the way of the story.<br/><br/>Performances are solid - but stars are rarely given a chance to shine. For me standouts were Hanks and, in particular, Bettany. McKellan was wonderful. Tatou was solid enough but far from exceptional. Reno was given one moment to shine (in explaining his pursuit of Langdon) and took it.<br/><br/>This is not a book that is easily adapted to screen - there is much information to convey and this crowds out character development. The challenge for director Howard was parsimony: to squeeze as much into the movie as possible while preserving a storyline. I think he achieved this admirably.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","First of all, it goes without saying -see the movie with an open mind.<br/><br/>The movie was fast paced, intelligent, and provided the right amount of action without becoming some mindless action flick. The characters were down to earth -Hanks and Tatou are very believable in their roles, and Bettany and Reno's ""villans"" were flawed and vulnerable, prompting pity for them, a rare feat in a blockbuster film.<br/><br/>I read the book first, and of course, I didn't expect the book to be exactly like the movie; the book is much longer and much more detailed. However, the movie followed the book very closely, so literary perfectionists (like myself were appeased). That is, until the last ten minutes. Unfortunately, the director opted to modify the ending for some unknown reason,deviating completely from the book, which was kind of sad, considering how well the movie had done for the last 2 hours. The ending was entertaining, wrapping up the film nicely, but the film ending added nothing to the movie that the book's ending did not, and the book's ending kept with the overall theme of the DaVinci Code. It was too bad, because the disappointment of the last ten minutes overshadowed the overall effect of the film.<br/><br/>Final verdict? Go see it (if you are ready to, of course), and enjoy it, but book lovers be warned, the ending is rather different. 8/10"

But as far as the movie goes...catholic, Protestant, Christian...SEE IT! The drama and theatrics alone are worth every second in the theater. I would also like to point out that Hans Zimmer made huge leaps in the score of this film. I have already purchased it and listen to it in my car everywhere I go. It is truly an inspiration. Kudos to Ron Howard and Tom Hanks. Proof that open-mindedness still exists in Hollywood and there are good performers willing to take on such dramatic roles. I was moved by this film to its very depths and think anyone and everyone should see this wonderful achievement by Ron and Tom. Oh and one more thing...I am Catholic.

","The Da Vinci Code Critics have been complaining about the pacing in ""The Da Vinci Code."" Dull, I've heard. But I have to say that it's quite entertaining despite its running time - approximately 148 minutes.<br/><br/>This truly is a movie version of what I imagined as I read Dan Brown's best-seller; for good and bad. Hence, if you liked what you read... I'm still amused by the fact that people around me took Brown's novel seriously. People who usually are skeptics believed some of the stuff because Brown blurred the line between fact and fiction. I want this stuff to be true, and the world would be a more interesting place if it were. But it's a cock-and-bull story if there ever was one. That becomes even more evident as we see the movie. This is a more straight-faced version of Indiana Jones. Dr. Jones for the ones who consider themselves too old for the archeologist's adventures.<br/><br/>As I see the film I sense that this is an architectural construction; it's lifeless and the people involved made it for the money. Still it's useful for entertainment. These actors, who are otherwise great at what they do, hold back and you can practically see dollar signs in their eyes. Ian McKellen can do this stuff in his sleep, Tom Hanks has acknowledged that he made it for the money, Jean Reno literally sleepwalks as Captain Fache; the acting is competent, but these guys don't seem the least bit hungry.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" is good entertainment.

I thought Hanks did a great job acting as usual and although in some of his films I feel Sir Ian Mckellin over acts, I really enjoyed him in this. I thought he was perfect for the roll. I was very fascinated by the story and it really had me thinking for a while after the movie. I can't for the life of me understand why it's getting such bad reviews, but once again I didn't read the book so I technically can't say much.

","I should preface my comments with the statement that I hold no particular set of religious beliefs (or disbeliefs) - the controversy surrounding this book and movie are superfluous to me. That said, I was late to read the book, but having done so, I was impressed with the author's ability to weave a story that could gain and hold my attention as a reader (I have since read several of his other books.) I am glad to say that the movie fulfilled my hopes in this regard; Ron Howard and the stellar cast he assembled kept me in my seat with my eyes on the screen and my ears at attention.<br/><br/>The movie (and the book) convey a story that utilizes elements from the action, suspense, mystery and drama genres. Achieving the proper balance of these disparate styles is difficult without becoming heavy-handed or clichéd, but I am pleased overall with the results. Dan Brown has a writing style that seems well-suited to (and perhaps actually intended for) transcription to the screen, albeit with a Hollywood sensibility. I am not surprised that the movie was received poorly at Cannes, indeed, I was more intrigued with the fact that it was presented there at all - it does not strike me as the type of story or film for the 'artsy' crowd (not that there's anything wrong with 'artsy' films!) I think it safe to say that anyone who watches this movie without too many preconceptions will find many aspects to enjoy. As for me, it is to be taken as an entire package, and in that regard, I will no doubt enjoy watching it several times."

Sir Ian McCellan was terrific as Leigh Teabing. Hanks,of course was wonderful, as usual. Jean Reno was the perfect Bezu Fache and the part of Sophie Neveau was also well done. I liked this movie, but it is getting a bad rap because people have their own individual ideas of what it shouldn've been like. It was such a popular book, everyone thought of the characters in different ways. Overall, this movie was worth seeing."

The priory of Sion's goal is not protecting a devastating secret! On to the performances: Tom Hanks miscast? I think not. I think he did a great job. Audrey Tatou was great as Sophie.

"craigarmiger24","10","3","6","21 May 2006"," Da Vinci Code a masterpiece
","The Da Vinci Code is one of the major book releases of the past decade and is now the biggest release of this summer. I felt that the film does not do the book justice entirely however the film is remarkable in its own right. There were only 3 major things in the film that were majorly different from the book for me: <br/><br/>1. the cryptex was only one-barrelled. I can't work out why as it would only add about 10 or 15 to the film's length, if that and I felt that the first clue was an important part to the story as it shows Sophie's grandfather's love for her. <br/><br/>2. Langdon and Sophie need to find information on ""a knight a pope interred"" and where do they go for their information? a mobile phone. I don't know if the people at Orange had anything to do with it but this didn't smack of academic for me. Also the scene was bit rushed along for my liking. (also my girlfriend was distraught that they didn't film at King's College where she attends Uni!) <br/><br/>3. The ending. It was more fitting for those who haven't read the book but for me it was far too different from the book's ending. When they arrive at Roslin it is to be reunited with Spohie's grandmother and brother. Although we see Sophie's brother its not mentioned that he is her long lost brother. Also, where did all those people come from?!!? And the chamber in the floor? Not good. As everyone whose watch Tony Robinson in england knows that no one has found an entrance to the vast chamber that was discovered to be lying underneath the chamber.<br/><br/>Good points of the movie include the performances of Paul Bettany and Sir Ian McKellen. Outstanding. Bettany is unrecognisable from the last film I saw him in (Wimbledon)and plays the part of Silas with such enthusiasm and really makes you believe the performance. McKellen just was in his element in the role of Teabing. from the moment he descended the stairs to the moment he was taken away by the police he was amazing. Bringing with him the British wit and humour that Dan Brown had intended with the character.<br/><br/>Overall the film is outstanding and is intended for those who have and who haven't read the book, a sort of in between so people don't have to have read the book to understand the plot. It's a good piece of cinematic work and will definitely be as talked about as much the novel whether it be bad or good. <br/><br/>An excellent film."

The movie was the cherry on the cake for such a wonderful book, but I have to say that I was not so much into it because I already know the story and thus the ending. I love the visuals, and the acting of Tom Hanks, not so much the French lady though.<br/><br/>If you have never read the book, this movie is a must see, regardless of your religious beliefs, IT IS JUST FICTION and if you have read the book like me, this is putting a picture to the written material.<br/><br/>I am not even going to comment on the crazy, close minded people who somehow think this movie is going to change what you have believe all your life.<br/><br/>Also, watch out for the Christian fanatics outside the movie theater distributing pamphlets and the bible."

"samseescinema","8","3","6","19 May 2006"," isn't the best adaptation The Da Vinci Code fanatics could've hoped for, but a solid flick
","rating: 3 out of 4<br/><br/>After nearly three years of putting it off, last week I finally picked up and read The Da Vinci Code. Being the 40,000,001st person to read the book wasn't much fun, as a dozen or more people giddily peered over my shoulder, asking what page I was on and oh-so-accidentally letting the twists slip off their tongues. I figured that since all the other 40,000,000 people who've read the book will view the film adaptation in a gnawing, nit picky book-to-film comparison, I probably should too. Trying to review a film from a perspective no one in the theatre will have has never been a winning stratagem. And Dan Brown's book was fun and riling, utilizing convincing art history and extremist theology to thicken its otherwise pulpy tale. As a film, its prospects were titillating: the damned thing was pretty much written to be a movie in the first place. But when put to practice, some key elements were lost in translation. Granted, Ron Howard is a more eloquent storyteller than Dan Brown, utilizing the language of film with more agility than Brown can maneuver the English language; but the script lost something along the way: for all its length, Mr. Howard's The Da Vinci Code has lost its scholarly charm.<br/><br/>Now don't go running off thinking Hollywood's done it again; this is a respectful adaptation that constricts its creativity to stay true to the worldwide literary phenomenon. What I mean is that Akiva Goldsman's adaptation seems to rush itself in some of the wrong places. <br/><br/>For those of you who're like me and have somehow avoided the book for the last years, here's a little synopsis: a respected curator for the Louvre is found dead with a mysterious smattering of clues surrounding his body. Symbologist and Cryptologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) track these clues down to their historical significance, tromping around Paris and London in search of the Holy Grail, the curator's controversial secret. Going any more in depth is a waste of print-space. I was the only person who hadn't read the book anyhow.<br/><br/>The finest moments of the novel, most will admit, occurred when Langdon and Neveu sifted through their encyclopedic knowledge in search of solutions to their international, multi-millennial treasure hunt. We were educated as they whittled down the answers, introduced to stifling theories and tasty little factoids. But with the film adaptation, Mr. Howard seems to skim over the puzzling aspects of the hunt. Answers seem to simply pop into the characters heads. Oh sure, every once in a while an anagram gives them a few seconds of trouble, but Mr. Sauniere's (the curator) brilliance is never properly honored. The trail he laid for the pair was intricate in the novel, laden with double entendres and charmed solutions. Goldsman's script doesn't have time for such nonsense, floating along past these magical moments of scholarly adventure and replacing them instead with other conversations lifted from the text that offer up disappointing substitutes. <br/><br/>Beyond this, however, I have no quibble with the project. Put simply, it's the moving picture version of the book we read, but without the clunky sentences. The best people in the business were put on this project and it certainly shows. Not only does Ron Howard prove yet again his careful command of the film medium, but the casting is also watertight. Mr. Hanks and Ms. Tautou strike the chord of off-kilter chemistry that Mr. Brown aimed for in his book, while the ghostly Silas is haunting and pathetic in the form of Paul Bettany. And yes, despite Hanks' much abused hairdo, his performance is the most respectful of all. He's just fine as Robert Langdon.<br/><br/>And there's no need to worry about the screenplay taking its own creative liberties. The one major change from the book is well handled and probably a better choice anyhow (it has to do with Captain Fache and Bishop Aringarosa). There are little things changed too, but only shifted to speed up Mr. Brown's otherwise sloppy action sequences. Instead of Sophie hitting the brakes and calmly driving away from the tightly guarded U.S. Embassy, she embarks on a wild, backwards car chase in the deeply congested streets of Paris. Ron Howard knows how to drive his film in these scenes, and his control of The Da Vinci Code is its winning token. <br/><br/>This isn't the best adaptation The Da Vinci Code fanatics could've hoped for, but it's a solid flick. The eloquence Mr. Howard delivers is a vast improvement over Mr. Brown's fumbling language, while Brown's adventure is undermined by Howard's slighting of the treasure hunt. This is a fair trade, sure, but it prevents both works from achieving greatness."
"Matt_Layden","6","3","6","19 May 2006"," ""It's One Of Those Read The Book & Skip The Movie Types""
","The Da Vinci Code, based on the massively popular book by the same name, sees Robert Langdon sent to a murder scene to investigate certain symbols left by the victim. What Langdon figures out though, could destroy Christianity and his life.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is a cultural phenomenon, which almost everyone has read. So it's no surprise that they want to get a movie out there for the people who are too lazy to read the books, but here it's an obvious case of cashing in on the money that the book has earned. Much like Passion Of The Christ, you can tell that the filmmakers hope that it's controversy is the key to it's success. It's a shame to say that it's one of those read the book and skip the movie.<br/><br/>I've read the book, been to it's locations and believe in Jesus Christ, so I really enjoyed the book. With Ron Howard giving us the motion picture, my hopes that the film making a good translation to screen were still up in the air. After finally seeing the film, I've come to realize that the book is indeed better then the movie. The main reason behind this would be because the film itself felt rushed. It felt like it was still trying to cash in on the book's success, it just so happens that it leaves the viewer wondering what all the fuss is about. If they haven't read the book that is.<br/><br/>Da Vinci is the weakest film out of the Hanks and Howard collaboration. Hanks still doesn't seem to fit the title character of Langdon. No, it's not the hair, it's just that when I'm watching the film I see TOM HANKS, not Robert Langdon. Hanks aside, everyone else seems to fit their roles perfectly. I enjoyed Reno as the french police officer Fache and adored Tautou as Sophie Neveu. Ian McKellen does a good job as well, although I thought he was more comical then his character should be. Molina is barely used in the film, but out of everyone, it's Paul Bettany who shines here. Bettany showed his acting chops in Gangster No. 1, here he steals the screen. Unlike Hanks, Bettany becomes his character sends chills down some spines.<br/><br/>The film is true to the book, but I could of sworn I remember a lot more stuff happening in the book then what was showed in the film. Granted, you can't transfer everything from page to screen, but it seems like they didn't really care for the material. The most important and entertaining part of the book seems to fly by here. I was also very turned off by the scenes that showed Langdon looking at certain things that weren't there. Hologram like images that play out in his mind and to the viewer, but are invisible to everyone else. <br/><br/>The score was impressive, it's one of the few highlights in the film. The book itself was a page turner and never seemed to slow down, the film doesn't slow down either, but with a 2 1/2 hour running time it does hit you in your seats. National Treasure I said felt like a Da Vinci Code ripoff, but Treasure was the better film of the two. It was more adventurous then Code, which to me, even with it's beautiful locations, seemed confined. <br/><br/>Howard is a good director, and if he actually took the time to make a good film here he could have had a success, unfortunately his rushed attempt to get the film in theatres shows. As does the acting, which is quite embarrassing at some points. The controversy surrounding the film should die down when people realize that the film isn't that great, as should it's box office intake. If they do decide to make Angels and Demons, I'll go to see it, as it was the better book and should make the better movie."

","Having read the book (has anyone not?); it was difficult to experience suspense when you know the story but the movie covered the book very well and expressing the ideas and theories were the main focus of the movie - see MI3 if you want to see mindless action. Audrey Tautou was a charmer - more of her please. The controversy over the movie is hard to fathom. I think the Catholic church gets some bad press but then with secret organizations like Opus Dei what do they expect. The idea of Jesus being married and having a child is much easier to accept than that of the resurrection. Most of us never challenge the basis of our beliefs as nearly all of us are born into them via our parents and if it does nothing else the book and movie will arouse a questioning and maybe lead to either an affirmation or rejection of what we've been brought up to believe in without ever giving it a second thought."

As for a comment about dialog presented as in soaps with maximum repetition, there wasn't a word wasted in this script. Just to see all those places I'd only read about was fantastic. One problem was a blue-eyed 'albino'. Couldn't understand this. Perhaps the whole loses a fraction of a point for this, but the rest was excellent.

Given the premise of male-female teaming up to accomplish something they could just as easily have called it the Da Vinci Co-Ed but that might imply even a scintilla of chemistry between Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou and thus run foul of the Trade Descriptions Act. I have no problem with the locations but one Louvre doesn't make a stunner and the best you can say for Ron Howard is that he knows which end of the camera to point at the action.

","The critical reaction to this film was just vile, but then a lot of normal people who saw it afterward said, ""Nah, it's pretty good."" I'm here to tell you that the initial critical reception was right on the money for this one. It's God-awful. A symbologist and a cryptologist (two fields of study which probably do exist, I suppose, but sound awfully made-up) get framed for murder and get caught up in an ages-old clash between factions of the Catholic church. The movie mostly consists of the two scholars (Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou) racing from one locale to another solving riddles and puzzles, and just barely escaping the cops and the villains each time. The puzzles are reminiscent of the ones the Riddler produced on the 1960s Batman show: they're completely inane; no one could ever solve them, certainly not the audience. But somehow the heroes figure it all out in a matter of seconds. It's about as much fun as watching someone do a Sudoku when you don't know the rules. And the characters are as paper-thin as they could possibly be. I had absolutely zero involvement with them or their adventure. Dan Brown's novel is famously terrible, and, while I've often heard cinema improves his painful prose, after watching this film I shiver to think what actually reading him feels like. If the plot weren't enough to convince me, the dialogue is terrible. The actors are all only here for the fat paycheck. Hanks in particular seems completely dissatisfied with the part. Possibly the worst movie of the year."
"gtodmon","6","4","10","25 June 2006"," Somehow disappointing
","As a fen of Dan Brown's novel, I must admit I was rather disappointed by the movie. The worst part was the casting - neither Tom Hanks, nor Audrey Tautou were right for their parts. Perhaps, only Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany fitted my imagination. Also, some important parts of the book were skipped and I believe it would be hard for someone who doesn't know the story, to follow it completely. This also stole from the tension and dynamics, which are crucial to ""The Da Vinci Code"". I must mention that the effects were good and there were some amusing moments that made the film entertaining. So, I suppose those who haven't read the book would enjoy the movie; fens of the novel, on the other hand, will be frustrated."

","It's a Harry Potter for adults, the difference is that Harry Potter is fictitious and Jesus really existed, you can not invent or re invent someone's history,based on pure lies. I think it's just a retaliation on the Pasion of Christ. This film only helps to confuse people especially those who have no faith.Life is crazy and our young people are getting worse.This helps to encourage lack of respect,disobedience and abuse freedom. That's why it is harder everyday to keep families together. No matter what faith or religion you belong to, everyone of them is built on obedience, not murder and invented gossip.The life of Jesus is clearly written in the Bible there is nothing hidden. This film insults my intelligence, I would never permit anybody bad mouth my mother or father or in that case anybody I truly know, well neither can I accept fallacies over Jesus."

Even the great McKellan was...substandard...mind you his substandard performance absolutely overshadowed anyone else's.<br/><br/>It seemed absolutely disjointed to me. Further.. I found it silly that the priory would risk the life of the blood royal and not intervene the minute the caretaker was killed.<br/><br/>The more they tried to rush the pace, the more disjointed it became with some of the most stupid flash back scenes ever filmed. I mean did we REALLY need to be shown how langdon and the french chick got out of the plane BEFORE the cops arrived at the hangar? And where were the templars? Ain't they supposed to be the body guards of the blood royal? Why were they not watching over the french chick 24/7? And the whole council of shadows thing... my goodness... Made no sense what so ever. What? The advance of DNA testing forced their hand??? PLEASE!!!! Even if they interred the bones of a relative of yours that was 2000 years old, you can pretty much bet that your DNA would be significantly different and the test would be inconclusive. In fact, it may even indicate that half the palestinians/israelis are related to Christ.<br/><br/>But I digress. The film tried TOO hard I think. Obviously it would have been better to create a mini series for television... one where you can create 4-6 hours of it and get the detail and characters developed a hell of a lot more.<br/><br/>Did we really need to know that Silas killed his daddy?

Some organizations have gone through the trouble to protect these people by having a representative of theirs show up at the theatre before the film started, just to explain what they were getting themselves into.

"ido50","3","4","10","21 May 2006"," A poorly made interpretation of a properly made book
","The DaVinci Code is arguably one of the best thriller books ever written. The plot is interesting, fast paced and the suspense is constant, from beginning to end. Dan Brown knows exactly which parts of the plot to thicken/lengthen and which to shorten.<br/><br/>The same can NOT be said on the movie. Ron Howard's work as director seems highly inadequate. Important parts of the book were not emphasized, most times shown so casually, the viewer can hardly notice them, and sometimes not shown at all. On the other hand, less important parts of the book were over emphasized. Weird interpretations were given and changes were done to key elements in the book, sometimes such ridicules changes that only lessen the suspense of the movie.<br/><br/>Seems to me that if I hadn't read the book prior to seeing this movie, I wouldn't have understood many parts of the movie.<br/><br/>While the book builds the plot carefully, never letting the reader get lost or lose interest, the movie simply bombs the viewer with information. Mysterious riddles are solved within seconds, ancient secrets are revealed as if were hidden behind a glass window (For example, a long search at one of the world's biggest libraries became a 3 seconds internet search using a cellular phone), deductions are made with no basis whatsoever. Nothing seems to go wrong. Suddenly Langdon and Neveu find the grail's previous burial place and a library of grail documents. Suddenly Langdon decides Sophie is a descendant of Jesus. Suddenly a woman appears and claims she's Sophie's grandmother, and Sophie accepts all of it as if irreputable truth.<br/><br/>Though initially impressed by the cast, the main stars' performances were also highly inadequate. Tom Hanks was very disappointing as Robert Langdon. He is boring, unrelatable and so unconvincing, to the point of being ridicules in the eys of the viewer. Audrey Tautou was a bad choice for Sophie Neveu. She is uninteresting, has virtually no chemistry with Hanks, and leaves the impression of being neither smart nor mentally strong, as Neveu of the book. Ian McKellen was a disappointment as well. He makes Teabing seem an unserious figure. The scene were he is revealed as 'The Teacher' is badly made, unconvincing and, as many times in the film, not loyal to the book. Teabing's footprints in the Issac Newton scene are laughable, as can be said on the scene were he is being taken into custody by the police. Jean Reno was also boring, and seemed to be a remote figure that somehow found its way into the plot. Only Paul Bettany as Silas seemed to give an adequate performance.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a huge disappointment. It is boring, hard to understand, and makes the controversial, yet plausible ideas presented in the book seem impossible and ridicules in the movie.<br/><br/>See it if you want to, but don't waste your time unless you've read the book."

"AlanSKaufman","10","4","10","19 May 2006"," The Da Vinci Code Paradox
","Ever since childhood I have been fascinated by two historical paradoxes. The first was the American Revolution which simultaneously established the land of freedom and the land of slavery. The second was Christianity which simultaneously embraced Jewish Jesus Christ and anti-Semitism.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code movie expands on the latter paradox by postulating that Jesus was married to Jewish Mary Magdalene and fathered a daughter, whose descendants may possess certain of His powers. Protagonists contend the church has ruthlessly suppressed these people and their supporters because they would undermine masculine authority by exalting women to a divine level. At one point in the film, certain people in hiding claiming to be these descendants reminded me of Holocaust survivors.<br/><br/>The Magdalene theory is not new. Most scholars reject it based on historical reasons and Christians reject it based on faith that Christ was single and celibate as Apostle Paul later declared a man of God should be. But The Da Vinci Code does not fail as a good movie despite rejecting its specific theory:<br/><br/>One) Much time is spent exploring the concept of paradox and the film demonstrates how several people looking at the same object see different things. Da Vinci's painting depicting the Last Supper is beautifully examined in this manner with the latest computer special effects.<br/><br/>Two) We are presented with a fair account of the historical controversies concerning the humanity and divinity of Jesus. As a Bible student, I am impressed by how effectively this description is offered to mass audiences who may not be well versed in such matters.<br/><br/>Three) Pictures tell a thousand words. Drama takes precedence over the intellectual presentation and holds your attention. We witness fervor from the antagonists, partake in a breath taking thriller, experience surprises galore, and are moved by the psychological development of the parties.<br/><br/>I won't disclose the ending but I can hint that it returns to the subject I raised at the beginning. I once read an explanation that Polish Catholic anti-Semitism resulted from being envious of the Jews' physical relation to Jesus even if not His literal descendants. Envy, because Jews experience a family closeness to Christ that Gentiles never achieve.<br/><br/>You see, the real paradox of The Da Vinci Code is that whether the theory about Mary Magdalene is true or not, the conclusion remains the same. Relatives of Jesus Christ do in fact exist. How about them apples?"
"cinematic_aficionado","8","4","10","19 May 2006"," and the truth shall set you free
","As with most people I was looking very forward in watching the Da Vinci Code. My anticipation was rather elevated taking into account the popularity of the novel where everybody I knew could not stop talking about it, as well as the controversy caused by its release.<br/><br/>Walking to a very rainy Leicester Square this morning I was greeted very peacefully by a news channel as well as religious campaigners.<br/><br/>As far as the film is concerned I would rate it as quite good. It has a marvellous cast, a second to none plot and it is directed very skilfully. From the very first scenes the audience is bound to enter the world of the book and you will be kept there until the very end.<br/><br/>The best part was its unpredictability. Every scene would offer a new twist and where you think it's all over.it is not.<br/><br/>Although I enjoyed the viewing and it is a film I have already recommended to friends and family I would not class it as an excellent (10/10) due to its ending which I found to be very anti-climax.<br/><br/>Furthermore and in my opinion the church's response has been rather exaggerated; it is clear where religious groups take offence but to me it is not a theme I would consider insulting to religion although everyone is entitled to their opinion.<br/><br/>My best advice is to watch this and think for yourself what it means to you."
"xanthe78","6","4","10","18 May 2006"," You're better off reading the book.
","I went and saw it last night, and what do you know, for once, I actually agree with the reviews... in a way.<br/><br/>My main thoughts on the movie, is that for such a fast paced book, the movie is rather slow. It's overlong (almost 2 and a half hours??) and I found myself looking at my watch about an hour into the film. That's never a good sign.<br/><br/>The car chase scene at the beginning is badly filmed. One would think that maybe it would have been better if another director was chosen for at least that particular scene - I hate to say it, but sometimes the big blockbusters with the great car chase scenes (like The Bourne Identity, Ronin, etc) make or break the film. The music was rather maudlin, with no real memorable scenes for it to even attempt to come into it's own.<br/><br/>The acting was terrible. It's the first film I've seen with Tom Hanks being such a wet blanket. He's usually so good in any type of film, but he just didn't look like he cared very much about acting in this one. I've only seen Audrey Tatou (did I spell her name right?) in this, so I don't know if this is the way she normally acts, but she didn't seem to have a great bearing on her role. The scenes with her and Silas seemed to lack depth, and she seemed to be out of her depth with the more emotional scenes. Is this how she normally acts? Paul Bettany as Silas wasn't too bad. I think he had the 'mad monk' down reasonably well in his mind. In the end I couldn't help but feel sorry for him, as everyone (and everything) that he cared about was using him, and his character is one that stayed in my mind a little longer than any other for his depth.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Ian McKellen did a fantastic job. Every time he was on the screen, you couldn't help but be drawn to his character. The facial nuances, the longing in his voice... HE is what made this movie bearable. Every movie I see with him in it proves again how great an actor he truly is. Plus he was the actor that brought in a little humour to the film, something that otherwise was sorely lacking.<br/><br/>My favourite scene in the whole film, and the one thing I keep thinking back on even now as I'm typing this, is the 'discussion' that Langdon and Teabing have about the history of the grail. But, come to think of it, it was also my favourite scene in the book, so that may not be a huge surprise :) The effects (yes, they have special effects) were great. To be able to literally fuse two different era's in the one scene hasn't been used to this great effect in a long time, if ever.<br/><br/>But is it a film I would recommend? Probably not. If you (like the majority of the world) have read the book, then you'll be disappointed. It's the first movie I've seen where mobile phones went off (twice actually) and NO-ONE shushed the owners. One of the people I went and saw the film with (who hadn't read the book) fell asleep within 45 minutes of the film starting, and stayed asleep for the rest of the film. What she did see, she found confusing.<br/><br/>So, basically, I'm guessing I'm saying that this movie ain't a bad film as such, but it's a better video/DVD film than a theatre film. 6/10"

","""The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost"" secularly head for the coast as I remember American Pie reporting. The Sisters of Saint Joseph had a decidedly different take for this Catholic boy, one that brooked no argument against the divinity of the Son, Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>So with what glee have I read Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code and seen the faithful film version directed by Ron Howard. Anyone who would dare compromise the nun's version to posit Jesus marrying Mary Magdalene is an instant hero for this critically thinking, subsequently Jesuit-trained professor and film critic, whose skepticism the well-wimpled ones punished mercilessly and regularly.<br/><br/>The film, with Tom Hanks as the Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, who helps unravel a centuries-old mystery about the Holy Grail and the uncelibate Christ, is a lengthy debate about the truth of the myth and the places of Opus Dei and the Knights Templar in the history of the church's violent past. Regardless of where you stand on the possibility that Christ was not divine, this film makes you interested in the debate and immediately suspicious of the Catholic Church's goodness.<br/><br/>But that skepticism is healthy in many ways, not dangerous at all to the doctrinaire leadership in real life, yet in this film the conservative church groups fear it enough to murder in the name of the Lord. So the laity joins the priests in beating the devil at his own game. Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ dwells overly long on the physical suffering of Christ; Howard and Brown dwell too much on the thrills if the chase. As Jimmy Durante quipped, ""Everybody wants to get into the act."" The film is so faithful to the novel that the slowest part of the film, the chase after the intellectual exposition of the theory by the mesmerizing Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabling, is just as weak and it is in the novel.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code may turn out to be the best movie this summer: It's faithful to the novel, intelligent in exposition, and an easy 2 1/2 hrs of intrigue. The faithful translation of Brown's provocative theories alone should please the highbrows; the thriller component should satisfy the summer sunbathers."

","This was much better than I expected, and it is far from the worst film ever made. My dad loved the book, and he thinks the film did it justice, and at 17 I liked it. Though with all the different views on Christianity and the complicated plot, it is confusing and convoluted. The dialogue is a little clunky, the violence like the whipping quite disturbing, and the direction perhaps too leisurely. But this is compensated by the splendid locations, especially Paris itself, and the music by Hans Zimmer was very nice, if not his best work. The acting was pretty decent, though all have given better performances, and this includes Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou in the leads. Jean Reno and Paul Bettany are pretty solid, but it is Ian McKellan, who is a great actor and rarely disappoints in anything he's in, who gives the best performance of the film. All in all, a good film, though it could have been better. It was cleverly constructed though confusing, and it is nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox."

","1st watched 1/7/2009 (Dir-Ron Howard): OK mystery-drama from Director Ron Howard. With all the hype leading up to this movie you'd think that Ron Howard was removed from the good-old-boy club due to him movielyzing issues that question Jesus and the Christian doctrine. The problem is that this has been done before with other movies like ""Last Temptation of Christ"" and others without all the hoopla because those movies weren't mainstream. Despite this, the movie has to be reviewed for it's merit as a movie instead of what it reveals that's shocking. The movie is basically a quest for the holy grail and answers to who Jesus really was; a Deity or just a man. A secret society is supposedly holding this answer and making it secretive and a grand master of the cult tries to reveal the answers to his niece before his death. Where the Tom Hanks character comes in, is that he reads religious symbols and is brought in to help determine why this man died and who killed him. The movie is not unlike adventures like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""National Treasure"" except the answers could bring down a religion. Audrey Toutau plays the niece who finds out more about why she's involved the longer the movie goes forward. The chemistry between Toutou and Hanks isn't that great and since they are the main characters it makes the movie less interesting. The revelations about Christ's possible mortality and descendants is kind of presented as just part of a mystery and therefore isn't that shocking. The movie is entertaining to a point, but nothing new. All the hype, again, doesn't make for a good movie --- but it's not bad, just not good enough to recommend."

"BA_Harrison","4","3","7","30 July 2006"," Disappointing big-budget adaptation of the Dan Brown bestseller.
","I've read a couple of Dan Brown's books, finding them fun but ultimately disappointing due to their ridiculous plot twists and unbelievable conclusions; the author's prose is also less than sparkling.<br/><br/>But whatever you think of Dan Brown's writing skills, you've got to admire his ability to take an age old theme, thoroughly research it, weave a potboiler story around it and then sell the results to the masses. The Holy Grail has been the subject of countless books, but Brown's genius is to make it accessible to the average Joe. So, in THE DA VINCI CODE, he wraps the mystery of who or what is the Holy Grail in standard thriller clichés (murder, action, double-crosses), and serves up an easily digestible platter designed to appeal the widest possible market.<br/><br/>On paper, Ron Howard might seem like a reasonable choice for the job of bringing Brown's book to the silver screen; a popular Oscar-winning director, Howard specialises in film-making for the masses. But in tackling this tale of murderous zealots and religious conspiracies, Howard is, in fact, way over his head. Out of his usual territory (sappy dramas, family movies), he flounders with the mystery plot line and occasional action sequences. Poor old Ron just isn't made of the right stuff to tackle this controversial tale of murder and intrigue head on.<br/><br/>Brown's books tend to have complex and preposterous plots, and turning THE DA VINCI CODE into a convincing movie was always going to be a challenge. Howard gives it his best shot, but he ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying adaptation of the bestseller, ending up with a muddled effort which requires better structuring and more detail to be wholly satisfying (although with the film already running at a whopping two and a half hours, I can't imagine sitting through even more!).<br/><br/>The cast of the movie fare little better. With Howard at the helm, it was not at all surprising when lovable all-American Tom Hanks was chosen to play the hero of the story, famed symbologist Robert Langdon, and although Hanks is a versatile actor, this kind of role just doesn't seem to suit him; he spends most of the proceedings looking more than a little lost. The French contingent is equally unimpressive; Audrey Tatou, who plays his sidekick Sophie Neveu, struggles with the dreadful dialogue whilst Jean Reno plays his usual stock Frenchman with no enthusiasm. Only the Brits manage to give anything resembling a decent performance with Ian McKellen making the drivel he is forced to deliver sound plausible, and Paul Bettany stealing the show as albino assassin Silas.<br/><br/>The film glides through the contents of the book, sometimes glossing over certain points too quickly, and at other times labouring issues a little too much (Langdon's claustrophobia, for example, had no bearing on the plot yet was mentioned several times). Those uninitiated with the Grail mythosthe bloodline of Christ, the Merovingians, the Knights Templar, Mary Magdalene, the Priory of Sion et al.will probably find following proceedings a chore. After 150 minutes, even those with an interest in such things may have even had enough."

","The plot line of the The DaVinci Code is fairly taut, without too many holes, contradictions or loose ends. I imagine that to many Christians, the explanation of the faux-religious root of the mystery will seem slow and pedantic. As a non-Christian, however, I appreciated the intellectual hand-holding, and recommend that you forgive this minor fault. There aren't too many surprising twists, however. Both my wife and I guessed the identity of the secret character far in advance of the movie's revelation.<br/><br/>Part of what makes a murder/conspiracy mystery movie work for me is people's reactions to the mystery itself and the mayhem that affects them as they unravel the mystery. All throughout The DaVinci Code, I kept waiting for the two protagonists to react in a way that was consistent with (a) the continuing mortal danger they were in (b) the background of their characters. How many academics (Indiana Jones excepted) can you think of who wouldn't retch at the sight of a ritually murdered body, and who wouldn't freeze like a deer in the headlights with a gun pointed in their face? And isn't it reasonable to expect a veteran cop, even a desk-bound one, to have some degree of clear-headedness in a crisis? Instead, you get the opposite. Professor Langdon goes from befuddled to resourceful with a cool reserve that James Bond would admire in an instant, apparently immune to the effects of adrenaline. Conversely, Det. Neve spends most of her screen time looking frightened or confused, and occasionally disabling bad guys. And both of them seem strangely muted in their reactions, given the excitement of a grail quest combined with a constant effort to avoid being killed. Combined, this doesn't make for particularly sympathetic or interesting characters.<br/><br/>The most interesting character is Sir Leigh Teabing, a friendly rival academic of Langdon's, and who joins Langdon and Neve in their adventure. To say more, unfortunately, would spoil the movie."

It is totally different from the original book by Dan Brown!<br/><br/>Your have to Wonder if Dan Brown even read the screenplay before they started shooting the movie! Personally I wouldn't let Hollywood turn something I wrote into a piece of crap. And yes!

","The Da Vinci Code is one of those movies that doesn't reach its potential as a movie because it doesn't realise the depth of character development needed to keep the characters interesting between action sequences. Perhpas Mr Howard should have taken a leaf out of the book of Mr Jackson to get a real view of how it could have been done. Instead, what keeps this movie going is the promise that somehow Langdon would find the secret- a promise that can only take this movie so far.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is interesting as Robert Langdon but the fact of the matter is that his character is too one-dimensional to really empathise with him. The same goes for Audrey Tatou whose revelation at the end is predictable and doesn't really add to the story as much as it should. The supporting cast however does a good job in keeping the storing interesting- with Ian McKellan stealing the show and acting the two principles off the screen. Alfred Molina is a sinister and driven villain as Bishop Arigarossa and Paul Bettany playing fanatical priest with glazed eyes and frightening devotion are also great, though underused.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is that this movie drags when these supporting actors are not on the screen despite its interesting premise ( which, by the way, is not new and has been bounced around historical fiction for a while ).<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is worth a look if you're interested in history and are prepared to put a hypothetical theory into reality. But don't expect too much as it doesn't move mountains like other religious films, such as Life of Brian."

","As a Ron Howard fan, I knew that I would have to see this movie at some point and I do make a point often to read the reviews of viewers beforehand and after. This movie has received a lot of negative reviews, but from what I can decipher, the majority of them come from those who entered the theatre with preconceived notions.<br/><br/>One must remember that almost every movie adapted from a book will always be measured against the book and therefore any negative criticism has to be mitigated by the fact that those having first read the book see the movie with certain prejudices. Whether or not Tom Hanks makes a ""good"" Robert Langdon is irrelevant to the movie; it is only a personal observation based on the mental image of the character created by the reader while reading the novel. The same is true of the other characters and for what bits of the story included or omitted in the final cut in comparison to the book.<br/><br/>A movie with the pre-publicity that The Da Vinci Code had (based on the legal battle and the subject matter) also will prejudice many against it. There are those, insecure in their faith, who will always speak out vehemently at the slightest questioning of religion, God or our moral code and, as usual, they are best left ignored. There are those also who will take a negative bias simply as a result of the publicity, sort of a that same sense of non-conformity and rebelliousness that leads teenagers to smoke.<br/><br/>My point here is that you, as a viewer, have to ask yourself what it is that you want from a movie such as The Da Vinci Code. Having not read the novel or followed the trial and looking to appreciate a decent thriller without having to question my spiritual and/or religious opinions, The Da Vinci code was a decent movie. Not great, not bad. It certainly isn't the best work that Ron Howard or Tom Hanks has done and it could stand to shed a good 15 to 20 minutes, but that's all it is. It isn't going to shake the foundations of Christianity; it has a plausible plot, some of the escape stunts are a bit far-fetched, some characters are over used or underused, the police are essentially bumbling idiots...hey, it's just standard Hollywood fare, but with somewhat more weighty subject matter. Enjoy it for what it is."

A better choice would have been Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is stolen by Ian McCellan, who turns in a fabulous performance as a rogue providing further mystery to a very old church secret. Alfred Molina, as the renegade priest, brings sustained energy to the role.<br/><br/>The picture is too long and should have ended with the McCellan arrest.<br/><br/>The murderous monk is portrayed by someone who looks like a very young Malcolm McDowall of ""A Clockwork Orange"" fame.<br/><br/>It would have been interesting how Mel Gibson would have handled this film.

"henrypijames","6","3","7","24 May 2006"," Redundant for those who have read the book
","If you have neither read the book nor planned to read it any time soon, you shall find this movie perfectly entertaining. However, to all those of you who have already read the book, the movie may very likely appear simply boring.<br/><br/>Generally I prefer to watch a movie adaptation of a bestseller novel *after* reading the original story itself. Following this habit, I read the book in the last three days before I saw the movie tonight. Accompanied by a very fresh and detailed memory of the novel, I found myself yearning to fast-forward (not that I could) during the whole movie - until the very end.<br/><br/>The thing is, this movie offers no additional value to the readers of the book. The acting is average, quite unimpressive - neither in good nor in bad way. The camera work is plain as well, there's hardly any spectacular scene - not even the final one, which has certainly been designed to be moving but doesn't really fulfill that expectation. There is little special effect in this movie - which is nobody's fault because the story simply doesn't require much. In the end, nothing of this movie exceeds a reader's own imagination in any aspect.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the story has proved to be quite hard to compress for the screen. Even with a length of over two hours, the movie has cut off some significant parts of the original story and squeezed what's left even more remarkably, resulting in many small inconsistencies, logic holes and incredible speedups - specially regarding the development of human emotions over time (or rather no time, in the case of the movie), all of which not present in the book. I don't want to blame the screen writers for doing a bad job, I just think the story is simply hard to adapt in this way. Maybe if the movie had cut even more parts of the novel, it could have handle the remain more properly?<br/><br/>Bottom line, the story itself is definitely worth enjoying - as long as you don't take it as an religious insult, of course. Whether you choose the book or the movie is up to you, however the former makes the latter pretty much redundant.<br/><br/>PS: Sophie is definitely more attractive in my imagination. ;)"

Unfortunately the move The Da Vinci Code doesn't have the exciting, fun spirit of Indiana Jones. It barrels along, explaining everything that happens, but not letting us try to figure out the puzzles that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) encounter. The film looks great, and I for one did not mind the flashbacks to the ""historical"" events described.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie has it's moments, usually with Silas (Pual Bettany) or Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), and looks very nice, but fails to capture the feeling of mystery or excitement that the book did."

I tell you what it reminded me of  you remember those educational videos we used to watch at school? We'll it was like one of those  but with good actors!

","Honestly. Some of the reviews I have seen sound like some high school student's Cliff Notes review of Hamlet. Ignore them. They're not worth a glance.<br/><br/>Something that everyone seems to forget -- this is a FICTIONAL tale. Dan Brown wrote a story -- a ""story"" -- which asks people to suspend belief and enjoy turning pages at a rapid pace through a narrative that spans 24 hours. And it was a great story. I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Now put it on the screen. Put Ron Howard in the director's seat, and have Tom Hanks star. Point to those who are accusing them of blasphemy, devil worship, who are trying to ""debunk the codes"", swearing to boycott this film, whatever else -- both men are Catholic.<br/><br/>Ain't nothing not to like seeing here. It's beautifully filmed. Paris, the Louvre, the French countryside, the beautiful old mansions and the castles and the churches, what a trip, and they were just magnificent to see.<br/><br/>Ain't nothing to insult your intelligence here, either. It's intense. It's not ""talky"" (goodness, children, if you're going to criticize, how about reading the book first, see how ""talky"" it *could* have been!), it's not dull, pedantic -- e-gad, what vocabularies these critics have, and yet not one of them seems to have a clue about the actual definitions of the words they parrot.<br/><br/>I've read the book. I go to church. My PASTOR enjoyed the story, and has been looking forward to the movie. Many in the congregation have the same idea, it's a story, a variation, something to make you not ""question your beliefs"", but instead, may even re-inforce them -- without ""shaking your foundations"".<br/><br/>The Priory of Sion was a real sect, it truly existed in Medieval Europe. The Knights Templar, the army of the Priory really were part of the crusades, but their campaign was delegated by the Priory, not the Catholic church. They were very powerful, influential, and wealthy. And they were slaughtered by the envious. The rumor is that they continued to exist in secret. Back somewhere in the mid-50's this was supposedly proved untrue. The whole basis of this film is that this ""proof"" was also false.<br/><br/>You know what I think really annoys the critics about this movie? There are no wild explosions, no fantastic shootouts, no X-Men, no 00 agents running around, no megalomaniacs trying to take over the world -- there is only Tom Hanks, a professor, nonetheless, but a fairly ordinary person -- and the mad pace of travel is one night and into another day, not weeks, no ""epic"". There was no revenge, no buried treasure (in the literal sense), there was no hack and slash -- they were asked to use their minds, and the critics don't want to think.<br/><br/>Nobody can tell anyone what to think or to do or to be -- not really. So don't let a movie critic who you don't even know tell you that because they don't understand something, you can't possibly understand it either. This movie is meant to entertain you. Suspend the reality of this reality for a couple of hours. Eat popcorn. Be entertained. Enjoy."

It was fantastic! It was a thrilling, interesting mystery with lots of great twists and turns. An excellent page turner! Now we have the film adaptation.<br/><br/>Going into this movie, I knew what was going to happen. I knew all the characters, twists and turns. So what was I expecting with this film? This film follows the novel so well that anyone who has read it can see everything that going to happen from miles away. Does that ruin the fun? Does that ruin the mystery? It all depends on how you look at it.<br/><br/>For me, I got what I wanted out of it, which was a faithful adaptation but I do understand were the critics slightly seeing any problems. The film is very much a mystery with fun and thrilling moments but the critics wanted to see an epic thriller that is mixed with the fun and mystery of the plot. The critics wanted too much out of it. Watching this film, seeing the characters and scenes from the novel come to life, the film gives exactly what was in the novel and nothing more. I can clearly see why people will love it, like it and hate it. The film was way too over hyped and mis-advertised as an over-the-top epic thriller.<br/><br/>So, did I like the film? Yes, I liked it very much but it's mainly because I didn't walk into it thinking this would be an epic thriller. The story was engaging and interesting without ever going way to over the top. It was fun to see the story unfold in front of my eyes. Like reading the novel, I was hooked. The acting was top-notch with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou leading the way as Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu. Both were fantastic. Jean Reno and Alfred Molina were both very good as Captain Fache and Bishop Aringarosa but the best performances were Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing and Paul Bettany as Silas. Truly great performances by both. McKellen was lots of fun to watch and Bettany was scary and thrilling.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard gave the film a creepy and dark tone but at the same time, keep it light enough so nothing would seem over the top. The production design and cinematography were breathtaking and beautiful. The music by Hans Zimmer was also a great touch, adding to each scene.<br/><br/>I feel this film will be better praised in time like other adapted films like Blade Runner and Hannibal. Like The Da Vinci Code, they were mis-advertised and people wanted too much out of them. Hopefully, this film will be looked at in a better light in time.<br/><br/>To sum this up, The Da Vinci Code isn't an epic thriller. It's a mystery with thrilling moments. I do like the novel more but the film is a faithful adaptation of the novel without adding anything new. Simply put, a great adaptation of a great novel. 9/10"

","The minor genre of religion-fiction practically appeared with the cinematic adaptation of the novel by Henry Morton Robinson, ""The Cardinal"", that Otto Preminger took to the screen in 1963. Inspired by the life of the Cardinal Spellman, this tried that its publication was forbidden. Afterwards, the successful version of another best-seller would arrive: ""The Shoes of the Fisherman"", by Morris West, which Michael Anderson took to the cinema in 1966, and was premonitory of Pope Joannes Paulus II. However, this minor genre consolidated with ""The Name of the Rose"", by Umberto Eco, that Jean-Jacques Annaud directed in 1986. And now, making use of the phenomenon of sales of a book by Dan Brown (more than 40 million copies, in 44 languages), the industry of Hollywood has seen in such a thriller (like this qualifies it in the cover Mondadori in his last edition) ""the kitchen of the eggs of gold"".<br/><br/>On the famous North American novelist (born in 1964) 'the portrait' was already made in this by the Spanish journalist Ángel Sánchez, who wrote in 'El Periódico de Catalunya': ""He is a brilliant and imaginative professor who, since he was kid, loves the crosswords, puzzle, riddles, symbols, etcetera, facilitated by his father, a mathematician of high level. It is for this reason that he lavishes their novels (because they are not scientific books, but novelizes fables) deciphering secret cabala. 'The Da Vinci Code' is about the secret supposition key of the Christianity: that Jesus of Nazareth married Mary of Magdala and they both had descendants. Although some have seen in Brown a mixture of John Grisham and Umberto Eco, its scarce rigor and his little demanding prose, from a literary point of view, do not do it winner of the two million sold copies in Spain and Latin America."" (March 27, 2005). However, the author of the novel holds that what he describes is substantially authentic, for ""secret documents"" which he makes out that he knows endorse it. Even then, before the critiques that have been done him, Dan Brown has opted to add ""a work of fiction"" in his web that ""The Da Vinci Code is a novel, that is."" (January 30, 2006).<br/><br/>In the face of the phenomenon Da Vinci, the professor Massino Introvigne, an Italian sociologist -specialized in estrus, innovatory societies and religion-violence relationship-, has dismantled all the assertions of his North American colleague through a book titled ""The Illuminati and the Priorate of Sion. The truth in 'Angels and demons' and 'The Code Da Vinci'"" (2005), where he proves the falseness of Dan Brown and discovers the theory of the Great Conspiracy -in which some include masons, Templars and even extraterrestrial ones-; a com-plot that catches the simple people of today, who are so prone to simplify, the complexity of the history, in emergent, but false myths. On her part, the medievalist historian Sandra Miesel says that the book has so many errors that ""I surprise myself when in The Da Vinci Code meeting something that is exact"".<br/><br/>The company Sony-Columbia, because of the big cinematic business that her provided with the novel, bought the rights of this thriller of religion-fiction in order to carry out a commercial movie that, undoubtedly, can hurt many believers; since the Roman Catholic Church and their institutions remain insulted. With everything, although the Yankee-Japanese major was asked for she put at the beginning of the film -to avoid possible demands for calumny or defamation- of any resemblance with the reality being pure coincidence, has not agreed to do such a warning. Only Jim Kennedy, director of Communication of Sony, declared: ""It is a fiction film of fiction, not a documentary. We do not want to offend anybody"".<br/><br/>Before the premier of the film, the professor Marc Carroggio, from the Università Della Santa Croce (Roma), would pronounce himself like this: ""The problem of a script of this type is that it 'criminalizes' a group of people. It presents the Church as a band of criminals that for two thousand years has been been about everything in order to keep a great lie hidden. Even if it is grotesque, and sometimes a little comical, an odious portrait of an institution ends up being offered, and is it proved that the odious portraits generate feelings of hatred in people that lack critical resources. It seems to me that we do not need more caricatures of any religion. We should be all of the part of the concord, of the tolerance, of the understanding"".<br/><br/>Directed with more profession than formal brightness by a worker from Hollywood, Ron Howard (born in 1954), filmmaker of ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001) and ""Cinderella Man"" (2005), with Tom Hanks (for his usual Russell Crowe, Catholic, refused the role) and Andrey Tautou (Amélie) as the protagonist couple, the film follows with quite a lot of faithfulness the tangled original text, but synthesizes the speeches, caricatures and adulterates characters (as that of the inspector Fache, which interprets Jean Reno). Likewise, insists in some violent and morbid passages perhaps also in front to the box-office. With a certain climate of suspense and a vibrating rhythm, in attractive scenarios -as the novel-, recruits the spectator to sell him ""cat for hare"". I think that the new movie by Ron Howard is a mere product of the series B, without hardly creative category, which soon the film goers will forget.<br/><br/>In a period that in Western we have condemned the caricatures of Mahoma, and some ecclesiastical authorities have already pronounced themselves against this novel and the commercial movie, one may suppose that the historians and specialists will continue disqualifying ""The Da Vinci Code"" as artistic and literary work for its lack of rigor and null intellectual category. It is more, if the world general public avoided the one viewed of such a film and he did not buy the video games that the Hollywood company announces would abound except these misleading productions."

"jcanettis","9","3","7","20 May 2006"," An Excellent Adaptation of An Excellent Book
","When a book like ""Da Vinci Code"" needs to be adapted to the big screen, the task is usually extremely difficult. The ""Da Vinci Code"" book is not only a great thriller, but it also fascinates the reader with the abundance of puzzles, trivia, and historical information that it contains. But above all, it is a book which raises an alternative version regarding the roots of Christianity: Whether this version is right or wrong is irrelevant here; Dan Brown provides the reader with an opinion, and it is up to the reader himself to decide the true version of events.<br/><br/>Given that ""Da Vinci Code"" is such a complex book, does it have any chance to succeed in the big screen? Fortunately for us, the answer is a solid yes! Although I went to watch the film rather reserved, bracing myself for a big anticlimax, I was very positively surprised to see that Ron Howard has done a great job. The ""Da Vinci Code"" film is as close to the ""Da Vinci Code"" book as it gets. The plot follows loyally the book's story, and more importantly, the overall atmosphere is exactly what one would expect after having read the novel.<br/><br/>As far as the characters are concerned, I believe that each of the protagonists has been correctly cast to perform his/her role: Tom Hanks is quite convincing as the investigative professor Langdon; although I thought him to be a bit misplaced for this role when I first heard that he was the one to take it, I was utterly relieved to be proved wrong to be skeptical. His screen partner, Audrey Tautou, is also very good as the charming cryptanalyst Sophie Nevau.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen and Jean Reno are definitely the best choices for their respective roles: It would not be an exaggeration if I said that when I read the book I imagined the looks and styles of Sir Lee and Captain Fache as being quite similar to the ones of the two actors. Both of them make a perfect fit in their roles.<br/><br/>Finally, Paul Bettany plays the difficult role of Silas more than satisfactorily.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is very impressive, and as I said previously, it follows the book loyally. Hard-core book fans might be disappointed, as a film can never capture everything a book contains: However, these people should not watch the film at all, as they are bound to be disappointed no matter what. For the rest of us, who enjoyed the book and wished for a good film to complement it, ""Da Vinci Code"" is what we wanted: 9/10."
"chynadream","3","3","7","19 May 2006"," Bad DaVinci!
","A year ago, when I found out that ""The DaVinci Code"" was in the production stages, I was excited. I found out that the movie was being made, and immediately images of how this story would look on film entered my mind by the hundreds--thousands even--especially after hearing that Ron Howard would be directing. Granted, not my first choice of director, but his style and vision would contribute greatly to the storytelling effort. Nevertheless, it made me thrilled. <br/><br/>Then I heard that Tom Hanks had been chosen to play Robert Langdon. All I could say was,""Oh-oh"".That's where doubt began to seep in. Tom Hanks is a phenomenal actor.But he is NO Robert Langdon. <br/><br/>Set in magnificent locations such as the beautiful Louvre Museum in Paris, The DaVinci Code starts with the murder of a prominent curator near DaVinci's Mona Lisa and subsequently glides through the plot with the meticulous detail of, well, a curator. The story continues for two-and-a-half hours at an inconsistent speed, with dialog that could have just as easily been (and more often than not was) pulled directly out of the book, and even worse, mediocre acting that, at times, was indeed laughable. <br/><br/>The script was, at best, safe. There was no real tension, I didn't feel the excitement that I felt reading the book. At times it felt as though the screen writing was lazy and not entirely thought out. Sort of surprising considering that the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, wrote some of the most brilliant scripts in Hollywood, in my opinion (see ""Practical Magic"" and ""A Beautiful Mind""). And quite frankly, coming from the guy who wrote ""I, Robot"" and ""A Time To Kill"", I expected much, much better, something much more energetic. The adaptation disappointed me. <br/><br/>Most disappointing of all,however, was Tom Hanks's take on Robert Langdon. His acting was forced and unnatural, the performance of someone who is not comfortable in the character's skin, or who maybe doesn't know the character well enough to be the character. I am not discrediting Hanks' talent; after all, with superb cinematic gems like Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, and Apollo 13 under his belt, this guy is one of the last great actors left in a cesspool of Farrells, Pitts, and Travoltas (yeah, I said it--TRAVOLTAS!). His acting usually comes from the heart--you know he loves the roles he plays because he brings them down to a human level. Unfortunately, as Langdon, he was placed in the unfamiliar territory of action films, and sadly, that is just not his forte. Luckily for him, he was not the worst actor in the movie.<br/><br/>As Sophie Neveu, Audrey Tautou was bland and simply boring. Considering that she is in 90% of the scenes, it becomes a bit tedious and annoying to watch her. Ian McKellen was decent and entertaining as Sir Leigh Teabing, and Alfred Molina's performance as Bishop Aringarosa, while exceptionally strong and well-adapted, was unfortunately limited.Jean Reno was perfectly fine as Captain Fache.<br/><br/>The surprise stellar performance in DVC, however, comes in the form of Paul Bettany, highly underrated actor best known for his role as Charles in ""A Beautiful Mind"". As the self-punishing, sacrificially loyal monk Silas, Bettany captures the true essence and the deep internal conflict of his character with multi-dimensional precision and unbelievable heart. He understood his character most, and it truly showed. I found myself a little mesmerized every time he was on screen, even when his character was behaving like a ""monster"",which really was most of the time. I found myself most sympathetic to Silas, and the only reason for that was because of Bettany's sublime performance. Kudos to him for making my movie-going experience today bearable.<br/><br/>That's not to say that it wasn't a noble effort. I truly believe that Ron Howard felt strongly that this is one of the best films he has ever made and I have to give him credit for that. Aesthetically, the movie is pleasant, the sights majestic and the special effects, while minimal, were respectable. The scenes that went back in time were well-shot and stylistically, the film is indeed beautiful. But it falls short of the Howard magic that us film buffs have come to expect from him. My guess is that he thought that because it was The DaVinci Code, the film would speak for itself and his work was essentially minimal.<br/><br/>This is probably also the reason why he thought that it would be perfectly acceptable for him to submit it to the Cannes Film Festival. WRONG. Wrong on BOTH accounts. In fact, like the Cannes critics, I found myself giggling inadvertently at parts in the film that were not supposed to be funny and I realized why they laughed. <br/><br/>The truth is that lazy efforts by talented people are not well-received by anyone who truly knows and loves cinema, and they shouldn't be; the cast was talented, the story was compelling, the director gifted, the screenwriter, brilliant. There was no reason why this film should have been anything short of amazing. Instead, I was left with the sad and irritating realization that the Cannes critics were right, and that my money would have been better spent on ""Just My Luck"" with Lindsay Lohan. But, to be honest, I kind of saw that coming. And I really,really hated that."

I have to agree that it has some interesting sequence of events, thanks to Dan Brown's creative imagination (and apparent research). But then again, to me, it is just shocking that Dan Brown made too much easy money.

","After reading this week's edition of U.S. News & World Report, I can't help but scoff at righteous indignation. Catholics and evangelicals are in such an uproar about a fictional movie. There are plenty of movies that are based upon some false premise. It doesn't mean we have to ban movies that may introduce others. What about the widespread panic at the radio program of Orson Wells ""War of the Worlds?"" That program was so real sounding that people thought they were literally being invaded by aliens! Were aliens invading Earth? No...But it was one of the best radio programs ever created. Why? Because it was realistic. The days of cardboard cutouts and cheap outdated computer graphics are gone. We are in the wave of the future. That includes the new wave of better story lines and the courageous journey to the edge of fiction/non-fiction. I believe the best authors dip their toes into truth in order to sell their fiction. It works. Dan Brown's book was genius. Go see it for the sheer enjoyment of a thriller and almost outrageous plot line of a great FICTITIOUS cover-up of the largest religion in history. It's not true, but it's a way to grab the viewer's attention. It's almost like a ""what-if"" sort of story. How far would people go to hide a secret?

","A murder inside the Louvre in Paris leads to an incredible journey for a Harvard professor (Tom Hanks) and a beautiful French detective (Audrey Tautou) as clues and puzzles seem to point to an unbelievable secret that could rock the very foundation of the Catholic Church and Christianity as a whole. Along the way they look for help from a cryptic expert (Ian McKellen) while dodging a pesky French police officer (Jean Reno). An eclectic cloak and dagger organization which includes priest Alfred Molina and albino monk Paul Bettany also attempts everything in their power to stop Hanks and Tautou from uncovering the greatest con ever conceived by man---the possibility of Mary Magdalene's real relationship with Jesus Christ and her true historical role. Dan Brown's ridiculously successful novel sadly falls flat for the most part on the silver screen. Director Ron Howard's picture is well made and highly ambitious, but its tone is oddball, its pace is sporadic, the chemistry among its stars is nowhere to be found, and its pathos are fuzzy and uninspired. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman's (who collaborated five years ago in 2001 with Howard on the critically superior ""A Beautiful Mind"") adaptation is preposterous and totally unclear.

","Like 50 million other people around the globe, I devoured the book. I think it's great. Hokum, but wonderful hokum, and when was a thriller ever the worse for it's hokum content? So I went to see the film simply expecting to be entertained by the cinematic version of a good holiday read. Now, I'm not a demanding film-goer. I don't go and see films that I suspect I will find too challenging or boring, because I'm stressed enough by real life and when I spend my £5.50 to sit in the dark for two and a half hours, I simply want to escape from reality. Not a lot to ask, you might think? Well, it is if you go and see the da Vinci Code! Firstly, if you do go and see this film, be prepared to feel patronised. It seems rather unfortunate that during the process from book to screen somebody has obviously decided that film audiences are thicker than book audiences and that everyone who goes to the cinema is so stupid that they need plot points spelling out to them very slowly and carefully and repetitively. Oh, and most insultingly of all, boringly! Secondly, I'm sorry to say that I think one of the reasons the film is meeting with such critical derision and audience boredom is because of the casting. I know that the blame for the film not working really has to lie at the feet of the writer and director, but the casting of Tom Hanks as the man that Dan Brown describes in the book as a young Harrison Ford, essentially an action hero, creates a leaden feel from the opening moments. As I read the book, I was imagining Robert Langdon as more akin to Joe Flanigan from TV's Stargate Atlantis, who looks uncannily like a young Han Solo. But I certainly wasn't imagining someone who would be too paternalistic to win the feisty heroine! Yes, Audrey Tautou, feisty, not overwhelmed and terrified! For me, the film's only slight redemption was the arrival on screen of the ever reliable Sir Ian McKellen. But all he really managed to do was highlight the wooden acting of the rest of the cast, even the usually wonderful Jean Reno. It was all so painful to watch that I sat there thinking that a new line needs to be added to the old adage about never acting with children and animals; Never act with a British thespian unless you are one.<br/><br/>But look on the bright side. There were a few laughs. All raised by Sir Ian, inevitably. That is to say, the only intentional laughs of the evening were raised by him. For the unintentional ones, all I can say is - let the Cannes audience be your guide! THAT moment actually made me feel nauseated, patronised and appalled, but had I perhaps not been British, or had I been with a slightly more jocular crowd, giggles would doubtless have followed the squirming! However, if I really wanted a good laugh, I wouldn't have gone to see the film adaptation of a book that wasn't funny, but was a really good read. My advice? If you haven't read the book, spend your money on the paperback rather than a cinema ticket. And if you have read the book? Spend your evening re-reading it. You'll have a far better time than sitting there wondering quite how much more laboured the plot points could actually be."

"delibebek","5","2","4","20 March 2010"," Mediocre adaptation
","I won't color my attitude of the movie with any notions about the subject matter. The movie only adapts the story of the best-selling novel. Obviously it wouldn't have been funded and produced had the book not established a following; controversy didn't hurt either.<br/><br/>I watched this movie in the theater when it first came out, and I didn't find it captivating. I spent a lot of mental energy trying to follow it. I recently read the book (finally) and I found it not hard to follow at all. I found myself wondering what was wrong with the movie, that it couldn't capture the disturbingly over-explained exposition in Dan Brown's writing style. I watched it again this evening and I find the big problem to be that it follows the story too well.<br/><br/>The story about the search for some great secret, a race between the hero and heroine and a criminal reformed by a sect of the Catholic church. They want to preserve the secret and he wants to destroy it. We spend most of the movie, as we spent most of the novel, not quite being told what the secret is, but it is clear from the beginning that it involves some of the great names in history - Leonardo da Vinci, Jesus Christ, Isaac Newton, etc. It must have something to do with the church, and there is a lot of implication (and explication) about the church having forced the secret to be kept hidden.<br/><br/>Without debating whether the story has any validity, or even whether it is clever or pedestrian, the strength of it is in the way the story is told. Dan Brown wrote the book in short chapters, changing the point of view, working in minor cliffhangers of ideas here and there to keep the reader pushing forward. It is a quick read, as books go. However, when this is filmed scene by scene, it becomes tedious. It seems necessary to go into such detail, given the nature of the story, building on little bits of history and the revision and speculation of history as it has been unwritten and rewritten and wondered at even into our times.<br/><br/>Two things this movie needed were a sharper screenplay, and a director interested in pacing the story by the key plot elements, not just the action sequences.<br/><br/>Ian McKellan is excellent as Leigh Teabing. Even in his long explanations of da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" and the implied symbology contained in the composition of it, he sparkles, simply by the power of his well-trained and well-used voice. Jean Reno lives up to expectation equally well as the French police Captain chasing the hero and heroine.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is disappointing as Robert Langdon, the hero who happens to know the history inside and out, but has trouble with relatively simple anagrams that has most viewers (as readers) guessing the answer ahead of him. Tom gives us no sympathy for the character, playing him as a nearly obnoxious know-it-all that he seems in the book. Strange that he never seems to know much, but when he speaks, you would think he is only playing with us. Tom doesn't fit the image of Robert as an intellectual. He plays it as if he's the gamemaster who doesn't know what the game is. It doesn't make the viewer root for him or want to listen to his input as the story progresses. But his input and his point of view are vital and the lackluster performance gave us only the drawing star-power of a two-time Oscar winner, but none of the payoff of such a presence in the film.<br/><br/>Keeping with the book, the film has trouble finding its climactic moment. It plays on continuing the viewers' thought processes, as if we are supposed to be left with a sense of wonder about these so-called revelations that we have encountered in the story. By the time it ended, I couldn't manage to care, even though I wanted to."

Alright they were going to have to make the puzzles a little harder. I mean was there anyone who failed to solve the anagrams or mirror writing at first sight?

Where the book was fast paced and enthralling the film was slow and uninvolving. The dialogue was trite and unbelievable and the plot completely mismanaged.<br/><br/>The book certainly simplified the subject matter and adjusted facts to fit the plot, but it never insulted the reader - it assumed a knowing intelligence and a willful suspension of belief. The film however was crass and insulting in its treatment of the audience and the way it negligently failed to even bother to try and paper over the cracks and, indeed, chasms in what plot it allowed was extraordinary.<br/><br/>As far as I can see there was but one single intent in making this movie - to make money!"

","When a book is made into a movie, more often than not a lot of things are being erased, switched around or altered in order to make a cohesive film that the audience can enjoy.<br/><br/>With the Da Vinci Code there isn't really that many changes, and it is basically because the original Dan Brown book is as close to a synopsis for a movie script as you can come.<br/><br/>The movie follows the events of the book almost chronologically with some alterations which will always occur, but generally does not disrupt the flow of the story.<br/><br/>However, when director Ron Howard and his scriptwriter chose to be as faithful to the book as they have, they have forgotten one important element: interpretation. There are basically no description or depiction regarding story, character or anything else that does not come straight from the book. This fact results in the movie not being able to assert its own position in the world of the Da Vinci Code, in which it now has entered, instead it gets reduced to a visual aid for the book. <br/><br/>I perticularly found Tom Hank's Robert Langdon flat as a pancake. Hanks, who through movies such as Philadelphia and Forrest Gump really showed his awesome caliber as an actor, never really delwes into the character and makes it his own. Ron Howard and to some extent Dan Brown, had a pre-conceived idea as to how Langdon should walk, talk feel and act that Hanks seems cut out of any relation to this character. It gives him no room to manuver and he becomes a stooge giving his lines with an almost wooden feel, that doesn't entice the audience in anyway.<br/><br/>The other main character Sophie Neveu is also just a pawn in the hands of the director. Audrey Tautou is, to an even greater extent than Hanks, left with nothing other than an already set idea and with even less material to work with. The writer has forgotten that the character Neveu has been trained in solving riddles by her grandfather, and as it is her grandfather who leaves all the traces for them to follow, you would think that she would be teaching the Harward professor a think or two, but that never happens. <br/><br/>Of course it is difficult when dealing with a bestselling novel which the entire world has read and loved, to begin changing the story too much as you would than alienate a large portion of potential movie gooers. However, Ron Howard should have taken more time to think about the project and tried to really make it his own, rather than just ""copy-pasting"" the book to screen.<br/><br/>Instead of watching this movie, read the illustrated edition of the book, because then you get the exact same locations as are present in the movie, but you will be able to create your own images as well. <br/><br/>The book is great in the sense that it actually invited the reader to think and guess alongside Langdon. This is not possible with the movie as Howard, while using every element in the book, still feels it necessary to explain that which would otherwise make the audience do their own thinking...you can't have a thinking audience...can you?"

The lead actors, particularly Hanks, seemed stiff and sort of embarrassed by what they were doing. Audrey Tautou is pretty and likable but there are no sparks between her and Hanks... no chemistry. Jean Reno, as usual, does a wonderful job. But there's so little definition or personality to any of the characters it's hard to empathize with them. There was no plot line to the story but rather a series of vignettes that end up really going nowhere. And lastly, realizing that this is based on a fictional work, the story still defies credulity. There's something disingenuous about this effort."
"Tucker_Keon","8","2","4","21 August 2008"," Entertaining
","I particularly welcome the exposure the film gives to the denigration of women by the Catholic Church and the role of Mary Magdalene in church history. While The Da Vinci Code never reaches its full potential as a compelling work of art, it is solid entertainment that creates awareness of the differences within the early church and may spur people to read apocryphal writings such as the Gnostic Gospels and The Gospel of Thomas. Of course, the theory, first expounded in the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, is out of the mainstream, yet, it is not as preposterous as Roger Ebert has claimed. Given the paucity of historical records referring to a historical Jesus and the passing of two thousand years, it is no more implausible than many other theological notions, widely accepted as the unvarnished truth. Anyway, all questions are answered and you are not left hanging. Whether you agree with the answers is up to you. Remember, it's only a movie, and it's never too late to become a history buff and you can do your own research."
"Jasper76","8","2","4","17 August 2008"," The Book was better.
","The movie does stay true to the book, although some may consider this a chance for the movie makers to bring more life to the characters and the dialogue. My personal feeling is that most (not all) people who didn't like this movie did so for reasons other than being entertained. I thought this movie was well-cast and well-played. The direction was good, and the cinematography was excellent. I think the film's drawbacks are directly related to the difficulties inherent in adapting a novel to a screenplay, and particularly a novel that is as didactic as this one. There was a lot of explanation in the book, and it would have been impossible to include it all in the film version. I think they did the best they could to balance the need to explain what's going on and the need to keep the film under three hours. Overall: AWESOME movie for people who haven't read the book, or have but not understood it."
"jsander734","8","2","4","1 July 2008"," great mystery and provides food for thought about Christianity
","The Da Vinci Code has its flaws but overall this is a good, engaging flick. It probably would have helped to read the book first to follow all the riddles and minor details that I didn't notice right away but ended up having meaning later on in the film. It had a lot of unexpected twists and turns, the acting was superb and the imagery was fantastic. Most importantly it dealt with deeper issues than the typical murder mystery, like the legitimacy of Christianity and the falsification of the divinity of Christ. Although it wasn't completely historically accurate when it dealt with those issues at least it provided food for thought. Who decided what books should go in the bible and how did the Holy Roman Empire get converted from Paganism to Christian? Was the bible really the inspired word of god or did men fabricate most of it? The New Testament was actually written many years after Jesus died so most likely the stories were fabricated and embellished. But (back to the movie) it's a good flick and I highly recommend it. I was surprised to hear Ron Howard directed it. He did a good job."
"phoebes323","7","2","4","26 June 2007"," Good solid movie!
","This is a good movie! It stays more true to the book (which I should point out is fiction) than any other movie of a book that I have ever seen, from ""Matilda"" to ""Harry Potter"" to ""The Hound of the Baskervilles.""<br/><br/>The choice of locations for filming was incredible. Almost every scene that was centered on a location was filmed at that location. For example, it was awe-inspiring seeing the actors walking around the deserted hallways of the Louvre in the dead of night. Also, the Templar Church that the characters go to in London was feet away from my work...I have actually walked down the streets that they ran down.<br/><br/>I would like to set the record straight about Tom Hanks' performance. He was not exactly who I pictured as the role (that would have been a Harrison Ford circa Indiana Jones) but he was very good! I thought that he was very believable as Robert Langdon. There was no chemistry between him and his co-star but (contrary to popular opinion I believe) that was a good thing. Their relationship was supportive and kind, and most importantly interesting to watch.<br/><br/>No, this film isn't award winning. But it is a great movie to see on a hot summer day. It is definitely worth spending ten dollars for the two and a bit hours of fun that ""The Da Vinci Code"" provides."
"ntsci","Null","2","4","16 March 2007"," entertaining but rather silly
","This film should have degraded into a Monty Python sort of self parody. The filming was good, the acting was good, it was exciting it parts, but the story is so silly that I just couldn't believe the actors could keep a straight face during the show. It comes close to being a parody of conspiracy theories. If it wasn't for the complete lack of humour, I think I would have found this film to be very funny.<br/><br/>What more amazing is that people are apparently now taking Dan Brown misinterpretation of the Grail seriously as an alternative history and the conspiracy for real.<br/><br/>OK so lets get this straight. Jesus was married -- big deal. He had a daughter -- big deal. His bloodline still exists -- big deal. And one branch of the church is protecting this blood line while another wants to end it.... why exactly should we care if he (1) had a daughter, and (2) that her descendants are still amongst us, is not clear. Oh, but if the truth had been told the would be a much better place today free of racism, sexism and so on! This last idea makes about as much sense as idea that the meaning of life is 42 -- it just does not compute.<br/><br/>Apparently the body of Mary Magdalene is important because it is proof of this silly story. First there would be hardly any genetic relationship between Jesus and the current descendant. Assuming that there would be a generation every 20 years (in the past women married before they were 20 -- so 20 is a reasonable estimate), there would be about 99 generations. That means that the relationship between Jesus and the current descendant would be .5 to the power to 99 -- which according to excel is 1.57772 E-30 -- that is essentially zero genetically speaking. The descendant might as well be randomly selected. Not even the guys at CSI would be able to make that case stick. Unless the descendants have been meticulously interbred for the past 2000 years, the current Grail would have no more relationship with Jesus than you or I. Perhaps thats the real shockers of the story, the incest necessary to keep the blood line pure! Aw, perhaps they mean mitochondrial DND!!! That would be possible if and only if the current woman was from an unbroken line of females dating back to Mary Magdalene. However that would only prove that the person in question was from the same general population as Mary Magdalene -- not that she was a descendant at all because mitochondrial DND is not person specific. For example apparently amongst all the native Americans that have been tested there are only 5 strands of Mitochrondial DND which are also shared with some other peoples in Eurasia. So the current generation might have the same pattern of mitochondrial DND as the corpse of Mary Magdalene, but so too might millions of other very distantly related people. And even if the current grail was related to Mary Magdalene, it would not prove descent from Jesus.<br/><br/>In addition, getting genetic material from a 2000 year old body is not an easy thing to do -- they might not actually find any usable genetic material left.<br/><br/>Finally, even if they were by some miracle able to prove the descent from Jesus.... what difference would it make!!! In setting up this genetic link as being so all important is Dan Brown actually telling us that Jesus's divinity rested in his genes -- a sort of Mutant X -- god power? That could be passed on to his descendants? Gods spirit (if you believe in such a thing) presumably was in Jesus's soul, not the body, and therefore if you believe that he was the son of God spiritually, the genetic link would be irrelevant -- the Godness of Jesus would not be transmitted to his descendants and therefore his progeny would just be ordinary people -- not demi gods. The idea that the children of Jesus would be divine as well would be more like the Roman religion (Where the children of Gods are demi-gods). One critic suggested that the book challenges the divinity of Jesus -- but his bodies ability to have children really says nothing about his divinity. Are we to think that Jesus wasn't divine because he could have children? If so, then why is the san grail special? If Jesus was just a man like any other then his bloodline would be irrelevant so why do we care about protecting the identity of his descendants? Another oddity is that to protect his descendants they kept records of them. Why keep records? Wouldn't it be safer not to keep records? And why have they set the little room up like a museum with dates for the various members of the secret society? On the other hand I didn't dislike the film. It was entertaining and the actors were pretty good. Some of the story was far fetched -- hiding in the back seat of a car to escape the police. But not a big problem.<br/><br/>I don't personally believe in any gods so I was not offended by the characterization of church in the film. I must say that the fact that Dan Brown can create such sacrilege and get away with it, is a really testimonial to how far the catholic church and Christianity in general has grown and matured over the past few hundred years. There have been a flurry of shows debunking the Da Vinci code (several a lot more interesting that the movie itself) but no sensational anti-Da Vinci code campaign or death threats that I know of. The relative lack of a (over) reaction by the Christian community must be applauded. Their lack of a (over) reaction and really renewed my respect for Christianity."

","I did not expect the movie to be as good as the book. Nor do I think that the 'Da Vinci Code' story is suitable to be made a movie. But with all the publicity and the excellent cast playing I watched the movie and I expected something entertaining. Well I was disappointed. Of course Tom Hanks and Jean Reno's play was great because they can play almost anything but Audrey Tautou's performance was very poor, clearly she was not the actress suitable for the job. None of the characters had a glimpse of the personality and vitality they are supposed to have in the novel. And the flow of the movie did not keep you interested to keep watching it, I was more than bored in the middle. And with the budget spent to it I really believe the 'Da Vinci Code' to be the biggest failure of last year.

","LOTS OF SPOILERS! With all the hoopla, I was actually tempted to go and see this movie in a theatre, as opposed to waiting until it came to my own 60"" screen. I'm glad I waited. I could have waited longer. What a mess! Let's start with the good part... the locations: Great shots of the Louvre;Belvoir Castle; Eglise Saint-Sulpice; Château de Villette; Lincoln Cathedral;Rosslyn Chapel;Temple Church;Westminster Abbey; not to mention great locations like London, Paris, Malta, Scotland, many other parts of England and France. That's it. That's all the good news, except for Ian McKellen, who did as fine a job as anyone could to make his role seem plausible, although I always like Jean Reno and Alfred Molina for their work... wasted on this movie. I didn't bother to read the book. I like my history factual, not conjectural. Hopefully, it made more sense than the movie. And if it caused anyone to examine his belief in the apotheosis of Jesus, good for it. A good start for this work would have been good dialog. It didn't have it. The actors mouth the words, but they aren't believable, but since the dialog isn't either, that's all you could expect. And the plot! I don't mind Byzantine plots, but in the end, they have to make sense. This whole thing revolves around the catholic church's obsession with not letting anyone know that Jesus had a child with Mary Magdalene. OK, so I can believe that. They've been paranoid about the truth for millennia. But who can believe bishops that reveal the supposed secrets of the confessional, running around with $10M in bearer bonds, hiring assassins, bungling attempts to find the thingamabob? Ludicrous. Police officers who go around beating up people for no reason, fall for the old toss the homing device out of the window-trick- and chase a dump truck like keystone cops-bank managers who wait for 20 years for someone to come and use a magic key...etc. The explanation of ""The Last Supper"" and the ""V"" between Jesus and Mary representing the Holy Grail, and being a representation of a woman's vagina was laughable. I had to wonder how many takes it took to get through that scene before McKellen could finish without bursting into laughter. In the end, any bright person could have found the crypt of Mary Magdalene without the secret map hidden in the thingamabob with the cryptic message. It made all the chasing, hiding, people shot, money wasted, deciphering...pointless. It reminded me of when I was a child and had to send off for a secret decoder ring in order to understand the secret message from Captian Midnight's show on TV. When I got it, it was useless. So was this movie. What a mess!"

"fayezsalame","10","2","4","28 November 2006"," Leave Sophie Neveu for next novel ( do not replace with another beautiful women)
","The Da Vinci Code is an excellent movie filled with action, excitement, murder and mystery. Even though the book was better, it seemed as if Howard did the best he could to copy the story of the book. The only disappointments were that the romantic factor between Sophie and Langdon was at a minimal (it seemed as if they were close friends, not lovers) despite it being present in the book, agent Neveu's role was diminished where she almost had no part in solving the codes as if she was just accompanying Langdon unlike the book where she helped solve the codes significantly, the same goes for sir Leigh Teabing. Another thing was that Leigh's betrayal was shown early unlike the book where it was shown at the confrontation between him and our hero's. Anyway these are some minor details, that if fixed could have improved the movie in a much better way. But the movie is still spectacular and even if you have read the book, i still encourage you to go and watch it ( that's what i did) and if you hadn't read the book then i suggest that you read it first before watching the movie because to truly enjoy the DA Vinci code you must both watch the movie and read the book and it is better to read the book first (there are some differences in the plot's). Finally, all that i can say is that the was great and Dan brown is a genius. I hope you all read his other Robert Langdon book (Angel's and Demon's) which is expected to come out in a movie in 2008, and i cant wait for his next Robert Langdon novel which is expected next year. P.S: If Dan brown or someone who can reach him is reading this then i wish you could tell him that i hope he puts Sophie Neveu again in his next novel especially since she and Langdon showed chemistry in DVC, and i hope that he does not bring any new beautiful women (keep Sophie)."
"John_Q_Citizen","Null","2","4","18 November 2006"," Wonderful Cinematography and a Powerful Score by Hans Zimmer Add To An Enjoyable and Tense Thriller
","Chances are that if you haven't read the book, you will enjoy this film. Chances are that if you have read the book, you might not be as satisfied with the adaptation.<br/><br/>But lets get the summary out of the way.<br/><br/>Symbologist Robert Langdon is on a business trip in Paris when he is called away to the Louvre to aid with a murder investigation. It turns out that he is the primary suspect in the case and (with the aid of a French cryptologist) escapes from police custody. He now must solve the string of riddles and clues spread around the dead body - clues that link the murder to a millennium-old war between two factions over the possession of a priceless treasure, the Holy Grail.<br/><br/>I had read the novel before seeing the film, so nothing was really a twist for me. Needless to say, though, I enjoyed this movie immensely. The tension from the book was very present and created a wonderful atmosphere.<br/><br/>Sadly, though, people love to bash movies - particularly ones such as this. Not surprisingly, the controversy has been stirred mostly from religious persons. I don't really see why, because I felt that the film handled the subject in a very delicate way. There was even talk of delaying the release date before the film was out.<br/><br/>Thankfully, though, that didn't happen.<br/><br/>I am very aware that a lot of people (aside from religious groups) didn't like the film either, and I can't really see why. I read other reviews from this site - and they said why - but I still don't understand. Perhaps I just love the film a lot because I loved the book a lot. It does remain really faithful.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of this movie really shine - particularly the cinematography and score. Salvatore Totino's dark and bleak color scheme really adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the movie. Ron Howard's direction (while people criticize being unoriginal) is very elegant and sweet. But the strongest technical aspect is the score. Hans Zimmer is my favorite composer, and when I heard that he would score this film, I got even more excited. And I wasn't disappointed. The score in this movie is probably the quietest that Zimmer has ever composed, and it works perfectly.<br/><br/>On the subject of the actors, I think that it is a universal opinion that Ian McKellan and Paul Bettany gave the two best performances of the movie, and it's hard to argue. **SPOILER** McKellan's performance as the bad guy is very believable and you really learn to hate him at the end.**SPOILER END** But I think that Paul Bettany's performance was the best. He creates an extremely complex and sympathetic character.<br/><br/>If you're reading this, you might think ""Does he dislike anything about the movie?"" Well, I suppose that the screenplay wasn't the best. Akiva Goldsman, who wrote A Beautiful Mind, did the best he could with the exposition (and believe me, there was A LOT), but I think that no matter how or who writes it, it couldn't sound like natural conversation. I was surprised how well the actors delivered it though. Tom Hanks seems to give a monologue every five minutes. When he did, though, he kept my attention.<br/><br/>I also think that Audrey Totou's performance wasn't the best in the film. Compared to the other actors, she didn't do very well, but I still believed in her.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an extremely enjoyable thriller. I will certainly but it when it's released on DVD.<br/><br/>9/10"

"chasman99","7","2","4","16 November 2006"," Review of the movie...not the subject
","And now for something completely newa review about the movie instead of the conflict it created.<br/><br/>First off, I did read the book. I found the casting a bit questionable but as is generally the case, minutia gets lost the further in your memory it is. I read the book quite some time ago, so the glaring mistakes were missed to some degree.<br/><br/>I watched the movie with my wife and she had never read the book. It was enjoyable for both of us.<br/><br/>The good: The topic in and of itself keeps you thinking throughout, if not on the actual action in the movie, on your own religious musings. The casting was pretty darn good actually. Sadly all the supporting characters were overshadowed by the one mistake Howard made in putting Hanks in the lead. It was just too difficult to get past for anyone who had a preconceived notion of who Langdon should have been (Ralph Fiennes or Hugh Laurie for me) The pace of the movie was good, and I did not feel that it dragged at all.<br/><br/>The bad: There were too many times you could poke a hole in the material. Again, this is not a critique of the content but a comment based on your ability to find holes independently of the subject matter. I also didn't feel the final few scenes tied things together very well. There was too much intellectual blather and you didn't feel a major emotional attachment between Sophie and her grandmother. That needed to be developed or you still felt ""can she trust these people?"" at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I think the twists and turns were faithfully reproduced, but it did not wrap up nicely. For perfect wrap up see ""The Usual Suspects"". I wanted something along those lineswhere after the finale I was glad to see how it came together, somewhat surprised and very happy for the come-uppance of the antagonists.<br/><br/>All in all I think this was a good depiction of the book, given the limited time you have to do so. I look forward to Angels and Demons more as I think the story is tighter, at least until the finale, which I imagine, will be laughable at the theater.<br/><br/>If you liked the book, go see the movie. If you did not read the book, but it intrigues you, go see the movie. If you are consumed with the conflicts in subject matter and the inconsistencies with the details in art, placement and historical facteither don't go, or keep it to yourself. I wish to watch in blissful ignorance thanks"
"c-corleis","7","2","4","15 November 2006"," Well done, but sometimes too close to the book.
","I think, one of the main reasons why many people (and critics) did not like the movie is, that it is too faithful to the book: If you read a book, you made you own ""mind-movie"" with your own perfect actors, places and scenes of it and you have all time in the world to read it. This are only a few of the reasons why the ""book is always better than the movie"". For a movie, you have a given running-time and it is almost impossible to put all the thinks of a book into a movie and to fit everyones imagination who have read the book. So the most movie adaptations of a book will be shortened in story and characters and sometimes parts of the book must be changed to fit the strengths and possibilities of a movie. The makers of ""The Da Vinci Code"" tried it the other way round, put a little bit too much of the book into the movie and tried to be too close to the book. They missed sometimes to retell the story with the possibilities that a movie can give; even if this means to cut out some parts of the story or to change parts of it. The storyline is often too fast (even the more than 20 minutes longer Director's Cut) so it can be confusing for someone who did not read the book to follow the plot (yes, i have read the book first). But this film is, in my humble opinion, far better than most critics said. The action is good, the flow of the story is straight, it contains a lot of riddles. It is like a modern ""Indiana Jones""-story! I think, the best idea is to read the book first, and than watching the movie. Don't miss it, it is really worth to see!"

For a book that took the world by storm and leaving most readers asking certain questions regarding the validity of the foundations the Christian church, I was left asking myself why? For a start, the book was so badly written it was laughable. There were more holes in it than swiss cheese. Everything fell into Robert Langdons lap a little too easily for my liking. And the film was just as bad! Ron Howard certainly took the original plot, and portrayed it just as badly as Mr Brown, with a few more continuity errors thrown in for good measure!. How is it that Mr Langdon and his accomplice are one moment in France, then on a plane to Switzerland, when then switches direction in mid-air to London, and then somehow they have the currency to board a London bus, where they very conveniently meet a hoody with a WAP phone? Also, I am pretty sure that even a FRENCH air traffic controller would not ""go for lunch"" when being questioned by a senior detective. No, the only reason for this particular little scene was to include a little graphic violence to spice up an otherwise pretty dull film.<br/><br/>I personally think that Mr Browm missed a great opportunity here.

The supporting cast is filled with great performances, the most significant one coming from Paul Bettany but also Ian McKellen and Alfred Molina were very good and Jean Reno was also very good as a french officer. The story is a bit controversial, a murder occurs inside the louvre and clues left behind lead to a religious mystery protected by a secret society, meanwhile the Church is trying to kill everybody who knows of this mystery in order to prevent the non-Christian thought from spreading, the thought of the possibility of Jesus having been human and had kids, a family line, etc... The film is done pretty well by Howard, written very well by Goldsman (Cinderella Man, A Beautiful Mind), i also liked the cinemtagraphy from Salvatore Totino (Cinderella Man, Changing Lanes, Any Given Sunday) and the score from legendary Hans Zimmer. All in all i think those who hated this film, compared it to the book too much (no film is better than the book, perhaps only A Clockwork Orange, even Godfather book is better than the film).

For someone like me the believability is not crucial because I find it no more or less believable than the stuff they try to teach us in Sunday school, although from a purist point of view I can understand why someone might be strongly opposed to it.

I failed to mention that this movie is long. All in all, It's very interesting."

","I had listened to the book on tape when it first came out, so I was already familiar with the story.<br/><br/>The book was very confusing to me, I found it hard to follow. But I think the film was made in such a way that it was less confusing. Such as when Tom Hanks is going over the code, the letters or words highlight themselves as he goes along. Or when he is thinking through a problem, there is an impression of it that appears before him. All this makes it easier to understand.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I thought both Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were good in their roles. But I think the stand-outs for acting in this movie are Paul Bettany and Alfred Molina. Bettany sure has a difficult role as the monk who is after Hank's character.<br/><br/>Also, I consider myself Christian and the movie and book didn't bother me. It is just Fiction after all, or just one person's idea. I like the fact that the movie leaves you thinking about religion and the meaning behind it, and shows that the people in the film believe in their faith very deeply. There are many scenes that address Jesus' Divinity and Humanity, and I think that is a good thing thing to show a movie audience. <br/><br/>So there are a lot of issues in this movie that will really make you think about Jesus and religion. And it is very much a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat."
"jimhills","2","2","4","7 June 2006"," One of the Worst Movies of the Year!
","www.kajatm.com The best way to describe The Da Vinci Code is a movie that was made too late. Like Wyatt Earp to Tombstone and Deep Impact to Armageddon, The Da Vinci Code is just another version of National Treasure with one key difference, it being good. I was bored with the story line, bored with the acting and overall I really didn't care if they found the remains of Mary Magdalene or not. Being one of the 10 people in the United States that haven't actually read the book, I was expecting to be surprised by the storyline or to be at least entertained for the 2 hrs (closer to 3) but ended up watching my watch to find out when it was ending.<br/><br/>Now this is the normal part of my review where I go into further detail about the movie and what happened but I have pretty much wiped the movie from my memory so that isn't going to happen this time around. What I do want to focus on is who has kidnapped the real Tom Hanks? On a scale of 1 to awful, his performance was pretty much awful. What happened to the guy that was pretty much Oscar worthy just because his name appeared in the credits? It was like watching a cardboard cutout of Tom Hanks on screen. He showed no emotion, no charisma to the point that I thought that I was watching some Bizarro-World Tom Hanks playing the lead role. Maybe it has to do with the fact that Spielberg didn't direct this piece of garbage and Tom Hanks only puts in 110% when Spielberg is directing. This kind of performance can ruin a career and I hope that we haven't seen the best of Tom Hanks. Finally, what is with his hair in this movie he looks like one of those skater guys in high school that shaves all of there head expect the top part so it looks like you have normal hair but in reality it just looks like some creature crawled up on you head and died.<br/><br/>The whole story line tries to trick you into thinking that other things are going on and that the clues aren't that obvious. Unless you are about 3 years old you or you have drool coming from your mouth right now you can pretty much figure what is going to happen and who the link to Mary Magdalene is. Honestly, the more I think about this movie the more upset I am getting that I will never have those 3 hours back. I have an idea, when you make a movie try to make it entertaining; it makes it some much better for the viewer.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you want to see a movie that is very similar and is well done even though the lead character is Nicolas Cage I would highly recommend seeing National Treasure. Maybe some books are better left to being books. From what I have heard the book is outstanding that was not the case with the on screen adaptation. Don't rent it, don't see it and please encourage others from making the same mistake that I did. But then again, what do I know?"

","Why not using the exact text by the book? There are some scenes that are missing in the movie that I think would add to the story, and make the movie a little vague. Maybe that was the intention of the director Ron Howard, but I wish they were added. For example, the full meaning of the name of ""Sir Leigh Teabing"". Another thing is that the fact that Sophie Neveu has also a brother apart from her grandmother. However, this is a great directed movie and I was so glad I was able to view it finally after all the debates about it and the book itself. Moreover, the fine act of Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Jean Reno, and the great one: Ian McKellen.<br/><br/>Have a nice day, Shai."
"NicBarker","6","2","4","27 May 2006"," A Spectacular Film from start to finish, a true thrilling ride.
","Ron Howard's movie conversion of Dan Brown's novel, The Da Vinci Code, is a spectacular film from start to finish. In this much hyped picture, Tom Hanks stars as Robert Langdon, a professor of religious symbology, and alongside him, Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, a cryptologist. After the murder of Neveu's grandfather, the curator of the Louvre in Paris, the pair follow his clues to unlock a secret that could change humanity. The pair discover that Mary Magdelene was the wife of Jesus Christ, and bore his child, alongside the revelation that the 'Grandfather' was the head of a secret society that revolves around the sarcophagus' protection. A lot of bad reviews blackened the release of this film, but they were not deserved at all. Hanks is impressively comfortable as Robert Langson, Audrey Tautou is truly emotional as Neveu, and there are some stunning performances in support, including Sir Ian McKellen, who plays Sir Leigh Teabing a charismatic Grail Buff, Alfred Molina, who is the standout as Bishop Aringarosa, Jean Reno, as bad cop Bezu Fache, and Paul Bettany, whose impressive turn as Silas ensures he an actor to look out for. Howard's directing is sublime, Akiva Goldsman has fitted a lot of content into the screenplay, and The Da Vinci Code is definitely worth seeing, not only because it is a truly thrilling ride, but because it is an almost perfect thriller, with a lot of smarts."
"chubbiecubbie07","7","2","4","27 May 2006"," The DaVinci Code;will it meet the standards of the book?
","Rating- 3.5/5 Category- Drama/Thriller/Mystery The Davinci Code is a drama/mystery/thriller that literally keeps your eyes glued to the movie screen for 2 and a half hours. Starring Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump, The Terminal, Cast Away, etc.) and Audrey Tautou (a decent French actress from out of the blue). Now in this movie these two characters help each other with the treasure hunt for the Holy Grail. This hunt was made from Sophie Neveu's, Audrey Tautou, grandfather. He set clues all around Europe all having to do with symbols and things having to do with Christ.<br/><br/>Even the New York Times says, ""WOW... Blockbuster perfection. An exhilaratingly brainy thriller. Not since the advent of Harry Potter has an author so flagrantly delighted in leading readers on a breathless chase and coaxing them through hoops."" Sadly other people had different views, mostly from the liberal side. People from the Chicago Tribune gave the movie a 1.5/5. But yet we have to think about this. It seems like the Chicago Tribune can't handle religious movies because the same thing happened when Mel Gibson produced the Passion of the Christ. So why don't you just think about that for a second.<br/><br/>Now for my opinion I believe this movie had a decent part in every field. The acting from Ian McKellen was phenomenal (like always), the screenplay was well written, and the directing from Ron Howard was more than half way decent. The main reason though that I gave the rating a 3.5 is because not the whole cast had their A game for this movie (Tom Hanks). Tom Hanks just doesn't have the pizazz to be in a serious role. All in all this movie brought it to the big screen in a big way."
"clara-83","6","2","4","27 May 2006"," Book was better
","All thought the movie was professionally made,and the cast was great. I still think that the movie really didn't live up to the greatness of the book. <br/><br/>And also, in this case I really didn't like the changes that they had made in the movie compared to book. <br/><br/>About actors and actresses: Tom Hanks is a great actor but somehow I didn't think that he was believable as Robert Langdon, it could also be that when I read the book I imagined the Robert Langdon a bit different. I think Paul Bettany did a great job as Silas. *applause* and Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing and Jean Reno as Captain Fache, were just so great as person can expect from great actors as they are. <br/><br/>all in all.. movie was good and there was a great cast, but the book was still better.<br/><br/>Should we now expect a movie based on Angels and Demons?"
"nazmobile","10","2","4","27 May 2006"," A great adaptation of a an awesome book.....brings the book to life
","I have to say that I can understand the uproar about this book, it's bound to happen when religion is involved. but the way I see it is that it's a FICTIONAL book which has used certain material to make it interesting to the reader.<br/><br/>Having said that I absolutely LOVED the film and can't wait to watch it again. The cast were all excellent, exactly how I pictured them when I read the book 2 years ago. A lot of the critics are saying it isn't all that but to be honest the film is a page by page adaptation, nothing has been changed and I like it that way. Of course I read the book a while back so watching the film refreshed my mind but also I had forgotten many little things so for those who haven't read the book this will be even better as quoted by my brother who hadn't even heard about the book believe or not.<br/><br/>The film does leave you wanting more, because for the duration of the movie you are hooked and along with the soundtrack it is like your imagination is coming to life almost as if you're reading the book and visually seeing it come to life.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou I believe has done a great job as Sophie and not many people have mentioned that. I'm glad Ron Howard insisted on having her because in my mind I thought no one could do the role better than the actress in the Amelie movie same goes for Jean Reno. Obviously Ian Mckellen is awesome and so is Paul Bettany. But seeing Tom Hanks, Ian McKellen and Audrey Tautou interact is great and just like the book once you get to this part of the movie everything becomes more exciting and enjoyable.<br/><br/>As for people saying Tom Hanks is rubbish, I personally think he plays Robert Langdon perfectly. In the book, Robert is a calm rational character who takes him time and slowly comes to the conclusion, which is exactly how Tom Hanks is, so to say he is 'wooden' is not correct. There also been a lot of people saying that people laugh at serious moments, and it happened in the theatre when I was watching it too, but I have to say I think that's down to the actually dialogue that Tom says toward the end of the movie, it is a crucial part but there is a difference to reading that part and hearing it said to you.<br/><br/>When you read it you are taken aback but when you hear it said to you yes it does sound slightly humorous and unbelievable, I won't tell you what part it is but suffice to say you'll figure it out when the movie reaches it's climax.<br/><br/>If you're expecting something different and out of the blue then NO this film won't give you that. But if you're expecting to see one of you're favourite books come to life and enjoy the ride then YES this will give you all of that and leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>For me this film is a blockbuster and I enjoyed it much more than X Men 3 which let me down. I came out the theatre wanting to read the book all over again simply because now I can imagine the characters in my head more vividly.<br/><br/>So my advice would be go watch this film with an open mind, ignore the critics, ignore your mates comments and just go see it for yourself and come to your own conclusion."
"allenge","6","2","4","25 May 2006"," Books fails to translate into Movie
","The magic formula Dan Brown used to transform his book, The Da Vinci Code, into a bestselling novel didn't seem to be present in the new film version. What in book form had been a fast paced novel became a slow film, bogged down by an overabundance of dialogue. Although most of the differences between the book and film were fairly inconsequential and made simply in the interest of time, some major changes at the end were questionable. Unfortunately, the beautiful Paris scenery and creative cinematic techniques weren't enough to override the mediocre acting and sluggish plot. <br/><br/>One of the greatest strengths in Dan Brown's novel is the plethora of background information on symbology and early Christianity, regardless of whether these so called ""facts"" are actually true or not. It is through inner monologues that most of this information is revealed to the reader. Since it is difficult to reveal a character's thoughts on film, extra dialogue is used instead. The amount of dialogue that the script writers were forced to add is one of the major factors that slows down the plot. Some of the lines seem awkward and unnatural because they sound more like thoughts than what a person would actually say out loud. In an effort to avoid adding even more dialogue, the film uses an interesting technique to show the problem solving process in Langdon's brain. When Langdon is trying to solve the riddle on Newton's tomb, the tomb appears on the screen as a kind of hologram and the different parts that he is thinking about are highlighted. While this was a refreshing change from simply adding more dialogue, it wasn't enough to pick up the pace of the movie in the numerous places it started to slow down. <br/><br/>There were many small differences between the book and movie. Most were obviously made simply in the interest of time and made little difference to the plot as a whole. A scene where Sophie and Langdon try to escape Paris in a cab and a scene in which the two use a computer to decipher part of a riddle were removed. Neither of these changes, as well as several other small ones, really made that much of a difference. There were a few changes, however, that probably would have been better had they been kept the same as in the book. In the book there were two cryptex, the first one opened to reveal another. Because the second cryptex was removed, an entire riddle that was in the book was taken out of the movie. The riddle solving is one of the most interesting aspects in both the movie and novel, so the complete removal of a riddle from the movie was a little disappointing. An interesting difference in that the movie version is that Langdon is less open-minded than the one from the book. He discredits most of the grail myth and even argues with Teabing about several points. By giving Langdon a more moderate stance on the whole issue, the film loses some of the controversy that was created in the book. Whether or not this was intentional is hard to say. The most noticeable change in the movie is the ending. While in the book Langdon and Sophie never find the Sangrael documents in the Rosslyn Chapel, they actually do in the movie. The entrance to the chamber seems ridiculously obvious, hidden beneath a very evident symbol of the unified chalice and blade. Another grating difference was that in the film it is implied that Sauniere wasn't actually Sophie's biological grandfather while in the book he most definitely is. The changes made for the sake of cutting time made sense, but the other big changes were not only unnecessary, but often times irritating as well. The special effects and cinematography were very creative. Whenever a flashback occurs in the movie the picture becomes slightly grainy and takes a bluish tone. The grain adds to the effect of these flashbacks being distant memories, deteriorating over time. This effect was used to illustrate Silas's history as well as a few parts of early Christian history. Another interesting effect was when Langdon and Sophie were walking into Rosslyn Chapel, what the chapel had looked like hundred of years ago was projected around them, helping to put the fantastic age of the church into perspective. Ian Mckellen's portrayal of the eccentric Teabing was excellent, but for the most part the acting was mediocre. Tom Hanks seemed miscast for the part of Robert Langdon, described in the book as an attractive man in his mid thirties. Hanks, with his terrible hair and lack of sex appeal, seemed unsuited for the role. Silas, played by Paul Bettany, was fittingly creepy, but was unable to capture the audience's sympathy like the character does in the book. Part of the reason for this could have been the much abbreviated background of the character. A chapter's worth of his history is shortened to a three minute flashback in the movie. What is a fantastic thriller on paper simply doesn't translate into a great movie. Although the film is by no means terrible, its slightly slower pace and annoying changes could be disappointing for those who enjoyed the book. It's a movie worth seeing in the cinema once, but it's unlikely too many people will go back to see it again."

","Most people judge a movie based on the book. I did this for Tom Clancy's Clear and Present Danger. The book was far better than the movie. I bought the Dan Brown book last weekend knowing I wouldn't have a lot of time to read it since work comes first. I made it through the first 10 chapters. Then I went to see the movie. The critics harped on a poor ""wooden"" performance by Hanks. But I am one of those that remembers the critics that hated Star Wars. The loved The Royal Tenenbaums. The so called experts have repeatedly told us would we will like and not like. The Aviator was so painful to sit through, I almost walked out. Gangs of New York was so bad, I returned the DVD to the place I bought it from, claiming it didn't play. I judge a movie in the theater based on how many times I look at my watch. I know when I entered the theater. I know before I enter the theater how long the movie is. If I look at my watch more then once, the movie doesn't hold my attention. The DaVinci Code held my attention and then some. The ending somewhat predictable, once the movie got to that point. The way Ron Howard ended it, I was impressed. If you loved the book, great. I will be finishing it in the next week. But this is a movie I will be buying on DVD in a heartbeat. I left the theater feeling the same way as I did about Spielberg's War of the World. I wanted to turn around and see War of the Worlds again just after I left. It was extremely entertaining. This is what I am looking for. Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar for ""A Beautiful Mind"" over Washington. Anyone could have played the heavy in a 'bad cop' movie. But Russell Crowe was everything to ""A Beautiful Mind"". Ron Howard found a way to make a movie about a mathematician entertaining. One of the best movie in a while. ""Training Day"" was a good movie. Not great...... Ron Howard did a very good job with this movie. I was entertained. And I am Catholic. Enjoy this movie. Screw the critics. They don't know JACK !!!!!!!! Like Star Wars, the movie and the story is the STAR."

","I haven't read the book, but I've heard good things. Tom Hanks and Ron Howard seem like a great movie-making combination... I was looking forward to this.<br/><br/>Having not read the book, I wasn't quite sure what to expect; however, from the opening murder in The Louvre, to brief discussions of Christian dogma, to Hanks telling stories about secret societies, I was utterly engrossed. Hanks seems to, as usual, be hypnotizing in his lead role. Audrey Tatou, playing the lead counterpart to Hanks, isn't quite Oscar-worthy here, but she does a pretty decent job. The real scene stealer is Paul Bettany, playing the most engrossing character of the movie, Silas. Jean Reno also lends his talent to the film, though he's not fully utilized.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is undoubtedly one of today's greatest directors, and he works his magic here quite well. Scenes are beautifully shot, pacing is great, and everything related to the director is top-notch. Kudos to Ronny H. here.<br/><br/>I can't comment on the story in comparison to the book, but as a newcomer, it was quite good. The mix of action here, dialogue there, and a theological background all over is quite good. Is it better or worse than the book? I can't say, but if it's worse than the book, I wouldn't imagine it would be by that much."
"proximo_sinister","3","2","4","25 May 2006"," The storyline is contradictory, just like the book
","I confess that I was hoping for a bit of alteration from the story in this film, as is the case with many films, but unfortunately there was little deviation. My problem with the storyline is not a religious argument, so much as the fact that the entire point that Dan Brown's story is trying to push is very contradictory. First of all, the Da Vinci Code follows the notion that Christ was not divine, he was merely human - his divinity was a contrivance of the Catholic Church. Secondly, the holy grail is not a cup, it is the bloodline of Christ and Mary Magdalene. Fine, let's run with this theory for a moment. If Christ was not divine, then should we (humanity) care who he was? If we don't care who he was, then why should we care who Mary Magdalene was or their descendants? Again, I'm not prompting a religious debate over which theory is right, I am saying that Dan Brown's argument does not make sense. While Brown is trying to argue that truth in religion lies in the ""divine feminine"" as was often believed in ancient pagan (and I do mean as in non-Christian, and not in the satanic sense of the word) religions. Even if this is the case, the divine feminine was based around the miracle of fertility, conception, and reproduction - not around one woman, which brings us back to the question of what was the big deal about Mary Magdalene and her children if she was married to just another mortal man by the name of Jesus? The point is, Dan Brown wrote a book that contains a conspiracy theory that makes very little sense if reason is applied to it. To make this into a movie would merely put faces on the characters of this weak argument - which is precisely what it did. The conclusion is that this is a mediocre film about a mediocre book."

","I walked into this movie expecting to see one of the most impressive films of my generation. What I got was not so much as this, but I left feeling satisfied with what I saw. Choosing Tom Hanks to play Robert Langdon was something that surprised me, but I was impressed with his ability to become the character. I thought he did a superb job and his acting definitely added to the enjoyability of the movie. Ian McKellen as Teabing was a surprise for me as well, but I never found myself actually think he was the bad guy, due to many roles he has played in the past. I lack the ability to see him as a bad guy. The script was well written. Though the plot was scattered about while following the numerous character story's(Langdon, Silas, Fauche and the Bishop)it worked well enough. I agree with folks who say that the book was better, but honestly, when isn't it? Movies such as Lord of the Rings or Chronicles of Narnia did a very good job of keeping to the original plot, and I think that The Da Vinci Code should be praised for this too. I have seen this movie once and intend to see it again. I was able to enjoy it throughout the films time(149 minutes) and as I said, left feeling satisfied. Good job Mr. Howard"
"sarastro7","10","2","4","25 May 2006"," Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle! It was great!
","I was one of those who considered myself too cool to read the book, and on hearing the bad reviews from Cannes I didn't exactly have great expectations for the movie, either. So when I saw the movie I was very surprised to find out what the story was actually about, and I totally loved it. This book and movie may be one of the greatest contributions to the debate on religion ever. And I mean EVER. It espouses a progressive, alternative version of Christianity, where the road to the divine goes through the woman. And while I am entirely aware that both the story and the Priory of Sion are fictitious, the movie (and hence the book) makes a surprisingly convincing case. Even if its specific argumentation is made up, the account it gives of the early history of Christianity may in fact be fairly accurate. Christianity, with its focus on marriage, has always essentially been an almost ""courtly love"" kind of sentiment, intended among other things to protect the woman from the misogynistic cultures of 2000 years ago. However, those cultures were stronger than the Christian messages, and so Christianity was quickly warped into something where the woman was basically responsible for evil, original sin, etc., etc. Dan Brown's story goes the errand of restoring the woman's status and full equality, and this is a totally good and progressive and admirable thing. People who opine against this book and movie only risk exposing themselves as adherents to a misogynist world view, and I for one am tremendously gratified that this book and movie have had such massive success. It demonstrates that there are large parts of the culture today that embrace this progressive message, and that gives me increased hope for the future and betterment of mankind. Well done, Dan Brown!<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, yes, there were a couple of things that were not as perfect as they might have been (mainly the disparate ages of the two main characters), but to me the power of the message overshadows any minor shortcomings the movie may have had. I found all the actors to be perfectly adequate, and the movie engaged me fully from start to finish. I have no choice but to award this movie the coveted 10 out of 10 rating."
"gabex-2","7","2","4","25 May 2006"," The big rush...
","I read the book and guessed that it wouldn't be an easy story to make a screenplay out of it. But I liked the movie too. In the novel there are a lot of explanation on art/historical things and the characters' backgrounds that has been left out from the movie. Even so, the 150-minute-long movie is not long enough for those who haven't read the novel to understand, it seems like a big rush for the divine truth. So as to make the good and evil characters more balanced in number the plot make Sauniere seem as if he was an aggressive bodyguard of the young Sophie, instead of his loving grandpa. Also, bishop Aringarosa lies to Fache to have Langdon and Sophie arrested, while in the book the bishop eventually turns out to be a decent but misled man. Fache motives are not even close too. The acting is not outstanding, but fair/good. The emotional content is restricted according to the novel.<br/><br/>**************** READ THIS: VERDICT ******************** Although sometimes difficult to understand without having read the book, I recommend this movie. If you like conspiracy theories you will even like it on its own. If you have read the book, you will love the music interacting with the emotions shown (it gives a huge boost to it; congratulations Hans Zimmer!) and the imagined story coming alive."

In fact, I would have loved to see a longer film that was truer to the book.<br/><br/>Here are just a few of my complaints about the film:<br/><br/><ul><li>There was no need for Jacques SauniÃ¨re to be excluded from being Sophie's grandfather. It depersonalized the story and removed the sexual tension that Sophie discovered as a young woman, when she witnessed her grandfather and grandmother making love in the sexual rite. This led to Sophie's alienation from her grandfather and was a crucial issue in the story.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why exclude the love story of Sophie and Langdon? Part of the ""cashing in"" in this story was the fact that the two principals fell in love with each other, and I became engrossed in that angle of the story -- which was excluded completely from the film!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the film, Sophie was portrayed as a dumb woman, when her intellect was, in the book, critical to the story and served to make it work.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bezu Fache, the Captain of the French Judicial Police, was portrayed in the film as a collaborator with Manuel Aringarosa, the Opus Dei Bishop.

","First off I wold Lek 2 say that I had read the book before going to see the film as did the packed cinema it seemed. I lost count at the amount of times I heard someone whisper ""That was just like in the book"" and so forth. Like most people who had read the book I had high expectations of this film and after watching, I felt as though that early promise had not been fulfilled. The action was slow paced, the dialogue was very wooden at times, the chemistry between the main characters was non-existent. However the film did stay true to the book, only cutting small parts out for running time. I enjoyed the flashbacks to ancient times when Hanks or Sir Ian where referring to ancient scripture, looked like it was lifted from some epic film. One personal gripe I had about the film being from Scotland is that it never mentioned Roslin(I know I spelt it wrong) Chapel is in Scotland, just outside Edinburgh, just they arrived there.<br/><br/>Overall go and see the film if you are a fan of the book, you will get some enjoyment out of seeing the actual Churches and painting etc., just keep in mind that it may not live up to your memory of the book. However if you have not read the book go and see this film for a mild mid caper that may just get you interested enough to buy the book and merchandise that this film is obviously made for."

","I've read the book and then watched the movie. The problem with all the flack that has been generated is that it's compared to the book far too closely. One cannot compare the two so strictly because they are two separate mediums. Though the movie is based on the book, it cannot follow it exactly; the movie would loose its interest otherwise. And I'm sure most realize this, but seldom is there a separation of the book and movie when one watches it. I too felt the difficulty of appreciating the movie without criticizing its divergence from the book, but the important thing is that the spirit and general plot IS conserved. And in this case the movie holds to both. If you see the film through as a viewer (and not a reader turn viewer), you'll find that it's a great mystery that keeps you interested throughout. The 2.5hours wasn't even noticeable; it seemed like the normal length.<br/><br/>There are only two things that I found negative about the film. The first was that I felt that the theories put forth lacked a little substantiation. That is, a little more proof/evidence to solidify the ideas, even if it's a work of fiction. Secondly, and this is more personal, I would have liked to have seen the Grail had actually been released, and the truth be known. This applies, obviously, to both the book and the movie. To expand upon the consequences would have been quite interesting in my opinion because it would go straight to the heart of the nature of faith.<br/><br/>The book is great, its attention to detail and all the information provided meshes so well that it seemed impossible that the story/theory were not true. The movie is also great; it has all the elements of a top rate mystery and holds you till the end. The story is compelling, striking and gripping. Remember, the spirit of the book is what's most important when watching the film after reading the book."

","The movie on its own was self sustaining in a way as it already had all the major plot in the story. However, since I did read the book before the movie it kind of felt a little incomplete in certain places.<br/><br/>For the most of the show,it was just okay for me. Nothing too exciting and yet not boring. The acting by Ian McKellen was superb to say the least.<br/><br/>On the topic of religious controversy, I found that the show was more of a teaser. In sense that they are just grazing on the issues of what to believe or whom to believe in. Still it all boils down to what the viewer choose accept and not the ""brainwashing"" that many factions of society seems to think it does.<br/><br/>Overall its a good show but the book will more than cover for its lack in completeness."

","My initial impression while reflecting on The Da Vinci Code was that this was not the best material for a film. The pacing was very uneven and it was nearly impossible to build any suspense. Tom Hanks appeared to be sleepwalking through most of it, except for spurts of expertise. Ian McKellan was the most entertaining part of the film, though even his performance was ...juvenile? And then there were the Herculean leaps over holes in the plot. Whatever did become of Alfred Molina's character anyway? What I came away with was that this was like the comic book version of Dante's Divine Comedy. Some material is best experienced in a medium that lets you define and describe the story in a more personal way, like ...a book?"

","Ron Howard did you even read the book? How could you miss so many key things? 1) When Silas shot Suniere, he did not even say that the other 3 senechaux were killed (like he does in the book), so what motivation then does Suniere have to pass on this secret to Sophie? He should have simply thought the other sisters/brothers from the Priory would take care of things.....Why, Ron, did u miss this and instead waste film on Langdons claustrophobia 2) Ron, you completely missed the point of the book.<br/><br/>""The Grail is literally the ancient symbol for womanhood and the Holy Grail represents the sacred feminine and the goddess, which of course has now been lost, virtually eliminated by the Church."" ""The quest for the Holy Grail is literally the quest to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene. A journey to pray at the feet of the outcast one, the sacred feminine."" The whole movie was based on the grail as a tomb, not the grail as the lost sacred feminine and Mary Magdelene herself. There was no honor to women and womanhood as Dan Brown has in the book.<br/><br/>3) Why did u make Langdon as such a hero? Sophie was also as heroic in the novel as he was, AND she was smart....you once again did not pay respect to the female component of the story. Sophie was the strongest tie in the entire story, the link between their theories and reality, the one pushing to solve the mystery, the true heir to the throne......why did u make her so mute and stupid? 4) You didn't even explain the ritual Sophie caught her grandfather in! Once again, missing a chance to honor women (as per part of the meaning of the ritual) 5) Saunier was such a lovable grandfather who was also a genius, why did u make him to be such a cranky old sod who wrote some codes on the floor? I could go on, but Ron, here's a tip for next time: read the book and understand it before you make a movie out of it. It would avoid you making a fool out of yourself."
"KAnnD86","9","2","4","22 May 2006"," Enjoyable movie - recommended!
","I saw this movie on Saturday and I really enjoyed it. I never read the book and didn't know very much about the plot going in besides the idea of the cover-up about the marriage of Jesus. If I'd read the book, it would probably be a little easier to follow. The different groups and their agendas were a little hard to keep up with. Other than that, I thought it was really cool how the seemingly meaningless flashbacks of the character's childhoods ended up playing a major role in furthering the plot along. I liked how every time I thought it was going to end, it wasn't quite over yet. I also liked how the characters weren't strictly good or evil. The monk did seem evil at first, but we see he a different side of him when he shoots the bishop. He seemed almost childish instead of a cold-blooded killer. I did predict a few things like the butler being a bad guy and Sophie being the descendant and the old historian being ""the teacher"", but I didn't figure it out too early that it ruined the movie for me. There were quite a few funny lines too! About all the controversy this movie is stirring up, I wasn't offended by it at all. It's not like it's trying to make you believe all those things about Jesus. At the end of the movie, did you believe Mary Magdelane is buried under the Louvre? No. No one is going to go there and try to dig her up. I thought it was a very interesting and clever conspiracy to create, but in no way was it trying to change your beliefs. It's fiction! Take away all the ""controversial"" (I use that word loosely) parts, and this was a very well written, cast, acted and executed movie. The locations were beautiful and the story never dragged. I definitely recommend it."
"ggulcher","7","2","4","22 May 2006"," As Good or Better Than the Book
","Brown's Da Vinci Code is basically a pulp fiction reworking of Umberto Eco's 1990 novel ""Foucault's Pendulum,"" but it's nonetheless entertaining pulp fiction. The same is true of the film version on all counts, but contrary to the pack-mentality pans that career critics have given it, the film in many ways actually improves upon the book, most notably in Hanks' fleshing out of Brown's incredibly wooden hero Langdon. Hanks gives him a sense of brooding determination that breathes life and complexity into the character; Tautou, Reno and McKellan are perfectly cast opposite him. I think a big part of the reason the ""pro"" critics are trashing this movie is that they bought into the book's hype without ever bothering to consider the fact that as original source material the book was only lightweight pop-bestseller fare to begin with.<br/><br/>The controversy surrounding both the film and book has added to the mystique, but by now it's become tiresome in contexts of both the Christian protesters and of Brown himself.<br/><br/>Catholics have the most legitimate beef in that the story basically portrays their religion as a massive fraud. But for Catholics and Christians in general to have protested so loudly and bitterly about a theory shockingly simple to debunk with even a cursory study of history, comes across as an embarrassing confession of a lack of confidence in their own faith.<br/><br/>Brown has of course insisted from the start that his novel is factual. Why? For the exact same reason that Madonna has spent the bulk of her career playing trashy sexual innuendo off of her religion-steeped name: Stoking the fires of religious controversy will make you rich despite often profound shortcomings in talent.<br/><br/>Brown is playing the religious firestorm to the hilt no matter what the historians say; the vocal outrage from offended Christians, as in the case of Madonna, merely generates mountains of free publicity and amplifies the venture's success. It's really quite a brilliant moneymaking ploy when you think about it.<br/><br/>As for the rest of us? We're the happy recipients of the very thing that people generally expect - but find with diminishing frequency of late - in early summer movie fare: A good rip-snortin' adventure yarn.<br/><br/>Everybody loves a treasure hunt, particularly when it involves musty arcana, shadowy villains, a claim of roots in historical fact, and real-world locales and landmarks - ""Da Vinci Code"" has gobs of all of them. It doesn't pack anywhere near the mandatory-second-helping wallop of the phenomenal ""Mission: Impossible III,"" but all controversy aside it's good, engaging and briskly-paced entertainment that's well worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The only downside is that the entire screenplay is noticeably rushed - presumably because the producers knew it was a guaranteed blockbuster and were looking to maximize the box office take with as short a film as possible. Which means we can perhaps look forward to a generously-extended Director's Cut come DVD release time? We're counting on you, Opie..."
"tsukiakari","8","2","4","22 May 2006"," amazing! i never expected a better movie of the best-selling novel!
","The Da Vinci Code film was outstandingly made. i loved the beautiful scenery of Paris in the film and thought almost everything was so detailed and perfect. however there were some flaws, like always.<br/><br/>The characters in the book were portrayed very well in the movie. Tom Hanks made a great Robert Langdon! but he could have showed so much more enthusiasm and interest in the movie. Hanks seemed really nervous and looked like he had never smiled before. he had such a sad face, it was hard for me not to notice that! Audrey Tautou made a brilliant performance as Sophie Neveu. she was exactly how i pictured her when i read the book (before i watched the movie of course) and no one could have done better. though at some times it was difficult to comprehend what she is saying because of her french accent but i guess that is how it is supposed to sound. the other characters did very well as well, especially Ian McKellan as Sir Leigh Teabing and Paul Bettany as Silas.<br/><br/>There were also some parts where you couldn't quite tell whether it was a memory (i think) or it was actually occurring at the moment until that part was over and it returned to the present. there were also a few inappropriate scenes (to me) that were either very violent or disturbing to some/or most.<br/><br/>My mother and brother watched it as well and they say it was very good. my brother said it was almost as good as the book, as it missed out on some parts you would only know of if you've read the book. my mother thought it was a great movie, even though she has not read the book yet. she had no idea what was about to happen, but she went along with the movie and loved it because it was a surprise every minute.<br/><br/>Comparing the movie and the book, the book was much better. you could visualize everything in your head while you were reading but the movie didn't catch every aspect of what was going on. i, among many many other readers, think that Dan Brown is a wonderful author, who uses history and art to create a magical and tantalizing story known as The Da Vinci code. all in all, a masterpiece film. highly recommended if you have not watched or read The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>~sakura"
"Richard_Booth","7","2","4","22 May 2006"," Far from a cinematic travesty, but equally far from perfection
","The Da Vinci Code is a very good adaptation of a book that was always going to be tough to compress without losing too much detail or reason, but then again Howard does make several key mistakes. First things first, Hanks seemed wrong for the part - my money has always been on Dennis Quaid to pull off a good Langdon and after seeing the film I'm even more certain of my choice. I also thought that Audrey Tautou seemed to misfire in one of her first English-speaking roles (Dirty Pretty Things aside): she put some very strange emphasis on certain words and occasionally let out the most god-awful example of how not to deliver a line (""But PROFESSOR!""). However, she was spunky enough for the role and I for one was more than happy to look at Amelie for 2 and a half hours! Paul Bettany, Ian McKellen and Jean Reno were all fine (Bettany probably came off the best); Molina didn't seem to register whatsoever, especially considering the character is fairly meaty in the novel.<br/><br/>As for Howard's direction, it was largely good with a few clunky moments. The Louvre lacked spectacle (aside from the climactic shot which I thought was handled very well) and the chase sequences seemed a bit stale and flat. I also thought the pace was too zippy, flitting between set-pieces with reckless abandon and little concern for plausibility (the novel had a lot more reason and explanation for the plot's various meanderings, something that Goldsman clearly decided to omit). Dialogue was good on the whole, apart from one of the worst lines in recent cinema history...""I need to get to a library, fast!""<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is certainly not the cinematic travesty that some reviewers might lead you to believe; I also think that those who have read the book will get more from the film since too much has been cut out. Whilst far from a polished, tantalising adaptation that could have been made by a director with more artistic sensibilities, it's a functional and enjoyable romp to complement the rest of the summer movie crowd."
"gluttony14","7","2","4","22 May 2006"," Could have been worse
","It's pretty hard to express my opinion of this movie in words, but I'll give it my best shot.<br/><br/>I believe that as a movie, it was good. Tom Hanks delivered a great performance (as usual), Ian McKellen was great, and the rest of the cast were good as well. The directing, by Ron Howard, was great, too. So what's the problem with this movie, then? The problem is, it's based on the Da Vinci Code. And so, the movie inherits all the weaknesses of the book (except for Dan Brown's writing). It inherits the b.s. (no better word to describe it), it inherits the poor attempts at cliffhangers every second just to keep the reader (or viewer, in this case) in suspense, and it inherits the weak ending. It hurts the movie.<br/><br/>Still, it wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't a great one, either. However, I suppose I expected it to be a lot worse than it is, so I ended up enjoying it, flaws and all.<br/><br/>If you liked the book, you'll like the movie. If you didn't like the book, odds are you won't like the movie either (it follows the book very closely). If you hadn't read the book yet, give this movie a shot. You might end up liking it, after all."
"Shiri18","7","2","4","22 May 2006"," A pleasant surprise...
","After many attempts to persuade me otherwise, I braved the Da Vinci Code on opening night. Expecting the worst, I must confess to have been pleasantly surprised by this movie. So all right, the book was better, but isn't it always?<br/><br/>Despite the negative reviews it got in Cannes it stands well on it's own right, bringing forth a great plot with enough twists to keep the audience entertained. I'm sure that if I hadn't read the book prior to seeing the movie, I'd be going on and on about what a great movie this is.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, Jean Reno & Ian McKellen delivered a fantastic performance. The rest of the cast also did an amazing job, however Tautou left me a bit cold. I'm not saying her performance was bad, but it wasn't very good either. She just didn't bring much depth to the character,so I couldn't really sympathize. And, as much as I hate admitting that the critics were right, there was indeed not enough chemistry between Hanks & Tautou (they give off sparks in the book!). <br/><br/>I loved the way this movie/book transforms everyday reality into something of a mystery. Things we walk by or dismiss as 'ordinary' are given a whole new dimension. It also deals with religion and it's impact in our reality. A big plus to this movie is that instead of letting the French characters speak in English - as most movies do- they had them speaking french, giving the movie something extra. And I absolutely loved the ending shot! <br/><br/>Some of the less positive aspects of the movie are the omission of a few important parts from the book, something that would have definitely added more depth and suspense, and the rather hollow characterization. Silas, amazingly portrait by Paul Bettany, was simply the bad guy. The futile attempts to give us an insight to who he was hardly sufficient. In the book I really felt for him, here: Nada! Off course I can understand that it's mostly because of insufficient time. 2 hours isn't enough to make the characters really come to life.<br/><br/>All in All a definite recommendation for those who haven't read the book, and for those of us who have- it may be a bit annoying knowing what's going to happen and dissecting the differences between movie and book-but it's definitely worth seeing The Da Vinci code come to life!<br/><br/>Not the best, but one of the better movies I've seen lately."

","Despite all the negative press this film has received, i cannot see whats wrong with the film. Having read the book, i went to see the film and it was a good thriller film, interesting and exciting. However, it seems to me that people are automatically dismissing it as they are catholics and do not want people to go and see the film. One clear example of this is Christopher Tookey, who rates the Davinci Code badly, but get this his favourite film is love actually. So as far as i can tell this film is getting bad press just because of its Jesus/Mary Magdalene theory. This is shocking and is making the film seem terrible Go and see it its a good film and enjoyable to watch. Those who say the book is poorly written just don't understand it."
"mgiese22-1","8","2","4","21 May 2006"," Good but not quite the book.
","First off, the movie was not as good as the book. The book, is a book that would be hard to beat. It is a thriller and keeps you wanting to keep flying through the chapters as you read it. So if you are going expecting it to outshine the book then you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>If you have read the book, the I would definitely recommend that you go. It's fairly true to the book with the exception of a few parts. The movie is slightly drawn out or slow. I felt it could have easily been a half hour shorter. By the end you are ready to get out of the theater. <br/><br/>This movie will get you to think, and also keep you wondering who's behind the whole thing. I have always been a big fan of movies like that. It's not enough to just simply go and be entertained, I feel there should also be some thinking involved. This movie will certainly do that for you.<br/><br/>Before I go I wanted to comment on all of the controversy this movie has brought with it. I do not understand what all the fuss is about. The book is fictional and everyone has the right to believe in religion or not. Folks, this is not the first book to address the Holy Grail, Jesus being married, etc. Another book called, ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" also discusses these same issues. The Priory of Sion, the Knights Templar, etc are all discussed in this book.<br/><br/>Granted the book is fiction but many many of the ideas behind it are not. The fictional part is a man being murdered in the Louvre and two people are on a treasure hunt for the Holy Grail. However, the Christians persecuting and killing the Pagans is TRUE. Constantine making Christianity the official religion of Rome and helped create the first Bible is TRUE. I could go on and on and on. People who are uneducated should not say one word about this movie offending them. Those are the same people who have no clue about the facts I have listed above. Go to college and take a history class and then you will find out the truth. The problem is people don't like the truth so instead they pick and choose the evidence that supports their beliefs.<br/><br/>If you get the time, go to the movie. If nothing else it will get you to open your mind and challenge you to think. That's what makes the movie great. It challenges peoples beliefs and opens up Christanity for a topic of conversation."
"hjosien330","7","2","4","21 May 2006"," A good film
","I read the book and expected the worst based on the critics and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. In facts, I could enjoy it without constantly checking my memory of the book. Ron Howard did a pretty fine job following the script to make it a fiction without entering too much into the politics. The chemistry between the characters is actually quite good too - Audrey Tatou is a little stiff in the beginning but projects better emotions later on. The critics should step back and look at this movie without bias.<br/><br/>I suspect the main reason behind the opposition is that it will entice more people to read the book, the later is actually much more damaging to the church (any church) by revealing how it controls human behavior and get its dime in the process."
"qr474","8","2","4","21 May 2006"," Somewhat of a let-down
","first, let me start out by saying that may viewing of this film was somewhat obscured by protesters in front of my local theater... Anyway, this movie is one of the few GOOD ones I've seen this year although it does have it's fair share of problems. One in which being that the actors have no emotion form time to time and it seems very mono tome and can get annoying. Another is that there are spots that need MORE storytelling behind it and then there are parts that should have been left out altogether and some of the actions seem terribly expected. ""Hmm... Let me look over here and think for about 5 seconds then magically Find something/figure out a problem that should take MUCH longer."" But the good outweighs the bad by far in this overall faithful book-to-movie transition. The good are as follows: The powerful soundtrack, the way the flashback scenes are filmed, how much of the vital information has been put into the movie, the locations, and last but not least it can entertain most anyone who has even a LIGHT knowledge of Dan Bron or DaVinci (Me for example, although I did read the book and play the game first.) Let me say that if most of you are just flat out BASHING this movie and giving it low scores to make it look bad, please do not come back on to IMDb...

","OK! the so said ""most expected movie of the year"" arrives in Brazil with the sensation of a Blockbuster. It's been one year since I read the Dan Brown's book and I thought it wonderful! The secret societies explained, so was the speculations about Christ's life were really great to read, maybe because it was the first time I read a book with this contents. And most than everyone I was expecting for the World Premiere, this may 19. So I went to see the movie with my friends. I was so nervous that barely could read the legends, just paying attention on the scenes. At first, the movie starts with quickly thoughts, the way that Robert Langdon finds the first anagram of Leonardo DA vinci: The Mona Lisa appear to be a little easy, considering that in this anagram 26 letters composes it! But moving on...the story is well presented, the actors were really into the film! But here's the point, for those who did not read the book, the movie is wonderful, the person stays fixed ons the screen...you don't lose anything of the real message the book wants to tell! But for those who read the book, the movie seems a little weak, and become so little that it maybe very disappointing to these people that read the book, including myself! In the book, the very codes are solved after a lot of hard work of Robert and Sophie, once that in the movie it appeared a little soft and easy! So we cannot compare movie with book in the minimun details. And I understand that the producers and director couldn't make a movie that can be compared to the book, 'cause the book has so many things said, so codes, so point explained that this can only be passed in a Book! Therefore, the movie is great, the Book is great but we cannot compare both! one is movie industry and the other is literature! both passes messages in a different way!<br/><br/>hugs, Maurício!"

","Good adventure story, reminded me of the better Bond films before they became campy extensions of late 1960's puerile television shows. Curiously I found the book had a better adventure feel to it, in the sense that it was not very difficult to suspend a sense of disbelief. The film, on the other hand, and it's use of very graphic special effects and gadgetry, seemed to be upstaged by these devices and lacked a certain amount of ""believability"" - regrettable, to my way of thinking.<br/><br/>Two things came to mind: 1- there is a scene where the British shoot someone, and they fire single shots in succession. This is contrary to the ""double tap"" rule used by British police. Also, there is a religious reverence to the film at times that seems out of place.<br/><br/>Very glad to see it do so well at the box office opening weekend, in spite of critics that seemed to consistently pan it."
"jwoehr","7","2","4","21 May 2006"," Engaging and Interesting...FICTION!!!
","I have seen so many bad * 1/2 and even one star reviews for this movie and the only review that got things right is the **** review I saw by the New York Post. Once I saw that **** review I thought many other reviews like that would follow. However I guess everyone else that gave it bad reviews are either overly Christian or have short attenion spans. Since some either complain about the length or the story itself. I even heard something about over-acting. Funny, I don't recall much over-acting here. <br/><br/>There's also reviews about it be boring with too much talking. Sure it's convenient that they can get out every single thing they wanna say about history unknown to mankind before they are in danger again. However the book was like that too. Plus I didn't find all the talking boring. It' is faithful to the book and if everything the book says wasn't explained, the people watching the film that didn't read the book would be lost. <br/><br/>Besides listening to Ian McKellen talk in any movie isn't boring and of course it's not boring here either. Everything he says about Jesus may be silly and offending to some but....IT's FICTION!. People can be like ""oh no, tell me he didn't just say that"". When what is really so bad about what is being said ? I think it's selfish to just want to think that Jesus possibly couldn't of had a wife and kids and to totally be appalled by the thought. It doesn't make him any less special to me if it's true. Besides like I said...this is FICTION!, so hating the book and now the movie is the real silly thing. I think everyone that gave this bad reviews had it planned to hate it in the first place. <br/><br/>Yes the screenplay is done by Akiva Goldsman who wrote the screenplay for Batman & Robin. So of course critics had to throw that in there and say the movie sucks because of that too. I too expected the film to suck once I learned that but come on, there's no Batman & Robin like dialogue in this film. Of course the guy that wrote Batman & Robin isn't as good of a writer as Dan Brown but he doesn't do a bad job bringing Brown's work to the big screen either. If you're mad that he chose to have all the talking from the book then that's silly too. <br/><br/>The main characters are supposed to be talkers and brainy debaters. While the actors play them how they should be played. This is a movie where you are supposed open your mind and heart and just think a little. If you want a non-stop action summer movie, this isn't it but is it a bad summer movie ? No not at all. Is it a bad adaption of the Da Vinci Code ? No, it's everything it should be and Ron Howard is very faithful to the book and so are the actors. Newsday also called the film over-scored by Hans Zimmer , I couldn't disagree more. The score is wonderful and if the film wasn't soooo unfairly hated it would get a best score nomination like it deserves. This is probably Ron Howards most unfairly hated film since Willow. While reading the book, the ending didn't do much for me but actually seeing it yourself, it's just beautiful and breathtaking and I loved it. So just give this film a chance and don't think it's your job of being a Christian to hate the film, just open your mind and sit back and relax."

I really and truly was thrilled by this movie!<br/><br/>Even though I myself may not agree with some of the ideas presented in this FICTIONAL work, I think it is foolish for people to be making such a big deal about it. People may not approve of certain religions but do they stand outside the places of worship and protest? Do they shun people who accept the foreign religion? Not in the norm! So why don't people just get over it and enjoy some interesting writing. It is, after all, a thrilling murder mystery and in no way does seeing the movie make a person less of a Christian.<br/><br/>My advice, go see it but leave the kids at home and don't bring your friends who are unstable and questioning of Christian belief.<br/><br/>I do no regret this movie or resent its existence."
"starwasr","Null","2","4","21 May 2006"," Not half as bad as people are making out.
","I saw this last night and would give it a solid 7/10. I think the problem the makers had was trying to get the very convoluted story across with reams of dialogue. The nature of the story demands this but it takes a while and doesn't have the 'page-turner' effect of the book as these revelations, which happen often, are not visually appealing but portray images when you read them. I think they did as well as could be expected getting a complicated story to the screen intact. Silas the monk is menacing, Jean Reno as Bezu Fache could have been made more of but as is the nature of the story, it doesn't lend itself well to character development, the main focus of the film is on the revelations, which are just spoken words. Ian McKellen is excellent as Sir Leigh Teabing, the eccentric English symbologist who turns a bit nasty and Audrey Tatou as Sophie Neveu is exactly how you would have imagined her to look whilst reading the book. As for Tom Hanks, well he's Tom Hanks, you know what to expect but he didn't really make you root for him as you tend to in the book and he is probably one of the few characters who has the chance to. Watch it, even if you have read the book, it isn't that bad!"

Don't get me wrong, the movie was not terrible but quite entertaining. It just did not meet up to the standards that the media had set prior to the film's release. It was a good movie. It just wasn't that amazing, spectacular, breathtaking, intriguing film that you see so very rarely nowadays. It was one of those movies where you walked out of the theater and you thought about it for a little while but then it would never cross your mind the next day, or the following week, or ever really.

I actually listened to the book on tape because I was on a long trip, and at some points in this film, Tom Hanks's voice was uncannily similar to that of the voice the reader used when Robert Langdon was speaking. Also, I didn't feel(as some others have said before me) that the dialouge was wooden, nor did I feel that you had to read the book to like this movie. I also thought that you can be Christian and like this film, because it has good suspense,and a very good plot, and if you don't like the theories, you don't HAVE to believe them."

","usually, most of the films based on a book are much worse than the book, but this is an exception. The book, though enjoyable, is quite bad (it has had these enormous success only because it criticize the Vatican, anything more; the book is like a funny comic, any literature value, but good for enjoying the time). However, the film is rather good (which was a surprise). The cast is really good: if I had to choose the best actors for all the roles, I'd chosen the same that were there, so, I can not complain! The film has a good rhythm and it does not stops during most of the film, the action develops itself in a fine way (good directed) and the puzzles are not boring but interesting.<br/><br/>Maybe the ending is quite slow, and this, in addition to the great longness of the movie can result tiring for some people. To sum up, I'm quite pleased with this film, I expected it to be bad, but it is enjoyable. If you are not able to be easily offended about theological subjects, probably you will have a good time. It is curious that it is not needed to have read the book to catch everything that happens, which is unusual."

","Unfortunately the movie is not overly accurate to the book which was AMAZING!. If I had not read the book ahead of time I would have really enjoyed this film, but being a fan of the original the lack of continuity was a disappointment. The biggest inconsistency was the last 45 minutes of the film. Which took away from the important story information.On the positive side, Tom Hanks was amazing (as always), his portrayal of Robert Lagdon was not lacking what so ever. Audrey Tautou was also wonderful and really captured the character of Sophie Neveau. I also want to comment on Ian McKellen's performance. I felt that he was a very effective Teabing but, was definitely out shinned but Hanks, and finally I would like to applaud Paul Bettany's performance as Silas.The only question I have about his character is ""Where are the red eyes?"".

","It was amazing, really, the reaction to the Da Vinci Code. Never, in a megaplex, have I seen a sell-out crowd of teens, adults and seniors all mingled together in a stuffy theater. Not since Titanic. Reeling in at two and a half hours, Da Vinci Code feels like a long movie. However, if you read the book, you will not be disappointed. The movie moves as fast as the novel and is as faithful as an adaptation will get. The cast is right on cue with its characters and Ron Howard did not stray into any creative freedom to ruin the movie.<br/><br/>The curator to the Louvre is murdered, and the French silently accuse one Robert Langdon, an American professor of religious symbols. It's up to Langdon and an officer who believes his innocence to unlock the clues of the murder.<br/><br/>About the protests and hunger strikes that surround the movie, my advice is to relax. Throughout the movie, the characters themselves say that some of the secrets and stories about the Catholic church is fictional itself. And in some scenes (particularly the one where Sophie's secret is revealed), the ideas are so far from left field that, oddly, I found myself the only one in the theater laughing. The Da Vinci Code is pure fiction. The entire movie is melodramatic, with Zimmer's musical score blaring that whole point. But if you loved the book, you'll love the movie and I recommend you to watch it."

Howard has the privilege of having an outstanding cast to work with. Alfred Molina,Paul Bettany, and the all ways outstanding Ian McKellan particularly stand out. Hanks is good but I still think someone else should have taken the role. The film is flawed though,I found segments of it to drag. Langdon's ability to decipher century old riddles within minutes is very hard to believe.

"gregy55902","7","2","4","21 May 2006"," Very entertaining but overlong
","I have not read the book, but the movie was pretty entertaining to me anyway. Now for my constructive criticism: <br/><br/>Ron Howard was not the best director they could have found for this, because he's too manipulative. The music swells every time something dramatic happens, and that gets really annoying after awhile. The cinematography was actually very good; everything is captured onto celluloid in a beautiful way. They managed to avoid a ""shaky"" camera during the chase scenes, which was commendable. Every director seems to be keen to use shaky cams these days, and it is very annoying/nauseating, so this film gets the props for that. The script was good, although not airtight, and I am sure the book is better in this case (from what other people are saying, anyway). The music was O.K. although it was very forgettable (I don't remember any of it).<br/><br/>So is it entertaining or not? Heck yes! It might have been loads less entertaining if I had read the book beforehand, because the uniqueness of it all would be taken away, but I digress. I sat there very entertained for 2 hours, only to have it get too drawn out near the end. This also could be due to the fact it was an 11PM showing, and we got out of the theater at 2AM (and I was dead tired by that point), but still. I could tell that there were other people in the audience getting restless too, so it wasn't just me. They should have condensed some of the scenes to make it about two hours max, but of course they didn't (I'm looking at you, Mr Howard). With a different director (although I'm not sure who), this could have been THE best movie of the year. Actually, it still is one of the best movies I've seen this year. It sounds like I'm being too critical, but meh, its what I do. Highly entertaining but overlong; enjoyable nonetheless. Verdict: <br/><br/>7 out of 10: recommended."
"Tirogesflair","Null","2","4","21 May 2006"," A chore for anyone except the Converted !
","Not having read the book but familiar with its contents and story - I found this film a real chore to endure - and not something I would like to repeat either. It was a film that appeared to be like a contestant in a reality show where it had to do 20 things in two and a bit hours. It appeared to be making sure it was covering the ground of all those who had read the book (so a lot of the book's scenes are there as well - as I understand from my partner) - but also deal with those who had no clue about anything. Hence the weird 're-enactments' from Christianity's past including Emperor Constantine, paganism's fall, The capture of Jerusalem in 1099 and the secret the Knights Templar had found which allowed them to blackmail the papacy . For those in the middle - like myself - well , I kept thinking - 'there is no time for us to get to know - or care about these characters'. I think also it was an interestng clash of acting styles. The British actors had no problem getting into their roles (McKellen, Bettany and Molina) but Tom Hanks was a tourist in his own movie. As for Audrey Tautou - her strong French accent wasn't charming when you couldn't understand what she had just said. So for fans of the book - go see. Anyone else - hope Ron Howard has made a better film by the time the DVD comes out."

","A good movie, not great. It rattled along well enough to keep one interested, but a little too quickly to delve into any one of the many issues and characters - the main intent seeming to be to cover as much of the book as possible within a reasonable time.<br/><br/>Comparing it with other ""chase across Europe"" films, Da Vinci Code has none of the pace or viewer involvement of Ronin or either of the Bournes.<br/><br/>Considering the number of other supposedly controversial movies released over the years, I was amazed to realize this is the first film I've seen where I encountered people demonstrating against the movie. And what a sorry bunch they were.<br/><br/>It's ironic that many of the religious bigots who ARE offended by Da Vinci Code were just last year defending The Passion of the Christ against criticism from Jewish groups for the offense that film caused them.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have said, this film is a work of fiction. The story may shine a light on certain questionable facets of Christianity (like Constantine's handy reworking of pagan rites and dates), but that stuff is more anti-Catholic than anti-Christian."
"MaxBorg89","7","2","4","20 May 2006"," Overlong and occasionally dumb, but otherwise a pretty enjoyable blockbuster
","The best way of appreciating The Da Vinci Code is to be perfectly sure of your expectations. In my case, I knew exactly what I thought I would see: on the cover of the Italian edition, the original novel is defined ""a thriller by Dan Brown"", not ""an essay on mankind's history by Dan Brown"". The book is 100% fiction and, while not a classic, it's entertaining enough if you have nothing else to do on a boring Saturday afternoon. The movie adaptation is just the same, and that's why I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Most critics, even those who didn't like the film (and there are plenty of them), claim the first fifteen minutes are the best. They've got a point: the opening sequence, where Jacques Saunière, the aged curator of the Louvre, is murdered by albino ""monk"" Silas (Paul Bettany), is indeed quite chilling, setting the tone for subsequent events. The weird circumstances of Saunière's death (apparently, he left a series of clues on his own body right before biting the dust) lead to symbology expert Robert Langdon's (Tom Hanks) involvement. Unfortunately, a misinterpretation of certain signs make him the prime suspect, and with the help of the victim's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), he has to discover the truth, a truth which will see him, to paraphrase English historian Leigh Teabing (the scene-stealing Ian Mckellen), ""witness the biggest cover-up in human history"".<br/><br/>It is said cover-up which has made some people (mostly over-religious) utterly hate The Da Vinci Code, because of its supposed ""blasphemy"" and ""heresy"". Now, the theory at the center of the film is with no doubt intriguing (a part of it was already dealt with in Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, conveniently mentioned in Brown's source novel), but let's face it: is there anyone who would take that stuff seriously? I mean, The Last Temptation of Christ can be taken seriously, in spite of its ""upsetting"" content, because it's a serious film. The Da Vinci Code, on the other hand, while dealing with interesting ideas (well, as interesting as they can get in an average mystery book), was made for only one reason: to be an exciting, entertaining summer blockbuster. Which it is.<br/><br/>Despite the overused plot line (average guy ends up in something so much bigger than him), director Ron Howard keeps the pace and suspense at a constant level, proving his versatility once again. He also confirms his very good eye for casting: Tom Hanks is a convincing protagonist, mainly thanks to the fact that he doesn't look like your ordinary action hero, and is therefore an excellent choice as a Hitchcockian everyman in an unusual situation, while Jean Reno gives all of his natural roguish charm to the stubborn French cop who makes it his mission to arrest Langdon (it is reported that Brown created the character with Reno in mind, and it is hard not to believe it). But, as usual, it's the Brits who steal the show: Alfred Molina's ambiguous bishop won't please devout churchmen (but hey, if everyone complained for being misrepresented cinematically, then how often would the French, the Germans and the Russians have sued Hollywood by now?), but he is a charismatic presence; Bettany is downright terrifying as one of the most disturbed (and disturbing) psychos to have hit the screens, adding an extra edge to the darker side he had previously shown in Gangster No. 1; and let's not forget Sir Mckellen, who enters the game an hour into the movie and then practically walks away with it, thanks to a characterization that is over-the-top, but in a classy, English way.<br/><br/>I still haven't mentioned Tautou, and that's because she is, despite trying her best, the weakest element in the film: best known for playing sweet, slightly naive women (as seen in the wonderful Amélie), she struggles to look convincing as a smart scholar, a fact that is particularly evident in the stretched epilogue, the only part of the movie that gets close to becoming utterly risible. However, this shouldn't detract from the merits of The Da Vinci Code, an unpretentious Hollywood thriller that sets out to entertain and succeeds most of the time, as long as the viewer knows it shouldn't be taken seriously. <br/><br/>7,5/10"

","They say The Da Vinci Code has sold more copies than any book since the Bible. Good thing it has a different ending. Dan Brown's novel is utterly preposterous; Ron Howard's movie is preposterously entertaining. Both contain accusations against the Catholic Church and its order of Opus Dei that would be scandalous if anyone of sound mind could possibly entertain them. I know there are people who believe Brown's fantasies about the Holy Grail, the descendants of Jesus, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei and the true story of Mary Magdalene. This has the advantage of distracting them from the theory that the Pentagon was not hit by an airplane.<br/><br/>Let us begin, then, by agreeing that The Da Vinci Code is a work of fiction. And that since everyone has read the novel, I need only give away one secret -- that the movie follows the book religiously. While the book is a potboiler written with little grace and style, it does supply an intriguing plot. Luckily, Ron Howard is a better filmmaker than Dan Brown is a novelist; he follows Brown's formula (exotic location, startling revelation, desperate chase scene, repeat as needed) and elevates it into a superior entertainment, with Tom Hanks as a theo-intellectual Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Hanks stars as Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist in Paris for a lecture when Inspector Fache (Jean Reno) informs him of the murder of museum curator Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle). This poor man has been shot and will die late at night inside the Louvre; his wounds, although mortal, fortunately leave him time enough to conceal a safe deposit key, strip himself, cover his body with symbols written in his own blood, arrange his body in a pose and within a design by Da Vinci, and write out, also in blood, an encrypted message, a scrambled numerical sequence and a footnote to Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), the pretty French policewoman whom he raised after the death of her parents. Most people are content with a dying word or two; Jacques leaves us with a film treatment.<br/><br/>Having read the novel, we know what happens then. Sophie warns Robert he is in danger from Fache, and they elude capture in the Louvre and set off on a quest that leads them to the vault of a private bank, to the French villa of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), to the Temple Church in London, to an isolated Templar church in the British countryside, to a hidden crypt and then back to the Louvre again. The police, both French and British, are one step behind them all of this time, but Sophie and Robert are facile, inventive and daring. Also, perhaps, they have God on their side.<br/><br/>This series of chases, discoveries and escapes is intercut with another story, involving an albino named Silas (Paul Bettany), who works under the command of the Teacher, a mysterious figure at the center of a conspiracy to conceal the location of the Holy Grail, what it really is, and what that implies. The conspiracy involves members of Opus Dei, a society of Catholics who in real life (I learn from a recent issue of the Spectator) are rather conventionally devout and prayerful. Although the movie describes their practices as ""maso-chastity,"" not all of them are chaste and hardly any practice self-flagellation. In the months ahead, I would advise Opus Dei to carefully scrutinize membership applications.<br/><br/>Opus Dei works within but not with the church, which also harbors a secret cell of cardinals who are in on the conspiracy (the pope and most other Catholics apparently don't have backstage passes).<br/><br/>These men keep a secret that, if known, could destroy the church. That's why they keep it. If I were their adviser, I would point out that by preserving the secret, they preserve the threat to the church, and the wisest strategy would have been to destroy the secret, say, 1,000 years ago.<br/><br/>But one of the fascinations of the Catholic Church is that it is the oldest continuously surviving organization in the world, and that's why movies like ""The Da Vinci Code"" are more fascinating than thrillers about religions founded, for example, by a science-fiction author in the 1950s. All of the places in ""The Da Vinci Code"" really exist, though the last time I visited the Temple Church I was disappointed to find it closed for ""repairs."" A likely story.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno do a good job of not overplaying their roles, and Sir Ian McKellen overplays his in just the right way, making Sir Leigh into a fanatic whose study just happens to contain all the materials for an audio-visual presentation that briefs his visitors on the secrets of Da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" and other matters. Apparently he keeps in close touch with other initiates. On the one hand, we have a conspiracy that lasts 2,000 years and threatens the very foundations of Christianity, and on the other hand a network of rich dilettantes who resemble a theological branch of the Baker Street Irregulars.<br/><br/>Yes, the plot is absurd, but then most movie plots are absurd. That's what we pay to see. What Ron Howard brings to the material is tone and style, and an aura of mystery that is undeniable. He begins right at the top; Columbia Pictures logo falls into shadow as Hans Zimmer's music sounds simultaneously liturgical and ominous. The murder scene in the Louvre is creepy in a ritualistic way, and it's clever the way Langdon is able to look at letters, numbers and symbols and mentally rearrange them to yield their secrets. He's like the Flora Cross character in ""Bee Season,"" who used kabbalistic magic to visualize spelling words floating before her in the air.<br/><br/>The movie works; it's involving, intriguing and constantly seems on the edge of startling revelations. After it's over and we're back on the street, we wonder why this crucial secret needed to be protected by the equivalent of a brain-twister puzzle crossed with a scavenger hunt. The trail that Robert and Sophie follow is so difficult and convoluted that it seems impossible that anyone, including them, could ever follow it. The secret needs to be protected up to a point; beyond that it is absolutely lost, and the whole point of protecting it is beside the point. Here's another question: Considering where the trail begins, isn't it sort of curious where it leads? Still, as T.S. Eliot wrote, ""In my beginning is my end."" Maybe he was on to something.<br/><br/>S."

""The Da Vinci Code"" might be my favorite Ron Howard film, even though I never seen all of films yet or this film got negative reviews, except ""Apollo 13"" which is a film I really loved, but let's talk about this movie.
First off, I want to say that I'm a catholic and a christian and I could see some of the stuff that Catholics and Christians saying stuff about this movie, I eventually watched some YouTube videos of Catholics and Christians protesting this film and getting offended by it, which I find it very stupid.

"fuzzles","5","0","0","29 January 2020"," Far less than it should've been
","Working from an extremely gripping, strong novel, this movie missed the boat in too many ways. The screenplay, by Akiva Goldsman, is clunky, obvious and free of lyricism and flow. Tom Hanks, a reliably great actor, is so relentlessly glum as to remove some oxygen from the film, though he still has his moments (and is supposed to be a less than expansive character). His chemistry with Audrey Tautou, as Sophie, is practically nonexistent, though both hold their own, separately.<br/><br/>The production design, by Allan Cameron, was excellent, especially the scene near the end in the basement of a church, and the cinematography was strong. The music could've given the movie a much stronger identity than it did. It was just serviceable, no distinct themes.<br/><br/>That said, there are some treats and great scenes within this film. Ian McKellen is just right, and a welcome element of wit & charm in a film chock full of dour miscasting, as Leigh Teabing. Jean Reno is reliably strong as the cop chasing Robert & Sophie, Bezu Fache, and Jürgen Prochnow is effective as a somewhat mysterious banker.<br/><br/>Great story, wrong director, miscast stars, a nondescript score and far less than a maximization of the material. In some ways, this reminded me of a far different film in which Tom Hanks was badly miscast, The Bonfire of the Vanities.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a great treasure as an actor, with wonderful range, but he's not the guy for every role. This seemed to be a too constipated & overly repressed character for him to play.<br/><br/>Worth seeing for some of its elements but largely a disappointment."

","This film essentially begins with a man by the name of ""Jacques Saunière"" (Jean-Pierre Marielle) being fatally shot in the Louvre by an assassin known simply as ""Silas"" (Paul Bettany). As it so happens, Jacques is not only the curator of the Louvre but also the grand master of a secret fraternal organization known as the Priory of Sion. And it's because of his association with the Priory of Sion that Jacques is killed. However, before he is shot, Silas extracts a key bit of information before leaving him alone on the floor to bleed to death. Not long afterward, a professor of religious symbols by the name of ""Robert Langdon"" (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by the French investigator named ""Captain Bezu Fache"" (Jean Reno) to ostensibly help solve the case. What Robert Langdon doesn't realize, however, is that Captain Fache has another reason for requesting his presence and if not for the timely intervention of an attractive woman named ""Sophie Neveu"" (Audrey Tautou) he would have been arrested shortly afterward. It's then that both Robert and Sophie begin on a desperate quest for the Holy Grail and their lives will never be the same from that point on. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining mystery film which took a number of twists and turns along the way. On the other hand, however, I must also mention that much of the film was based on a number of half-baked conspiracy theories which should cause anybody with a rudimentary grasp of history to shake their heads in disbelief. Again, it was entertaining-but it was also quite nonsensical as well. That being said, I can fully appreciate any apprehension a viewer might have with regard to their rating. That being the case, had it not contained so many obvious and blatant historical inaccuracies, I would have rated it higher."

Serene pace of the movie is impressive. Faith and knowledge are portrayed very well including responses of different characters. The characters are believable. The movie explicitly shows that evil and good also prevails outside the church. This is an important point regarding humanistic approach to religion.
The movie is superb but only a few flaws remained which doesn't really disturb the theme I feel. Many about the life death situation at the beginning that it could been better than that.

","21 May 2006. Ron Howard has created an amazing intellectually stimulating religious mystery-thriller without distracting and unnecessary special effects and action thrills. Most of the important action sequences are tame by current standards and straightforward but are more compelling for their simplicity than their implausibility, especially considering the premise of the movie. The twists and turns are nice and the lengthy ending is more Fahrenheit 451 (1966). The pacing of this verbose and convoluted symbolic deciphering is intriguing and consistently entertaining. Tom Hanks offers a sympathetic character who articulates the story well. The tension oozes out in strategically timed sequences. The weakest part of the movie is the opening sequence which seems more forced and awkward in its presentation and photographic technique. Most of the characters are presented with more than stereotypical two-dimensional depth. While this movie could have been more powerful in The Passion of The Christ (2004) in terms of start realism, this more summer blockbuster provides its audience with religious exploration and controversy as acceptable entertainment This movie breaks new religious ground for mental exploration with an important message for the sexual division in our society. It's approach is positive and mysteriously sad at the same time. The criticism of Ron Howard holding back isn't in evidence here, except for those people eager for division and conflict for its own sake. But such a dramatic heightening of controversy would belie the true intent of the movie. The movie offers hope of an uplifting outcome as a result of the production of The Da Vinci Code. Eight out of Ten Stars."

","Boy, talk about a letdown. This film is a poster child for what hype and too much positive publicity can do to a film- The Da Vinci code isn't a bad movie but nor is it the second coming of Christ(no pun intended). When you boil away the hype and hysteria, all that remains is a pedestrian murder mystery that isn't sufficiently challenging or scandalous to raise anyone's hackles. It's preposterous, overlong, and saddled with a sloppy denouement that defines the term ""anti-climax."" The film's two big ""surprises"" are telegraphed early, and the ease with which they can be guessed (using the ""conservation of characters"" process) leeches the movie of a large measure of its suspense. Individual scenes are entertaining in their own right, but the production as a whole is a lumbering mess."

","Controversial for its proliferation of the ""mythical"" Priory of Sion and fraudulent ideology that Christianity is built based upon a lie, there is nothing quite like this to stir up religious warfare. Quite often my opinion is in the minority, and we visit that zone once again because I just adore this film. Yes, there are gaping plot holes and heavy hand-holding as the mystery unravels, but sweet Mary Magdalene it is so incredibly absorbing and interesting. It is one of the few conspiracy theories that stimulates my ageing brain. A symbologist is the prime suspect in an investigation for the murder of the Louvre curator, however the victim left encoded clues that soon start to unravel an ancient mystery. Religion is the catalyst for death. As long as one God is said to exist, people will continuously murder in his name. Brown's perspective for the radicalisation of faith and the centuries of unnecessary deaths all in the name of Christianity is a sentiment that I also share. However, regardless of my (or your) religious views, this mystery is still thought-provoking and paced meticulously well. It consistently involves you, allowing you to wrap your mind around the enigma that is the ""cryptex"". The adequate amount of both informative plot points and character backstory allows the story to be intuitively engrossing. Small details in Langdon and Neveu's past allows them to be somewhat relatable, yet it never felt unnecessary. These scenes, whilst prevent the characters from being completely one-dimensional, become important to the mystery. Hanks and Tautou were functional, they keep the narrative moving. Applause for McKellen though, as he was simply scrumptious. The twenty minute dissection of Da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" was mesmerisingly fascinating. Praise for Zimmer's score should not go amiss, particularly the final track ""Chavalier De Sangreal"". Within the perplexing nonsense, there are underdeveloped sub-plots. Opus Dei was underused, especially the talented Molina. Still, nonsensical hooey fun."

","I think the books are fun. They get into issues of art and secret societies going back ages. I'll admit that Dan Brown misses the point sometimes on some of his set-ups. But like most fiction, especially the genre he belongs to (I will throw in the likes of Preston & Childs), there are liberties taken. I'd like to know where those places in Game of Thrones are on our earth. Silly. Well. There is no scientific or historical accuracy in these films. The author created a world where evil has existed for centuries and he makes up a situation where this evil must be circumvented. I think what has happened here is because Dan Brown is not considered a fantasy writer, his work gets attacked as if her were a scholar. That trickles down to the movies and makes people so emotional. I liked the review by the woman and her boyfriend who had never read the book. They were willing to let their prejudices go. I didn't care much for the sequels, but there are other reasons for that. I think Hanks was quite adequate and the move is reasonable."
"masonmorgan-92917","6","0","0","3 December 2016"," Somewhat entertaining, but ultimately messy
","Tom Hanks behind Ron Howard's direction has led to some success in the past such as the entertaining, albeit super corny, Apollo 13. Here, Ron Howard has tackled a subject that few other mainstream directors would even think to. But the controversy over the subject matter seems unnecessary as even the characters within the story don't seem to believe the far-fetched and incredibly bogus plot. <br/><br/>To begin, the acting is surprisingly dull. Tom Hanks, a legendary actor, never had ""the scene"" is this movie, making his performance distractingly off. At times, it looked like he didn't even want to be there, which only attributed to the sleepy tone of the film. Any actor could have portrayed Tom Hanks' character, making his presence feel like a waste of true talent. That being said, Ian McKellen was actually great. His introduction to the story and his deciphering of The Last Supper painting was among the films brightest moments. He brought a much needed pop of character to the story. Still, it was funny to see the lack of emotion within a group of people who were unfolding a secret that would lead to the most important discovery of all time. <br/><br/>Now I do think that the story is completely stupid and rarely makes sense, but the film in it's entirety is admittedly entertaining. I can't say I was ever bored watching The Da Vinci Code as the story moved quickly from puzzle to puzzle and the group made new discoveries. This is where the movie shines and some fun can be had. But when we left our main characters, the story began to drag considerably. The parallel story lines just simply weren't intriguing and while they did provide the conflict and tension, motives were not clear and the sub-characters just weren't interesting. <br/><br/>Watching our three main characters decipher ancient codes and riddles was actually quite interesting. While most of it is totally wack, these scenes did manage to hold my attention, resulting in some fun enigmas and hidden secrets. It's just too bad that the surrounding characters and atmosphere feel so insignificant, which makes the clues uncovered feel unimportant. <br/><br/>The film also went on for way too long. The main story was done at the 2 hour mark, but it felt the need to continue for an extra 20 minutes where nothing was really accomplished. This extra 20 minutes did give us the answer to our main question, but it really felt unnecessary at that point as even our main characters had seemingly gotten over solving the mystery. And at that point, I imagine the audience has as well.<br/><br/>Ron Howard tried so hard to piece together an alternate path in history, one in which we have to suspend our beliefs so high to a point where it feels artificial and clumsily manufactured. While it was entertaining to watch at times, the matter never felt pressing and the tension never felt real. The characters were just as believable as the ludicrous story, but if they had been even half as interesting, it would have been a much more memorable experience."

"markwatney94","8","0","0","2 November 2016"," A movie with flaws - which are greatly exceeded by the merits it has to offer
","Even if many people and critics denounce The Da Vinci Code as an average mystery-thriller, it is far more than that. For me there is hardly a more interesting premise than to combine real historical events with a compelling story that evolves around those things. Dan Brown manages to delicately explore famous artwork, architecture and sights and weave an interesting, complex and twisted story around them. The plot is basically a treasure-hunt including codes and puzzles that need to be solved in time, and this makes for a thrilling and compelling movie experience, which - if you are willing to get yourself into it - on top of that offers a big amount of knowledge. The thought provoking themes and theories that Dan Brown explores in The Da Vinci Code have even led me to start reading the bible, which makes all the protest from church officials and catholic groups around the world somewhat ridiculous considering this book makes people concern themselves more with religion and its scripture.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman did a good job in adapting the novel by cutting the unnecessary stuff out (sometimes the novel goes in pages-long details about historical events) and keeping the right stuff in. While the story is compelling, the villain's plan is maybe a little bit over-complicated and ludicrous. The method of giving the historical background in old-fashioned flashbacks with voice-over was the right choice. It is these flashbacks where you can learn a lot about European religious history. Of course not all presented facts in the novel and the film are true, but if you choose to get yourself into the theories you may experience a fascinating movie with very surprising twists, some stunning visuals, extraordinary beautiful music and some interesting characters.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard did some great work on The Da Vinci Code, however, he does not manage to deliver a constantly solid film: There are scenes which are emotionally and intellectually involving like the one in Teabing's ballroom explaining Leonardo's Last Supper and the mystery about Mary Magdalene. Here Ron Howard merges the three characters Langdon, Neveu and Teabing together with the TV showing the Last Supper (which almost acts as a fourth character) in a very investing and lucid dynamic interaction which helps to clearly understand the somewhat complex topic without being too dry and fact-laden. Another great scene takes place in the chapel behind Westminster Abbey where Teabing confronts Langdon and Neveu, which features Langdon's reflection about Newton's achievements, shown in another stunning animation. The ending scene however, in which Langdon eventually solves the code and makes his way through the evening streets of Paris to the Louvre, stands out most: the magic of a Parisian evening, the beauty of the Louvre and its Pyramid - greatly captured by Salvatore Totino's cinematography - paired with the impact of the story and your desire for it to be finally solved, Tom Hanks reciting the poem and, above all, Hans Zimmer's wonderful score make for one of the most cinematic beautiful sequences I've ever seen.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are some scenes that feel a little bit rushed and unconvincing, like the unrealistically fast responds of the people in Langdon's auditorium at the beginning of the film, major parts of Langdon and Fache's conversation in the Louvre, the scene with Silas and Remy in the Temple Church, the Teacher's POV scene with Remy and some of the flashbacks concerning Silas and Sophie Neveu's past, respectively. The subplot concerning bishop Aringarosa, though important for the narrative, is not very interesting either.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Alfred Molina gives a solid performance as Aringarosa, as does Jürgen Prochnow as Andre Vernet, director of the Swiss Bank. Throughout the film, Etienne Chicot performs really good as the grim police officer Collet, whose authority appears somewhat stronger than in the novel, especially with respect to Capitaine Fache, who is not perfectly portrayed by Jean Reno in my opinion, with his lines sometimes sounding too forced and static. Similarly, Audrey Tautou's acting - while Sophie Neveu is a likable character and has her moments - is not always quite believable. Jean-Yves Berteloot's acting as Teabing's servant Remy is not really impressive as well. In contrast, Tom Hanks is, as usual, very pleasant and convincing; in my opinion he is the best actor working today and I deem him the perfect casting choice for Robert Langdon. While Paul Bettany gives a very dedicated performance as Silas, the best both written and acted character, however, is Sir Leigh Teabing, portrayed by the remarkable Sir Ian McKellen. Every second he is on screen he steals the show and is a pleasure to watch. This refers especially to the ballroom scene in Château Villette and the plane scene where he gives, as I perceive it, one of the best little speeches in movie history, concerning history and him ""creating"" it now.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, what truly elevates all the scenes and makes some of them so emotionally impacting, is Hans Zimmer's amazing score. On the one hand the themes consist of old-fashioned ecclesiastical appearing choir movements - supplemented by bells - and, on the other hand, of modern fast-paced staccato choir pieces paired with heavy orchestration and synthesizer elements, resembling the thrilling treasure hunt against the clock. The main theme ""Chevaliers de Sangreal"" develops a single minimalist motive by continuous augmentation into a phenomenal climax. Hans Zimmer uses this sort of relatively simple but all the more effective technique quite frequently, like in Inception and Interstellar. The Da Vinci Code's original score is, I claim, truly Oscar-worthy. The Academy chose to ignore it, the Globes, however, did not.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a very special, highly original movie which explores great themes, and it deserves more attention and certainly better ratings. If you let yourself in for it and are not too nit-picky, you may well have a truly rewarding experience with The Da Vinci Code."

","With the upcoming release of the new Ron Howard-Tom Hanks thriller INFERNO Sony has chosen to re-release their first two original outings together with the Dan Brown character of Robert Langdon. It's a good thing to as some may have forgotten how great those two movies were. Not only that but it makes a great excuse for upgrading from the old DVD to blu-ray formats. And of those fortunate enough to have upgraded to the new 4k format it is available that way as well.<br/><br/>But let's go back to the beginning with this, the first film. Hanks stars as Langdon, a professor of religious iconology and symbology, a less action prone Indiana Jones. While lecturing in Paris he is called upon by Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) to help in the investigation of a murdered curator at The Louvre, Jacques Sauniere. Langdon was supposed to have met with the man but failed to do so. Now he stands over the man's body looking at clues put in place by the man as he was dying.<br/><br/>As he interprets the clues for the captain another officer, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou) arrives with information. She loans Langdon her cell phone and tells him to call a specific number. When he does, he gets a recording made by Sophie telling him that he is about to be arrested for the murder and to go to the men's room. She aids him in escaping and off they go with the police in pursuit.<br/><br/>It turns out Sophie was the granddaughter of the deceased and believes a message he left behind with Langdon's name on it wasn't a clue to the name of his murderer but one to lead her to seek his help. Using the clues left behind by Sauniere they discover that he was a member of a secret society known as the Priory of Sion whose duty was to protect the Holy Grail. With not only the police but a separate secret society, an outlaw sect of the Catholic Church, they must not only clear Langdon's name but find the real murderer and save the grail at the same time. But just exactly what is the grail? What we have here is a well thought out mystery that takes the time to offer clues to its solution from start to finish. As I said earlier the character of Langdon is a sort of Indiana Jones figure, a scholar with an overwhelming sense of wonder at all things in his field. The look of amazement on Hank's face as Langdon when he is presented with various items, paintings, symbols and more throughout shows the love and respect the character has for each. It is a subtle display that shows why Hanks is one of the best actors in the business.<br/><br/>The movie progresses at an even keel combining moments with a sense of urgency beside others that show the thought process going on as Hanks and Tatou attempt to solve the puzzle with each clue moving them forward to yet another. This is author Dan Brown's method on display, telling us not just what is happening in the here and now but how it relates to history as well. While my guess would be there is some narrative license being used at moments, much of the history told is well researched and solid. This makes the movie not only a thriller that holds you in its grip but one that fills you full of history and information at the same time.<br/><br/>In watching the film I was amazed at just how well it was done. Howard has pulled together some of the most talented people in the business behind the scenes as well as on screen to present a compelling story that grabs the viewer by the throat and never lets go until the final credits roll. You never want to turn from the screen for fear of missing out on something. Even ten years later and two viewings in the past I still found myself fascinated. The film remains gorgeous to look at and entertaining to the extreme.<br/><br/>If you've never seen the movie then by all means buy a copy today. You'll find it one of the best movies made in some time as well as one of the greatest thrillers around. And if you pick this one and its sequel ANGELS & DEMONS up soon you'll have time to get caught up in the story of Langdon before the next movie comes out. It will be time well spent."

","All the bookworms might put me in jail and throw away the keys but I'm here to confess that I had never read the controversial novel by Dan Brown. When I first saw ""The Da Vinci Code"" I just walked in with a clear mind and a clean slate. People might hate for it, I saw the movie before I ever had the the chance to read the book. I may not be the only one, but at least I'm coming clean with you all. From what I've watch I'm pretty sure Brown must have some keen eye on artistic intentions and has high interests in prose. Friends tried to get me to see this movie just to see what all the fuss was about, even though I never got around to reading the book. From words of people who did read the novel, the script by Akiva Goldsman, pretty much follows through most of the important parts of the novel which in itself could potentially ensure with some level of satisfaction. <br/><br/>After seeing it for the first I was absolutely very fond of this movie. It didn't waste time introducing the concept of the plot and it was executed quite nuanced and in full detail and once that was done the thrills just take off from there. In Paris, Louvre curator Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) has been murdered by an albino complexioned assassin named Silas (Paul Bettany) who's under the guidance of someone known as ""The Teacher"". That's when moody Harvard symbologist Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is requested by the French police to decipher the clues that led to Sauniere's death and the esoteric markings he's left behind. Police cryptographer Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) also gets involved in the crime. Langdon's now been labeled as a primary suspect and is now on the run and the chase is on.<br/><br/>Langdon and Neveu seem to have different sets of enemies. The French law enforcement lead by Captain Fache (Jean Reno) seems to be hot on their trail and are inches from catching them. The other seems to be the Roman Catholic Church who seems to be hiding some sort of dark secret that can't be revealed. Silas along with the Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina) join forces to bring our heroes down. The closest ally to our protagonists is Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) to Robert and Sophie if the want to escape from their enemies and unraveling this encoded sacred secret. Only to know later what's really Teabing's motives are.<br/><br/>So now as I see it the genre has jumped from a murder mystery to crime-drama to becoming a religious mystery that will likely intrigue the inner theologian in you. There are a lot of suspenseful events leading to their chases and that is all right with me. The mysterious decoding will like spark my interests which is quite amazing. The actual Da Vinci code itself looks complex and very exhilarating as we the audience are left scratching our heads and the continual clues will like keep you glued to your seats. And the piecing together seem precise and never feels confusing and the pacing is well executed. There's some good dialogue to go along and never does it wear out its welcome. The imaginative imagery is an added addition and the flashbacks to historical events makes more sense in what our heroes are unraveling. <br/><br/>Maybe by not reading the book first might not have been entirely a bad thing. Those who have read the novel were harsh about this movie mainly because they're nitpicking at every error or inaccuracy about this movie. I feel if I did read the book it might have dampened my spirit about the movie. But I was hooked on this movie partially because I didn't read the book and expected the unexpected. I have some knowledge about the historical events to get enough information about what they're deciphering. <br/><br/>Overall, I had a lot of fun with ""The Da Vinci Code"". Goldsman's script ran at a respectable pace. Another factor is the originality of the story. It's a mystery thriller based not on crime or murder but on religious symbolism even with cops and crooks. And we can't neglect the thin linings between fact and fiction. And while the emphasis is based on religious relics like the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, and asks the insightful question if the Holy Grail could be the balance that could change the world. Son in the end I'm pleased with a story that might trigger world reflection."

","Watching this film has been on my to do list for quite some time, but the long 2.5-hour length of the film kept me away until recently. Despite the length, the film was compelling and kept me interested to the end. It starts off as just a plain vanilla crime thriller, but it gets interesting near the middle when the theory regarding Leonardo Da Vinci, Jesus, and Mary Magdalene is explained. It gets even better in the latter parts of the film which have a few plot twists, even though the final revelation at the end was very predictable. It was basically what I was thinking before the halfway point of the film. So basically the film gets better as it moves along.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some critical historical info in Brown's book, some of which are also discussed in this film, are wrong. For example, Opus Dei is nothing like how it is portrayed by Brown. Although this film is thought-provoking, I would encourage anyone who watches this film to watch or read The Da Vinci Deception (2005) afterwards to prevent your mind from getting brainwashed. It's currently on Amazon Prime Video. The Da Vinci Deception basically explains in detail the things that Dan Brown got wrong and debunks the theory presented by him.<br/><br/>Some films are just pure fiction/fantasy and meant for entertainment, but one would hope that a book/film on a religious topic would present the historical background correctly.

","A murder inside the Louvre and clues in Leonardo paintings lead to the discovery of a religious mystery protected by a secret society for two thousand years -- which could shake the foundations of Christianity.<br/><br/>I read the book when it first came out, and I have to say it was not a great book. It kept me turning pages and was a quick read, but I was catching errors on almost every page. Sure, you could day it is fiction and you can't have errors in fiction. But I disagree. If you are going to weave a convincing tale, at least the foundation needs to be firm, and the book had too many problems that could have been fixed and made a stronger book.<br/><br/>This problem seems to be fixed in the movie, or at the very least it comes off as less of an issue. maybe we are more willing to go along with shaky plots in films?

","I love adventure movies and wish they would produce more. An avid adventure gamer(Curse of monkey island, Diskword, Brokensword, Mist, Atlantis, Dreamfall to name a few) I love the delight of solving puzzles, putting together clues, meeting interesting characters and unravelling a great mystery. Of course movies are not interactive in the same way a game is, so we have to believe in the adventure on the screen, the puzzles and clues have to be intelligent and this is all adds to the great mythology and sense of discovery in such movies. Movies that did it well: Indiana Jones and the lost crusades, the Goonies, National treasure are some of the better examples in this genre.<br/><br/>Da Vinci code is going to be joining my small list of great adventure films. The movie keeps you captivated from start to end with a gazillion plot twists and a perpetual sense of mystery. It is irrelevant that the setting is a biblical conspiracy theory, as one should not be looking for any reality in the saga -- it should be treated as an adventure. It also an excellent thriller, with murders, man-hunts and car cases.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is excellent as Langden a symbolist scholar and you learn some actual real history about symbols, their meanings and significances which has a semblance of authenticity.<br/><br/>Technically a well made production, but I think they could have cut down on the washed out flashbacks. There are far too many flashbacks in the movie and a few are just needless fluff. Action and cinematography are good.<br/><br/>All the religious controversy aside, this is well made and highly entertaining adventure thriller."

","I've read the book and it was the most remarkable, genuine and intelligent experience I have ever had. Despite English isn't my mother tongue, and I haven't read thousands of books to firmly assure my point of view, I can emphasize that Dan Brown's talent and noticeable dedication worth the applause. This movie adaptation, though, hasn't aroused the same feelings and motivation the book had; for me, it seemed incomplete. I think it lacks on fidelity to the original story. Of course, a movie isn't a perfect portrait of a book or vice-versa, but I honestly disagree with some changes to the original story made in the movie. Also, some actors designed to the role seemed kind of misplaced. I understand the need to shorten the story and to drop some aspects of it, but I don't agree with some additions put in the script. I had the impression of an amateur film based on a masterpiece. At last but not least, the soundtrack is superb. Hans Zimmer, as always, proved himself a master. I personally liked Tom Hanks as Robert Langdom, and I really liked the usage of French and Latin in the dialogues. The film itself can be a great experience for those who haven't known the story yet and are looking for a clever narrative, but it may be disappointing for those who read the original novel. *Please, disregard any English mistakes in this post. As I said, English isn't my mother language.*"
"t-viktor212","9","0","0","27 September 2015"," How is this NOT faithful to the book?
","That's what reviwers say around IMDb. Let me say it: I started once watching it but got interrupted, I've read half of the book and then saw it all 'till the end.<br/><br/>When I read the book, at least for the part until which I arrived at watching the film for the first time, we have a congruency of the two at 99%. Then, the part until which I arrived at reading in the book (we're talking about 6 hours of reading), so like the second 3rd of the movie, again 99%. When I've finished watching the movie I've read through the next part and found again the same level of congruency. Therefore I think many reviewers here tend to over-react at details, and to judge a movie based off a book without any exception.<br/><br/>But, in films based off movies, when you see eragon, and compare it to, let's say, lord of the rings, you realise there are both good and bad transpositions. This is a case of a good transposition to films, with the important things nailed right, and the mistakes being only some minor details.<br/><br/>One pro is the casting. While maybe for Robert Langdon they might've needed something else, yet Tom Hanks portrays enough well the character. Ian McKellen was a wonderful surprise to find too, he did maybe one of the best performances in the film, together with Paul Bettany as Silas, and Jean Reno as Fache. I feel to highlight these three between the stars that appeared in the film especially. But overall, by reading the book I can say that choices of actors seems perfect.<br/><br/>I want to understand also why people found it boring. because they knew its ending, maybe? Definitely The Da Vinci Code is a fast-paced film, and in the moments of pause it's filled with interesting explanations that keep your attention. Finally, Hans Zimmer's score as usually is very fitting for the entire movie.<br/><br/>What to me is partly a con is the repetitive shoeing of the cilice's bloody wound, a disturbing thing, that wasn't particularly shown this frequently in the book.<br/><br/>Other than this, any cons the movie could have are cons that the book could have."

","The Da Vinci Code (2006): Dir: Ron Howard / Cast: Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Paul Bettany, Jean Reno: Beautifully crafted contrivance that has enraged the Catholic Church regarding Christ's mortality, Mary Magdalene as his supposed wife, the Holy Grail, Christ's descendants, etc. Tom Hanks stars as Robert Langdon, an expert on symbols summoned to a murder scene. Audrey Tautou plays a cop who warns him of danger and aids him in his quest. Spellbinding with many plot turns make this an enjoyable thriller but its case against Christ's spirituality is questionable. Too many contrived or convenient plot turns nearly crucify even the human story. Ron Howard hooks viewers with tension and exquisite art direction and photography throughout. This does not rank amongst Howard's best films, which include A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13 but he does present mystery and suspense in the form of a guilty pleasure. Hanks is believable in his quest to dissect the code. Tautou is wonderful in the film's most mysterious performance. Ian McKellen is superb as a friend of Langdon's sought to assist with the code, and Paul Bettany plays an albino monk named Silas who tortures himself. Jean Reno plays the police captain investigating the puzzle. Christian elements or arguments are questionable otherwise the film is a beautifully painted hogwash. Score: 7 / 10"
"classicalsteve","10","0","0","6 June 2015"," The Extended Version Is a Much Better Film: A Religious and Art History Thriller
","I give the film 10 stars for the Extended Version, 8 stars for the theatrical version. When I saw the Da Vinci Code for the first time in the theater, I thought it was okay, but the whole experience seemed rushed. Much later when I bought the Da Vinci Code on Blu-Ray and saw it in the so-called Extended Version, the film was much more satisfying. The Extended Version is a superior film: more gripping, more suspenseful, and far more compelling. The Da Vinci Code the Extended Version makes better use of Ron Howard's fine directing, and the characters seem more developed. The first time around, everyone was in and out of the Louvre, and running all over Paris, not to mention everywhere else. In the Extended Version, the pacing seems more natural and the events aren't as hurried, allowing the story to ""breath"". <br/><br/>As has been pointed out by many a-reviewer, the plot is somewhat absurd. However, that's why we see films: to be taken away to another plane which may or may not work completely logically. The trick is whether or not audiences will suspend their disbelief and run with the story for two hours. The plot is essentially about the continuation of a religious ""war"" of sorts between two covert factions: The Priory of Zion, also known as the Keepers, and Opus Dei, an underground order within the Catholic Church which carries out extremist agendas, even without the knowledge of the Vatican. These factions and their 2000-year-old war have been kept hidden from the public at large. Harvard symbologist and cultural-history scholar Robert Langdon and a police researcher Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) become enmeshed in a diabolic religious plot in which the four top-ranking members of the Priory, called the Senechaux, have been assassinated. <br/><br/>The first scene involves an old man running for his life from a hooded assassin during after-hours at the Louvre Art Museum in Paris, France. The assassin, an albino named Salis (Paul Bettany) fires a fatal shot into Jacques Saunière (Jean-Pierre Marielle). Bleeding and dying, the old man drags himself to his feet with a pen in hand and engages in some kind of markings. The film then cuts to a lecture by Robert Langdon on the nature of symbols in world history. He is then confronted by the French police and asked to come to a murder scene. He was planning to meet the victim, Saunière, but the older man failed to show for their appointment. <br/><br/>He comes to the Louvre to see a horrific site: the body of Saunière splayed out like Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man with strange markings on his chest and invisible words on the floor. Unbeknownst to Langdon, the detective-officer in charge of the investigation Besu Fache (Jean Reno) believes Langdon guilty. By chance, Sophie Neveu arrives and through a secret message, informs him he is Fache's no. 1 suspect. The two flee together from the French police and become fugitives from justice. They engage in a two-day adventure in which they attempt to decipher anagrams, find artifacts and artworks, and reveal the meaning of codes all the while eluding the French police. The theme of the so-called ""sacred feminine"" recurs throughout the film, especially when the fugitives solicit the help of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen). Teabing is a self-proclaimed solitary scholar and presumably independently wealthy Englishman residing in France whose historical conclusions are rather wide of mainstream academia. At the same time, the albino-assassin is hunting for an artifact called ""the keystone"". The secret order, Opus Dei, is trying to eradicate the long-held belief in the so-called Holy Grail.<br/><br/>If you like suspense films with some historical and art references added into the mix, the Da Vinci Code is one of the best films of its type. While the author Dan Brown certainly didn't invent the genre of art-history thrillers (""The Flanders Panel"" by Arturo Pérez-Reverte was written over 10 years before ""The Da Vinci Code""), it has become the most well-known and bestselling examples in its sub-genre. Some of the plot twists and explanations are certainly absurd if you analyze them critically. However, it really is a fun film. The only scene I don't care for is one in which they trick a young man to lend Langdon a cell phone on a bus to find out more about some historical names. In the book, this scene took place in the British Library, a much more interesting and appropriate locale to look up revered figures of the past. Still, a really fun movie that does give me the shivers at the end. I don't know why, but it does."

"viitanen8","4","0","0","25 December 2014"," What a waste of good source material.
","Okay, for the record, I have read the book and I really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend it. Even thou some of the reasons this movie doesn't work is because they changed things from the book for no reason, I would like to make clear that mostly my opinion on the movie would be similar even if I had not read the book. I will nevertheless point out some things that were done better in the book. If you have a problem with that, well, boohoo. My review.<br/><br/>First off, the characters. They had no character. In the book, they are more fleshed out and three dimensional. I hear you say ""But the book is a sequel to Angels and Demons and they made a movie adaptation of that only later, so of course the characters are more familiar when you have read two books about them"". But, I have not read Angels and Demons, and I still think the character of Robert Langdon is way more believable in the book on its own. There is a great scene in the beginning of the book where Robert looks himself in the mirror and just thinks about stuff. Here we learn how he is smart and hard-working, but still has a bit of a low self-esteem. In the movie? No such scene. No any scenes where we learn about him. All we know about Robert is that he is a professor of symbols, has a fear of tight spaces and has a striking resemblance to Tom Hanks. Sophie is a bit more developed, but the performance makes it kinda worthless (I'll talk about the acting later. I know. I can almost feel your excitement). The character of Sauniere is in the books flashbacks portrayed as a loving and caring guardian with some deep secrets. In the films flashbacks, all we is him yelling at Sophia like a madman. That is NOT so Sauniere.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the cast. Cause it's amazing. Tom Hanks as Langdon? A fine choice. Aubrey Tautou as Sophia? Well chosen. Sir Ian McKellen as Teabing? Oh my god, you could not have gotten it more right. Mckellen was basically born to play this character. And he is wonderful. If I can think of anything redeemable about this movie, it's Mckellen. He plays the weird but secretive Teabing excellently, just on that border of okay and over the top were great performances are born. Sadly, Tom Hanks stays away from that border. And not even on the side that would make it entertainingly over the top. Cause he is dull. D-U-L-L. Now don't get me wrong. I LOVE Tom. He is one of the best actors working today, capable of pulling out a variety of characters, and by all means, this should be one of them. Yet it isn't. What went wrong? Well, it could be one of two things. Either Ron Howard can't direct his actors, or Tom is lazy. Now, Howard has squeezed out some great performances before, so unlikely that is the case. All we are left is Tom not taking the time to read the book to build on the character when the script offered him nothing. And that's what he is in this movie. Nothing. He just seems bored in every scene. Like he doesn't want to be there. Same goes for Toutau.<br/><br/>What about the technical aspect? Infernal. The camera apparently can't simply just sit still and film anything patiently. You how to have it be hand-held and shake in every possible scene so you can't figure out what is happening. When it rarely is on a tripod, it hast to slide and spin around like a carousel. And lets throw some super- fast editing there to. Yea, I bet that will be pleasing to the eye. <br/><br/>You might be wondering why I'm still giving it a 5/10. ""Why isn't it lower after all the things I bashed the movie about? Is McKellen THAT good?"" Well, yea, he is, but also, there were a few short pieces of dialogue which I thought added some personality to the characters (even thou very little) and I did enjoy the scene in the airplane also.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna spoil the ending, I'll just let you know that it is horrible. It goes on too long and makes irrational changes to the book that did not need to happen. The following epilogue however is a pretty nicely executed and even leaves some to the viewers interpretation.<br/><br/>I would like to end this unlawfully long review which I'm writing at 3 in the morning because I have no meaning to my life other than complaining about movies on the internet by saying that the themes of the book were not explored at all in the film. The book deals with the responsibility of knowledge and how what to do with it. In the movie? Nothing.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this movie. Even thou everybody said it sucked before I saw it, I had faith in the director and the cast. Not anymore."

","I know this movie (and book) gets a bad rap for being overly- pretentious, but darn it all, I am very entertained by this flick.<br/><br/>For those of you living under a rock, The Da Vinci Code is a treasure hunt going from the Louvre in Paris to various ports of call in France and England. The fun is trying to figure out the clues before they are revealed. Even years later, when I know the basic plot, I had forgotten the specific clues, so I had fun trying to remember them.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is watchable, as always, as Robert Langdon. It is said that you can see Hanks thinking on the screen and it is VERY helpful for this movie as that is what he does most of the time. He is ably aided by Jean Reno, Audrey Tautou and Paul Bettany. The joy to me was watching Ian McKellen hamming it up as scholar Sir Leigh Teabing. It must have been fun for McKellen to play a comic book character without having to put on spandex or a long white beard.<br/><br/>This is not Ron Howard's best job as director. The movie is overly long and takes itself just a bit too seriously. I am sure that he was under immense pressure to stay true to a very popular book, but I would have liked it if he would have just had more fun with it.<br/><br/>Despite that, I enjoyed myself - and you will too.<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)."

","A big-budget, big-name, big-screen adaptation of one of the decade's biggest literary phenomenons. Given such gravitas, it shouldn't be surprising that the whole thing frequently threatens to buckle under the weight of its own expectations. And threaten it does, in typical bloated, self-indulgent fashion, but like a Weeble it's able to sustain such wobbles intact. The intense, brainy series of puzzles and mysteries at its heart are largely to thank for that - though the figurines dancing around their outskirts are persistently fake and irritating, there's something deeply interesting about the riddles themselves that's able to power the film instead. The plot comes and goes as it pleases. Ian McKellan gets to deliver all the sizzle, in a profoundly thought-provoking monologue on the roots of Christianity, then abruptly changes his tune in one of an endless series of stupid, unnecessary swerves. In that sense, it feels like a film that thinks it needs to do more than it does. Tom Hanks, thrust into an unfamiliar role as a thriller/action lead, never feels completely at-home, and Audrey Tautou (best known from her work in Amelie) is flat and unconvincing, a major disappointment as his co-star. There's the sparkle of something powerful glimmering at the heart of The Da Vinci Code, but actually unearthing it amidst so much padding and space-filler is a task on par with one of the film's most difficult brain teasers."

","I went into this film hearing mixed reviews but not knowing much about the plot at all, although i was aware of the hatred it had received from the religious community. I loved the way it neatly tied up the ending, and everything slotted together, when watching the film i thought it was fantastically well researched, and it was nicely paced. However, the thing that really killed this film for me was how badly it was researched. It compiles so much information, and combines it with a legend to make it appear to give it credibility, of course you know its fictional but you expect the data used to back up the fiction has credibility, in fact the outrage the film caused made me more certain that was the case. However most of the facts seem incorrect when researched outside, and many non religious academic people speak out against it. Not just the obvious existence of priory of Sion etc but more of the facts that it lays on constantly throughout the film, and this ruined the film for me afterwards. That being said it was still a very nicely made film, you can go into it and enjoy it, as long as you are not a religious person who gets easily offended. Just keep in mind it is completely fictional, even if the gist of the idea is perhaps realistic. The whole investigative mystery crime it does very well, and the view of corruption it portrays is interesting, and it gives an interesting take on the things people do because of their beliefs. Thus a very good film, enjoyable, intellectual. Just don't read too much into it. If it had been well researched and this had backed up the fiction behind it, it would have vastly improved the film."

","Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a symbologist skilled at deciphering and understanding ancient symbols. He is asked to examine clues in a gruesome murder. Soon he discovers that he is a suspect by the French police Captain Fache (Jean Reno). The murder victim's granddaughter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) goes on the run with Langdon on a continental wide chase to discover clues to the mystery and evils of Opus Dei.<br/><br/>Ron Howard tries to wrestle down this convoluted maze of codes and confused motives based on the popular novel. It was a big mistake to have Tom Hanks have that ugly weird long hair. It's a weird mix of puzzles and Bourne action. The large amount of French with subtitle doesn't help the matter. It just doesn't get going well. The good part is the likable Tom Hanks. He keeps the mystery solving on track even though nobody cares after awhile."

","I recently read the book and then watched the movie. I've always felt that movies can hardly accommodate all that a book has to offer. The same was true with this movie as well, it somehow missed the grain of the book but still a great job in making it enjoyable. That being said most of the reviews I read so far from critics as well as the viewers seemed obviously enraged backlash of hurt beliefs towards the writer in particular. What happened to the human spirit to question the obvious? This book just does that and any person with a scientific rationale will obviously challenge the present premise of any religion. It is not a secret that the religious books have been altered to make believers and followers. Many will question a human prophet so why not make a God out of him? Faith has provided peace and hope in moments of despair for ages. It tends to be the only place of recluse when there is no where else to go, so an enraged reaction out of fear of loosing the last belief that holds the spirit for many may be justifiable. But does that mean we denounce someone else's freedom to follow his thoughts and question the common?"

","I should firstly state that I have not read the book so my review does not have that perspective as a point of comparison. This is a film about ideas even though most of the ideas are fake. In the context of a film that does not matter to me as films create their own fictional worlds anyway, we know that from the outset. It did stimulate me to look up things as I watched, such as Da Vinci's The Last Supper and the various religious sects, most of which turn out to be real in one sense but invented in another. The world that the film creates bears little resemblance to the real world but is definitely worth visiting. I need a little padding to get my review to the required length so here it is."
"sionyboy11","9","0","0","28 May 2013"," Such an underrated film
","I honestly think that this is an extremely underrated film which has just received bad reviews from people with certain religious beliefs as they may disagree with some of the films story line. The acting in this film is tremendous with stars such as Tom Cruise pulling off yet another great acting performance, but I think the best acting role in this film was played by Paul Bettany as 'Silas'.He portrays the role extremely well making his character seem very realistic. The story line is gripping with an abundance of twist and turns and also finishes with a variety of scenarios which could all easily end the movie with a lasting effect. But, the actual ending rounds off the film especially well and thankfully does not leave it on an annoying cliffhanger, I do think that this film should be rated a 15 age rating instead of a 12 as there are sexual scenes and scenes of violence throughout. I would rate this film a 10 but some of the story leads off to unexplained endings. Overall, in my opinion, a very good, yet very underrated movie which did indeed do justice to Dan Browns' original novel."

","Conspiracies are great fun. They are filled with intrigue, mystery and delve into the darker secrets of society. Usually the skirt upon the taboo, the untouchable subjects, the things we shouldn't talk about. It's no wonder why everyone is so interested in them. And making a mystery about the most conservative and untouchable subject of all time will definitely draw a crowd. That's just what Dan Brown did with The Da Vinci Code. Ron Howard's version, while not bad, is nothing spectacular. The music feels over the top, and I think this material would have been more appropriately handled with a grittier director (ala Fincher). But this epic historical mystery geared towards those 'familiar' with the legends of history is still fun. Unfortunately, with a number of 'oh brother' twists, it's a little harder to swallow for those more versed in history (and I can imagine people who study any art or history are livid). And while the story is always moving, very exciting, and keeping up the mystery, it more tells you mysterious facts than really lets you guess what will happen next. Still there are a lot of great concepts here, lots of treasure hunting to be had, and a great conspiracy to unravel. But despite its weaknesses, this is a fun puzzle."

","I don't know why this got such backlash, when it got released.<br/><br/>When it comes to the movie and the book, they are both hot topics for discussion in religious circles. Quite a few religious circles around the world had issues with some of the aspects of this film and book; Some believed that it was basically an insult to the Catholic faith and to Jesus Christ. What I don't get is: Why is this an insult? There really isn't anything to get all negatively hopped up about. Okay, maybe it's a little shocking to think that Jesus had a wife and a daughter, but first, let's take a look at the gospel of Philip; this gospel states that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were ""companions,"" which, according to this movie, means that they were partners. It also says that He loved Mary Magdalene more than His disciples. Now, we all draw our own conclusions here, but really, I am a Christian, and yet, I find nothing wrong with this image; I mean, He was married, and He had a kid. That's just my opinion, but you've got to fill the holes in the bible.<br/><br/>Anyways, enough ranting, more critiquing. This movie stimulated my interest as I was reading about the plot of the book. I decided to watch the movie, despite the negative reviews from the critiques. I can honestly say that this is not as bad as people are making it out to be. Yes, it could have been more, but if it had've been even 10 minutes longer, it probably would've felt too long.<br/><br/>The acting is on par, as well. Alfred Molina (Doctor Octopus from Spider-Man 2) is good as Bishop Aringarosa; Paul Bettany is quite creepy as Silas. While I couldn't make out a whole lot of what Jean Reno said (because most of his lines were in French, I believe), he did seem to be into his role, which was good. Ian McKellen is always great in everything he does. Audrey Tautou is beautiful as Sophie, who finds out a little secret about herself towards the end. And, of course, Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon: this is a role that fits him, and fits him well. Good job to all.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're going to see it, be aware of the ideas that it brings up; go in with an open mind, but make sure that you are ready to think. After I finish ""Angels and Demons,"" I think I might pick up ""The Da Vinci Code."" A 7.5 out of 10 for me."
"ajs-10","7","0","0","28 December 2011"," Not as good as the book (IMO), but still worth a look...
","Whilst visiting some friends this film came up in conversation for some reason, I can't exactly remember just why now, but needless to say, a viewing was hastily arranged. Having previously read the book I had a pretty good idea about the storyline and so settled down to enjoy Ron Howard's interpretation. I will give you my thoughts after this very brief summary.<br/><br/>A murder has been committed at the Louvre museum in Paris; an eminent professor has been killed, but he has left clues to the identity of his murderer. Robert Langdon, an expert in symbology is called in by the police but do they have an ulterior motive? The victim's granddaughter, cryptologist Sophie Neveu warns Langdon that he is in danger. They manage to fool the police into thinking they've escaped and take to opportunity to look for clues. What they find leads them to a revelation that, if made public, would blow religion wide apart! To this end, they are also pursued by an agent of the church, Silas, a cold blooded killer I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police will have me clapped in irons (again).<br/><br/>This is a very well made film that looks great on the screen; you can tell there was a good chunk of money thrown at the project. The music, by Hans Zimmer,was also great and fitted the visuals perfectly. As far as performances go, well I thought the best performance came from Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, for me he stood out. Honourable mentions must go to; Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, Jean Reno as Captain Bezu Fache, Paul Bettany as Silas and Alfred Molina as Bishop Manuel Aringarosa.<br/><br/>In scanning through other reviews, the phrase, 'not as good as the book' seems to come up quite a lot, and I must say I agree, the book is better. Having said that, I did find that, although it is very long, the time passed pretty quickly due to the fast-paced storytelling. The problem with this is that it's quite easy to miss a vital piece of the puzzle and that can be annoying. For me, it was a decent effort to put on the screen quite a complicated tale. Unfortunately if falls down because there are just a couple too many coincidences that work out. A blind alley here and there might have helped (IMO). At the end of the day, if you haven't read the book it's still an entertaining watch and one that may well spark a little debate. (It certainly did with me and my friends!) Recommended (just).<br/><br/>My Score: 6.5/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 6.4/10 (based on 147,704 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 25/100 (based on 220 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

This movie has a lot of history with flashbacks that help understand the reasons why Sophie was raised by her Grandfather and why he had taught her what he did.<br/><br/>This movie has a few scenes that were hard to comprehend as they moved fast and talked even faster. When you have to rewind a movie a couple of times to get what just happened, it doesn't seem to keep the movie flow.

"jessndash","10","0","0","10 December 2011"," The Da Vinci Code review
","Professor Langdon (played by Tom Hanks) is a symbologist who gets called to the crime scene of a museum curator. The curator, Jacques Sauniere, (played by Jean-Pierre Marielle) knows who his killer is and knows that Prof. Langdon will be able to decipher a centuries-old secret and help to keep it safe. Mr. Sauniere's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu (played by Audrey Tautou), knows that both she and Professor Langdon are in great danger and she helps him escape the museum. From there, it is a high- speed chase to unravel the mystery that many are willing to kill over. There are many ancient symbols and puzzles that Langdon must decode in order to get the answer that could change history if accessed by the wrong hands. The theme of this movie is symbols and codes. Codes and symbols are present throughout the entire film. The title, The Da Vinci Code, gives you an idea about the theme even before you watch the movie. Langdon is a symbologist who studies ancient codes and symbols for a living. He is even teaching a seminar on ancient symbols at the beginning of the movie when he is called to the crime scene. Langdon's knowledge of ancient codes is immense, which is why Mr. Sauniere trusts he will have the comprehension be able to decode the secret of the Holy Grail. The element of music was used extensively in the film. One particular scene that stands out is the scene where Silas (played by Paul Bettany), an extremist follower of the organization Opus Dei, flogs himself. He believes this allows him to feel the pain Jesus Christ felt when he was being whipped prior to being hung on the cross. The music used in this scene is loud but poignant, creating a strong emotional effect that allows the audience to almost feel the pain that this man is putting himself through. Angle was another component used often in the film. The ending scene with Langdon returning to the pyramid in the Louvre is a good example. After realizing that the Holy Grail is hidden there, he kneels in reverence. The camera angle travels up and above him, looking down on the top of the pyramid. It then proceeds to move downward toward the pyramid faster and faster, revealing the underground chamber holding the ancient secret that only a few select people in the world know about.<br/><br/>All in all, it is an enjoyable, fast-paced film that allows the viewer to unravel the mysteries right along with the characters. There are many twists and turns until finally all is revealed."
"benton06","7","0","0","9 December 2011"," The Da Vinci Code
","Da Vinci's code is definitely not as bad of a movie as it has been proclaimed by most of the book's fans. It is simply impossible to put so much information into two hours of projection despite the entire technological advance, and to be honest the movie has managed to pick up most of the important facts and scenes from the book, while keeping it in accordance with the book as much as possible. The actors, the effects and the camera on the other hand have all been professionally employed in order to create a modern day Hollywood spectacle. So, technically it easy all there to make a huge success and for some reason it did not, it may be that the story might not be interesting and has not the same effect without the detailed history parts that were obviously too extensive to fit into the movie. Or is it simply that books tend to better then movies no matter what the directors try to amaze the audience and create a better effect then the book might have. It is also very well filmed and keeps the spectator concentrated throughout most of the movie which has always been hard to achieve and even harder lately. The plot and the story have been very well adapted while some of the scenery and imagery has been very well exploited for action scenes that are breathtaking. Tom Hanks is excellent as the somewhat awkward Professor while Ian Mac Ellen is excellent as the principal foe. Something that most of the spectators knew before the movie has started even though the identity of the villain id not revealed until the end. Jean Reno seems to be just getting through his job as a cop which is not in accordance with the passion of the police commissioner, while the usually versatile Alfred Molina didn't make the performance of his career as the leader of Opus Dei., However in general terms a much better movie then it is usually considered."

","The Da Vinci Code (the book) may not be as accurate as it would like to be, but the compelling evidence and convincing writing of Dan Brown's may leave some audience wondering. The book was a ride, the movie, however, can be a little bit mocking. For those who haven't read the book, The Da Vinci Code is about a murder linking path of finding the Holy Grail. Jacques Sauniere was murdered inside the Louvre museum in France, but minutes before his death, Sauniere decided to leave some clues for his granddaughter to solve (just like the old days). The clues weren't leading to his murderer but apparently Sauniere's granddaughter (Sophie) and his colleague (Professor Langdon) were on the path of finding The Holy Grail. The path proved difficulty considering Langdon was wanted for 4 murders (which he didn't commit) and the person who Langdon thought he could trust (Sir Leigh Teabing) betrayed him. It's a great story on paper, but apparently failed to deliver on screen. The source materials is first-class, and considering Ron Howard and Tom Hanks are in this, it would be better than the book.<br/><br/>Ron Howard was fantastic at getting the angles of the camera right and making sure there was a good amount of French in the film, but his story telling and directing of the actors were a bit lazy. The sets were mesmerizing and the art direction of the place is award-winning. The Da Vinci Code is such a good looking film but it lacked so much depth and wit from its source materials that we can't help but bag on it. You may be entertain with Tom Hanks himself or the fantastic storyline that revealed some secrets about Jesus, but that is about all."

","Honestly, the movie's chances were much compromised from the beginning, since the text made by D.B. is one of the most incredible samples of trash ever printed. The content is plagiarized, the story preposterously unlikely, the structure chaotic, the storytelling awkward and amateurish, the style childish - all in all, a boring piece of editorial imposture. THIS is what matters, not the false religious controversy. The church made a ludicrous mistake by triggering all that scandal, which only enriched the product with some hefty negative publicity. Let's made it clear: THERE IS NO HERESY INVOLVED. Such a vision towards the life and heritage of Jesus could be absolutely pious and respectable, as long as it's done in a honorably professional way. The only heresy involved is the insult to serious writing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie is even worse. Slow paced, messily narrated, hilarious in all the places that should have been serious and thoughtful. Ron Howard, a director with a mediocre knowledge of the trade, proved time and again that he has no feeling of action and thrills. Further, now he stepped into history by the incredible performance of being the first director able to make Tom Hanks act poorly (fake, histrionic, shallow).<br/><br/>And as a sure sign that the Hollywood moguls lost it totally, this shameful piece of garbage is now spawning its own sequel - based on the equally moronic prequel in print: ""Angels and Demons"". Troglodytes, prepare to squander your money over one more item of non-cinema. Decent movie-goers, be smart: wait for a DVD-rip and download it from the hubs or the torrents.

"Roman-Nies","1","3","8","19 August 2008"," Of confusing boredom
","The thesis of the film is the same as in the book of Dan Brown. Jesus was married to Maria Magdalena and produced a child with her. After the crucifixion Maria fled with the child to France where she founded the dynasty of the Merovingian kings. In them the blood of Jesus lives on. Emperor Constantin has manipulated the Bible to make Jesus to God and ban the women from leadership of the church. Maria Magdalena leads on the godly line of the Egyptian Isis cult. In the film it is Leigh Teabing to explain the theory. Teabing is an anagram of the name ""Baigent"". Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh are authors of discussed Qumran and Gral-books. Their erroneous assertions were rejected by experts. But Dan Brown was inspired by them. He assembles in his book the full offer oft the actual Christian conspiracy theories: Templer knights, Maria Magdalena married to Jesus, Symbols of Da Vinci, Opus Dei, the Holy Grail. That is the fabric for millions to watch in the cinema. How is this proved to be true? With mysterious signs, alleged suppressed informations, hints on Da Vince paintings and reinterpretation of church history. Browns and the films conspiracy theory swims on top of the superficial, religious, tolerant spirit of the post modernism with an anti-Christian spearhead. Not like Brown director Howard shows Robert Langdon rather as a skeptic, not so much as a follower of the grail-theory. Before the start of the film, star Tom Hanks stated: ""If you take a film  even a hundred million dollar production  for hard cash, you make a big mistake!"" Right so! The story remains what it is. A play of irritation and a confusing labyrinth. But the film shows also what the book is, a fictive novel!"
"LeslieLLKing","8","3","8","23 May 2006"," A most intriguing fiction speculating popular belief! Bold and Excellent Investigation!
","Most movie viewers probably read the book before seeing this movie. Hence, suspense and mystery are naturally lessoned. The book reads more thrilling than watching the film. In the film, the controversy of good vs. evil is dull, flat, and formulaic. The test: would it appear less so, had one not read the book? Answer: Not really, just more confusing, as the treasure hunt for the Holy Grail, resting place to Mary Magdalene is too rapidly paced. Whether you read the book or not, the script is too mechanical and superficial, and the character's personalities are too simple, boring, and inanimate, of course with the exception of Silas (Paul Bettany). Nevertheless, even his character is somewhat superficial. We know his psyche acts out with self-inflicting pain. How does he arrive at such state? We want to know. In the book, it says that he shot and killed his father, a drunk. If we saw a Silas flashback to his tormented childhood, we might be more fully engaged in comprehending his self-infliction. We might even internalize his pain more. All of the characters are designed too distant from our sensibilities. As a result, our attention wanes more than it should. This movie is just as much work for us, as it is for the actors, therefore, I would give it seven stars, but due to such interesting historical inquiry, I give the film eight stars. It deserved ten plus. As for author Dan Brown's happiness, in no way is it to be associated with the stars that I assign the film. As an author, he knows what I am talking about. You might say, that it is the ""writer's code."" Where was the entertainment value that could have strengthened our interest not detracted from it? It was missing. This film is not a documentary but plays itself so, on the book's behalf. It had entertainment potential by bringing greater human expression, interaction, and animation to the screen, but its greatest mistake, ironically is too closely following the black and white of the book. These characters could be more lively, interesting, and emotionally layered, without sacrificing the fiction's storyline. As a reinforcement, poetic license could be more generously utilized. By evidence, it is under utilized, downgrading our mental engagement and enthusiasm, for such a potentially interesting, intellectual, and mystical ancient story of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and the Holy Grail. Such intriguing inquiry is only threatening to selfish, greedy, and unadaptable religious ""experts."" If the autobiography of Jesus was available, it would probably be the world's number one seller of all time.<br/><br/>Again, Paul Bettany plays his role under the skin of the character. Everything about him is creepy, from scars to buns of steel. For his next role, instead of ""Shallow Hal,"" he should play a fat boy, in ""Shallow Sally."" Between Paul and his infamous, Academy Award winner wife, Jennifer, have they sacrificed mainstream intelligence for redundant extremist role play, possibly settling for assignment, rather than soul searching for one? Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Alfred Molina, Ion McKellen and a host of others are o.k, but not challenged enough in the film's dry and flat adaptation. As for location cinematography, it is excellent, but lacks dimensional light and varied wardrobe by actors. It is a little too sleepy-eyed X-files, another reminder that I can't retire to the empty heaven of sweats. The film has enough shortcomings, but undeniably does not fall short of clearly laying out the book's story, clue by clue, scene by scene."
"petep","10","3","8","22 May 2006"," A thoroughly enjoyable piece of fiction
","I'm reminded in seeing this film of the Indiana Jones series, though for the moment, not the 2nd one, which I still enjoy but for different reasons. Raiders was made to resemble the classic films from Hollywood's golden era, and it succeeded in this. Last Crusade had the inspired pairing of Sean Connery and Harrison Ford as father and son, and it couldn't have worked any better. Both had great action set pieces, edge of your seat moments, and laughs. But none of this describes my favorite aspect of both films. Each is a quest for a religious artifact. This is the story from which all the films' other elements are built upon. It's a search, a mystery, one that requires a bit of globe-trotting to solve. Allies may be enemies, enemies may in truth be allies. And in both those films, the mysteries are built up (for fictional, entertaining purposes only) upon beliefs held by billions of people around the globe, for centuries. Beliefs that are one and the same with truth to many, but regardless, they build upon grand stories that we already know, or think we know.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is another such film with grand ideas affecting religious history, but built upon the stories that we have been familiar with our whole lives. In this way we don't have to pick up on a story out of nowhere. Depending on your education or personal interest, we're already starting at the knowledge base of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) or Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), and we go along for the ride as the most basic stories of religion, of the origin of faith for billions of people, is, shall I say, given a new spin. Now I don't want to stick my foot out on the train tracks here and debate whether any of the revelations here are true, or could be, but you want a story to convince you of its value, and basically this was the cinematic equivalent of a real page-turner. I was quite fascinated and intrigued. Areas of my brain were working again that hadn't been accessed since I finished that History of Ideas minor in college.<br/><br/>I thought this film hit all the right notes, perfectly. They don't dumb anything down, and at the same time nothing was overly complicated. True, there is a lot, a lot of exposition, but I was able to follow it, nothing was too repetitious, and I wasn't getting lost in a sea of theories, boring history, or truly absurd notions, as I feared I might. There are some thrills in the film, and chase scenes, but the studio never tried to sell it as a non-stop thrill ride, for it is not. There is nothing truly absurd or impossible in the script (such as revealing Judas to be Dracula). The climactic moments of the film do not involve any magic, or centuries old death traps that are beyond the comprehension of modern architects. The implications of the film's big discovery are huge, in that it could shake the foundations of Christianity, but rather than this making the actions of any cast member insignificant and trite by comparison, it rather serves quite well as motivation for several parties who all might have an interest in what Langdon and Neveu get drawn into, and would also justify the existence of a centuries old cult, whatever its ultimate goal may be.<br/><br/>And also on the subject of the filmmakers (gotta love Ron Howard in particular) doing everything right, this does not become some sort of by-default love story for the two lead characters. Oh no, one's male, one's female, they're on the run, dodging bullets, we have to have them kiss at some point! No no, none of that. These are intelligent leading characters, both seeking a truth that outweighs their own personal motivations, and told from the point of view of a gifted author, not the Hollywood machine. And there's some real talent in the cast anyway. Hanks and Tautou are international stars, as are Ian McKellen (finding his way into several blockbusters these last 6 years) and Jean Reno. McKellen gives the best performance of the film, as to be expected, as a grail historian who gets into some amusing arguments with Hanks' character, but on that note I don't want people to discredit Paul Bettany, known more for his role in Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind. There's been some criticism of his performance here as murderous monk Silas, but it's a tortured character who, like many others, believes he is serving a much higher purpose. His suffering is his own damn fault, as he feels the need to punish himself for his sins, and suffer as Jesus did, but I thought Bettany pulled it off quite well.<br/><br/>So, I have not read the book, and probably won't in all honesty. My motivation to read the Lord of the Rings books never reached significant heights. I prefer the film medium. I can see with The Da Vinci Code in what ways it was originally a book, and for those who insist on comparing the two mediums, as usually, I don't give a damn what you have to say. But I loved this story as presented to me this afternoon on a big screen, and this is the ideal sort of fun I look to have every summer when the big stars and the big name directors hook up."

","I didn't read the book, and suspected it's a shameless exploitation of Da Vinci's name in order to cash in. That it is.<br/><br/>It spins on the premise that Da Vinci had a special insight on the fact that Jesus and Maria Magdalena had offspring and that there's a bloodline running to our days. This has been matter of dispute between conspiracy theorists for quite some time. The fact is that Dan Brown exploits the controversy to create a dull and predictable, filled with laughable historic references no-brainer, not that I agree with official history(to those mildly interested in history it's not a secret that the Vatican is an organization that exerts religious power in order to control, and that Christianity is in fact a mix of religious concepts that entered Europe from the Middle East which put under just small scrutiny will reveal it's flaws). Also odd enough it doesn't mention the relation between Freemasonry and the symbolic shallowly depicted(five pointed stars, Star of David and most of all Rosslyn Chapel), but what could one expect from a mediocre fact-fiction salad eye-opener wannabe .<br/><br/>From the credibility point of view it reminded me of Hudson Hawk with Bruce Willis-about two insane billionaires on the quest for a gold machine presumable invented by Da Vinci. But that was an entertaining comedy with witty, funny dialog and most of all done in good taste. This crap disguised behind Da Vinci's name is Dan Browns greasy hand stuck into your pocket to get your money. SAVE YOUR MONEY(goes for the book, too), and if still curious catch this clock-watcher on cable in a year for a quick laugh before you switch to the news. Better yet, rent Hudson Hawk, at least you'll be entertained."

","I was so excited to see this movie, and as I have been with every other book to movie, I was so disappointed. The characters were boring and dull; completely lacking any of the characteristics that made them interesting in the book. For example, Sophie comes off as fairly useless throughout the movie. In addition, the writers changed certain aspects of the story, which in my opinion, did not enhance the story but confused the viewer. Lastly, it was boooooring, I could not wait until the end to leave. Everyone in the theater walked out upset and disappointed.<br/><br/>Save your money, read the book!!"
"TIALI","3","3","8","20 May 2006"," the dumbest story ever told
","So I asked my friends if they knew how many DNA samples it takes to discover the parents of a child and they each answered, 3. You need a mother, father and child so you can sample the DNA to see if they are related. So if this is true, why does the Da Vinci Code tell us that they can sample the DNA of a mother (Mary Magdeline) and a daughter (Sophie) to tell us if Sophie is the daughter of Jesus Christ? Who has a sample of Jesus's DNA? Now, this bothered me through much of the movie, since the whole plot relied on each secret group either protecting or trying to destroy the holy grail, meaning the daughter of Mary Magdeline and Jesus. Sure, Mary could have had a kid, lots of kids, but no one can prove who the father was. So the protection of Mary's body is pointless. Hence, the entire story is pointless. I don't understand anything that happened. I don't understand why a man who has been shot walks around a museum leaving clues at several locations then removes all his clothes before he dies; it seems like he could have made it to the hospital in that time. And why does the dying curator leave a secret message to a Harvard professor pointing to the Mona Lisa, but makes a point of including the name of the artist in the clue? Wouldn't the professor know who painted the Mona Lisa? Is the clue meant for the dumb reader/movie-goer who doesn't know who painted the Mona Lisa? This is an incredibly dumb story based on bad science/logic meant for dumb people who failed that subject in grade school."

","as someone who did not read the entire book (only the opening chapters). i still found ""The Da Vinci Code"" enjoyable to watch. i tried to keep an open mind and not get expectations up too high because of the media attention surrounding the opening. in fact that's why i believe the reception for it has been so divided, the media truly destroyed this film. if it had of been kept a secret up till its release it would have received a much brighter opening. Tautou however i must say was amazing in my opinion as Sophie. i though she approached the part well. I was though a little let down by Sir Ian, i'm a little sick of him after LOTR & XMEN. a brilliant actor but i think someone like Michael Gambon may have suited it a little better, in my opinion. ""Da Vinci"" is a good film, just keep an open mind, don't expect big things and you'll enjoy it more than you think."
"zizmondka","8","3","8","19 May 2006"," Seen it.... loved it
","I'll go out on a limb here and say that The Da Vinci Code is a great movie. Not in its genre, being classified as a ""thriller"", because let's face it, there's nothing thrilling in there if you already know the story (having read the book), but it's a great summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Anyway, as it debuted in Cannes, the reviews were horrendous  too long, too complicated, you won't understand it if you haven't read the book and so on, and so forth. And the next day, it was getting worse by the minute. Now, having seen it, I have to wonder two things  whether the critics at Cannes are so cynical they don't like any movie at all anymore, or they're failed movie makers, adamant that if they didn't succeed in the business than no one would  ""so let's thrash every movie that comes our way!""<br/><br/>I loved the movie, it wasn't at all too long, it wasn't incomprehensible, and there was nothing to laugh about at the climax, when Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) tells Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) the truth about her origins. It was a bit melodramatic, but totally plausible.<br/><br/>Now, for the movie. It was beautifully directed. Ron Howard knows what he's doing. It wasn't a supernatural movie, so what CGI there was served the story perfectly (to show Langdon's ""almost"" photographic memory or to whisk the audience back into the past as the characters discussed about history and its events). The screenplay adhered to the story line of the book as much as a screenplay can (a big round of applause for Akiva Goldsman) and if he changed the ending (between Langdon and Neveu) a little, he did good  the movie didn't need that extra zing. And don't let me touch the music. Hans Zimmer delivers each and every time, and if it had a little of the Gladiator soundtrack in it, it doesn't matter. I especially loved the last scene of the movie as Robert Langdon kneels in above the two opposing pyramids at the Louvre. I loved everything about it  the pose of the character (respectful and wondering at the same time), the lighting (it was night after all), the movements of the camera (as it travels from above, down to the pyramids and inside them, to reveal the grail), and the music only added to the enchantment and beauty of it, rising in a lovely crescendo to the revealing. Perfect!<br/><br/>Now, to the cast: Tom Hanks is still not Robert Langdon in my book (but that's just because each and every reader creates his/her own picture of the character), but I have nothing against his performance in this movie. In reality, he's probably the only actor in Hollywood that could deliver all those lines about history, symbology, and the grail, without turning ridiculous. I believed he knew what he was talking about  not that he's just learned those lines, but it seemed as if he'd read all the books on the subject. He did an amazing job. Tautou (at least for me) was a perfect Sophie Neveu. She might look fragile and doe-eyed, but you could glimpse something else beneath that sweet exterior. For such a young creature, she did an amazing job. I have to agree with the reviews about Ian McKellen. He stole each scene he was in. He was brilliant, as always. And I enjoyed the scene at the gate to his castle as he runs a little test on the worthiness of his visitors. Classic British wit! Jean Reno was cast to the perfection. His Bezu Fache is just like the detective I imagined reading the book. But then, who else can you cast as an uptight, know-it-all, stuck-up French policeman than Jean Reno. I love the guy. And I mustn't forget Paul Bettany as Silas, the albino Opus Dei hit man. His performance was brilliant. His depiction of a fanatic, lost soul was perfect, realistic to the goose bumps, and very poignant.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is a must see for everyone  The Code's geeks that know the book by heart, and all those who haven't read the book. If you decide to go to the cinema this weekend, but don't exactly know what to see, this could be a good choice. It will give you something to think and talk about."
"bonniperr","7","3","8","18 May 2006"," A Job Well Done!!
","I have read the Da Vinci code and while still a strong Catholic, found it an interesting, well written story. Despite the story's premise, it does not actually contain any mind-shattering anti-doctrinal revelations, simply because none of the stuff in the story can be proved anyway, and even if it could, this is hardly Dan Brown's fault - it would have come out eventually, I think! I can't really understand what many of my fellow Catholics are so worried about. I guess the idea of worshiping at the tomb of Mary Magdelene is blasphemous, but as the existence of this tomb is in itself debatable, let alone it's whereabouts, I think it all essentially breaks down to a storm in a teacup.<br/><br/>No, what Brown has done is written a good, maybe even great story. A rippin' good yarn, so to speak, and having seen it translated to film last night when it opened in Sydney, I wasn't disappointed. Tom Hanks played Robert Langdon exactly as I'd imagined him when I read the book, so I was impressed by his acting and Ron Howard's direction. Audrey Tautou, I felt, was a little weak as Sophie Neveau - personally I'd imagined Sophie's character as stronger, a little more forceful (although in one scene Tautou smashes the albino monk's head against the ground and man! It was nasty! Perhaps even too violent, but anyway ...). Teabing, played by Ian Mckellan was bang-on, I thought, almost exactly how I'd imagined him (although my Leigh Teabing was slightly younger) and McKellan's acting was, as usual, spectacular!<br/><br/>The scenery, most of it the real-life venues of the book, was spectacular and enchanting. After reading the Da Vinci Code and now seeing the movie, I am more determined than ever to visit the Louvre and to learn how to speak French! The paintings in the films backdrop, though we only get quick glimpses of them, add a rich and ancient dimension to the aesthetic experience.<br/><br/>As in the book, some of the codes are quite predictable, not so mind-bogglingly difficult to crack, and the movie can be slow in parts. I would perhaps have liked to see a LITTLE more character come out in Hanks (Langdon) although I think Ron Howard was very weary of making this The Da Vinci Code and not a 'Tom Hanks movie' so I understand why this didn't happen. Overall, I thought the book was adapted to film excellently. Even my husband who hasn't yet read the book and is a hard-edged critic when it comes to movies, was impressed. You feel as if Ron Howard has been faithful to Dan Brown's original, and hasn't just gone off on a tangent of his own, which often happens in a novel-to-screenplay adaption.<br/><br/>I would advise anyone, particularly those who have read the book, to see the film, but PLEASE see it at the cinema, otherwise you miss an amazing part of the experience."

","It's been awhile since I last read the book. I forgot all the details already. So watching the movie today was like watching it with fresh set of eyes (& mind).<br/><br/>Am quite impressed with the cast. I like watching the character of Paul Bettany, Silas, on the big screen. He's got this magnetic presence. Every time I see Alfred Molina, his Dr. Octopus character comes to mind though. Ian McKellen was great, as expected.<br/><br/>Ron Howard used a lot of ghostly flashbacks. There's one scene that showed Silas dipping his fingers on the holy water. I really like that shot. Also, there were a lot of funny side comments from the main characters.<br/><br/>They added a scene in the movie that would sorta balance it out. And never forget, it's just a freakin' movie. Faith shouldn't get affected by watching a FICTIONAL film. I really don't understand the uproar.<br/><br/>After the movie, 4 people from the audience (from different sections) clapped.

","Wow! Don't believe the nay-sayers on this one. I have read the book twice and find this movie not only to be faithful and respectful of the book but a tight, taut thriller in its own right. The acting is top notch and you get a real feel that it has been lovingly crafted.<br/><br/>I have often criticised movies for leaving out critical parts of the book, but this is as good as the source material, primarily because the plot is preserved and presented in a way that conveys every nuance in a very effective way.<br/><br/>The one critcism I had of the book was that the ending was sudden and a slight let down. In this movie they surround the final scene with fantastic camera work and stunning music such that it becomes a fitting end to a great movie. As a catholic in the 21st century, I'm stunned that the church can't just accept Da Vinci Code (book and film) as a piece of fiction where some humans - even catholics - can be baddies!! I'm also Australian but that does not make me the killer from Wolf Creek!"

","Given that films can rarely do full justice to the book they are based on, my wife and I found this film to be a very good movie representation of the book. The screenplay was largely faithful to the book, as far as a movie allows, particularly with regard to the relevant parts. We enjoyed it and would be happy to see it again. Tom Hanks did not entirely correspond to my idea of Robert Langdon but his performance was very convincing. Audrey Tautou was both beautiful (as usual) and also portrayed a creditable Sophie - a far cry from her character of Amelie. I wasn't entirely convinced by their looks of concern when facing probable imminent death but I've seen worse. Silas was as menacing as in the book, in both his looks and his ghastly rituals. Ian McKellen was a superb Teabing, entirely capturing the character of the book. Altogether a good 150 minutes of entertainment."
"MrBiddle","8","4","13","18 May 2006"," The Adaptation.
","First of all, kudos to the cast and crew of the Da Vinci Code adaptation. The movie is more abridged than I would have it but it is certainly more faithful than Tony Gilroy reconstructing the Jason Bourne story or Steven DeZousa ripping apart Roderick Thorpe's story of Joe Leland for the betterment of the movie we now know as ""Die Hard."" The opening scene and the last scene are exactly what the mind's eye would see if one would read the book. The last scene even performs beautiful photogrammetry or ""omnipresent"" phantom camera-work to confirm the innuendos of Dan Brown's finale to the story. What is different? Among many, are the cryptex - I can tell you now if you've read that book that Sauniere in the movie obviously was more merciful than in the film, there was that shocking discovery regarding the cryptex in the airplane that was spared in the movie, the Hieros Jerjerous or whatever it was called was only flashed and not annotated by Langdon and instead of on the airplane, this flashback happens in the end. Let me also commend Howard for creating a beautiful atmosphere of the ages of old when Teabing or Langdon recount their interpretations of history. From the Council of Nicaea, to the execution of the Templars, and even later scene with ""scepter-like"" super imposition when Langdon explains about ""A. Pope"" and Sir Isaac Newton while crossing the street. And as one viewer has already noted, Akiva Goldsman was calculating enough to make Langdon and Teabing even debate a bit just so the unorthodox Gnostic ideas aren't necessarily fortified, and as Dan Brown stated in a forum - the audiences are free to believe which of the interpretations in these matters are correct. Langdon even emphasizes the words ""MAY have... MAY have..."" at one point in opposition to Teabing's strict affirmation regarding the Grail legend. Langdon also cracks the final puzzle instead of it being accidentally unravelled as in the book, the one regarding the missing orb. The five letter word. Missing are a great many things from the book, such as Sister Sandrine per Ron Howard or Akiva Goldsman's hand failing to say the line, ""I do not see that one message in Opus Dei."" before Silas silences the nun. Omitted also is the sequence when the otherwise maniacal Aringarosa, in the book tells Silas that forgiveness is God's greatest gift, in the end when they discover about the treachery. The reveal of The Teacher is less shocking in the film than it is in the book although I love the tease of cinematic sequence when Remy speaks to the initially anonymous villain. But among those which are made concise by Ron Howard, I appreciate the ""instant library card"" in the bus a very appreciated short-cut as to eliminate a rather taxing task that Langdon and Sophie had to do in the book.... I do NOT appreciate the fact that Sophie was not the one who deciphered the mystery language in the airplane, the engravings on metal, that Langdon thought was reminiscent of Semitic writing. It was a language, or system of writing that only Sophie knew about from her grandfather... And also, I didn't mind much about the absence of an extended recount of the Fibonnaci sequence, the androgyny theory of the Mona Lisa as these things I'm afraid are gonna require the observer to read Brown's novel. The discovery in the Rosslyn church is also altered much, but as I mentioned earlier it doesn't change the very very very last scene, but the revelations are similar nonetheless. Sophie, and no one else instantly spots the ""blade and the chalice fused into one"" in the church building which is not the case in the book. Zimmer's score is above par and it accentuates the visuals and nuances that Howard and his crew have put to the screen. And for Christians whether candid or the more religious, I may have sensed an attempt of Akiva Goldsman to put in Dan Brown's conscious thoughts and even his comments on the fact that Da Vinci Code and it's maker isn't one that has the luxury of absolute correctness. Langdon expounds more on his spiritual side, and regarding his childhood mishap at the well, and this tops off his unbiased convictions and makes ground for those who might be otherwise offended by the movie's Gnostic concepts. That scene was a payoff for what was foreshadowed, a question asked by Sophie in response to a question about belief that Langdon brought up earlier in the bank vehicle. By the way, Vernet doesn't get any denouement in the end, in the book he is only referenced but Goldsman probably chose to make him one we merely pass-by. Jean Reno is as intense as he can be as the zealous Fache, and it will also be a loss to NOT see his final exchange with Aringarosa in the book..... he has no resolve with Collet either and the funny alibi Collet makes about the error of the DCPJ on TV in the novel is nowhere in the film. Nonetheless Howard and company create a piece that reflects the bestseller and can hardly be called a sacrilege in light of it's source and author. But because of some writing decisions of Akiva Goldsman that I have disagreed with, I will give this an 8 instead of a 10 out of 10. And P.S..... P.S. Mickey Mouse doesn't get an explanation or an annotation of his presence in an appliance that Langdon owns, obviously to jive with how Goldsman put lesser bias in Langdon's stand of the Grail legend, the book gave Langdon more conviction on the theories and consequently the book chronicled hidden references to the legend in Walt Disney.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

Bear this in mind when I say that I have no problem whatsoever with this book and/or movie. I view it, as absolutely everyone should, as a work of pure fiction. It is a novel, created from the thoughts of a man whom many people now hate. Many people, including the previous commentator (whom I offer my respectful apologies for this comment), have learned to despise the filmmakers and the author because they feel their faith is threatened.

In both of those instances we know it is not true, but two thousand years from now people could believe that.

"sotirislaw","1","3","9","27 May 2006"," Badly presented blasphemy
","I must say that I have read the book, before I saw the picture which I don't recommend because I was absolutely disappointed. Historically the whole story is the biggest lie ever presented and I just can't understand why some people chose to offend the name of Christ, The Son of God, and with It the foundations of all Christianity. I mean why? What wrong did Christ do to them? I really disaprove the idea of one religion assaulting the other and I find that this is the surest way of creating disorder. This is the only benefit of this movie...disorder and blasphemy. On the other hand the movie as a movie was surely not what I would expect. The whole plot seems to drag itself, the actors are not leading the film but are lead by it and from a point on the only thing you wish is for the movie to end!

"saarvardi","8","3","9","20 May 2006"," Forget the critics, watch the movie and judge for yourself!
","Coming into the film, I knew there would be many moments where the term ""suspension of disbelief"" would come into hand. Although I must admit I never got through reading the entire book (mostly because of my intense life style that leaves me with minimal free time), I knew the basic plot line, including the big secret that the Da Vinci code protects. What I didn't know was the sheer magnitude of writer Dan Brown's conspiracy theory, which crosses time and land and provokes an intriguing discussion about the authenticity of the foundations on which our religions stand. Sure, many of the ""facts"" that are claimed throughout the film are not necessarily true, but the slight possibility that it is plausible is what makes it even more entertaining and interesting to view.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know what the film is about (are there any?), Da Vinci Code tells the story of the mysterious murder of a curator in the famous Louvre museum in current day France. World acclaimed Harvard Symbolistic, Robert Langdon (two time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks), is called in by the local police to help investigate the case, using his academic skills to connect the clues left in the murder scene in order to find out why the curator was killed. From there on, starts an intense chase throughout Europe which goal is to untangle the startling truth behind the murder and unleash a secret kept for centuries. Joining Langdon is French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu (French actress Audrey Tautou from 'Amelie' fame), which helps Langdon escape evil forces who are after him, whilst struggling to uncover the religious secret that lies beneath what may well be ""the biggest cover-up in human history"".<br/><br/>I won't say anything further about the plot since I don't want to spoil the fun for any of you, but I can say this  the movie is very loyal to the novel, both in premise as in spirit, which is a rarity these days. For those of you who read the book, I can promise you will not be disappointed. However, for those who didn't, beware: some of the revelations are quite talky and less intense than your usual Hollywood fare, so I can see how many viewers may loose their patience from time to time. Alas, there are still some very suspenseful scenes throughout the flick, and if you can forgive a cinematography that is less than perfect (despite the beautiful scenery the plot has to offer, the camera work was anything but inspirational); you will thoroughly enjoy Da Vinci Code. Concentrate on the ideas the movie brings to life, on the fine acting by supporting actors Paul Bettany ('A Beautiful Mind', 'Dogville') and Sir Ian McKellen ('Lord of the Rings' trilogy, 'X-Men' trilogy), on the predictable-yet-enjoyable twists and turns the story has to offer  and believe you me, you will be having a good time.<br/><br/>Honestly, I didn't expect for anything else than the aforementioned details, so believe me when I say I'm having a hard time understanding what the critics were so upset about. For me, this is a classic example of the everlasting dissonance between viewers and critics worldwide.<br/><br/>I give Da Vinci Code a very satisfying 9 out of 10!"

I just saw the film with my wife ( who has not yet read the book ) and we both thought it was wonderful. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou work well together and their acting is flawless. But Ron Howard is the real star of the show. The film holds remarkably true to Brown's masterpiece and communicates the story extremely well. The scenes in the Louvre and around Paris are amazing. I absolutely loved it...I think you will too !"

","The Da Vinci Code is directed by Ron Howard and adapted to screenplay by Akiva Goldsman from the novel of the same name written by Dan Brown. It stars Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Paul Bettany, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and Jürgen Prochnow. Music is scored by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Salvatore Totino.<br/><br/>When a man is murdered inside the Louvre, his body is found to be surrounded by cryptic messages. The police call in American symbology expert Robert Langdon (Hanks) to decode the clues. When he is joined by Parisian cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Tautou), it quickly becomes apparent that nothing is as it first seems and a mystery begins to unravel that could shake Christianity to its very core.<br/><br/>Extended Cut (Blu-ray) Version Viewed.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book! And I love treasure hunt/clue chasing movies! So I came to Ron Howard's hugely successful film (over $600 million in worldwide profit) bereft of literary pressure and with only a modicum of genre expectation. Perhaps this is why I'm apparently only in a small percentage of film lovers who really enjoyed the film? In spite of those gargantuan financial figures.<br/><br/>Ultimately it's very safe film making, with a director and cast guaranteeing professionalism, but it weaves a magical mystery tour full of cryptic clues, secret organisations and cover ups. Yes, there is a good deal of corn thrown in as well, which inevitably stops the adaptation from being hyper intelligent. There's also an understanding on my part as to why many feel it's just too talky, but was the film ever going to be unfurled as an action movie blockbuster for the popcorn munching crowd, like National Treasure et al?<br/><br/>It is a clever conspiracy thriller full of twists and turns with a outlandish revelation at the finale. It's also very appropriately performed by the cast (serio brooding and fret), and when McKellen joins the fray after an hour of film it has a little class as well, while Zimmer's score is a majestic blending of choir, strings and synths. I maintain that the film didn't deserve the critical whacking it got, but again I say I had a blank canvas going in for my first viewing. <br/><br/>I wasn't sold to it because of controversy or had a saliva tinged mouth having worshipped at the altar of Dan Brown, I expected exactly what I got. A flawed but ever so intriguing adult mystery thriller, and not even Hanks' hair stopped me having a great time with the movie. 7/10"
"VerdantGreen","5","2","5","8 September 2009"," Not as good as it should have been
","I'm sure everyone remembers the controversy that this film caused during it's release. By the hype this film was receiving, everyone was sure that they were going to experience something big. Truth is though, this film is nothing more than a flat, mundane piece of cinema. The problem is the lack of any real mystery in the film. You don't really get involved with the film or the characters and by the time the climax of the film comes along, I didn't really care.<br/><br/>Unlike the film National Treasure, which had similar flaws. This film takes itself too seriously and could have at least tried to be fun. I'd recommend reading the Dan Brown book, which is a good adventure novel. But the less said about this film, the better. It is watchable at best."

","The film gets dafter and dafter as it grinds on. The revelation that the French female protagonist is really a descendant of The Virgin Mary beggars belief. Tom Hanks tries unsuccessfully to look as if he has been pole-axed by the discovery but all he manages is a wistful, half-fruity look as if wrestling between falling at her feet or going straight for the beaver. <br/><br/>Now this is the point, if any, to wheel on a few extras - preferably children of tender age and shepherds (the Church's stock witnesses of miracles and revelations). Instead, a small tweedy bunch of elderly French men and women crinkle their brows and shoot puzzled looks as they behold the scene from about fifty yards away. The viewer might be forgiven for thinking these old crocks are Alzheimer patients lost on an outing to the country but - believe it or not - they are none other than the guardians of the secret. Their chances against the likes of the strapping young albino monk-cum-serial assassin in the film are slender to say the least. The ""surrogate Mary"" might do well to take a leaf out of the Pope's book - a bullet-proof limo and a small army of Swiss mercenaries to keep violent death at bay. The bad news is that the cast are likely to live long enough to spawn a sequel."

","I'm feeling generous - Christian, if you like - so I've given it 5 stars.<br/><br/>Though quite where I'm awarding them is unclear even to me. This has to be one of the ditchiest-dull movies of all time. It's like a Tolkein epic but without the special effects, the battles and the monsters.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, his face stricken and artificially-aged by a permanent frown, escorts some sort of femme-fatale through all of the gloomiest set-pieces ever dreamt-up by Hollywood. A curious albino bloke with a penchant for self-flagellation - who might well have escaped from a Tolkein set - pops-up from time to time to commit sundry acts of murder. Various other characters come and go. Jurgen Prochnow trades his U-boat for a truck, Ian McKellern lends a bit more middle-earth de-ja-vu, and Jean Reno attempts to obscure the other actors with his nose.<br/><br/>This is the ultimate religious conspiracy theorists movie. A deep, dark secret is being held by a furtive organisation. It's the biblical equivalent of 'Hanger 13'. What is this secret? Does anyone stay awake long enough to find out? Someone with more resilience than myself told me that - apparently - this femme-fatale is a direct descendant of Christ. Like; the crucified one had a bit on the side with Mary Magdalen. Is that it? Is that the great big bete-noir of history? Gosh; stop the press.<br/><br/>After 2000 years of generations, lets say - about 100; how much of Christ's genetic constitution is she likely to speak for now? Somebody knows a lot more about 'mystery' than they do about genetics.<br/><br/>This is slow, dark, and oh-so-talky. Despite the fact that the lead characters seem to run everywhere. It's a religious storm-in a tea-cup, much ado about nothing, clerical codswallop. Neither does it help that I'm no particular fan of Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Conspiracy theorists and religious freaks will no-doubt nod sagely at its gloomy foreboding passage. Whereas those of us who live in the rational world can see it for the pretentious tripe that it is.<br/><br/>For some, it's as if The Enlightenment never happened."
"sddavis63","6","2","5","27 October 2008"," Decent Movie, But Not Worthy Of The Controversy It Spawned
","Give credit to Dan Brown (author of the novel on which this movie is based) on a number of counts. First, he did good research into the non-canonical gospels (especially, since they were referenced in the film, to those of Philip and Mary Magdalene). Second, he showed his skill as a novelist by weaving a creative tale around the question of why they're non-canonical, combining the presence of secret societies (Opus Dei and the Knights Templar) along with a hardly unique interpretation of Da Vinci's painting ""The Last Supper"" to produce a novel which obviously caught the public's attention. Then, he showed his skills as a businessman by selling the novel to Hollywood, which ended up putting out this mildly suspenseful, largely well acted and mostly entertaining action/suspense/conspiracy theory movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon (a professor of Religious Symbology - of which there is no such beast!) and Audrey Tautou as Sophie are both quite good and worth watching. The story revolves around the search for the Holy Grail (but Monty Python this ain't!). In this case, the Holy Grail is Mary Magdalene's tomb, and the conspiracy revolves around the efforts of the Roman Catholic Church to suppress the truth about Jesus being merely human rather than divine - a figure who, according to the movie, was married to Mary Magdalene and had children with her. Thus, there is also the question of who Jesus' descendants in today's world are. It stirred too much controversy in my view. It certainly has an anti-Catholic tone to it, I admit. The Catholic Church is dismissed as oppressive and misogynistic, involved in murder to keep its secret (and therefore its power). Still, the extreme reaction of the Catholic Church (and some fundamentalist Protestant sects) probably gave more credibility to the movie than it deserved. As a Protestant pastor, I found nothing here that would shake my faith, and the movie never quite goes to the extreme of saying that the story was true. As Langdon says, ""what's really important is what you believe."" In other words, whatever your faith is - it's a matter of faith! (And remember - this movie is based on a novel, not a history text book. It's a piece of entertainment!)<br/><br/>Personally I thought the movie a bit too long. The ending, revolving around Langdon actually finding Magdalene's tomb, wasn't really necessary (except, I suppose, to be faithful to the novel) and the revelation of Sophie's identity was anti-climactic. I figured it would turn out that way. (Another nod to Brown's obvious acquaintance with the state of contemporary religion is his choice of the name ""Sophie"" for the female protagonist - an obvious nod to the ""sophia"" movement in modern feminist Christianity.) It's also yet another example of the ""religion is the cause of all the evil in the world"" mentality that is so yawningly cliché in today's society. Overall it's pretty good, although not really deserving of the controversy it spawned, which probably lent it more credence than it should have had. (The secular world would say ""if the church is so against it, it must be true."") I'd give it a 6/10"

Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were perfectly cast as Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu. Jean Reno was good at being what he always is. A cop. Ian McKellen was probably the best as Sir Leigh Teabing and Paul Bettany did a decent job as Silas as well as Alfred Molina who played Bishop Aringarosa. The score was superb and dare i say should have got an Oscar nomination perhaps even should have won! Ron Howard's directing and the camera work are exceptional. I was surprised to find this got second most disappointing adaption from a book to a movie. (first being golden compass) This is unfair. Everything in the book was in the movie except for a few minor details. Nothing huge. I thing everyone did very well and i do not understand what was wrong with the script. It worked fine. It was not outstanding but it was definitely not something to criticize. Do not let anyone else stop you from seeing this movie. :)"
"groovylicious_dude","3","2","5","21 May 2007"," Limp literary adaptation
","Book-to-screen adaptations have proved themselves as tricky creatures. Peter Jackson set a new standard with his Lord of the Rings trilogy, but his success remains one of very few. The Da Vinci Code therefore presents itself as a prime example of literature limping lethargically onto the big screen.<br/><br/>Most frustrating is that the concept is a genuinely intriguing one. Blending a re-interpretation of biblical legend with mad monks, murder and a virtual beehive of conspiracies, Da Vinci sets itself up as a mature, contemplative project with Big Ideas. Howard's moody photography establishes a suitably ominous tone, including some inventive CGI that merges landscape from medieval times with that of the present, but Goldman's clunky script seems responsible for most of the damage.<br/><br/>Following its source material with an uninspired paint-by-numbers precision, Brown's book is treated with a religious reverence that would no doubt do Ian McKellen's character proud. As a viewing experience, however, it proves dull and vacant, failing to stir the emotional response that one would expect from such controversial subject matter. Adding insult to injury, the most interesting aspect of the premise  that of deciphering clues within works of art  is horribly skewed, never allowing the audience to participate in and decipher the mysteries alongside the characters.<br/><br/>In the end, Da Vinci is over-long and over-confident, talking itself to death. In a film about faith and its emotional bearing on the world, it is a sad irony that The Da Vinci Code leaves its audience cold and unmoved."

","I loved this movie. And there is one reason why I am more often than not satisfied with a movie that was turned from a book into a movie. The answer is.....I don't read books. I'm a movie lover, not a book lover. So when I watch a movie that was a book first, and hear everyone saying ""It wasn't as good as the book."" (as they always do) I am the only one not disappointed. Morons who read a book, and expect the movie to be as good, are going to ALWAYS be disappointed. It is rare that a movie is ever as good as the book. I will say though, that if this movie didn't have the exact ending that it did, than I probably wouldn't have liked it as much. I would have still liked it, but just not as much. That ending scene is one of my biggest goosebumps experiences i have ever had during a movie. Sorry if that sounds gay. :-) I think Ron Howard did a great job with turning such a HUGELY popular book, into a movie. The expectations were so big, so i understand how some were let down. Anytime you have such huge expectations for a movie, it's never as good as you want it to be. Just some advice to those who have read the book, but haven't seen the movie yet.....Treat it like a movie, not a book."

I liked his character in the movie. But I was disappointed he turned out to be a shady character. The clues, the graphic scenes, and the action in the movie made it very interesting to watch. The main thing of that movie is the puzzle. That piece of the puzzle was the real deal to that movie. I don't have any objection to the movie or the book. I just want to see things for myself.

"codefool","1","2","5","2 January 2007"," Even as a movie, its bad
","I watched this movie out of curiosity and through Netflix, just so I would spend as little money on it as possible. Although I completely detest the subject matter, it did so-so at the box office and with the talent involved (Howard/Hanks) I decided to watch it anyway, viewing it strictly as a movie to see how Howard/Hanks handled the material.<br/><br/>Simply put, this movie does not work. It plays more like a school play, with deadpan acting and so much information being flayed at you that there's no time do develop the characters. The only emotion in the film comes in the very last scenes, when Hanks actually put some meaning in his words.<br/><br/>Also blaring were huge plot holes that distract the viewer from what's going on. As these have been so belabored in other reviews, I shan't enumerate them here - suffice to say that it would appear to me that this was not a labor of love, as are so many of Howard's movies, but more of a cash vehicle off the source material. It does not have the polish and fineness that Howard puts on his other work, and Hanks' phoned-in performance is a pure waste of talent.<br/><br/>If Howard had been given the time and incentive to do more with the material, we actually could have had something special here. As it is, look for it in the Wal-Mart discount bin very soon."
"wrlang","10","2","5","17 November 2006"," good show
","The DaVinci Code is another wonderful Howard movie with a superb cast and excellent screenplay. The chemistry between the actors makes the film a true epic of emotional platitudes. Everything about the film is technically of classic magnitude. The film is about the idea that there is a bloodline of Christ through Mary Magdalene as Jesus wife who has been protected by a secret order of the Templar's and attacked by the patriarchal traditional church through the Opus Dei sect of self mutilators. If you can get past the not so obvious heresy in the whole idea, it is an interesting movie filled with proof of concept and very likely a good amount of embellishment. Still, there is nothing wrong with calling this film a must see. I understand the Christian fundamentalists gave Dan Brown death threats just like the Muslims and Rushdie."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","2","5","20 October 2006"," Certainly not as bad as everyone makes you believe it is but also too long and it tries to tell way too much to consider this a great movie.
","Perhaps the most anticipated and talked about movie of 2006, by both positive and bashing negative parties (mostly from religious persons). Controversy had always surrounded this movie and the book it was based on. It's such a shame that some people just can't separate fact from fiction and just take the movie for what it is; good intelligent entertainment. Judging by its style and directing this movie was clearly not made to shock or offend but to purely entertain.<br/><br/>And for the unbiased open minded person this is surely an entertaining movie to watch. It was not as slow or boring is I had heard and expected. The movie is definitely fast paced and features lots of thrilling moments.<br/><br/>The movie its story had definitely enough potential to make this one of the best movies of 2006 but yet it isn't. The story tries to tell too much and often goes to deep into certain aspects which certainly doesn't help to make this movie the most pleasant or easiest one to watch. The story also takes lot for granted and goes to deep with its theories which isn't always good for the realism of the movie. It overall also makes the movie too long which makes it hard to keep interest for its entire duration.<br/><br/>The movie has a good style and quick pace, with some good editing and moody camera-work and a great perfectly suiting Hans Zimmer soundtrack. The directing is also good when for most part but yet you can tell that thriller/mystery just isn't Ron Howard's genre. The movie doesn't always flow well enough. My advice to him would be to just stick to drama's and comedies, were his true talent lies. Guess Howard really wasn't the right guy for this job.<br/><br/>Lots of fine actors are also wasted in the movie. The movie lies its emphasis on the story and therefor too often forgets about its character that become at times a secondary element in the movie. The movie does really lack a solid main character. It's not that Tom Hanks is of course an horrible actor and it's not like he's miscast in the movie, like most people say he is, his character just isn't always likable or understandable enough. Ian McKellen's role is too limited, as he is introduced too late into the movie. So is Jürgen Prochnow in a very small role and Alfred Molina, who's character had way more potential than was eventually used.<br/><br/>Yet the movie remains a perfectly watchable one that is also more entertaining than you'll perhaps would expect. The movie features more than enough interesting and mysterious elements to keep you interest in the story until the end. The story features lots of imaginative and fascinating elements, the book by Dan Brown on which this movie is based is not a world wide success for no reason. Too bad that in the end the movie does not live up to the book it's success or brilliance and it doesn't quite meet expectations.<br/><br/>It's some good intelligent entertainment but it's just not one of those movies people will still talk about in 10 years from now, I would reckon.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"archmagibob","9","2","5","27 May 2006"," Movie beautifully captures book in tone and story
","Great movie, lots of action, gorgeous sets in some very interesting locales. Thought provoking, tender. Yeah, it's a bit talky but that's called ""dialogue"". (It used to be in movies before ""Terminator"").<br/><br/>Concepts were presented in a way which made them very understandable. I disagree with folks who claim Mr. Hanks was wooden(apologies to Toy Story). I thought he developed his character to a high degree and played him truthfully throughout. The character Langdon is a Harvard professor folks...and Hanks is a great actor in an important role. <br/><br/>To the critics who say there is no chemistry between Sophie and Langdon in the film?...um this isn't a love story. If anything, he is her protector and she is the metaphorical ""wisdom"". Think of him almost like a modern Galahad, the knight who seeks then protects the grail. Galahad was chaste/pure thus deserving to find the grail in Arthurian legend. Having a love affair between them would have weakened the story, even though ironically the story is ""about"" a love affair. I thought there was plenty of chemistry between the two leads albeit nonsexual.<br/><br/>The direction was another feather in Ron Howards cap. He took a very cerebral and controversial novel and made it very watchable while remaining true to the novel. One of the best adaptations I can think of. I have often felt Dan Brown has mastered the elusive art of edutainment, where he presents information wrapped around an interesting story line so, as you enjoy the twists and turns of a mystery yarn, you don't notice that you're learning something. Howard understands this and does a great job as well. Opening to 225 Million dollars worldwide??? 77 Million dollars US??? Not too shabby!!<br/><br/>Great Photography!!! Great locations even if there were some stand-ins. I thought the flashback historical scenes were illuminating and beautifully realized, not cheesy as some critics have posited.<br/><br/>My thinking is the people who are trashing the film are doing so out of allegiance to a particular religious dogma. And that's fine, they have their opinion. (I guess the idea of a ""divinity"" having sex and a child while in human form would upset the rank and file especially since the taboo against sex ironically seems to have been a staple of the religion.(Thankfully every generation has caved or their'd be no one left to view the film.) To be fair, Mr. Howard presents opposing thematic views, having Langdon frequently debate Teabing albeit without much fervor, but the film is not meant to be a spirited fair debate, it is an adaptation of a novel after all, thus the final question of the film needs be... does it do justice to the book? I believe it does with exceptional grace, sensitivity, emotion and understanding. The problems I had with the movie were the problems I had with the book. The ending drags on a little long but the final scene is such a beautiful moment it is well worth that indulgence. Teabing's motivations are still the real mystery to me but Brown likes to seed his bad-guys as the ones you'd least expect, for the surprise factor I assume. To the critics who judge the movie not on it's merits but on it's subject, remember it is the villain who makes most of the ""heretical"" claims/points.<br/><br/>I don't think the film will alter anyone's faith or start a new religion as perhaps the book may, but I don't think asking questions and seeking answers, even if they are as elusive as the grail itself, should ever be shamed out of the seeker of truth, the reader of fiction or the summer popcorn-eating blockbuster movie patron. Thumbs up, way up!!!!"

Most reviews made the film seem awful, and shouldn't be watched.<br/><br/>However, after watching the film, i can safely say the critics got it wrong. Granted it's no phenomenon the book was, but Ron Howard delivers a thoughtful film that stays faithful to the book. Sure some people will laugh at the climax when Tom Hanks says 'I have to get to a library fast!', but the film is overall very successful. One major factor in the films success is the performance by Paul Bettany as Silas. He delivers an awesome performance.<br/><br/>So don't believe what the critics say, the Da Vinci Code is a winner."

Although this movie was universally scorned I still went and was really quite disgusted by the inaccurate picture that they painted. Ron Howard, with all of his skill and experience in this industry just does not make bad movies anymore (if he ever did). I feel that the critic's reactions were directed toward 1) the hype and 2) the controversial religious subject matter. They simply were not able to remain impartial and judge this movie based on its true merits. Its actually quite good, having an excellent story (one of the best adaptations of a book in recent memory) and great performances from the cast. Early comments such as the reaction at Cannes where people were laughing at serious scenes have me baffled. I saw this movie in a packed theater and certainly no one laughed, except when it was intended. I don't have any idea what scene this could have even been? I certainly doubt that the film was re-edited one week before release."

","Yep I spelt it right, this is a stinker. It's a shame because, although I haven't read the book, I like Tom Hanks, Sir Ian Mckellen and being a red blooded male I love Audrey Tautou. The main problem with this film is it is so flat. Tom plays well it seems he's playing himself its how I imagine he would be when not acting. Ian is way over camp, more so than usual and Audrey is just bad accented eye candy. I don't think it's anyone's fault, it probably works as a book, but with no set pieces or major dramatic elements it just ends up being pompous, drawn out and ultimately boring. The story if you don't know it is basically about a series of codes hidden in various things that tell the whereabouts of the holy grail which is said to be not a big gold cup but a direct descendant of Christ thus making him mortal and not the son of god and so throwing out any form of religion that anyone knows. Pretty big stuff if true, enter people who want that truth exposed and those that don't, murder, mystery and anagrams come thick and fast or should I say thin and slow? Along the way we meet mad monks, corrupt cops and dodgy bank managers (hold on I'm making it sound interesting here!) when all is said and done 40 million people brought the book, and just like the first few ropey Harry potters, it has a guaranteed audience. I think the saddest thing is that audiences don't seem bothered anymore about the quality, this film was the second biggest opening weekend after Star Wars: Revenge of the sh*t, so its weird that a film that has had below average reviews can still pack out cinemas and break records. Whether it was the draw of the story, the stars or the controversy surrounding its blasphemous suggestions (get over it guys it's a work of fiction) something is pulling in the people and I for one can't work out what it is. This film is a perfect example of a great idea executed badly by people who should know better. Unless you're a massive fan I'd give it a miss."
"steve-borley","2","2","5","25 May 2006"," Forget the controversy, this is a cinematic clunker
","The 'Da Vinci Code' is not a very good film. Ignoring the debate about the relative merits of Dan Brown's plot on an historical basis and taking it simply as a plot, it's a potboiler, but a pretty good one. But adding Ron Howard and Tom Hanks to the mix is like putting lead boots on Justin Gatlin - it just drains it of all it's energy and removes any power it had to excite.<br/><br/>This reviewer has always found Hanks particularly off-putting as a leading man - 'Philadelphia' being his nadir - and this film does nothing to redeem him in my eyes. His appalling mullet at least made me chuckle, though his continual odd lip contortions seemed to display an inner doubt as to what, exactly, his character felt or believed. Thanks for that must, I'm sure, go to Ron Howard.<br/><br/>Poor Audrey Tautou. A wonderful actress here handed some of the worst dialogue since 'Star Wars'. For her straight face alone she deserves an Oscar nomination. Compare and contrast her here and in the marvellous (no, not that one) 'He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not', which is a minor masterpiece and allows her to show some real talent, unlike this pudding of a film.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany does his best with possibly one of the least promising characters ever to hit our screens: an albino Hit Monk. He is a good actor and does his best. Sir Ian McKellern does another jolly turn as Sir Leigh Teabing. He has a glint in his eyes throughout that shows he decided to play it as 'Carry On Holy Grail' and he clearly had a wonderful time chewing on the scenery. He was marvellous and the only one of this ensemble to unshackle themselves from the po-faced reverence Howard seemed to expect for this clunker of a screenplay. Even the normally excellent Alfred Molina succumbed.<br/><br/>*** Mini-spoiler ** So: implausible, unbelievable and unintentionally hilarious - I mean, did you see the state of some of the acrylic jumpers on the bunch of Priory of Sion at the end? I'm sure Sophie felt very protected when they appeared - and that is without recourse to a debate about the validity of Brown's plot as an historical argument. A clunker from start to finish that, joyously, reaches that tipping point that takes it from merely bad to so bad it is almost an instant cult classic. The Razzies must be in the bag already.<br/><br/>A shame for Tautou, Bettany, Molina and McKellern who deserve better. Par for the course for Hanks and Howard. 2/10 - for the unintentionally funny bits and for the luminous beauty of Ms Tautou."

","The above summary was overheard in the theater as I was exiting THE DA VINCI CODE. I feel sympathy for those who have not read the book as there is a lot to digest from the dialogue. I felt totally engaged with this film from beginning to end...and I read the book. I needed a greater sense of urgency from Tom Hank's performance. <br/><br/>I have appreciated Tom Hank's acting skills in many of his previous roles. This great cast, especially McKellen, Reno, Tautou and Bettany (in that order) ended up upstaging Hank's in most of the scenes. Still this did not ruin the film for me...just a slight distraction.

The chemistry between Hanks and Sophie was fine, I did not feel that they did not flow together as some people have commented. Silas and Teibing characters were great.The movie did have a lot of dialogue as many have reviewed as a boring part of the movie, but it needed it to explain a lot of details.Ron Howard did a fine job, it couldn't have been done any better.

The DaVinci code is hands down one of the best films of the year and despite its 150 mins runtime, there is not a dull moment in the entire movie and keeps you guessing until the very end.<br/><br/>I have not read the book, so had nothing to compare it to, but as a stand alone movie it does very well entertaining the audience and would definitely make a top 10 list of mine for the genre no questions asked.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, Tom Hanks is excellent and fits the role well as Robert Langdon. I can not think of anyone else that could capture this role as he has. Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, and Paul Bettany all are excellent in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Of note about the movie are the breathtaking locals and Hans Zimmer's background score which truly captures the essence of The DaVinci Code.<br/><br/>Walking out of the movie I was truly disappointed by the critics that bashed this movie as there was not much to bash about it.

"mookiejava","7","2","5","23 May 2006"," A fun flick--I don't get the critical drubbing
","Yes, I read the book. And I enjoyed the film as much if not more. The movie dispenses with lots of unnecessary rambling and gets right to the action. Some have questioned why Langdon has become more of a skeptic of Teabing's theories, but it truly helps to balance out Dan Brown's story where everyone agrees on the same radical beliefs. It's not as much of a turn-off-your-brain action movie as National Treasure, but it's more satisfying. The art direction is superb and I had no problems with the acting. My only real problems came from the pedestrian dialogue. I know they were trying to stay true to a dumbly written book, but they could have spiced it up a bit and avoided a lot of the cheesiness.<br/><br/>If more critics were concerned with objectively looking at movies rather than selling a pithy blurb, this movie would be getting better ratings."

"pswitzertatum","8","2","5","22 May 2006"," A good run after a good read
","I think this film version of Dan Brown's NOVEL was better than I had been hearing about but not as good as I expected after all the hoopla around it. It's still a wild ride and provocative story with some interesting film-making techniques, and some not so great editing. In some ways it is better than the book, such as at specific parts portrayed at the ending, but so much explanatory stuff is left out, I really think one has to read the book first to ""get"" much of what happens in the film. While not any masterpiece, the novel was a good read, so that's not a waste of time. However, if one wants the real meat of the controversy, I think reading Holy Blood, Holy Grail and The Templar Revelation, or The Holy Place, are some of the best places to start. By the end of the film I was enchanted with Audrey Tatou, who for the most part was wasted in what is supposed to be a pivotal role. I love Tom Hanks, but thought he looked uncomfortable much of the time in his role. Ian McKellen is flat-out brilliant as Teabing. I found the film for the most part, like the novel, sort of ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail Lite,"" but still an inspiration for continued spiritual seeking and searching and strengthening of belief in God, not one iota of blasphemy toward God of any sort. Then again, it still makes me question the power and validity of institutional church propaganda no matter what. The film is worth seeing, but certainly not worth boycotting."

","Never seen such a strong unjustified media campaign against a movie. We went to see this film yesterday despite the fact that every single review said the movie was dull, lacked spark, was poorly made, etc, etc. To our surprise, Tom Hank's hair wasn't distracting, and we were pleaseantly entertained and amused by the whole thing. The British actors steal the show, no doubt, and we have seen Tom hanks do better. But the movie delivered the goods solidly. The only weak link in the movie is the otherwise amazing Audrey Tautou. We have seen the french actress devour the screen in Amelie, Dirty Pretty Things and a few others. She is an accomplished actress, no doubt. In this movie, she was acting in some scenes, in others, i think the director told her she wasn't going to be in the scene and she was flat,amateurish and dull.

Sure I had picked my ideal cast for this movie and when the cast was actually announced, I had my misgivings. But none of that mattered when I actually saw the movie because the acting was so good it made me forget about whom I wanted to see in the movie instead. I also loved how Mr. Howard handled the various historical explanations. Instead of just resorting to dialogue, Mr. Howard showed us what happened by transporting us back to Rome and Constantinople and the witch trials and the Templar knights, etc. So kudos Mr. Howard and company for making such an excellent screen adaptation!"
"Crap_Connoisseur","Null","2","5","22 May 2006"," Overwhelmingly Stupid
","I'm not sure why I even went to see this movie; I hated Dan Brown's book and find Tom Hanks about as appealing as dental surgery. More to the point, I'm not religious and couldn't care less if Jesus got hitched or not. I just figured that my expectations were already so low that I might enjoy the film. After all, despite its general idiocy, I still managed to finish that damn book.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is not a poorly made film. I think the actors (with one exception) are fine and the adaptation is faithful to the novel. The problem is more that the concept of solving riddles is not cinematic, thus making the large, gaping holes in the plot so much more apparent. The film's slow pacing and unimaginative use of locations just makes things worse. I managed to take the film seriously until Robert and Sophie left France. After that the stupidity of it all became too much to bear.<br/><br/>Some critics have singled Tom Hanks out as the bad apple in the cast. Personally, I found him far less annoying than usual. His performance is relatively restrained and his general cluelessness seems appropriate for the dumbest hero in movie history. Audrey Tautou is endearing as Sophie. Audrey is too good an actress for trash like this. I just hope she was paid a lot of money because this will probably kill her international career, at least for the next few years. The supporting cast is composed of several great character actors. Ian McKellen, Hollywood's current favourite ""hire-a-thespian"", is enthusiastic as Leigh, while Alfred Molina continues to carve a niche for himself as a bad guy specialist. Jean Reno, not surprisingly, shines as Fache. However, he also made ""Empire Of The Wolves"" watchable, so the man is obviously capable of anything. I was also pleased to see Juergen Prochnow score a role in another big budget film. <br/><br/>The exception to the generally impressive performances belongs to Paul Bettany. It doesn't help that his character is a walking sight gag but there was no need to camp it up even further with crazy eyes and demented stares. The scenes of him running around London are unintentionally hilarious, with the Michael Jackson make-up and bad contact lenses, he looks more like a crazed fan on their way to a Star Wars convention than an Opus Dei monk.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is not a total waste of time. For example, I congratulate the joker in the make-up department who gave Tom Hanks Pat Benatar's hairstyle. However, Tom's amusing mullet is not enough to sustain 120 minutes of this crap. Fans of the book may enjoy the film but I think that even they will be put off by the plodding action and cheap flashbacks. It saddens me to think that religious groups have taken this tripe seriously enough to bother protesting it. They really should have more important things to do."
"bigtron","8","2","5","22 May 2006"," Better than expected after having read the book
","I have reservations on how they are going to squeeze all that information into a movie without making Tom Hanks sound like a walking encyclopedia (many of the information presented in the book are through memory flashbacks of Robert Langdon). The beginning of the movie is very shaky and confusing to those that have not read the book. The introduction of Opus Dei, The Priory of Sion, The Louve, Robert's char and especially Sophie's char are all under done. Sophie's char was really underdeveloped and as a result i think they left out the romantic portion between her and Robert (if not it would look like it is forced). Her history and flashbacks are too vague which is sad because i felt that it was one of the more important aspect of the book.<br/><br/>But the movie really picks up when they got to Teabing's mansion. From there onwards, it was a good blend of adventure, mystery and a bit of a ""history"" lesson. The music also really contribute to the excitement. The movie really does the book justice from that point onwards.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks does a credible Robert Langdon and Audrey is quite good, but the show is stolen by Ian McKellen. The key of the book (and this movie) is to make people think the ""history"" is real, and Sir Ian McKellen delivers.<br/><br/>I am a bit disappointed by the ending (not the part when Robert found the grail, that was good!!!) but the part where they traveled to that place (forgot the name) following the last clue. It was changed from the book and they made it worst. Also a bit disappointed about the romance being left out.<br/><br/>All and all, a relatively well done adaption of a very difficult act to follow, considering that they really have nothing to show for on =the movie format except a great conspiracy story (unlike LOTR with the scenery, CGI monsters, action etc)"

What I will say is that it starts off with a murder in this museum by this weird guy (who worships Jesus and hurts himself in the name of him!) Tom Hanks (a lecturer in Theology or something religion related) becomes involved presumably because the people unravelling the mystery thought he would come in useful.. the story unfolds from there really with the different people trying to work out the code etc, quite funny in places, also quite graphic scenes (especially with the man who hurts himself, so bare that in mind for under 12's) but a thoroughly motivating storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seats so to speak!

","The Da Vinci Code (2006): Starring Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Paul Bettany, Jean Pierre Marielle, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina, Jurgen Prochnow, Jean-Yves Bertelot, Etienne Chicot, Marie Francoise Audolet....Director Ron Howard, Based On The Best Selling Novel By Dan Brown.<br/><br/>""Too many deaths and wars have been caused in the name of the One True God"" - Sir Leigh Teibing (Ian Mckellen)<br/><br/>""I believe in people, and that sometimes they can be good"" - Sophie (Audrey Tatou).......<br/><br/>The premiere weekend is over and dozens of Americans have seen the controversial film, based on the Dan Brown best-seller. With all the hype surrounding it, and the recent protests, book-burning and angry Opus Dei members, Christians and Catholics, this film will enjoy a great summer at the box office. Bottom line: this is a sensational work of speculative fiction, offers a theory, and doesn't take itself seriously. Neither should you. Keep an open mind but if you're a person of faith, don't let a simple little adventure story rock the foundations of what you believe. The film is an odd choice for director Ron Howard and for actor Tom Hanks, but the end result is it is a satisfying adaptation with lots of suspense, mystery and adventure. Shot on location at the Louvre and other sites of Paris, as well as Temple Church and Rosslyn chapel in England, the movie follows the perilous journey of Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and the daughter of the murdered Frenchman, Jacques Sauniere (Jean Pierre Marielle) Sophie Nouveau (Audrey Tatou). Sauniere groomed the orphaned Sophie to unravel codes and puzzles she didn't quite understand as a child. Now as an adult woman, she embarks on a quest to decipher clues in Leonardo Da Vinci paintings and architectural landmarks to get to the bottom of an age-old secret that some are willing to kill for. A small group from within Opus Dei (wrongfully portrayed) that includes Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina) and the young monk he has taken under his wing, an Albino named Silas (Paul Bettany). Silas was disowned by his family who thought him to be repulsive and was taken from a life of crime in the street by the Bishop who recruits him to do his dirty work, namely kill any member of the secret Priory of Sion whose mission is to protect what they believe are the descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, who contrary to the Church-imposed image of her as a whore, was in fact, the ""Holy Bride"". Paul Bettany steals the show as a brutal agent for this Catholic sect and gets into the character's damaged psyche quite well. Tom Hanks is doing a good performance but not his best work and doubtless he could have done better and is in the end, miscast. Audrey Tatou is terrific as a girl caught up in a larger-than-life mission and who steps up to the challenge, ultimately discovering her own hidden identity in the process. She plays the part as a strong female, even stronger than Tom Hanks' Langdon, but if she disappoints in something, it's in the absence of emotion and transformation. She is the last descendant of Jesus and she doesn't believe it nor take it too seriously nor react with any depth of emotion. Her acting is slightly on the bland side, but so is Hanks'. Veteran British actor Ian McKellen (who also worked on X-Men Last Stand at the same time) as the knowledgeable Sir Leigh Teibing does better. He's very humorous, intelligent and nuanced. He has the single greatest line in the whole movie, ""So many deaths have been caused in the name of the One True God"". And isn't that the truth! Religion and war, Bible and weapons, when will it end ? There are some plot holes here and there due to the fact the film doesn't convey every aspect of the novel and does feel rushed when parts of it could have been slower, especially such pivotal moments as when Langdon and Sophie first learn about the Jesus/Mary theory from Tiebing in his estate. The paintings could have also featured more prominently in the film as the Louvre scene in the beginning is too brief. In the end, this is just a Gnostic fantasy thriller and you can choose to believe in it or not as it is all conjecture. True for most part to the novel, it is an exciting, edge-of-your-seat ride through Europe, past and present, and makes one want to learn about such mysteries as the Templar Knights, the Priory of Sion and visit the exotic locations. The music by Hans Zimmer is dramatic and oddly beautiful. This is a well-made movie and I highly recommend everyone, irregardless of their beliefs, to treat yourself to an adventure such as this one. Dan Brown's book has achieved a level of immortality now that it has been made into a stunning Hollywood film. It is the number one film in America right now. DVD's will sell like crazy in a few months and is sure to be recognized for at least one or two Oscars come next February or March. There is a lot to admire in the direction, art direction, cinematography, music, screenplay and other aspects, even if the acting is not Oscar worthy. The film has struck chords and nerves with Americans and will not soon be forgotten. It takes its place with other religious controversial films like ""Ken Russel's The Devils "" ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" Last Temptation of Christ"" and the recent Mel Gibson film The Passion Of The Christ."

","Whether its entertainment only, or a thriller with historical depth and substance, Ron Howard explodes the limits with this 21st Century masterpiece. There is no gratuitous anything, only a tight story line of fictional outcomes to factual scholarship by academic and religious experts. Based on solid historical and theological research up to the minute, this is a story beginning long before Christianity's origin. Yet it draws us into the mainstream of today's Church. Did not read the book, but ""The DaVinci Code"" opens us to new insights for human spirituality. Like ""Gone With the Wind"", in 10,20, or 50 years, this will still be a classic, both for content, acting and story."

","My whole world has been flipped upside down....Mission Impossible 3 was better than the Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>The movie seems to suffer from the same shortcomings as the book itself. The basic story is an interesting one; not the religious controversy, but rather the elaborate treasure hunt the characters take to unravel the titular secret, and the twists and turns they encounter along the way. One of the problems with the book is Dan Brown's mediocre prose, and the movie seems to be plagued by more of the same. Much of the dialogue is unmemorable or ridiculous, and some of the details that made the book intriguing and the characters likable have been altered or removed.<br/><br/>The film alternates between short bursts of unsatisfying action and ponderous scenes of exposition, second-guessing the audience's ability to grasp the more ""challenging"" concepts by stating them repeatedly. The film itself is over-long, yet still manages to leave out some of the book's more interesting scenes.<br/><br/>The movie's only saving grace, IMHO, is the cast. Tom Hanks is a suitable Langdon, as far as I am concerned. The character is not a difficult one to translate to the screen, being fairly flat. The always radiant Audrey Tatou brings a wounded grace to her French cryptologist; Paul Bettany (one of my personal favorites) makes the albino Silas a sympathetic character, even lacking the scant scenes of narration from his point of view the novel offers. It is Ian McKellan who deserves the most credit for his role, giving the film a much needed dose of humor with his sparkling portrayal of Sir Leigh Teabing, the physically crippled but quick witted historian who helps Langdon and Neveu in their modern-day Grail Quest.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say that fans of the book should see the film, if only to take in the disappointment for themselves."

","Greetings again from the darkness. It does seem as if everyone has read Dan Brown's book and of course, rarely does a movie based on a quality novel ever measure up. Although there are exceptions, Ron Howard's version of ""The DaVinci Code"" is not one of them. For fans of the book, there are wonderful moments of awe and recognition. However, there are more moments of mediocrity, even near boredom. In other words, the visual presentation offers nothing new, save for some wonderful shots inside and out of historic buildings and churches.<br/><br/>The casting of Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou seemed perfect, but the execution is lackluster at best. Neither brings any energy to their part and the lines are spoken as if dress rehearsal is the NEXT step. Hanks in particular appears lackadaisical and really doesn't fit the Harvard professor role. Ian McKellen brings a much needed lift to the movie when his Teabing finally appears. Jean Reno is solid as Fache and Alfred Molina is fine as the Bishop. As in the novel, Silas (played well by Paul Bettany) is by far the most interesting character. The guy is definitely committed to his cause.<br/><br/>Despite the beautiful scenery and historic shots, it is with regret that I report the film just doesn't do justice to a colorful and exciting novel. Yes, the book is an easy read and it seemed to move much faster than the movie. It will be interesting to see how those who have not read the book react to the presentation and if they are able to follow along. So many details are skipped and Howard evidently assumes the viewer will know what has already happened and why the story has jumped ahead.<br/><br/>Howard's last outing, ""Cinderella Man"" was sadly ignored by movie-goers, but I fear this one will be crucified. Let's hope his next outing, a remake of ""East of Eden"" will be his breakout."
"rakyle","4","2","5","20 May 2006"," Book Was Better....
","This movie was not nearly as good as the book. I disagree with the theological basis of the book, but enjoyed reading it nonetheless. This movie, however, was one of the most painful things I've ever sat through at a theater, with the exception of last year's calamity Napoleon Dynamite.<br/><br/>The actors, while a stellar group of individuals, did not portray the characters from the book well at all, with the exception of Bezu Fache, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), and Silas (Paul Bettany). The audience is never given a chance to empathize with the characters, leaving one with the vague idea that these people should mean something to one, but simply don't.<br/><br/>The movie deviates from the book in several ways, none of which I am going to discuss here so that I don't have to enable the ""spoiler warning"" thingie.<br/><br/>Aside from the above, if you have a couple of hours to waste, $10 to blow, and are ready to be mind-numbingly bored, feel free to watch this movie."
"bluenose_581","3","2","5","20 May 2006"," I Tried So Hard to Like This Movie
","While Paul Bettany's portrayal as Silas was the best of the film, my mother and I agreed that Jean Reno was the only reason we didn't walk out of the theater. We've been madly in love with him since ""Leon."" Tom Hanks was about as warm and convincing as a Popsicle stick, Audrey Tatou seemed to be in a separate scene even when standing next to him, and Ian McKellan was hard for me to see as Teabing. Most disappointing were Howard's seemingly unnecessary deviations and story changes. I can understand a few tweaks to make it more ""popcorn friendly"" but complete rewriting of Sophie's family history made the story seem unnatural and heavy as a lead balloon.<br/><br/>Countless people in the theater glanced at their cell phones to check the time because the movie seemed to drag, and when they weren't doing that they were snickering at the unbelievably wooden and absurd dialogue.<br/><br/>Will I buy it on DVD? Yes, but only when I come across what I am sure will be countless used and marked down copies."

","I never read the book and personally, I could of cared less about the religious implication(s) the movie and book purported; Rather I went to go see a movie about solving a 2,000 year old mystery. The movie did not disappoint.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was great as Robert Langdon and Audrey Tautou was beautifully cast in the role of Sophie. She did her role, which is alternatively conflicted, intelligent, and compassionate very well. If you enjoy sherlock Holmes type of movies, then you will enjoy the Da Vinci Code. Some things are rather apparent early in the movie, but I think that it is more to do from the formula that this genre of story typically follows than a problem in the film.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Ian Mckellen you will enjoy his scenes. He was wonderful in this movie!Very funny! Paul Bettany was good too. Although he seems to enjoy showing his backside in his movies quite a bit."
"rockerpenguin","6","2","5","20 May 2006"," Not as bad as some people are saying...but not fantastic either.
","I was wary of seeing this movie after all the bad press it received after Cannes, but honestly, it was not a bad way to spend an afternoon. The cinematography is nice, the music is cool, and the acting is solid, with the exception of Hanks and Tautou (more on that later). In particular, Paul Bettany and the inimitable Ian McKellen were enjoyable to watch. The only problem for me was that Hanks seemed awkward in the role of Robert Langdon. Not because he is Hanks, but because of delivery and persona problems that weren't quite filled out. I realize that Langdon is not supposed to be debonair and dashing, but even the less socially adept part of Langdon does not come across cleanly. Tautou is better, but the performance lacks solidarity and is plagued with the same odd dialogue problems and awkward moments as is Hanks (the dialogue problems obviously not being their fault). Their moments alone in the don't quite flow as they should. As a whole, the movie flows better, but still doesn't feel completely solid, maybe because they were still editing it two weeks ago (or so I've heard). That said, I would prefer to give this movie a 6.5 instead of a 7. As compared to the book, the book was better for me, but might not have been had I seen the movie first and known as I was reading how the book was going to end. The film is pretty darn faithful, with the addition of only a couple of small cinematic touches. Final note: It's worth the gas and ticket price if you're looking for a way to pass 2.5 hours on a slow day."
"d.tolfree","9","2","5","20 May 2006"," A thrilling fast moving film true to the book
","I went to see this film after reading the book and intend to write an objective comment based on the film, uninfluenced by other comments, reviews and the publicity hype that has surrounded it. This is the first film that I have ever seen that did not significantly change or distort the storyline in the book. Dan Brown must be pleased with the way it was adapted into a film - not an easy task. Maybe the religious implications it raised made it necessary not to leave out contentious issues. Whatever the reasons it was well produced, directed and acted. I thought that the best performances were from Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Paul Bettany while Tom Hanks, although cast in the main role, was in this film, out-casted by the others. He is an undoubted brilliant actor but this was, in my view, not an ideal role for him. This film is adapted from a work of fiction and must be seen as such but it does give food for thought about the many ways religious history can be interpreted. Before the age of enlightenment when people believed what they were told as they had no way of knowing or separating truth from myth, the Christian Church in common with other religions often sought to deceive to retain power. A point made in the film. Myth, mysteries, stories that are handed down through the generations provide fertile ground for writers who wish to seek out the real truth or just stimulate the imagination through fiction. Now people can investigate almost everything themselves so writers who want to succeed has to do their research carefully, unlike the the scribes of ancient times who could write anything they wished if it brought them fame or fortune. Dan Brown clearly did his research and using his imagination able to write a plausible story which is probably why the film writers did not need to make any significant changes. The content may be against what was written in the bible which underpins the Christian faith but whatever belief one has there is no way to conclusively prove that Jesus did not in his early life as a man marry a woman and have children. It does not really matter whether this is fact or fiction since it does not alter the message in the gospels that led to the birth of the Christian Church. Surely Christianity is strong enough not to be worried by a work of fiction. Therefore it is difficult to see why the Catholic Church was so angered by the film. It knows like all Churches it has both good and bad people within it. The closing scenes of the film summed it up when the character Robert Langton said to Sophie that the only thing that really mattered was what she really believed. Surely this is the point for everyone. If such a story or film can change a person's fundamental belief then the foundation of that belief is on very soft ground. <br/><br/>I saw the film today at a cinema that was nearly full even at an afternoon showing. There were many very young people in the audience and I expected some noise and the usual jeering but all through the performance there was an uncanny silence. May be it was because the film was fast moving, had a well defined storyline and the characters were very real. It worked for this audience anyway. I did have the advantage of knowing the story and have been to some of the locations in Paris so it added to my enjoyment. It may be little more difficult for people who have not done so to follow the codes and symbols so basic to the story. I therefore recommend reading before seeing. My final comment is that unlike so many Hollywood films that rely on computer generated effects, stunts and artificial sets, this film used real locations, real people and a thrilling and interesting story. People who do not go to see it for any reason, will miss a rewarding experience."
"Scoval71","5","2","5","20 May 2006"," Flat and Very Lackluster at Best
","The book was a mess and jumble of confusion, average in written content and rather lackluster---at least that is my opinion when I finished reading the book. As for the movie, well, I found the movie marginally better. My problem was with the casting of the actors. Tom Hanks is not the best actor or the best choice for this role. Sorry, but he was wooden and unbelievable---this was not a part he should have been cast in. The actress playing Sophie was only slightly better. I must say, the plot in the movie was a bit easier to follow than the book. It is more of an action thriller to me. It's a long, somewhat tiring movie, and it certainly did not hold me in suspense, but I repeat: the casting of the actors in the lead parts was terribly wrong. I wanted to see it to compare it to the book, to clarify things I found somewhat confusing in the book. I was, however, not impressed--not at all."
"pastorray1951b","4","2","5","20 May 2006"," Disappointed in North Daktoa
","What a disappointment. The book was great, the film a sleeper. Hanks seemed to be really bored. I know Langdon is an academic but not all academics are boring. The general reaction of the audience was the same as mine. The Code is worth seeing but I will not buy the DVD when it comes out in a few weeks. This movie will be a flash in the pan for the first week or so then disappear from the rankings. To bad, Howard could have done better. As much as I disliked the movie Howard was very faithful to the book. The music was a bit load, could have been the theater. The movie came across very dark, almost difficult to see at times."
"jennieprior","5","2","5","20 May 2006"," lacklustre performance
","After reading the book, I was among many anticipating the release of 'The Da Vinci Code' in the cinema. Unfortunately, the final outcome, after all of the excitement and hubbub leading up to its release, was very disappointing. The negative points outweighed the positive. Firstly the film lacked the speed in which the book so expertly included, and by the end of the film you are left wishing it to end. The chemistry between Audrey Tatou and Tom Hanks is so unrealistic it is laughable. The character of Silas, played by Paul Bettany, was one of the only reasons which saved my eyes from closing. Bettany was the only one who looked like he truly understood his role. Overall a lacklustre, boring film.<br/><br/>Dan Brown must be very annoyed..."
"chriscmen","6","2","5","20 May 2006"," Good acting, good special effect, bad movie?
","The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is one of the best novels I have ever read and I suggest to anyone thinking about seeing the movie to read the book first. This will be a lot more enjoyable for you.<br/><br/>Now, the movie changes a lot of things from the book. Some are required due to time issues (it is hard for one to cram 450 pages into 2 hours), but others I thought were just plain useless. This story is so rich it is a pity the movie changed so much from the original.<br/><br/>The acting is good although Hanks does not seems like the Robert from the book to me and neither does the girl who played Sophie, but that is expected. I felt like the first scene with the teacher was going great in the movie and then in the very next scene they reveal too much. Why?! That scene alone ruined the movie for me.<br/><br/>I wanted to see this movie because the book was so well done and such a good story (let's remember it is just a fictional story, okay people?). I was, however, very disappointed at the outcome. I felt like I would have done better watching Mission Impossible 3 again. I know those of you who want to see it will see the movie nonetheless but I am sure most of you will be disappointed at the outcome and for this I am sorry. It is what happened to me. I give this movie a 6 out of 10 just because of the good acting and special effects (they were great) but the screen play failed me. I do not recommend it especially for those who expect it to be great because of the book."
"limebalthazar","6","2","5","20 May 2006"," So-so.
","Tom Hanks disappointed me thoroughly. I'd expect something more than the uninspiring performance he gave from Tom freaking Hanks. He just wasn't appropriate for the role at all. He came across as too awkward, and spoke from the side of his mouth from time to time, which was pretty distracting. Robert Langdon is supposed to be aging, but suave all the same-- which Tom Hanks just did not pull off. Definitely not Hanks' best work.<br/><br/>However, the movie was pretty easily understandable for those who didn't read the book, and included a couple of extra little things so that the movie wasn't just a clone of the book. However, it was dumbed down significantly. If you're seeking an intellectual thrill ride, look elsewhere."

The film lasted for around 3 hours and I couldn't bear to get out for fresh air. The new century theatre,where I saw The Davici Code, shut down their air condition( or they never set the air conditions right). And the content of the film, which I have to say something about, is fabulous at the beginning but become worse and worse from the middle to the awesome ending. A happy ending I have to say, but so many Jesus-gossip were put into the film . Maybe it sounds thrilling and interesting to those foreign movie fans and Christians, but for me , as a Chinese, can't really follow the meaning of the protagonist's analysis and the history of Christianity.<br/><br/>For one word, the film is worthy of seeing as well as the same-name original work wrote by Dan Brown.

","Like a mixture of The World of Beakman and Scooby Doo, with a History Channel documentary thrown in for good measure. Audrey Tatou, Tom Hanks and Sir Ian McKellen are completely wasted. Jean Reno plays his usual role of the though guy law (of God) enforcer, and Paul Bettany keeps fighting against a pair of cheap contact lenses. The characters pursue planted clues as if they were on a crazy car rally in what may be the longest night in the history of movies -since it begins in a conference hall and ends (in what feels like ages later) somewhere in the French countryside discussing theological issues. In one of the final sequences you see a group of men entering a medieval church... and once inside, some of them turn into women! Nice locations, though - that accounts for the 2 stars vote. To be watched on a rainy Wednesday when a good book is not available."
"valkelis","5","2","5","20 May 2006"," Yawn!
","Two Xmases ago my friends bought me a book that was the buzz of the month. The DaVinci Code. I rushed through it, spent all of my free time reading eager to see the mystery unravel. I was overwhelmed how fast paced written it was, how clever the riddles, how utterly smart and charming Robert Langdon was, how accurate the descriptions, how well conceived the plot. In a few words, a stunning piece of fiction. Yesterday, finally the movie opened. I yawned through the whole show, trying to figure out what went wrong. Still am, still can't. But it was wrong. Boring. Compared to the book, this was nothing. As much as I respect Tom Hanks, this was not the part for him (Dennis Quaid should have played Robert). Also, Ian McKellen as a mischievous-stop-at-nothing seeker of the truth didn't quite settle with me. On the other hand, Paul Bettany as the albino assassin monk was brilliant. Seeing him made it worth to sit through the movie. Of course, the locations were amazing, next time I'm in London I'm sure to go and visit Isaac Newton's tomb. It was great to attach a picture to Brown's detailed, although sometimes incorrect descriptions. Maybe if I hadn't read the book. Maybe that's it. In the end, it wouldn't be fair of me not to say that my friends loved the movie. (None of them read the story.)"
"joshnault76","4","2","5","20 May 2006"," Great story, disappointing movie
","I am a big fan of the book, but the movie was terribly disappointing. The dialogue between the characters was pretty poor and that really ruined the entire movie. Tom Hanks put in a sub-par performance as well, and he did not quite fit the character of Robert Langdon that well. The casting was also pretty poorly done, helping out with the bad acting. Another problem with the movie is that is was made to seem more conservative. Because of this, a bulk of the back story was changed from the book and really was disadvantageous to the credibility of the story, be it true or false. Overall I thought that this was a can't miss movie, but somehow they missed."
"tccandler","7","2","5","20 May 2006"," In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti...
","Admittedly, I am a film person... If there is a choice between reading a book and watching a film, I'd typically pick the film. After reading the acclaimed best-seller by Dan Brown for a day or two, I heard that Ron Howard was shooting the screen adaptation. So, about a third of the way through the book, I stopped reading and waited.<br/><br/>Now that I have seen this very entertaining film, I am curious to go back and read the entire novel. I am sure that some parts had to have been left out. And frankly, I am curious to compare the two.<br/><br/>This film was quite easily the most anticipated film of 2006... Ahead of any comic book adaptation or summer sequel / remake. I don't believe the validity, but I heard a rumor that this novel was the most sold work of fiction since... well... the Bible. No doubt it was an enormous phenomenon... For about two years it seemed that, every time I boarded a flight, every other passenger had a copy tucked in their carry-on luggage. The film will assuredly be a big success too, making a boat-load at the box office and then exploding into DVD collections.<br/><br/>The reason for all the popularity? Quite simply, the story is a fantastically entertaining and riveting one that works on many levels. It can be read as a detective story, a crime thriller, a religious exposé, a conspiracy theory, a puzzle... The complexity and depth are endlessly fascinating.<br/><br/>The film is shot by the wonderful Ron Howard, whose résumé is fast becoming one of the most impressive in recent Hollywood history. He is as sure-handed and reliable a director as there is... You can count on him to deliver a fine film almost every time out.<br/><br/>The cast is equally impressive. Hanks has been called the Cary Grant of this generation... And he resembles a wrongly accused Hitchcockian character in this film. He is the rock to this film's insanely hyperactive story. He is our focal point and he manages the part superbly.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou is one of my ten favorite actresses. I am grateful for every moment she spends on screen. She handles the English-speaking role with aplomb and is quite capable of carrying the film along with her co-star.<br/><br/>There are also a handful of quality roles turned in by Jean Reno, Ian McKellan, Alfred Molina & Paul Bettany. No one lets the film down with a weak performance.<br/><br/>The story is so familiar to almost everyone... and I will not ruin it for anyone who wants a virgin movie-going experience. The film begins with a murder inside the hallowed halls of the Louvre. What is left behind is a handful of cryptic clues that will lead to the greatest cover-up in human history and the true source of God's power on earth.<br/><br/>Now, of course, the story is controversial in the sense that it deals with religious belief and vast conspiracies. However, anyone that gives this story weight or credibility, by denouncing it or forbidding people to see it, is utterly naive. They'll only add more interest to the members of the public who are waivering. The same thing happened to Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"". After all, controversy puts asses in seats.<br/><br/>Movies are movies... they are not laws or doctrine or factual documents. People should not fear films like these.<br/><br/>The book, and thus the film, is complete fiction and does not claim to be anything other than that. It is merely a great suppositional piece of entertainment... and on that level it works spectacularly well.<br/><br/>You will find it virtually impossible to be bored during the 150-minute running length... something most 90-minute films cannot boast. This film is engrossing up until the chilling final sequence.<br/><br/>If there is any quibble, it is with the pacing. I felt a little rushed while watching all these earth-shattering events unfold. This prevented me from being fully immersed in the story from time to time. It was so hurried in parts that I became aware that I was watching a movie... And that is a big no-no in a film like this.<br/><br/>However, ""The Da Vinci Code"" works very well and it is easy to see why this story became such a world-wide hit. It is not the type of film to win Oscars and Globes... but it will captivate an audience who appreciates great storytelling, eerie moods, exciting action sequences, whodunit puzzles & surprise endings. This is the cinematic equivalent of a page-turner! -- TC Candler IndependentCritics.com"
"windandfury","2","2","5","20 May 2006"," Biggest flop in human history, more like...
","After all this hype, after all the trailers and campaigns, we all were expecting something fantastic, spectacular, dazzling. Unfortunately, this was definitely not the case. The Da Vinci Code as a film was a sorry interpretation of the book. None of the same suspense, the action and the twists we had come to expect from Dan Brown's creation. Granted, the film was almost stiflingly true to the book, but none of its moderate genius was brought to life in any way on screen. Despite some decent attempts to save the picture by Sir Ian Mckellen and Paul Bettany, it was just another Tom Hanks movie through and through-boring, lifeless, in a word - dull. As a fan of the Da Vinci Code, and one who waited for the day to come of the movie release, if you are anything less than disappointed I would be shocked. Crude attempts to enhance the plot and a lame excuse for an ending simply went from bad to worse. Awful."
"gippel","6","2","5","20 May 2006"," Interesting concept, poorly executed.
","There is no denying the hype of ""The Da Vinci Code"". I recently read the novel prior to the theatrical release of the movie. And in my opinion, I found the book interesting because of the many theories and facts it presented, not the fictional story that surrounds it. The movie on the other hand, seems to favor the fictional story. I have to say that I am a bit disappointed of Ron Howard. It would seem that after his recent masterpieces that this would be a safe bet. You know, like an epic adaption, code breaking in the sense of John Nash in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Sadly, Howard moves through the material with hasty pace, and without much tension. In general, I guess you could say that the movie is quite faithful to the book. Some things are changed though, but nothing major. However, the movie seems to be taking a much safer and milder tone to its accusations. Visually, the movie looks OK. I had hope a for a little bit more from the cinematography, but it was OK. The same can be said from Hans Zimmers score, it does its job, but nothing memorable.<br/><br/>To conclude, in my opinion the movie seems to lay its wight on other elements then what I found interesting in the book. Its source material was interesting, the movie on the other hand, passes as a decent thriller. Just barley though."
"lindseytheboy-1","5","2","5","20 May 2006"," Could have been better, Could have been worse
","The movie did a decent job at following Dan Brown's original story line and managed to touch on all the key plot points. I feel the casting was great. I think what the film lacked was proper direction. Tom Hanks character seemed a little dry. When reading the novel I got the impression that Robert Langdon was very excited to be a part of history, solving the worlds greatest mystery and who wouldn't be? However, in the film version Tom Hanks didn't manage to pull of much excitement. The overall emotion of the novel got lost in translation to film somewhere and thats why I blame Ron Howard. I think it was just a clean cut case of poor direction. The movie seemed to drag. Unlike the page turning story telling of Dan Brown.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is not a character driven story by any means. Its based on actual historical facts but spun into a fantastical story line. The perfect ingredients for a summer block buster. With that being said the fact that 'The Da Vinci Code' is basically a story comprised of multiple history lessons it would be expected that the original story would be ""hollywooded"" to death. Fortunatly, the comic relief came in small doses and the pace of the movie seemed to make them far and few. However, when the did try to spring a joke it was a terrible terrible punchline.<br/><br/>Before I start going in circles let me just say this. If you were a fan of the novel the movie will let you down a little bit. I enjoyed the film just not as much as the book. Like I said before it was clearly just bad directing. Too many ""washed out"" fade to white flashbacks for character development and history. I think at least 9 or 10 of those were used. I would not blame Tom Hanks or Audrey Tatou for the disappointment this movie will bring to the fans of the novel. I would place it all on the guy that gave the go ahead for Ron Howard to direct this. I clearly feel he controlled the mood of this movie 100% and he managed to ruin the pace of the story, and eliminate virtually any kind of emotion for the audience.<br/><br/>**shakes fist and boo's Ron Howard***"

","Watch a dull 2 and half hour film or read a dull 700 page book, I have had the misfortune of both. The film is little more that a page by page visual interpretation of the book with only very minor changes. Each dull scene only takes place to take you to the next dull scene and the next part of Dan Browns little puzzle. At one point there is a minor car chase but it has no excitement and only serves the above purpose of bringing our characters to a location where they can spout more pseudo-history. The acting is functional to say the least, but the actors don't really have much decent dialogue apart from explaining the above mentioned pseudo-history. There is no character development and by the end of the film you really don't care about the characters or what they are doing. Of course Ron Howard didn't have much to work with in the way of characters, the lead role is essentially a poor mans Indiana Jones. This films only saving grace is its visual quality, most of the scenes and descriptions from the book are well realised and some good effects are used to convey the characters thoughts rather than poor ""internal dialogue"".<br/><br/>5/10"
"Jordan669","6","2","5","20 May 2006"," Ahhh yes the moment we've been waiting for...
","Well the world will have their eyes peeled on the reaction this movie brings. Why? People are taking it more serious than it should be and they forget that it is an amazing work of fiction and show's no limits in the imagination that Dan Brown explores. It think Ron Howard forgot the fiction element and took the movie much more serious than it really is. It shows in the wooden acting by both Hanks and Tautou. Don't get my wrong i've seen most of Tautous movies and this seems to be the least job I could appreciate with ""God is great"" a close second. I kept asking myself why Hanks couldn't show any emotion, it looked like he practically gave up on acting and just wanted to get it over with. I hope this will be his last horrible performance because of course he is a great versatile actor.<br/><br/>When I first read the book, it read like a formulaic Hollywood screenplay with amateur dialogue but yet it kept me peeled and wanting to continue reading more. Sadfully the movie kept leaving me hanging and I was constantly waiting for the constant smooth connections the book had. Again I was disappointed with the dialogue which was all too simplistic and I had false hopes that Akiva Goldsman would try to vamp it up a little and clean up the rough edges left by Brown. The Goldsman/Howard duo keep praying (bad choice of words) for a successful movie and they have financially but they somehow ruin something that has talent and they make it too simplistic for todays audience which is increasingly getting smarter. If Goldsman keeps clunking out work as ""Batman and Robin"" ""Lost in Space"" and ""Practical Magic"" then of course you won't be able to excel in making something with substance as ""Da Vinci Code"" does have, and why not it's a great idea and is controversial which is another dimension inherent in film. Maybe he should stay with his buddy Joel Schumacher and continue hitting them out of the park.<br/><br/>Howard took the epic idea too seriously and we see that in his film-making. At one point where Langon and Sofie are getting chased by the police in the smart car, the orchestral music takes control of the scene and while I waited for the sound of tires screeching which would have increased the intensity I was left out of the mood. Maybe Jene Reno should have used his knowledge from ""Ronin"" but then he would probably get fired by the producers. There were other scene which felt too forced and slowed the movie down. One being Where Tautou and Hanks go to a shady park to think about what to do next and Tautou gives the heroin junkie some money to buy food. The scene was just another in a series that bogged down the feel of the film.<br/><br/>There were a few upsides. I did feel the cinematography was very well done and I congratulate Salvatore Totino on creating a very darkly lit and mysterious mood to the movie which makes it worth watching. But how can you go wrong with making Paris look mysterious? Sir Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing was more than I could hope for. He pulled off the whit that Teabing had in the book but was more humorous with such lines as ""I guess my Cannabis charge has caught up with me"". And not surprising, because I believe he has a lot of talent but Paul Bettany pulled off Silas very well. Ever since ""Dogville"" and ""Gangster No. 1"" I think he is starting to show himself as more of a character actor and people are taking him more seriously. I was frightened of him in ""Gangster no. 1"" and I felt the same here too.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the book thoroughly even though it's one of the easiest reads the film felt far inferior and was quite disappointing. Maybe it should have been made into a movie first so that a lot of people wouldn't have left the theatre agitated."

","It's going to be a sad day for Dan Brown fans when they go to see his, ""The DaVinci Code"". Not only does the film not live up to the novel, or to the hype, but it also doesn't even breach the surface of all the potential the movie had going for it with some good actors, such a Hanks, Tatou, Reno, Molina and McKellen. Although there were good performances from Tatou and McKellen, the cast in general performed rather poorly. When I see a film adaptation of a novel or a book, I prepare myself for the usual disappointment that parts of the story will be changed and edited for the sake of time. In ""The DaVinvi Code"" however, I was more than surprised to see that not only were some parts missing and altered, but there were many things added as well. There were many instances where the story was rushed, leaving many questions unanswered. This will also leave anyone who hasn't read the book somewhat lost. WARNING to those who have not read the book; watch the movie with someone who has so they can fill in the many gaps. I love the novel and my love for it had not been altered after watching the film. Yet I don't believe Ron Howard did any justice to the book with his direction. In summary, the movie is still worth while to watch, although maybe not in theaters. For those who have read the book, prepare yourselves for some disappointment. As for those who have not read the book, prepare yourselves to discover the ""greatest story ever told""."

","I was completely disappointed with the film. I was expecting something extraordinary, considering it was a Ron Howard film but I thought it was crap. It was slow, uninteresting and the actors seemed to have no passion for the film or the purpose it was supposed to serve. I read the novel a few weeks back and absolutely loved it. I found it entertaining and very well written in the sense that it kept the reader interested. Needless to say I finished the book in a day. However, the movie was not what I expected it to be. I bought tickets in advance and was looking forward to it, but I absolutely hate that so much was different in the movie, I mean yeah, movies are never exactly like the book but I was expecting more considering all the hype. They skipped a whole scene in the plane and I thought that was a vital point in the novel. Another thing...the ending. Where did that come from? I think I was most angry than disappointed at my waste of money. If I liked anything about it, it would have to be Silas. He was my favorite part of the film and most like the character in the novel. <br/><br/>Boo.<br/><br/>I like how no one clapped or showed enthusiasm for the film at the end. At least I don't stand alone in my opinion."
"dbsoulcore","5","2","5","19 May 2006"," Uninspired.
","From the word go... the acting and direction of this film is unemotional and detached. Tom Hanks is terribly miscast as Robert Langdon, completely failing to convince us of his character's expertise and demeanor. Forget the lack of romanticism and eroticism that was in the book and not the movie. The movie is not enough drama and too much lecture, with none of the cliffhanging suspense that makes the book so wonderful. An absolute disappointment, especially from a great actor like Tom Hanks, who has more than proved himself adept at dramatic roles.... in this film it is as though he is sleepwalking. Worse still is Ian McKellan, who still plays the old grey wizard Gandalf card in this film in his delivery, and apart from a few playful moments (and the only chuckles in the film), is completely dreadful. Jean Reno, as usual, completely nails his part of Bezu Fache, and Paul Bettany, who I think is a great young actor, is adequate as Silas. Ron Howard tried too hard I think, to make the film enjoyable by as many people as possible and far too much of the controversy is either passed over quickly or left out entirely. Ugh. What a disappointment."
"jax713","6","2","5","19 May 2006"," Could have been worse, should have been better
","I read the book and enjoyed the twists and turns and puzzle-solving and it's unique premise, so I was very much looking forward to seeing it on the big screen. This is a good movie, but not the great one it could have been.<br/><br/>Though Ron Howard kept the story moving and I didn't get antsy in my seat, I wondered afterward what the film would have looked like in the hands of another director. A director who can build suspense was needed for this film and that isn't Howard's strong suit. Howard and the screen writer did a good job of providing all the information and background necessary to understand a rather esoteric topic, but some of that information turned out to be dead weight when made part of the movie. Meanwhile, other information that should have been included was not. For example, Langdon's fear of small enclosed spaces really did not add to the movie and, in the book, Sophie was portrayed as more intellectual than she came across in the film. A romantic relationship between Langdon and Sophie began to develop in the book, but you don't see it in the movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon was somewhat of a misfire. In an obvious effort to appear professorial, we don't see a range of emotions in Hanks' characterization of Langdon. The book makes Langdon a man who is unwillingly swept into a murder conspiracy but who is equally impelled by his own expertise and resourcefulness. We don't see his struggles with the fear of being hunted and the frustration of figuring out his next move, and then his decoding talents come out of the blue at just the right time. Tatou does a very good job with what she's given, but the book's Sophie was shrewd and dynamic and Tatou isn't allowed to show these traits except briefly in the opening scenes. She devolves into a rather passive partner for most of the movie. Unnecessary minutes were given to Silas, whose perverse dedication to a religious philosophy could have been summed up more quickly without the short voyages to his childhood. Getting to know Silas detracted from the terror we are supposed to feel when confronted by him. Instead, we feel sorry for him most of the time and that interferes with the thrill of the chase-and-escape rhythm we should be experiencing throughout the film. Jean Reno is always the perfect French cop, but again, the dichotomy of his character is lost in the film whereas, in the book, the reader wonders if he's the ""Teacher."" Because of the time constraints of a movie, it would have made more sense to modify Fache because he never becomes suspicious in the way the author intended. McKellen is superb in his role as Teabing, stealing every scene he's in. My guess is Howard didn't direct him at all and just let him roll.<br/><br/>My rating of 6 out of 10 is slightly higher than my gut tells me because Howard and the screen writer were faced with the daunting task of not only bringing a record-breaking best seller to the screen, they had the additional burden of translating a big, complex subject full of conjecture, over-the-top characters, secret rituals, ancient histories, symbolism, and religious factions. Add to this that all the clues related to the central murder are in Mensa-type codes and you can imagine their priority was to make this story understandable to a mass audience who has not read the book. This earnestness, however, is what diluted the suspense and, ironically, left several unanswered questions. So, I keep wondering what Spielberg, who can build suspense, awe, and excitement in the span of only a few frames, would have done with a story like this."
"nikola81083","5","2","5","19 May 2006"," So boring!
","I must admit I never liked Tom Hanks and this certainly won't change my mind about that. He is simply not interesting at all.<br/><br/>After reading the book last year, I was telling everyone how thrilling it is and when heard about movie, my first guess was it's going to be much better. Well, seems like no one should've expected that. Characters are not well developed at all, and the story tends to get really slowed. <br/><br/>Simply, I think it should have been done lot better, with more dynamical scenes and getting it little more mysterious. Especially, because Opus Dei is not mentioned as much as they might have wanted for us to think.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, total failure due to expectations."

I think most people will feel disappointed because there's just been too much in the accessible media recently about all this that most will feel that they've seen it all already. Someone who's never read the book might find it interesting. This movie actually suffered because it was too faithful to the book. At times I felt like I was listening to a lecture and not watching a movie. I'm sorry, I love Tom Hanks, but his acting was too wooden. Audrey Tautoo was just a complete mistake. It was difficult to watch her. There was just no chemistry there between the two. I think the movie was saved by the acting of Mckellen, Bettany and Alfred Molina. I think most people will see this movie just to get it out of their system that they actually saw the film version of the novel. I have to say that for me this closes the chapter on The Da Vinci Code. Ron Howard should have consulted Anthony Minghella on how to make a movie that's even better than the book it was based on. I'm talking about The English Patient."

","I have watched it yesterday with my daughter, we usually have mixed views, but not in this case.<br/><br/>I did not like the book so much, but expected more from the movie, the plot is confused, and the actors are not convincing, mainly Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>I think in the case of Dan Brown's books, and mainly Da Vinci code, the success of advertisement and the promotion is much more exciting and interesting to observe, than the book and the movie.<br/><br/>The cinema hall was full as its promoted all over the media, and create arguments even on CNN, but it is not convincing story and when you put it together with not convincing actors, and mixed plot, you feel sorry you left home and spent the money."
"theshadow908","5","2","5","19 May 2006"," So, uh...What was all that hype about?
","The Da Vinci Code tells the story that we all must know by now about a Harvard professor who finds himself caught up in trying to solve a murder while discovering clues that lead to the theory that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and their descendants still walk the earth today. The book and movie involve intrigue, murders, mystery, and a little bit of action, and overall stirred up quite the controversy with the Catholic church. This movie has been hyped as this summer's biggest hit. The book is supposed to be an amazing best seller. Now, while the story may look intriguing, and the trailers make the film look amazing, I think that people are going to be surprised at how much of a let down this film really is.<br/><br/>I'll start off with the acting, since that's what bothered me the most. So many great actors in this movie...Alfred Molina, Paul Bettany, Jean Reno, Ian McKellan and Tom Hanks. These are all actors that I have enjoyed watching in the past. Ian McKellan gives a solid performance and Paul Bettany is chilling as Silas, the murderous monk. Beyond that, no one does a spectacular job. Tom Hanks, who is an amazing actor, and is one of the primary reasons I thought I'd like this movie, gives the worst performance of his career. I'm talking TV movie quality acting. He never changes facial expressions, and he barely reacts to situations. His acting is so wooden, it's like it's Tom Hanks' evil twin brother out to destroy his career. Alfred Molina is quite wooden as well.<br/><br/>The trailers for this movie makes it look like a non-stop action film with the music playing and the images we see of people running and gun shots going off and Silas whipping himself. When you see the movie, you'll quickly realize that there's no action at all. The entire two and a half hours of film is talking. The movie actually ends up feeling longer than 2.5 hours because it drags out and some scenes. Toward the end of the movie I couldn't stop yawning.<br/><br/>However, this movie gets a 5 out of me because I do enjoy the code breaking aspect. I like movies that have a mystery that needs to be solved. The scene where Ian McKellan's character breaks down Da Vinci's ""Last Supper"" painting was very entertaining to me, as well as the end scene when Tom Hanks figures it all out. I liked National Treasure for the same reason, but unlike Da Vinci Code, National Treasure keeps you interested with a cool story, great acting and lots of action. Da Vinci Code almost feels like an ill conceived sequel. I haven't read the book, so I'm going to assume it's better than the film.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Moritz-11","2","2","5","19 May 2006"," Yawn
","I give this movie one point each for featuring lovely Amelie and a Smart mini car (30s). Every other single aspect of this concoction was entirely disappointing. Having read the preceding Dan Brown novel - not the DaVinci book itself - I'd been expecting the same type of hot-air page-turner quality that leaves the reader both restless and barely satisfied, yet constantly curious till it's all over. Like cheap booze, essentially. Now have that transferred to the big screen, and in this particular case it didn't work with me. At all. The movie's pages didn't turn fast enough in order to compensate for the well anticipated pseudo-babble. The way it works OK in the book, I mean, on plot and line-of-thought basis. That's not to say that settings were not changing. They were changing a lot, still failing to create pace of any substance. Plus the imagery was simply too dark for 2.5h, which almost made me fall asleep. The set of actors did not help either. Since this movie is supposed to concentrate on a puzzle of artifacts, they were meant to be cliché (and acted quite up to it, I'd say). Therefore, the audience wasn't relating to anyone of the lot, some people were laughing at a ""crucial"" scene near the end (no pun intended). Oh well."

","I had heard a lot of bad things about The DaVinci Code before seeing the movie, so did not have high expectations - thus I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I was a big fan of the book and was pleased to see that this adaptation had stuck fairly faithfully to it (and not gone the way of, for example, LOTR by inserting random stuff into the story). The locations and cinematography were also pleasingly excellent and (although some may disagree) I was a fan of the way the ""recalling memories/past events"" sequences were portrayed and liked the way some of the more wild elements of Christian-bashing from the book were tempered with reasoned, rational explanations and pointed criticms of the church and its history.<br/><br/>The film was entertaining and well executed - that is until the final section, where some truly shockingly cheesy dialogue was delivered that had the audience I was literally in roaring with laughter on several occasions that were meant to be profoundly serious. I also found Silas' mannerisms and facial expressions to be often be bordering on comical rather than intense.<br/><br/>The only other gripe is that there were a couple of occasions were the storyline lost continuity as I think prior knowledge of the book was assumed.<br/><br/>I went in with the expectation that the whole film would be as bad as the last 30-odd minutes, but a good start and middle was cancelled out by a silly and annoying end leaving a distinctly average experience all round."

Things were just too predictable, as well as unbelievable (and not in the conspiracy sense, but as in the situations the characters get themselves into).<br/><br/>Tom Hanks seemed almost miscast in his part, IMO, it's the worst acting he's done yet. Even the musical score wasn't up to par. There hardly seemed to be any chemistry between the actors; although, Ian McKellen played his part well.<br/><br/>I suppose I would still recommend this to any Catholic friends just for the simple fact that it has to with a scandal involving Jesus and the Holy Grail; although, I wouldn't even mention it being a thriller.

","I saw this film at the cinema today, and although I own the book, I have yet to finish reading it(I only got to chapter 2). So, watching the film like any other cinema-goer who has no previous background experience from the novel, I found it entertaining, but unlike I thought it lacked sufficient thrills.<br/><br/>The main plot in which the curator of the Louvre museum is shot by Silas(an albino monk), is the opening scenes of the film. Before he dies, this curator leaves behind symbols and anagrams to pass on the ancient secret which ""could shake the foundations of Christanity"".<br/><br/>Robert Langdon, a professor from Harvard, is brought to the murder scene, later joined by Sophie Neuveu, a cryptologist who helps him to discover what exactly the symbols and anagrams mean - which, as we discover, leads to the Holy Grail.<br/><br/>The following chases that follow lack any kind of suspense that make me feel that the main characters are in immediate danger. It seems very ... formulaic in a way. We get some very good performances from Sir Ian McKellen(Sir Leigh Teabing) and Paul Bettany(Silas) but I do get the feeling that the other main leads were miscast - namely Hanks and Tautou. Don't get me wrong, they can act well, but they don't have ANY chemistry and Tautou's strong French accent is hard to understand at times.<br/><br/>Even I, that I haven't even read the whole novel guessed the ending and fate of the characters before the credits rolled. I would say it was somehow thought-provoking, but more in a controversial way, like: should I believe this or not? In my opinion, as a Christian, I feel the whole quest for a 'Holy Grail' is rather far-fetched and is something more of a conspiracy theory, a fantasy rather than the actual truth that has been hidden from us by Catholics for 2,000 years. Let me add that I'm not rating this film on the whole 'Holy Grail' theory, but rating it on how it is shown on the screen, whether I support these claims or not - in other words, I'm rating this as a FILM not how 'believeable' the theory actually is.<br/><br/>This book is merely a fictitious thought that has been blown way out of proportion. Whatever conclusion you come to, is up to you - I'm not forcing anyone to share my opinion. The fact is, though that as humans, we live by our beliefs and beliefs can be manipulated.<br/><br/>Rather than the religious people protesting to ban this, I reckon it should be seen as more of a springboard for a discussion about religion - more of a way of debating about our beliefs(or lack of). Watch the documentary 'The Real Da Vinci Code' to get more of an idea of the theory presented in the novel this film is based on.<br/><br/>However, that being said, there were certain moments in the film that made me jump in my seat, and was quite entertaining, just not up to the persistent hype for the film that I had hoped for, really.<br/><br/>It's not a TERRIBLE film, but not a brilliant one either. I think that Langdon only exists to serve the plot of the film/book and doesn't really have any depth of character as such - kind of like a cardboard cut-out. This film had the potential to be better, but it was hindered by a bad script and not-so-great performances by the main leads, as aforementioned.<br/><br/>It's a shame that this wasn't as outstanding as I had hoped, and was a bit disappointing. I'd give it a 6.5/10."

","I had a few echos about bad critics for this movie, so didn't go with great expectation. The film turned out even worse... From the start, I was disappointed in the overall acting, music and total picture. The characters are not well built, probably way too much information about stuff that doesn't really matter. I agree that there is a lot happening and explanation being done in the book, but it would have been much better to be a little selective. That selection would leave more room to stage the characters and plot instead of this bad trial which seems to have been made in a rush... <br/><br/>Having read the book I was probably biased since I knew the plot. Still, a movie should catch the viewers' attention from the start until the end. This one got me sleepy near the middle, I never had that feel of action nor was I ever on the tip of my chair because of the suspense. I would have probably stopped watching if it were a DVD. <br/><br/>The attempt to explain the ritual is really badly done. I wonder if the viewers that didn't read the book even understand that part (I know I wouldn't). Why wasn't there any space for the romance that grows in the book between the two main characters? Finally, what about that Hanks' speech at the end in order to stay on the good side of the catholic tracks? That was just awful! <br/><br/>Fortunately I got in for free and it came with dinner & drinks... I would have felt bad to spend 8 EUR on this crappy flick. <br/><br/>Anyway, I hope the 3D cinema remake in 20 years will be as captive as the book.

","I liked the Da Vinci code. I'm not afraid to say it. I think those of you who took sooooo much offense to the book probably needed to check the side of the book. The word 'fiction' frees the writer from all critics who called his book a sack of lies. Of course it's lies, the book is a novel. What I really hated is all the hype that came out of this. I mean...for what? What were the Catholics trying to prove? No one believed this and if they did, well, Catholics need to find a new angle anyway. This whole ""protect the world from evil"" thing seems to be a ploy to get attention anyway. Now to the movie. As I read the book, there was not one time I sat back and thought ""this would make a great movie"". You know why? First the book is rather large. See, this isn't always a problem (for instance, The Godfather was pretty big and that movie was fantastic)...but the subject matter has to be interesting all the time. The Da Vinci code didn't have that type of suspense. Also, the book is just too slow to be considered thrilling. Bottom line: This isn't a terrible movie and it really shouldn't be all that controversial. Kudos to Dan Brown for writing a great book (and yes, it was great. All who say different either haven't read it, or just don't like slow books...or you're a catholic). Ron Howard did the best job with all that he had...which was a book that wasn't really suited to be a movie. Don't even get me started on the Da Vinci code game (no, I'm not kidding).

I've read critics comments about the movie's need to carry out lengthy explanations ...and I must disagree with their view. I thought that the effect of overlaying historical scenes when discussing intricate points to the ploy was extremely well done. Yes...at times there was more than a few sentences of information to absorb within a minute but they repeated the important facts in more simplistic terms throughout other scenes. It makes me think these movie reviewers would be better suited to the dialogue of a Sylvester Stallone movie! DaVinci code had twists and turns...a poignant ending (how could anyone not want to jump on plane and visit a famous landmark in Paris after seeing that!!). Actually I wonder if any of the reviewers used their Grey matter to realize the ending was proof of the often used phrase in the movie ""people often don't see things right in front of them"" Get it ??<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Tom Hanks usually and especially not a fan of putting ""marketable"" actors into a movie to bring in box office dollars. However I found he is very engaging by taking a less emotive...matter-of-fact approach to the character. Audrey Tautou needed just a little more of...something...to make me believe her character, but still an impressive job. One point that other reviewers have mentioned that I do agree with is that Ian McKellen brings an outstanding quality to his very important character.<br/><br/>DaVinci will appeal to anyone who likes a bit of Hollywood and a LOT of cerebral matter in their movies.

Not just to Christians, but to educated rational people who would expect more from an otherwise good filmmaker like Ron Howard. What's next, a movie where Gandhi was a Nazi spy, or where Abraham Lincoln was a slave trader, or where Princess Di was a prostitute? Do movie makers have the dramatic licence to depict Princess Di performing oral sex on Paparazzi? <br/><br/>Going out of one's way to make something controversial, i.e., Jesus bedding Mary Magdalen, is not good story telling.

The only negative comment was from one gentleman who had just finished listening to the audio book on a recent trip who said that the ending was different. From those of us who had read the book when it first came out in 2003, it generally followed the book. We were genuinely puzzled at the negative reaction to this movie and postulated two reasons: (1) it is a dialog-driven movie that requires you to think and remember plot lines and characters and, thus, you have to actively participate in it; and (2) could all these negative reviews be coming from people who want you not to see it for religious reasons.<br/><br/>I use this database, along with television critics and newspaper reviews, usually before I view a movie, or perhaps after I see a movie that does not live up to the hype of the movie trailer. I felt strongly enough to write my first review for this forum because I believe that if you like the book, you will enjoy the movie. It's not ""take your breath away and I have to see it 10 more times"" great like one of my favorite movies, ""Titanic"", but Ron Howard did a credible job with the material. Although it was photographed mostly at night, it was photographed beautifully. Go with an open mind and see it for yourself."

","I found the movie an almost faithful reproduction of the novel, with a few variations that did not in any way retract from the original story but served to sustain the thrill to keep someone like me who has read the novel to be glued to my seat while watching the movie. The ending scenes touched me most, as it made me realize that what is important is the faith that one has, rather than on the circumstances surrounding the development of such faith.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany to me was the best performer as he carried his role to the point that you'd feel afraid to cross his path. As expected, Tom Hanks and Ian McKellan performed well, although I felt some uneasy moments watching Tom do his lecture before a large group of students.<br/><br/>The music distracted me at the early part of the movie though eventually it fell in sync to the point of being unnoticeable.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an enjoyable experience watching the movie and I rate it a 10 out of 10."

Interesting theories though, makes you realise there is a possibility of a different history, one that would make more sense (possibly).

"Therut","7","2","6","29 April 2009"," A decent escape movie with controversial topics
","The Da Vinci code is a thriller directed by Ron Howard, starring Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou in the lead parts. Most of you also know that the novel of the same name that it is based on, caused major controversies partly because it doesn't tell history of Christianity from the common winners' point of view.<br/><br/>Instead, Both the book and movie dwell into the mysteries of the lost forms of Christianity and tell a largely fictional version of their legacy through fictional characters and fictional events taking places in non-fictional locations in the 21st century Europe. There are those fanatics who want to dig up the almost forgotten heretic 'facts', those fanatics who want to stop them, and of course the main characters symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) and cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Tautou), who have to escape the inevitable mess that the fanatics create. During their journey they team up with enthusiastic Grail seeker Sir Leigh Teabing (played by Sir Ian McKellen) who offers his insights and resources to keep the main characters following the mysterious and dangerous path to truth.<br/><br/>The book was a best-seller for a good reason. It gives the reader almost constant suspense as the mysteries stack up and events unfold. Though the book is real page turner, it is also so long that people have lots of the time to reflect upon what they read during the breaks between reading.<br/><br/>The movie stays very close to the source material written by Dan Brown, both in good and bad.<br/><br/>It was a very hard task to squeeze the book, with it's long and detailed discussions, into a two and a half hour long movie. As much of the thought-provoking pondering gets cut out, the movie turns into almost continuous escape, which is not ideal, because after all, the original story is at least as much about discovery as it is about running and hiding.<br/><br/>The few calm sequences amidst the storm are mostly rushed and too far between, which is why the movie ends up being abrupt and undramatic when the characters discuss of the background events. This is very unfortunate because the background story is what made the book popular in the first place. Most of the action and drama both in the book and the movie is not very interesting, although Ron Howard does succeed well in some sequences that zoom in on the fears and pains of characters or zoom out to show magnificent locations or historical events. But mostly this story is ran through.<br/><br/>The acting is a mixed bag. Credit must be given to Sir Ian McKellen who succeeds in giving his enthusiastic character Leigh Teabing depth and entertaining the viewer with his strong, theatrical performance. Tom Hanks does a nice job as witty professor Robert Langdon, that is, nice relative to his other performances. The french actress Audrey Tautou has a bit too tough a task. The character Sophie Neveu she plays is so perfect that she's dull. She is attractive, intelligent, tough and sweet all at the same time, basically a flawless person. Considering the task, Tautou pulls off a proper performance, although her English isn't very strong. The supporting cast is surprisingly strong and their characters interesting personalities.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is not only cinematically well-executed and entertaining, but also thought-provoking, although not as much as the book it is based on is. The main flaws of the film have to do with the undramatic way the background story is told, the rushing through events, and the uninteresting main characters. Overall, Da Vinci Code is a decent thriller that deserves seven points out of ten."

","The book was probably one of the best that I have ever read; I could not put it down! While reading the book, I imagined how everything happened, and it was as best as I could have envisioned. And then I saw the movie...<br/><br/>A book that was total magic, was dismantled into this garbage. The directors and producers decided to completely changed the events of the book around, making it almost unrecognizable. Certain characters, small ones who made appearances for only a tiny section of the book, yet left a great impact on the events, were discarded; the union and reunion of these characters with major figures were either altered or completely obliterated.<br/><br/>Sophie, depicted as strong, brave, and intelligent, became a shadow of Robert Langdon; things she discovered and realized in the novel, became his to solve, while she stood in the background. The revelation of the identity of the Teacher was as anticlimactic as tying one's shoe for the hundredth time. While reading the book, you are left wondering who this man or woman was; the revelation unfolded slowly, and we suspected various characters. The film, on the other hand, cheated the viewers from this revelation, it unfolded like a bandage ripped from a cut.<br/><br/>Memory played a key role in the film, as we began to understand who these characters were, and how past events transformed them into the person they eventually became. The relationship between Sauniere and Sophie was torn into bits, and became NOTHING! What a shame.<br/><br/>Finally, like the convergence of the feminine and masculine symbols, Sophie and Robert come together in the novel; we are once again cheated as they depart, perhaps never to meet again.<br/><br/>Bottom Line, READ THE BOOK."

I read the book first (which I thought was a typical potboiler wrapped up in religious mumbo jumbo), and still had difficulty following this far-fetched nonsense. As a film, it's too disjointed, too darkly lit, and way too long. After all the hoopla surrounding the book, this film seems to have thrown a wet blanket over the whole thing  we (thankfully) hear nothing about it anymore. Tom Hanks had a similar effect on a big bestseller when his film of ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" also landed with a thud. I think the main problem here is the script.

","""The Da Vinci Code"" is a film based on Dan Brown's famous and controversial novel. The book and the film have been criticized by Christians due to its plot which portrays elements of the Roman Catholic Church as being involved in a conspiracy. However, this never bothered me and it is clear enough that this is a work of fiction. The story follows Robert Langdon, a professor at Harvard, who becomes entangled in the aforementioned conspiracy. The film features an impressive array of locations, architecture, art and a notable score by Hans Zimmer as Langdon unravels the conspiracy.<br/><br/>A number of people were dissatisfied with Tom Hanks' portrayal of Robert Langdon. Tom Hanks certainly isn't as well-suited to the role of adventurous professor as Harrison Ford, but I found his performance to be respectable. Audrey Tautou is also notable as Sophie Neveu. My favorite performance of the film was Ian McKellen in his over-the-top and charismatic performance as Sir Leigh Teabing. Every scene with Sir Leigh in it is a delight to see. The supporting cast is great too, particularly Jean Reno as Captain Fache, Paul Bettany as Silas and Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa.<br/><br/>This film has been criticized for not meeting expectations based on the book and generally being dull. I have never read the book and hence can't compare the book and film, but I can say that I didn't find this film to be dull. Quite the contrary, to me this film's main strength is that it sets up an interesting mystery and pursues it vigorously with a lot of interesting twists. Any film that manages that will always get high praise from me."

","Right off, I admit to not having read the book ""The Da Vinci Code"" but I was familiar with the story before seeing the film. Due to the lackluster reviews this movie received, I decided to rent it rather than rush out and see it. I find sometimes that films not well received in the theater do better as rentals. I'm not sure why. It may be the shelling out of so much money to see a film nowadays. Nevertheless, I suspect I had a better experience than some people.<br/><br/>I won't bother to repeat the story, but I am one person who did not find this film dull, lackluster, or felt like nothing was happening. I found it suspenseful and interesting, with good performances, Ian McKellan being a standout. The scenery was stunning, as was the musical score - the whole look and sound was that of a very big money production, which of course it was. I liked both Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou - Hanks never imposes himself on the material, so he didn't try to make more of the Robert Langdon character than is there - which isn't much. Just about anyone could have played the part. Hanks was the icing on an expensive cake. Audrey Tatou was very good in her role. But these parts take a back seat to the intricate and controversial story.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" is provocative, exciting, and well done. My only complaint is that it had several of what I call false endings - i.e., you think the film is over and it isn't. I loved the true ending - once it got there."

Maybe it's okay for someone who hasn't read the book and doesn't know what is going to happen. Maybe finding out what's going to happen is reward enough. But for someone who has read the book, there are no other attractions to the film. There is no serious excitement, suspense, emotion, love interest, action, cinematography, acting, social message, or anything else that makes a movie worth lining up for. It might have been more interesting if they had concentrated on the historical events leading up to the present and made it a saga of the activities of the Roman Catholic church from the time of Constantine, through the Holy Roman Empire, then the Crusades, then the plague, then the renaissance, then the industrial age, and finally the last century. If they had done that, with lots of context and verisimilitude, then it might have been intriguing and exciting. As it turns out, the flash backs were low-budget scenes like the kind you see in cheesy History Channel documentaries. Maybe I'm disappointed because I had just seen Sir Ian in X-Men, and I expected that anything he would do with Tom Hanks would have to be even better.

"happy_hangman","Null","2","6","25 May 2006"," Dire
","This is a very revealing film. It doesn't have anything new, original or particularly interesting about the Catholic church, Christianity or the nature of belief, but it speaks volumes about the source novel. I didn't like 'The DaVinci Code' as a piece of prose: I think Dan Brown is a lazy, derivative, plodder of a writer. I did think, however, that it might make a decent film  a medium where cliché, preposterous serendipitous co-incidence and an emphasis on spectacle rather than substance is often an advantage.<br/><br/>It isn't. This doggedly loyal adaptation simply highlights the writer's creative deficiencies. The dialogue is leaden, loaded with unnecessarily heavy-handed hints at profundity and significance  ironing the much touted plot twists and revelations flat. The nature of Audrey Tautou's character (of which more later) is so lumpenly telegraphed that even those who had not read the book (lucky them) would guess at it after the first half hour. There is no real attempt at characterisation, as dialogue is so heavy in exposition that personality and psychology don't get a look-in. Hanks and Tautou stagger through the film looking as though they've been stunned  reading the novel had the same effect on my mind, though in my case I was near-insensible at the thought that this drivel is currently the best-selling novel in the English language. Ian McKellern fares a little better, enjoying the few comic lines the wearily dry script is graced with, but even he is lumbered with a tired archetype. The normally excellent Bettany and Molina are just plain awful.<br/><br/>These faults are, essentially, those of the source text. Director Ron Howard must share some blame, however, for allowing the pace of what is essentially a chase-movie to sag so often, and using the wide variety of artworks and historic buildings featured so poorly. This could  for all it's lack of narrative drive  have been a beautiful film. It isn't. At best, visually, it's unremarkable. It's a controversial book, undeservedly so, as it has nothing new to say and what it does have to say is put poorly, so it is possible that Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsmith  both capable of excellent work - have chosen to stuck so closely to Brown's book in order to deflect criticism as to it's content. If this is the case, then they are cowards. If it is not, then there is little excuse for this being such a poor film."

I'm glad that Howard doesn't assume the audience won't be able to read the subtitles, because hearing the French police speak French adds a lot. Paul Bettany was simply brilliant. He has got to be one of the top actors currently working. Despite all the talk about their lack of chemistry, I thought Hanks and Tatou played very well together. For the most part, the movie stayed very close to the book.

I must disagree with them. OK, it's not great art and will never become a classic of the cinema, but it holds up as a reasonable thriller and is quite acceptable for an evening's entertainment. The cast puts in an acceptable effort to keep the plot rolling along at a good pace. I must add that the film has not made me want to rush out and buy the book and I really can't see what all the fuss is about (that's probably because I'm a non - believer).

When I left, I felt not just disappointed but wronged. Perhaps the conspiracy here is not within the film but in the hype that would lead someone to pay good money for such a disappointment.<br/><br/>I'm not for sure even how much of the film I watched, at least an hour. If this was the first half, it moved painfully slow, the characters were difficult to connect with and the whole first hour was devoted to the setup of the crux of the film - you know, the part where catholics were duped and Jesus was a fraud.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but the conspiracy this film hinges on is hard for me to find entertaining. If I were a Catholic, and I'm not, I would be highly offended by this characterization. When the film reaches the conspiracy crux, it comes across more as sermonizing, with a bit silly attempt to interpret history to develop its conspiracy theory. I know. It's just fiction, but put in a different context, say the Jews were duped about the Holocaust, it would be considered anti-Semitic, but if you make the same fictional assumption about the Catholics and Jesus, its now just fiction with no overtones? Even if it was not intended, it does smack of an attempt to discredit, or at a minimum, cast doubt upon Catholics and their beliefs.<br/><br/>Again, I'm not Catholic, but of all the things to develop a conspiracy on for entertainment purposes, surely something more interesting could be found. Overall, I'm just disappointed. Having great respect for the producer and Mr. Hanks, I expected much more from this film and don't understand the need to build such as powerful entertainment medium that promotes such a theory at the expense of a religious faith. I wished they would have been more forthcoming about the true entertainment value of this film, rather than letting the advertising hype mislead people into viewing this film.<br/><br/>Go if you like.

"fatewriter","3","2","6","22 May 2006"," Terrible adaptation
","For the record, I absolutely love the book. Now for the bad news, this movie is one of the worst book adaptations I've ever seen. They managed to take an enormously exciting book and turn it into a boring, confusing, ignorant movie.<br/><br/>I'll just give a few examples. For one, the book's theme is the importance of the sacred feminine and how women should be viewed as equals if not superior to men and yet Sophie (the main feminine character) is pretty well portrayed as a moron. She is supposed to be a genius cryptographer and yet she really adds nothing to their quest. In the movie, Langdon figures out to look behind 'Madonna on the Rocks' not Sophie, Langdon discovers the address on the back on the key not Sophie, Langdon figures out the mirror script not Sophie. In the book Sophie figures all of these things out and for some reason Ron Howard takes that away.<br/><br/>Another thing that irritated me was the deletion of one of the riddles. They completely got rid of the first cryptex which, in the book, helps to show Sophie's importance in the quest.<br/><br/>They also make Bishop Aringarosa (a character that I really like in the book) look like a bad guy. In the book, he is just trying to save Opus Dei when the Catholic Church decides to cut all ties to them. He even confesses everything to Fache and practically turns himself in. However, in the movie, they have him invent this lie about Langdon confessing to him about the murders. They also have him as a part of the League of Shadows (which isn't even in the book). At the end of the book, you understand his motivations and admire his character. At the end of the movie, you don't like him at all.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention they change the whole ending? Instead of Sophie remembering her childhood, finding her grandmother, reuniting with her brother, and then her grandmother explaining to Langdon that the grail isn't there anymore; they invent this whole new ending where they go into a catacomb and find the Sangraal documents (which contradicts the book because the grail includes both the documents and the sarcophagus; the sarcophagus alone is just a coffin, it needs the documents to make its claim as Mary Magdalene, wife of Christ). Also, they make Sauniere not actually Sophie's grandfather in the movie, which is a pointless stupid change.<br/><br/>Also, here are some of the minor changes that still annoyed me very much: Silas doesn't have red eyes; they don't take a taxi through the garden of earthly delights; the plane takes off for Zurich instead of going to London all along; Sophie does her pathetic little slapping of Silas (which looks ridiculous); Teabing's dramatic exposure to Langdon and Sophie is ruined when they show him earlier as the Teacher; Fache is a member of Opus Dei in the movie, not in the book; Sophie and Langdon don't have their final kiss and plan to meet in a month; Sophie is just a Saint Clair, not a union of the last two divine bloodlines.<br/><br/>And even with all these complaints, I haven't even touched on the acting, which was sub-par; Langdon and Sophie have no chemistry together; etc.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie left me incredibly disappointed. Ron Howard had the easiest job in the world. The book is already written like a movie, all he had to do was shorten some conversations and put it on screen, but he failed to do that. I love the book, but I won't ever buy the movie."

Usually it's the result of pandering to the intellectually challenged masses who care more for a cheesy love story or high octane special effects than substance and accuracy. Such is once again the case with The Da Vinci Code. Only this time the way was paved by a mine-numbingly painful book that had already succeeded where Hollywood often fails. Why? Most people are stupid. Most people think Leonardo's last name is Da Vinci (it's not). Most people believe anything they read in a trashy spy or mystery novel and don't bother to look up the facts for themselves. And with the very preface to the novel, Dan Brown informs his 40 million-plus readers that the art, architecture, documents and secret societies described in his book are FACT. Not fiction, mind you, but FACT. Oh sure, it's a fictional novel, we all know that. But so too are the ""facts"" Dan Brown hinges his entire story upon. FACT: The Priory of Scion didn't exist until 1956, and it was a fabricated society concocted by French hoaxster Pierre Plantard, who later confessed under oath that he lied about the Priory's long and storied past. That means Leonardo Da Vinci was NOT a member of the Priory of Scion, nor was Sir Issac Newton, nor was Alexander Pope. FACT: The Dossiere Secrets are a forgery, and were proved so by the 1970's. That means that Plantard and Co. simply invented the entire myth of the Merovingian Kings carrying the bloodline of Christ and Mary Magdalene, a bloodline they erroneously claimed still exists today. FACT: The Dead Sea Scrolls say ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about Jesus, contain no lost Gospels of Jesus, and in no way mention anything about Mary Magdalene.<br/><br/>All Dan Brown had to do was pick up a damn copy of them in translation from Barnes and Noble and he would have known that. Instead he got his idiot ""art historian"" wife to do the ""research"" for him. The same holds true with the Gnostic Gospels. Dan Brown claims they portray Jesus in human terms only and that's why they were rejected by the Church. That's CRAP. Again, Dan, pick up a copy of the Gnostic Gospels by Elaine Pagels and read for yourself how they portray Jesus as even MORE Divine than in the 4 canonical gospels. The Gnostics believed Jesus was never even made flesh, that he was all spirit and that his followers should reject material things in favor of spiritual pursuits. All of this is ignored in the book and the film. Leigh Teabing's rant on Constantine was downright laughable. The Council of Nicea did NOT determine the books of the New Testament that are now canon; that didn't happen until 50 years later, by Athanasius of Alexandria. The issue at Nicea was NOT whether Jesus was mortal or divine, but whether the Arian view of Jesus being ""of a similar substance"" to God the father OR ""of the same substance"" was acceptable. The latter view was accepted, and that produced the Nicene Creed, which most brainwashed and ill-informed Catholics recite every Sunday like sheep thinking it's in one of the Gospels or epistles of Paul. It's not. It was written by Eusebius of Caesarea 300 years after the fact in an attempt to produce some unity of belief in a Christian network of followers who disagreed on anything and everything having to do with Jesus. Hence Catholicism was born: three centuries after Christ. But one thing they DID agree on (again obvious from the literature that has survived from the first 3 centuries AD), Jesus was at least somewhat divine, he never married and he never produced offspring. That nonsense was only the later mythologizing of an already problem-plagued, contradiction-riddled storyline presented in the Gospels. Oh, and try to find a secret chamber below Rosslyn Chapel, the supposed resting place of Mary Magdalene's sarcophagus. You won't. Many have already tried--with no success.<br/><br/>As a film-goer, I wanted to at least have a PLAUSIBLE conspiracy dangled before me. I know the Catholic Church is corrupt, I know the 4 Gospels are flawed and don't tell the whole story of a man who somehow got followers to believe he was divine. I know would-be Messiahs were a dime a dozen in the 1st century world of Roman Judea. I know that tens of thousands just as faithfully built temples and worshiped the likes of Hercules, the son of a mortal woman and a god, who performed great feats, suffered a horrible death and was resurrected by Zeus and taken up to Mt. Olympus as a god. Ho-hum. Nothing original there, Christianity. But for $9 bucks, I want Tom Hanks to actually act and not phone in a catatonic, 2-dimensional performance. I wanted the plot holes to be smaller than the Grand Canyon. I wanted a pretty Frenchwoman who could actually ACT. Thank god for Paul Bettany and Sir Ian McKellen. Leave it to the Brits to inject at least some infusion of spirit and emotion. But what was Ron Howard thinking? The film was overly-long, painfully shot (though the flashback sequences were mildly redeeming), and just plain excruciating at times. That dialogue between Langdon and Neveu often made me want to wretch, and there was about enough chemistry between them to make sulfur dioxide, and only that.<br/><br/>In short, I didn't hate The Da Vinci Code because I'm a devout Christian/Catholic (I'm not), or a devotee of the book (I'm absolutely not), but because I have half a brain and some taste for what constitutes good cinema. And this ars-dribble was an insult to both."

","I saw this film tonight hoping that it would recapture the feeling of seeing a film that everyone in the world wanted to see. It might have been the somewhat lame audience, but the movie did nothing for me. Ron Howard was an excellent choice to direct Dan Brown's novel; he's a sharp and provoking director with a beautifully universal aesthetic. This film has less in common with the fluid editing or powerful photography of Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, or even Cinderella Man and more in common with some of his sloppier work with EdTV or The Grinch. Partly because this film is an adaptation from a book, The DaVinci Code suffers from a choppy, incoherent feel. Howard and long time collaborator Akiva Goldsman try to follow Brown's novel religiously, nervously moving from one character and narrative to the next. What ensues is a stylistic mess, clumsily using hand held cameras and somewhat obscure angles for a mass appeal film. Hanz Zimmer does provide a supportive score, but it is too prevalent in the film. I don't know if that belongs to Howard or Zimmer, but much of the action would have more impact if we were less dependent on someone telling us when to be excited. Which brings me finally to the flashbacks. This is especially where the adaptation component comes in. Since novels have so much more room and time to elaborate upon a character's history and personal development, movie adaptations must make up for this with more succinct and efficient suggestions. Howard chose to actually show many of the characters' ""historical monologues"" (these could either pertain to the characters' actual recollection of personal memories or their summations of the conspiratorial history regarding their pursuit) through an awkward integration of flashbacks. The one and only that sticks out successfully is the Council of Nicaea-portrayed as a mess of courtly men throwing words at one another as if they were weapons. Pulling back, the cast is good but, as other critics have noted, they look rather silly speaking some of Brown's gibberish with serious tones. Hanks and Paul Bettany surprised me. Hanks is a fantastic actor, but I thought him wrong for the role until I saw the film. Bettany was very effective, leaving no hint of his lighter side he's shown in previous films. McKellan is wonderful as always. Like the actual locales the characters travel to, the rest of the cast function as props, looking very pretty on screen but remain underused."

Past this we see Tom Hanks' awful acting as a professor, where he barely changes his voice rhythm and his facial expression through the 2 and a half hours of the movie. Silas is also a problem here, being one of the worst portrayals of the insane, religious killer. The cast was very mislead and there is not a single, good acting in it. I know Hanks an McKellen are very good actors, but they picked the wrong one here.<br/><br/>The movie is generally boring, with a lot of talking and very few action.

"Goggyjdz","10","2","6","20 May 2006"," This movie was brilliant. A big achievement for Ron Howard!
","Ron Howard scores again with a big hit based on the hit novel written by Dan Brown. Set in Europe, a professor (Tom Hanks) is framed for a murder he did not commit. With symbols marked on the corpse, Hanks character finds clues to revile a plot to keep a secret about Jesus Chirst that he might not have been the son of G-d, but a regular wise man of his age. With the help of the granddaughter of the murdered man, Hanks character continues his riddle and discovers something larger than life itself. The search for the ""holy grail"". But with the police in Europe looking for an American framed for murder, the time is not on his side and must think quick in order to prove his innocence, and solve DaVinci's master riddle of time.<br/><br/>While it twists two religions in it (Christianity and Judiasm) it keeps everyone on the edge of their seats guessing what will happen next. While the movie is long, it is worth it to sit for a bout 2 1/2 hours. And please note, THIS MOVIE IS NOT SAYING THAT Christ WASN'T WHO HE IS BELIEVED TO BE. IT IS JUST TRYING TO SAY ""WHAT IF"", NOTHING MORE. I highly recommend it to everyone."

","I saw The Da Vinci Code on May 19th, and have been eagerly awaiting its release for well over a year and a half. I believe the book was amazing and as a person who is not devoted to any religion I felt it was thought provoking. I felt that the movie took a great book and made it into the best movie humanly possible. This book is an incredibly hard novel to turn into a movie as the information provided through pages of dialogue (between characters) is vitally important to the whole story. This information is terribly hard to get across onto the screen without having terribly long scenes of actors spouting pages of dialogue. The movie provides this information perfectly and with interesting flashback sequences. I think that if you loved the book you will love the movie. Also, I don't know how others feel who have read the book, but I felt that the ending of the movie was more satisfying than the end of the book was. They haven't changed too much from the book and I felt the time fly. This movie was awesome!"
"cep159","10","2","6","20 May 2006"," If you read the book first....INCREDIBLE
","I went into this movie expecting it not to live up to the book. Which it didn't- but could ANY movie live up to the book? The movie depicts the story and does an outstanding job of balancing the amount of Religious history, symbols and a plot-twisting nail biter.<br/><br/>If you look at the movie and watch carefully for symbols with an open mind, the movie will fascinate and amaze. There are even surprises for the millions of Da Vinci code readers.<br/><br/>However, keep in mind that you will find the movie boring and confusing. The book was so intense that the movie would have to be even longer than its 2.5 hours. They remove the details, which is what creates the confusion.<br/><br/>In summary: don't go in expecting an edge of your seat thriller. Read the book and go to see a movie depiction of what you have read. Then you will find it absolutely amazing. Quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. Don't always listen to the critics."

","I couldn't believe that a movie directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks, Paul Bettany, and Jean Reno could be as uninteresting as this sedative was. I am highly skeptical about the whole premise of the story before I went, but I thought that Ron and Tom would provide a good thinking man's mystery/thriller; so I went to see it. The quality was as poor as most of the major network thriller movie fair (like the recent stinker about bird flu); I was astonished and felt like I was scammed. The characters were dull and uninteresting (how low can Jean Reno sink? He was excellent in The Professional), the story line unconvincing, and the movie was trying so hard to push the idea that Christianity was a fairy tale that it lost track of its purpose; to entertain! I will not recommend this film to anyone and I hope Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, and Jean Reno join Paul Bettany in self flagellation as penance for foisting this dog on the movie going public."

","So, The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is a real page turner. It is easy to become engrossed in the novel and lose track of time. Moreover, you become drawn into the mystery and suspense and find yourself running to the research area of the library or google to verify his facts or try to solve the puzzle first only to return to the book more amazed than before. Yes, it is a work a fiction, but has elements of truth and fun puzzles.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code directed by Ron Howard, based on the novel by Dan Brown, seemed inconsistent in intent. He attempted to capture the various elements of the novel, but couldn't decide if he wanted there to be an element puzzle solving, so he just let the characters find the puzzle, ponder it for a few seconds and tell us the answers. That's fine, I can understand, he only had three hours. The action scenes were alright; as was the use of ghosting to show elements of the past, at first anyway it got a little old after a while.<br/><br/>Several portions dragged. Several more seemed out of place. Tom Hanks though not believable at first begins to grow on you as Robert Langdon-- sort of like an infected sore, until the final scene where the script of the movie takes a left turn and heads into the land of ""let's pacify the people that might riot"" by having Langdon do a soliloquy that is somehow at once deeply agnostic, Christian, and entirely out of character. Mlle. Tautou made for an adorable Sophie and I blame the writers and Opie for any problems I had with the Sophie character.<br/><br/>The other characters were passable despite poor direction with the MVP award going to Ian for, though diverging from the text, utterly running away with the movie. There were several scenes, saved by him.<br/><br/>The ending, up until the left turn and then once again when it got on track was alright as were some scenes in the middle. The closing scene managed to conjure a slight sense of adventure and awe that a search for the san grail ought, but otherwise I was glad to see the credits.<br/><br/>Overall, it gets a ""Meh"" and a shrug. Not the greatest book-to-movie but it's not VanHellsing or anything. I wouldn't go see it again in a theater, but I might rent it or watch it on cable. If you were a fan of the book or are curious it might be worth the price of admission just to see what they did with it, if you are a die-hard fan of the book... you might want to bring some Zoloft."

","This was not a very good movie.<br/><br/>Having read the book, I must say that I did look forward to seeing this film. What a major disappointment.<br/><br/>But there are some good aspects of the movie: The first 10 minutes of the film look promising, Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing and Paul Bettany as Silas were great to watch, and the film stayed true to the book throughout.<br/><br/>Still, Tom Hanks looked tired. Time after time, movie after movie he has delivered acting performances in Oscar-range, but this time, he looked tired and bored with it all. <br/><br/>For example: How stupid it looked when he said, ""I can remember the things I see,"" while trying to figure out the encrypted message Sauniere had left them; or when Langdon first sees the body of Sauniere, he says something like, ""The Virtuvian Man; one of the most famous works by Leonardi Da Vinci."" Uhm, Okay, Mr. Know-It-All...? And the following scene where he and Neveu is in the bathroom, the dialogue is so daft and forced, and there you'll get a taste of what the rest of the movie is going to be like.<br/><br/>The films seemed rushed, yet everything moved slow; after 1/4 of the movie, I lost all feeling of suspense and excitement, and started to look for goofs (which I found quite a few of) and began turning around in my seat.<br/><br/>When I read the book, and learned of the conspiracy theories, I was really wondering, ""Wow! Maybe this is true?"" But when re-experiencing them in the theatre, the whole thing was ridiculously stupid-sounding. <br/><br/>It was as if the movie missed the little ""spark"" that makes the audience want to pay attention. I was quite bored throughout.<br/><br/>If you have read the book, you're probably going to see it anyway, just don't expect too much of it."

","I would like to say that The DaVinci Code left much to be desired. As one who has read the book, I must say that the detail in the book simply could not be captured on film, regardless of director or producer. The book was so well written and so explanatory, that it could not all be expressed in a three hour film. At any rate, the movie had enough of a plot for the average movie goer to understand what was going on for the most part. Some scenes were confusing. The scene where the Bishop obtained the bonds was rather confusing in the movie, where as in the book, it is crystal clear.<br/><br/>I feel that the biggest disappointment for me was Tom Hanks. His acting was completely flat and emotionless. I have seen many of Hanks's films, and this was not his best character. I feel that Ron Howard should have gone for more of an unknown actor. I spent most of my time comparing Hanks as Langdon to Hanks as other characters. If you want to see the film, I recommend not reading the book prior."
"painted-out","5","2","6","19 May 2006"," Entertaining if you can stomach outlandish theory
","First off, I hated the book. I thought Dan Brown had produced an interesting, if ridiculous, storyline that had me asking myself lots of questions- but I despised his writing style and the pathetic excuse for duologue he made his characters spew. Therefore, I found the film itself entertaining and suspenseful (since I read the book a year ago and didn't remember all the details), but was grieved indeed to find that the terrible duologue had been kept. Why couldn't they adapt the script a little bit more? Regardless, the acting was overall rather good: I am always impressed with Audrey Tatou's natural talent, she never seems to have to overdo anything. I worship her. Tom Hanks was alright, but didn't have much to do other than to be the bearer of code-breaking genius. Ian McKellen was wonderful and added some much needed comedy. Paul Bettany, of course, was a stand out and stole every single scene he was in- even when he didn't speak. I swear, that man needs to get an Oscar for breathing. The fast-paced-yet-leaden-with-heavy-exposition storyline doesn't leave much room for character development, so I felt the Silas story was underused and ended with a lot less redemption than I remember in the novel.<br/><br/>I still don't get how Jesus having a bloodline proves he's not divine, but whatever."

","i just came back from seeing the Da Vinci code, i had read the novel and had high hopes for the film version but to my dismay i encountered a terrible portrayal of what could have been an award winning film. Throughout the entire film you felt as though you were being rushed out of the theater. Maybe its because of the fact that i enjoyed the novel so greatly that i am picking on the movie but i went with a novice to the story and they said that if i were not there explaining what was going on in the parts that Ron Howard left out that they probably would have walked out of the theater and asked for a refund. I was especially disappointed in the ending of the film, In the book Sofie, her grandmother, and her YOUNGER brother(the movie says he is older) are all reunited. In the movie, however, out of nowhere the entire priory of Sion shows up at Roslyn chapel in the matter of about thirty minutes, i found this to be no where near as fulfilling as the ending in the book. also when Silas is killed by the police he randomly says "" i am a ghost"" which if you haven't read the book you were left pondering what the hell he was talking about. Finally the Sofie in the book had auburn hair which is the same color as what Mary Madeline supposedly had which sort of foreshadowed the ending of the story but in the movie they gave her brown hair which wasn't bad but the auburn hair would have suited the ending even more. The one thing i did enjoy was during the movie i noticed that Sofie had a strange mole or birthmark on her clavicle in the shape of the sign that tea bing and Langdon describe as being the chalice when interpreting Da Vinci's last supper, just a cool thing that you should try to seek out if you decide to see the movie which i do not recommend."

Sure, maybe there's that one tricky word that causes a bit of consternation, but beyond that, it's quite dull.<br/><br/>Such is the film version of The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>This film is such a non-event, a total waste of the talents of Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, Alfred Molina, and Ian McKellan. You're effectively watching others meander through a puzzle, without any sense of drama or human interest or anything to keep you involved. The worst part is you're not even shown the clues! You just trudge along, being told what's happening. It's like listening to color commentary at a Scrabble tournament.<br/><br/>Character development is non-existent.

The antagonists are not particularly threatening and only mildly creepy (and their eventual dispatch is, again, a non-event).

","Pop culture religious heresy is a pleasure only mildly guilty as long as it's done with reverence. Spielberg nailed this formula long ago with the ""Raiders"" movies & Ron Howard takes a pretty good whack at it with ""The Da Vinci Code,"" or, ""Dan Brown's Big Book of Renaissance Puzzles."" Harvard religious symbology professor Langdon (Hanks) is brought in to consult on the murder in the Louvre of his associate Sauniere (Marielle), which features numerous cryptic symbols & clues left by the dying man in his last minutes. Police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Tautou), after learning that detective Captain Fache (Reno) is convinced that Langdon is the killer but knowing that the professor is not, helps Langdon escape. They can only clear their names by solving riddles deliberately left by the dead Sauniere & leading to the exposure of a secret society dedicated to preserving the hidden truth of the ""Holy Grail,"" a revelation that would embarrass & perhaps destroy the Catholic Church hierarchy. The Quest for the Grail crosses the paths of Opus Dei official Bishop Aringarosa (Molina), his vicious, self-mortifying albino henchman Silas (Bettany), oily Swiss banker Vernet (Prochnow), wealthy, eccentric Grail expert Sir Leigh Teabing (McKellen) & an unseen, sinister mastermind whom Silas & Aringarosa know only as ""The Teacher."" Brown's convoluted tale is built around puzzles & selective interpretations of historical fact & legend, a challenge for a filmmaker since the viewer, unlike the reader, can't turn back the pages or put the story down until the movie comes out on video. Howard & Company get off to a strong start. Akiva Goldsman's script begins deftly, following the book closely without losing or intimidating the viewer. Howard's direction sets the tone darkly & tensely, not ponderously or somberly. Hanks is understated & terse as Langdon, much as Howard directed him in ""Apollo 13,"" where he also played a stressed-out professional whose life depends on his skill. Tautou is strongly, heartbreakingly evocative of Audrey Hepburn, almost as if she were in ""Charade"" and her roles with Cary Grant were reversed. Bettany, Reno & Molina portray their heavies with even more sympathy than Brown let them have, one way in which the movie improved on the book. Howard & Goldsman do an excellent job of covering up the book's greatest flaw, which is the ludicrous ease of solving a key mystery, by keeping the action moving steadily & reducing the mystery's prominence. The film is still aloft when it gets to Teabing, whom McKellen makes his very own with a perfect mixture of self-important eccentricity, condescending intelligence and scholarly eagerness. As the clues unravel, so does the film. It goes on at least a half hour too long, passing one Oh-My-God climax after another, desperately throwing in more Western Civ puzzles like fuel on a fire. CGI special effects in the second half confuse more than illustrate, though they probably cost more than all those ever created by Ray Harryhausen. Perhaps Howard, like most other big-ticket directors, is no longer capable of telling a story without whiz-bang effects, or maybe he couldn't find another way to deal with Brown's concentration of so many difficult, confusing clues near the end of the story. For most of the movie, the action keeps the viewer's attention away from glaring holes in Brown's religious-historical background, particularly the flawed interpretation of Da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" which should be apparent if you can answer ""yes"" when Indiana Jones asks if you ever went to Sunday School. Unfortunately, all that baggage comes crashing down as the film approaches its end. Langdon's attempt to explain it away in a short speech to Sophie falls flat, tending, if anything, to negate the whole point of the bloody adventure they share. Despite several brief attempts, Hanks & Tautou never get to fully develop their characters either individually or together, another drawback of following Brown's story closely. Those looking forward to a chemistry like Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn or Gregory Peck/Sophia Loren will be quite disappointed. Despite the global furor, the Opus Dei order is not demonized, since the story clearly indicates that Aringarosa & Silas are operating beyond official sanction. Catholic characters in fact come across with a sympathy--sometimes even nobility--when the story has time for them, which is seldom. If the ""The Da Vinci Code"" is open to a religious criticism, it's a depiction of Christianity as a religion only fully appreciated by brainiac puzzle-masters. To that end, this reviewer has left you an anagram in the title of this review, made up of the names of two real-life people associated with this movie plus the name of one vital plot device. Like ""The Da Vinci Code,"" it's best enjoyed without thinking much about any historical rationales behind it."

","Based on the popular book by Dan Brown, this film tells the story a race against time to solve a centuries old riddle crossing through religion, literature, folklore and culture. Tom Hanks plays Robert Langdon, a professor/teacher/symbolist/literature expert/puzzle specialist who gets mixed up with a plot that put him both in danger, and in the driving seat to reveal one of religions biggest cover ups. It all starts in France, when a Louvre curator is killed. He is found in mysterious circumstances with mysterious codes on and about him. Langdon, along with Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) attempt to unravel the clues to the murder, and the clues to the cover up - this takes them through various locations all to do with Leonardo Da Vinci, as he was one of the perpetrators of the cover up. The cover up suggests that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene had a child and there is in fact an active blood-line of decedents still alive. Throw in the mix various corrupt law enforcement agencies, various religious sects such as Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion, various independent parties too - and you have a adrenaline fuelled mystery that spans the time of man and religion too.<br/><br/>Directed by Ron Howard this film takes it's source material from the Dan Brown book of the same name. I have read the book but I wanted to review the film without the book in mind - so rather complain about differences or changes - I'm mainly going to be focussing on the delivery of the film rather than the contents of the book. <br/><br/>Howard's choice of locations make the film visually pleasing, some lovely architecture has been really looked at from interesting perspectives. On first inspection his choice of casting too seems to have been a good choice; there are times where the lines are a little wooden, leaving me unable to connect or empathise for the characters - but for the most part performances are decent. Hanks and Tautou do well to carry the forward, while other appearances from Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany and Albert Molina (amongst others) all come off believable. Effects have been done tastefully for the most part, with emphasis on clues to help the audience along - sometimes practically spelling out the issue for audience members unable to understand. There's a decent pace for the most part but there are times where action drags a little - presumably to allow the audience to catch up. <br/><br/>All in all this is a decent detective slash chase slash journey of a film. It's like an Indiana Jones style film with less action and more book smart. I'd give this a 7 out of 10. It wasn't awful but it's not totally my cup of tea. The hardcore book fans probably won't like some things about it, but as a standalone film it's got enough to keep viewers entertained."

","When I see this type of movies where a big puzzle is being solved with ancient text and so on. I always I always put myself in the shoes of the person/persons doing it in the first place in how they create the hints and create the secret doors that only open in very specific ways. I imagine him having contractors over to do these secret door and try to explain why he needs them. People would think he is a bit weird and if he had done it all himself even more weird and bit trapped in his own world. its like when you see documentary's about ancient secrets they try to unravel by finding clues in old texts.

","Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code is brought to life under the direction of Ron Howard. Tom Hanks stars as the renowned symbologist Robert Langdon who is called to the Louvre to solve a murder mystery. Paul Bettany plays the devout albino assassin, Silas. The murdered curator leaves behind a set of clues that Langdon must solve in order to discover an ancient secret left behind by the artist Leonardo Da Vinci. <br/><br/>Langdon is assisted by the curator's adopted granddaughter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou). Pursued by Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) who is convinced of Langdon's guilt, Neveu and Langdon follow the clues that have been left behind. Silas also uncovers mysteries as he chases Langdon and violently chastises himself. The symbologist and cryptologist together elude capture and travel throughout Paris as the clues lead them towards a greater mystery.<br/><br/>Eventually, they encounter a scholar, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) who reveals the secrets that Da Vinci hid. These revelations may not be historically accurate but the conspiracy is intriguing enough to have achieved the popularity of the novel and film. As I remember, the mystery and intrigue were served better by Brown's writing but the controversy is entertaining enough.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","Robert Langdon didn't seem like the smart Harvard professor that he is. He wasn't offering up information in the same way he did in the book. Sophie Neveu also did not seem as smart as she should have been. With the book you really got the feeling that they were intelligent people who could follow the clues and solve the mystery. With the film I thought if these two can figure out the clues anyone can. It wouldn't take a Harvard professor or a cryptologist. You expect a higher intellect level from these people. Also, it was not the same give and take as in the book. It seemed Robert was solving all the clues himself. In the novel Robert would give a little, Sophie would give a little. It was a team effort with a good dynamic.<br/><br/>One of my main problems with the film is the way Robert thinks things through in his mind. It was reminiscent of the way Russell Crowe's character saw things in A Beautiful Mind. I'm not sure if this was done in an effort to save time, or to make Langdon seem smarter.<br/><br/>I saw this film with a friend who has never read the book. When the credits began she immediately said she thought it was one of the best movies she had ever seen. With that impression of it she still had a few negative things to say. She felt that there was was a lot of information that was hard to keep up with at times. She also agreed about the way Langdon's thought process was shown. She plans to read the book and see the film again to get a new perspective.<br/><br/>I did enjoy Ian McKellen's performance. I think Sir Leigh Teabing had the best lines in the whole film. Paul Bettany also impressed me as Silas.<br/><br/>I'm giving this a 4 out of 10. It was not the worst movie I have ever seen but I don't think I will ever watch it again. I was very disappointed and bored. The entire length of the movie I kept thinking ""I don't like that its so different from the book"". I couldn't turn my brain off long enough to enjoy the film and not think about all the changes."
"thales-pereira97","4","1","2","29 May 2014"," The Da VInci Code: The Adaptation Strikes Back
","The Da Vinci Code, a mystery book written by Dan Brown, tells the story of Robert Langdon, a seismologist and professor of religious iconology in his journey with Sophie Neveu to discover who assassinated the Louvre's curator Saunière. As well as in the book, the movie follows the steps of the couple while they find out an unknown side of one of the brightest minds of our history: Leonardo Da Vinci. Furthermore, it is revealed a secret not mentioned in the Bible together with the amount of corruption and conspiracy that surrounded it. As most of you might know, when released The Da Vinci Code suffered a lot of critics by the Vatican and was and still is prohibited in some countries around the world. That being said, I do not intend to extend myself discussing whether or not the affirmations made in the book are real. Although I've got to give credit to Ron Howard who tried his best to be loyal with the best-seller, it was a disappointment to see the quantity of gaps that were left throughout the play. Important issues and answers were forgotten during the film, that shown being of crucial importance for the understanding of the movie. However, unlike most of books converted to films, this one perfectly managed to mix action and dialogs (which I am not saying were good, but I will get there) that were able to catch my attention, something that not even ""The Avengers"" could do. Finally, my complaints about the characters: with no exception, all actors and actress were exactly the way I pictured while reading the book. Besides, all had a great historic of successful movies. Yet, the development of characters was poor and the alterations made in the plot did not contribute to their roles. In conclusion, I personally hated this movie due to the massive quantity of differences from the original. However, my mother who has not read the book loved it. My final advice is that if you want to watch the movie, please do not read the book, you may share my opinions if you start with the papers."

","Giving what is arguably the most outstanding performance of his very distinguished career, Tom Hanks proves once again what a gifted actor of stunning proportions he truly is. He succeeds in bring depth and passion to the one dimensional Langdon character in the book and sets the screen afire with a searing performance that will be studied in acting classes and amaze audience for generations to come. There is no doubt that what he achieves in this film is Oscar worthy and among one of the most memorable acting accomplishments in cinema history. The rest of the cast is certainly adequate in support of Hanks but Tattou is sadly miscast egregiously in what should have been a pivotal role. Emily Watson would have been a superior choice in every way as she could easily communicate the saintliness of the character as well as the burning humanity. It was an opportunity dramatically missed by Ron Howard and one can only wonder what he was thinking when he did not demand Watson for what could have been his masterpiece."
"RyanEberhart","10","1","2","4 September 2013"," A Great Suspense Thriller
","There are few movies or books that are as controversial as this one, and this one doesn't even have nudity or much swearing in it. Dan Brown did a wonderful job weaving a fictional story with historical facts to tell the story of The Da Vinci Code. Some of the historical facts are true, some of them have been interpreted in such a way in order to tell the story. The Da Vinci Code is of course a novel and now a movie.<br/><br/>I love this movie because it has suspense, murder, mystery and history. I love the historical twists that have been added in order to tell this story. I love how Dan Brown tries to tell the story by showing that Jesus could have been married and had children, or at least one child, and that that child survived to adulthood and had children and so on. It also tells of the story that that child's bloodline, Jesus's bloodline, survived to the present day.<br/><br/>The first scene I like is the scene where Silas (Paul Bettany) hunts down Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) and kills him. The reason I like this scene is because after Silas shoots Sauniere, Sauniere leaves a message that only Robert Landon (Tom Hanks) could decipher. Landon does so with the help of Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou).<br/><br/>My next favorite scene is when Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (Alfred Molina) is trying to get the Shadow Council to give money to pay for the information that would lead to the Holy Grail. It is surprising that Aringarosa and his fellow council members are aware of what the grail actually is, Mary Magdalene. Aringarosa vows that once he gets the location of the grail he will destroy all documents as well as the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene.<br/><br/>My most favorite scene is when the heir of Jesus is revealed to the audience as Sophie herself. I like this scene because it shows her lineage and those of the group that has protected her line for over a thousand years, including the man she thought of as her grandfather, Jacques Sauniere.<br/><br/>I know this movie and the corresponding book has drawn the criticism of many critics because it calls into question the divinity of Jesus. I ask, though, why couldn't Jesus have had a wife and a child and still be divine?<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars."

","Interested in the hype surrounding this for a long time I finally got to see the film tonight, it happening to be buried somewhere amongst UK Channel 5's usual shedload of brain numbing adverts. For films like this that require some thinking I find these many interruptions more than a distraction and almost a hindrance to acceptance of either film or advert.<br/><br/>Complicated and convoluted tale of various goodies and baddies chasing after that ultimate holy grail, The Holy Grail. During the chases you can lose track of who is good, bad or both apart from the earnest and always dependable Tom Hanks. And by the end I had denouement fatigue, so many pre or misconceptions were reversed or blown away that it almost became a comedy for me. I think they found the HG by the end, although another last minute ""discovery"" by Hanks overshadowed even that. I thought the ending of Pygmalion was the most contrived I'd ever seen until this - all that was revealed to me was nearly 3 hours had gone and that my TV was still on the same side.<br/><br/>There's usually at least two things I take away from films with religious messages: 1/ just how destructive fanatics of all kinds (whether believers unbelievers or neithers) can be; 2/ just how works of fiction such as this can end up authenticating the subject by serious treatment and therefore invigorating the superstition they are fictionalising. Also I suppose it's incredibly sad that so many intelligent people of all persuasions got so swallowed up with this nonsense they partially jettisoned common sense - whereas all religious or anti-religious fanatics jettison all common sense. My Catholic father in law would never watch this on principle! Well, he didn't miss anything conceptually vital here except maybe a good laugh.<br/><br/>It's fascinating and extra-thought-provoking hokum! A well made slick time-passer cleverly mixing fact fiction and fantasy and God willing something I'll watch again - but apart from fanatics does anyone really know or care where the key to the code to the key to properly appreciating it is to be found?"

","I have been reading some of the reviews written here, and I have to say I strongly disagree with the two main lines of opinion I've detected: You will love this movie if you are an educated person with an interest for culture, or you will hate it because of the religious controversy. No, it's rather a combination of those two lines: You will hate it precisely because you are an educated person with an interest for culture. Because the movie is flat and shallow, mediocre. The story is decent, although they are including way too much information for a movie, which is a typical error when adapting a book. If you haven't read the book (and I have not) you might find yourself drowning in a historical essay rather than enjoying a movie. But well, this doesn't really matter because there is little to enjoy: The direction is so bad that the movie is simply annoying. The actors seem to be there by coincidence, puppets of a crazy script. Things happen to them all the time, but it's like they are not touched, they are just watching. So when they are forced to show some kind of life or feelings, it's almost ridiculous. Take the love story between the two main characters: Where did that come from? Zero chemistry. Not credible at all. So bottomline: Much ado about nothing. Puff!<br/><br/>PS- The issues some people might have with religions or opinions about them have nothing to do with cinema and shouldn't be taken into consideration when reviewing a movie. Please!"
"MovieGuy109","6","1","2","9 July 2011"," The Da Vinci Code's not awful, but not great.
","Dan Brown's novel has become a global hit and now Ron Howard has directed the film adaptation. The film certainly diminishes the power of the book mostly due to over length and lack of pacing. The pace is slow, given the two and a half hour length, but the subject matter is still powerful enough to give me some enjoyment out of it. Some of the fun and thrill is present from the Dan Brown novel, but not all of it, making a serviceable, if not well-executed thriller. If you can sit through the two and a half hours of controversial material, you should get decent entertainment out of this limited film. See Also: Howard's prequel Angels & Demons."
"fordpioneer","8","1","2","16 March 2010"," Decent attempt to represent the book.
","For me, the film falls into the mystery genre. It uses the typical who-dun-it type of progression. The whole movie revolves around 'solving' the mystery. In the case of this movie, the solving part takes front stage. In order to find out the solution, real life items, structures, and ideas are used to give clues to Robert (Tom Hanks) and Sophie (Audrey Tautou). The mystery itself revolves around religious beliefs about the life, moreover the lifestyle, of Jesus Christ. The flow of this film goes along the same path as films from the James Bond series. In the Bond films, James tends to travel from one location to another looking for the next clue or chasing a particular person. One clue takes the characters here, the clue they find there takes them somewhere new. Even though the clues in the movie are almost their own character, there are many more in-depth puzzles given in the book.<br/><br/>The location shots play a large part in making the film feel like it involves clues from the past. There are also elements of modern technology used to rush the information to the viewer. At one point, a pseudo power point is given to explain the significance of a picture. The movie has a very dark feeling. This plays a large role in making the viewer feel that there is something not right somewhere. It gives the feeling that there is a dark evil force behind all of the trouble. The brightest scene in the movie is the end, after all has been 'discovered'. <br/><br/>There are a few scenes shot from above that help give the viewer an idea of the surroundings for that scene. It also helps to show that the location is realistic; whether it was shot in a set or not. Some of the indoor church scenes have a lot of sculptures that add to the feeling of realism for those particular scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very good attempt at recreating a very information packed book. The nice thing about the movie is that it does not actually state whether or not everything was true or not. It gives the information and progresses through the plot quite nicely, but still leaves room for the audience to form their own opinion."

","I never went to see this when it came out in the cinema and watched it on TV while abroad. I was surprised at what a good film The Da Vinci Code is. Has Tom Hanks ever given a bad performance? And Aurey Tatou was also excellent in a film that showed her intellect as well as her beauty. In my opinion Ian Mckellen overacts ( as do many stage actors when on screen ) but that can be forgiven as the film moves at such a fast pace with lots to keep me glued to the screen. The premise behind the story is all nonsense as has been shown many times, but as others have said this is fiction, so taking it for what it is, I loved it and even bought Angels and Demons on DVD to see if that is also as good."

The movie uses historical references and manipulates them to come up with an entertaining story.

If you enjoy a fast paced plot, its a plus. If you like a complicated plot with many twists, its a plus. If you are overzealous Christian, its a double minus. The ""infallible"" Christians won't enjoy this movie because of pre-instilled biases; that might as well be a fact. I've seen comments on this movie degrading it for its deviance from the facts, but thats insignificant and inconsequential; this is not an educational film.<br/><br/>Honestly, if you are expecting to be educated by Hollywood films, you are terribly misinformed and are forgetting the purpose of the ENTERTAINMENT industry."
"KillerLord","8","1","2","20 September 2008"," A Decent Flick!
","When a movie is made from a novel, there is always an uncertainty involved as to how it will be received by the audience and the critics. Some of the movies like The Godfather have been successful in creating master pieces by drawing inspiration from master pieces. But there is always a problem with movies derived from popular novels. There is something missing in the novels that movies can provide. It is pictures! There are no pictures in novels as a result of which you tend to form your own images of the places and the characters when you read through a novel. Now, should a movie be made based on the novel, you tend to have some amount of prejudice in the sense that you are searching for the precise same images you had created for yourself when you read the novel. Many a times, movies flop simply because the director's vision of the story and the happenings does not seem to match or resonate with the opinions of most readers. I believe that the Da Vinci Code can be placed in this category.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code was a novel written by Dan Brown. Dan Brown, of course, cannot be considered an incredible author but he had done a decent job with it. Of course, the plot can be questioned in many ways but the way the novel as such had become very popular most people had heard about it and many had read it. And the starting note had made the novel even more popular. The statement made by the author that all the descriptions of the customs, rituals and artwork are real caused many people to be convinced by the conclusions drawn by the characters are true and the popularity of novel spread far and wide.<br/><br/>Dan Brown definitely did not build the characters in extreme detail. For example, when Al Pacino had read The Godfather, he knew what he was suppose to do when he'd play Michael Corleone. But my personal opinion about the character of Robert Langdon is that different people will visualize him differently when reading the novel and hence many might not like the role of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. Add to this the incredible reputation of Tom Hanks for having portrayed extremely complex characters before and you get a collection of negative comments on Tom Hanks' role. I think Tom Hanks has done a decent job with the role. It might not be a Forrest Gump or a Castaway kind of a role but nonetheless it was a decent act.<br/><br/>There are two ways of looking at this movie. One is with prejudice formed based on your version of novel. And other is that of a viewer who has not read the novel at all. Those of you who have read the novel and disliked, you really should not be bothered about the movie at all. Those you who read the novel might not like it unless you are able to reset your mind and see the movie from an independent perspective. And those of you who have not read the novel, there is a good chance that you might enjoy it.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci code does not deserve any exceptional place in the history of movies as a critically acclaimed movie. But it still remains a well done movie. The screenplay is fast paced and the characters are quite good. Tom Hanks is a good Robert Langdon, so are all other actors good in their own places. Sometimes the movie can get monotonic with the chase sequences but overall, it is a decent movie. Ron Howard's work as a director may not be his best but is overall decent.<br/><br/>This movie is worth watching for both people who have read the novel and who have not read the novel. For those of you have read the novel, my sincere advice would be to try and look at the movie unbiased and unprejudiced. Kudos!"

The supposed secret (based on incredibly bad scholarship) was that ""jesus"" married Mary Magdalene (per some spurious ancient texts long passed over as - fake). <br/><br/>And the French girl Sophie is ""jesus's"" descendant - so she is the living ""holy grail"" that the church mafia types wish to murder.

Ron Howard (who has directed quality films elsewhere) joins Dan Brown & co to do the ""Mapplethorpe"" to the Christian faith and say ""It's just art! It's merely fiction!"" as they pocket their bankroll.<br/><br/>In the movie's second scene, Tom Hank's character justaposes various potent visual images on the screen as he talks about the POWER of the IMAGE.. It's a clue to the not so secret slant of the movie. <br/><br/>Technically, Hank's character is not saying that Spanish priests (dressed in white hooded robes) ARE like the KKK, but the VISUAL image clearly implies this. <br/><br/>Most visual images for Christianity (incluing some of the artwork and statues as well as most all the film's Jesus followers) are shown as evil, tormented, cruel, and or strangely laden with secret meanings just discovered...so that one wants to breathe a sigh of false ""relief"" at the film's claim of religious ""fraud"". <br/><br/>This is masterful manipulation. Plainly portrayed, but verbally denied by the participants. <br/><br/>***** But to those who want to TEST truth claims - even in a fiction story - Research the pagan era. It's not the glorious era hinted at by this movie...Our ancestors turned from the ""cold cruel night of paganism"" to leave such things as...<br/><br/>Women as temple prostitutes (Hinted at in this movie - developed more in the book)--Infants (especially girls or the disabled) exposed to die--Slaves who were no longer fit thrown on the streets to die (and then taken in and nursed by early Christians)...and various examples of human sacrifice as well as a general contempt for human life.

","I think the problem the makers had was trying to get the very convoluted story across with reams of dialogue. The nature of the story demands this but it takes a while and doesn't have the 'page-turner' effect of the book as these revelations, which happen often, are not visually appealing but portray images when you read them. I think they did as well as could be expected getting a complicated story to the screen intact. Silas the monk is menacing, Jean Reno as Bezu Fache could have been made more of but as is the nature of the story, it doesn't lend itself well to character development, the main focus of the film is on the revelations, which are just spoken words. Ian McKellen is excellent as Sir Leigh Teabing, the eccentric English symbologist who turns a bit nasty and Audrey Tatou as Sophie Neveu is exactly how you would have imagined her to look whilst reading the book. Tom Hanks's voice was uncannily similar to that of the voice the reader used when Robert Langdon was speaking. Also, I didn't feel(as some others have said before me) that the dialouge was wooden, nor did I feel that you had to read the book to like this movie. I also thought that you can be Christian and like this film, because it has good suspense,and a very good plot, and if you don't like the theories, you don't HAVE to believe them."

Tatou's cop status seemed more like a prop than a career, and I would have loved to hear the conversations between Ian McKellen and Ron Howard over Sir Leigh's ""personal motivations.""

The role of Silas, I hope, sounded amusing to him on paper but the character is so thin, it's the kind of role that someone hands over to Kevin Bacon for the sake of a quicker link to Audrey Tatou.

Brown's book deals with a secret: In this film we are given the choice about that secret, maybe that same choice is given to us as readers of the book. If the ""Secret"" of the film revealed to us is true (in terms of the film only), how are we going to react to it? This question is the basis of the conflict of the film. The activities of the characters in this film are all based on this. Some people are afraid and react in a certain way, others are not afraid but want to use this secret to destroy. Still others are actually curious, and therefore, try to use what little resources they have to attempt to find out what is really happening.<br/><br/>These three motivations: Fear, Curiosity and the seeking of Power are intertwined throughout the film: And as each level of the plot is revealed, we are genuinely surprised at several different moments. There are a few places where we can successfully guess what is next, but by that time we are hit over the head with something else.<br/><br/>This film is also an Odyssey: Beginning in France, then over to England and Scotland, we see some of the most magnificent locations ever shown in a dramatic film. The shots interior The Louvre are worth seeing, as are the exteriors Scotland.<br/><br/>I have heard both Pro and con Tom Hanks as Langdon, and my personal opinion is that of the hair did not work, should have been left curly. I do not know if the Sophie Neveux in the film is acceptable as what she appears as, even after three or four viewings of this film. Sir Ian McKlellan is excellently cast as Baigent/Teabing- And Jean Reno is extremely excellently cast as Captain Bezu Fache. Impressive is Paul Bettany as Silas, and other characters played by Jurgen Prochnow, Alfred Molina are fairly believable- The supporting cast does exactly that... Supports.<br/><br/>I could get on my own personal soapbox about the subject of the ""Secret"" of this film. But regarding, at least, this rendition of the story, as Ron Howard presents it: We have the same choice as the characters in the film: Fear, Curiosity, or Search for Power. Since it is ridiculous for us as mere viewers of the film to even think about the last choice: We are therefore as viewers only given two choices: Fear or Curiosity.<br/><br/>And historically, Fear is the reason for all of the worst acts of Human Beings toward other Human Beings that have ever been recorded, not recorded, or erased from history.<br/><br/>Also historically is the fact that Human Curiosity has given the Human Race all of the technological and even spiritual advances we now in this day enjoy: One of those being freedom of religion, another being Film.<br/><br/>So I personally accepted Curiosity as my motive for watching the film. In the film, Hanks poses a question: A person that may have the blood of Christ running in their veins... Would that person seek to increase faith on Earth or would they act to destroy it? This film and both of the books that it is based upon is just a Modern-Day Grail Romance, and should be treated as such."

","Granted, Dan Brown's intriguing though incredibly poorly written book would have been a real challenge for anyone to turn into film. Ron Howard has always had such an unfailing sense of narrative film-making that I was certain he of all people could pull it off.<br/><br/>But, sadly, he doesn't. Nothing seems to work, from the dark, murky photography to the miscasting of Tom Hanks as Langdon to the wooden, flat dialogue to the poor use of locations and the confusing and disjointed narrative. There are long stretches of film which are in French and the resulting distraction of subtitles slows the film down even more. Why do that? It's not necessary! Speaking accented English with a few words in French would have made the same point. We KNOW they speak French in France, for God's sake. This is an American film from a book written in American English, by an American filmmaker for an American audience. Putting those stretches in French was just unbearably pretentious.<br/><br/>So much of the film was disjointed that Zimmer's over the top score had to work overtime to create any kind of tension, involvement or emotional impact. It reminded me of what Jack Warner used to do when he saw that a film he was producing wasn't working: he'd say to the composer, ""Write more music!"" And in this case, LOUDER music! <br/><br/>Too bad. This film COULD have raised some serious issues to a very large public of non-readers...but it's so poor it never stands a chance of doing that. The message gets lost in the mess."

","The DaVinci Code is based off of the best-selling book by Dan Brown. The book was so popular because of the controversial theory that inspired it. I read the book, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was interested in seeing the movie because of how good the book was. Big mistake.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with the murder of the museum curator of the Louvre. Robert Langdon is called to the scene to help solve the murder. Thus begins a very boring movie experience.<br/><br/>The movie is very accurate to the book. In most cases, this is very good. In this case, it is bad. The movie is very talky. It tries to keep things interesting by having shots of the events the characters are talking about. This still makes it boring. There is very little real action in the movie. By the end of the movie, you just wish it was over. Unfortunately, the movie weighs in at a hefty 2 hours and 30 minutes. It is overly long, and the final scene is drug out for all it's worth. Also, one of the scenes is laughable at how hard Ron Howard tried to keep an identity secret.<br/><br/>The plot is very much like the book, but a few twists were added in that confused me. The acting was above average, but Tom Hanks can't play an academic. I was hoping I would like the movie. Too bad I didn't. To fully grasp how bad the movie is, here's something I found interesting. Since the movie was released, I have not heard anything about The DaVinci code. I have not heard anyone objecting to the theory. This movie is very, VERY boring.<br/><br/>P.S. Jurgen Prachnow, the captain in Das Boot, gets a cameo in here. He should have had more screen time."
"EUyeshima","6","1","2","23 November 2006"," Some Nice Visual Flourishes in a Muddled Adaptation of Dan Brown's Religion-Fueled Thriller
","The dense plot complexities of Dan Brown's novel around the pursuit of the Holy Grail made it a thoroughly entertaining read, but the unending plethora of detail looks contrived and ultimately predictable when translated on screen, especially if you have already read the book. Having Ron Howard helm this 2006 production certainly assures a mainstream-oriented consciousness would predominate, but unfortunately, it also means a lack of pervasive invention when it comes to conveying the dramatic twists and turns of Brown's story. Moreover, Akiva Goldsman's screenplay requires scenes of lengthy exposition which Howard tries mightily to offset with fantasy visualizations of speculative religious history. However, the core problem is that the filmmakers' diligent attempts at remaining faithful to the book make the movie feel overstuffed within its lengthy running time of 149 minutes.<br/><br/>For those who don't know, the focus of the plot is on the hunt for the secrets hidden by the Priory of Sion including the Holy Grail. Some want to protect it, some want to expose it, and some want to destroy it. Harvard professor Robert Langdon and Paris police cryptologist Sophie Neveu, equipped with secrets shared by the murdered curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniére, are a step ahead of the police, assassins, and churchmen in full pursuit. After what looks to be a standard murder mystery set-up, the story finally gains momentum in the second hour with the creatively handled explanation for the hidden meanings behind Da Vinci's ""Last Supper"". A historical labyrinth is presented piecemeal, incorporating the origins of the gospels and the assimilation of pagan rituals and symbols into the early church's practices, all of which showcases the revelatory role of Mary Magdalene in scripture. While Langdon is the nominal protagonist, Sophie emerges as the pivotal character here, especially as they recognize how her past provides keys to vital information that could change history and religion.<br/><br/>Casting is a challenge here since the actors are really there merely to support the convoluted storyline. As dazzling as she has been in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films, Audrey Tautou of ""Amelie"" fame is comparatively constrained as Sophie, though she also seems a bit burdened by the verbosity of the role. As Langdon, a lank-haired Tom Hanks is more problematic as his versatility is sorely tested by playing an academically-oriented sleuth. Stealing scenes easily is Ian McKellan as erudite, Grail-obsessed Sir Leigh Teabing. On the other hand, Paul Bettany merely exhibits a fairly one-note malignancy as the murdering albino monk Silas. Also left to their own elliptical devices are Jean Reno as the secretive Captain Fache and Alfred Molina as Opus Dei's designated kingpin, Bishop Sringarosa. The film's plodding pace is offset somewhat by Salvatore Totino's superb cinematography, especially at the Louvre and other European locales.<br/><br/>Thinking back on the film, I keep wondering if it could have benefited more from a fresher director like Darren Aronofsky or Christopher Nolan, or even Quentin Tarantino's pulpish approach since the kinetic thriller elements are ripe enough for his cinematic audacity. The two-disc 2006 DVD set is certainly full of extras. Disc One contains the movie and several previews for upcoming theatrical releases. Disc Two has all the extras, which consist mainly of ten featurettes on various aspects of the production and its translation from Brown's hugely successful novel. The best of the bunch is ""The Codes of the Da Vinci Code"", which has Howard and Brown explain much of the symbolism used specifically in the film."

","Prof Robert Langdon (Hanks) is about to be accused of murdering the curator of the Louvre, but the way the curator's body is cut up provides clues to secrets hidden by Leonardo Da Vinci, and it is up to Sophie (Tautou), a police cryptologist, to convince Langdon that there is more to all this than a simple murder. Running away instead of being arrested sounds like a good idea to Langdon.<br/><br/>If you are a history-buff, you might agree that the findings of the Da Vinci Code are palatable. If you are not a history-buff you still might find this story, that starts at the time of Jesus Christ, interesting anyway. Questions: Were Mary Magdaline and Jesus married? Who was purported to be the real head of the Catholic Church? What is the Holy Grail and where is it? Do we have your attention now? <br/><br/>Whatever the beliefs of an audience, story is presented well and it flows quite logically. The clues come slow enough to allow an audience to understand the complexity of it all. The acting, dialogue, and photography, in general, are very good. I only found one flaw and it had to do with direction. When Langdon and Sophie escape from bank official with a gun, he is knocked down and the two run away. I would have made sure that bank official didn't get a chance to use the gun again, and, at the very least, take the gun, and then run; and, well he gets up and starts shooting for all he is worth.<br/><br/>Anyway, all questions are answered and you are not left hanging. Whether you agree with the answers is up to you. Remember, it's only a movie, and it's never too late to become a history buff and you can do your own research. Now, where did they put that Grail thing?"
"gilda_lives_on","Null","1","2","16 November 2006"," A brief warning for people who read and enjoyed the book
","*Spoiler ahead.* I feel that I must warn all who read the book. I was nearly outraged before Langdon and Sophie even left the Louvre.<br/><br/>First of all, the book did a wonderful job of presenting the information at a good pace, as needed. The movie takes on a little too much and just starts throwing information at you, as quickly as it can. If I hadn't read the book I probably would have been a little overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Now for my outrage. The book is about the sacred feminine and the movie is a mockery of it. When they are looking at the second anagram in the Louvre, Sophie says something along the lines of, ""Can you solve it?"" Are you kidding me? I believe in the book she is supposed to solve the second anagram after he solves the first. The entire movie is like that! She looks so unintelligent! The only casting problem I had was with Tom Hanks. I love him, don't get me wrong. But he is not who I had in mind to play Langdon. Also, with him being so much older than Audrey Tautou, there was no chemistry. He was more like her dad. I was so let down that their attraction and sexual tension was cut out.<br/><br/>So I guess, if you didn't read the book, it could be very entertaining. I was just so mad about them dumbing down Sophie that I couldn't even enjoy it. Although, it is rare for me to like a movie better than the book it's based on, anyway."

"HiddenVoice","6","1","2","6 November 2006"," Not bad,could've been a great film.However, you can't help but feel really disappointed.
","Da Vinci Code is one of those novels that I kept reading over and over again and yet be bewildered by its twists,turns and surprises.It was a book that had my jaw dropped wide open until I had finished the whole book and solved all the mysteries and yet kept me hooked into it.It was an addictive book with facts that may or may not be true.But it had everyone under its spell.It's one of the smartest and most brilliantly written books,where the fun never stops.A book where you will not be able to stop turning the pages.The twists,the surprises to the end of the book will hold your breath.That was the magic of the book and it was the finest I've read in a long time.<br/><br/>No doubt a movie was to be made.But could that film live up to its source?That is rarely a possibility,especially when the film is booked as Hollywood Blockbuster.The film is neither good or bad.It isn't a terrible film,it's just too bland and straightforward that you are able to predict everything that goes on.Even the minor alterations become obvious.I had massive expectations ,like everyone.With a skilled director,with a great cast and a producer who has produced good movies.It was bound to be great.Except,the writer was Akiva Goldsman.That's where I went all skeptical about the film.If you check his resume,it will shock you that why did the producers hired him.But then again,he did Beautiful Mind.<br/><br/>A great pedigree on its shoulders,it should've been great.But no,the film's execution is so uneven and so messy that you are unable to find any good points about the film.We all the know the story too well.But at least the makers could've changed it a bit rather than making a way too faithful book to screen presentation.Everything,sadly,becomes too predictable,leaving no surprises.<br/><br/>The book had an excellent setting,and an exciting pace that kept your hands turning the pages.The film has none of the excitement and an uneven pace that will either bore you with its dull conversations or will want you to yell out loud.I mean ,even the book's conversations felt so entertaining,whereas the film's felt so banal.There scene that were really lame and poorly executed.Something I didn't expect from Howard.And of course,lifting almost 80% of its source.When it comes to chases and action,it's fine.But when it comes to the revelations and explanations,it becomes cheesy and lame and you laugh at its execution.In the book,the the factoids explanations was what hooked you in and made the book such a classic,but in the film the facts and explanations seem really boring and lame,poorly done except for its flashback sequences,which were impressive.<br/><br/>The only saving grace here are some standout performances and accurate casting.Sir Ian Mckellen couldn't have been better cast in a role that I pictured him playing when I read the book.His perfect portrayal of Leigh Teabing is what makes this film worthwhile, for a while.Although,after the big reveal he is just another actor disposed.Another actor who took me by surprise was Paul Bettany as Silas.I never thought of him playing a role like this,but he just proved his talent.He manages to evoke the emotions of his character and his chilling performance really makes Silas come alive.Hanks is a terrible miscast.Perhaps his worst role yet. His portrayal of Langdon is dull and expressionless.His wooden acting really disappoints me,as I had expected more.When it was announced that he would be Langdon,I was excited.But I guess it didn't matter now.While reading the book,the only actress that struck my mind who would be perfect for Sophie Neveau was lovely Audrey Tautou.The character's description matches with her and she was well cast.Except,she couldn't pull it off.She looks totally silly with her weak accent.The makers made a joke out of the character.Most of the times,when she delivers a classic line from the book,I'd be having chuckles.She was a let down to a great character.Alfred Molino is fine.But he's underused.And Jean Reno plays his routine cop character,which I've seen many times before.I had no one else in mind who would play him but he just lets down.And as the smartest character of the book is turned into the stupidest character in the book,Jacque Sauniere.There was more depth in the character in the novel than it is in the film.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard pulls a few surprising elements and handles a number of scenes with his skills but overall he lets down big time as he couldn't hold the film well.His visual taste is fine but doesn't apply to the film.Forget about the writer,he's just made a terrible adaptation.The film has a stunning look to it.It's visually entertaining.Even if under uses its masterful setting it still manages to capture the essence of the book.The score is fine while the editing could've been better.The flashbacks or the re-tellings of the past events were the key highlights of this film.That's what succeeds in the film.<br/><br/>Once again,the book-better-than-the-film claim could be easily applied here.What could have been a great translation,is turned into a bloated and disappointing film.It succeeds in only few parts.But regardless of all that,there is a lot to enjoy in this brainless adaptation.It is ridiculously entertaining.It has a gripping atmosphere that will keep you interested as long as it can.It's certainly loads of fun. But don't expect a classic.Another could've been better film."

The Plaintiff Sirrano Keith Baldeo of New York brought the suit against Sony, Dan Brown, Tom Hanks etc. Alleged that the movie makers never in the trailer or other wise stated the it was fiction and that co producer Dan Brown stated to a judge (peter smith) that he had historical evidence to show that Jesus did have sex with this sinner and had children, the Church hid it. If you notice the movie never stated it was fiction because it wanted to leave it as an 'option' to believe it. The plaintiff is appealing to the Supreme Court. Either way when Jesus were here, there were people and judges just as these. Using his father's name, as they are now doing his (in the courts) and ruling against him with laws they made up.

The only thing that's good is the acting, though you wouldn't expect less from all the experienced actors. But all the acting doesn't really come forward, because the script is so shallow. You cant really feel the characters, they are all left without souls. They just do what they do, they mention some reasons behind their actions, but that's it. I don't want to get into the story, much has been said about it. But from the movie point of view: it takes itself much too serious. It wants you to believe that by revealing this mystery all of the world would change and nothing would be the same again. If you can believe that and hold that thought in your mind trough the whole of the movie, it would be far more interesting. If you cant, than it all starts to be dull.<br/><br/>Also I should mention that its made in a true Hollywood fashion.

It followed very closely to the book. I honestly have to say that over 90% of it followed the book, which is very rare to most films based off of books.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know what the Da Vinci code is about, it is a controversial tale of the fact that Jesus was married, and that there was a bloodline that ran to the modern-day.<br/><br/>The film, like the book opens with a savage murder of a clergyman in Paris, France. A specialist in religion and mythology, Rob Langdon (Tom Hanks) is called in to help with the investigation. Unfortunately, the truth be told, he's under investigation for the murder. But as fate has, a French detective, Sophie Nevereu (Audrey Tatou) believes his innocence, and thus begins the quest in search for the holy grail.<br/><br/>I don't want to say anymore, for I'll spoil the film. But basically, these two go on mission that involves the biggest, religious cover up in history. The film has an all star cast such as: Sir Ian McKellan, who is flat-out excellent as Teabing, Paul Bettany, who gives a creepy feeling of the albino monk Silas, Capt. Fache (jean Reno), who is also great, and many more faces.<br/><br/>This film was excellent. As previously said, it follows the book very closely, it's acting is superb, and i also have to add that the film-making quality was great too. the cinematography use of blended colors gave an eerie, religious feeling, the music by the ultimate Hans Zimmer, had the same effect as the cinematography, and the other technical uses and set-decoration was fabulous.<br/><br/>After saying all that, there was some negative sides to it as well. first off, it was a slow movie. The book was a page-turner, but the film didn't have that quick pace as I thought it would, and also some of the story was left out, especially at the finale which made me feel disappointed. I know most producers feel that they have to rush the end of film's, but that's no exception for a film like this! Besides those two problems, the film was fantastic in my mind, and is one of this year's best films. overall rating ***1/2 out of **** I have to warn, it is controversial on religion, and many maybe offended by it.

The ""facts"" that make the book a masterpiece.

The Da Vinci Code tested the limits of this. If you pull at one dangling strand of the plot, it all starts to unravel. The plot and the conspiracy just doesn't make any sense. Furthermore, the movie is incredibly boring for something that's supposed to be a thriller. It feels as if both cast and crew were sleepwalking through the whole thing. However, I did have fun looking at the cast and thinking about all of the movies they've done that were better than this pile of poo.<br/><br/>Lastly, it was depressing to see Amelie play ""The Girl"" in a big budget Hollywood movie. She spent a lot of time running away from bad guys behind Tom Hanks. Actresses often complain about the lack of good female roles.

I found the narrative to be condescending, the foreshadowing ham-fisted, and the pacing irksomely slow. The entire book felt like Dan Brown was so busy smugly congratulating himself for being so darn clever that he forgot to make the book really interesting. There were times I wanted to shout, ""Get on with it!"" Every five pages or so, the characters would be stunned into silence at some new revelation that the reader had seen coming a mile away. And after all this frustration and annoyance, for some reason I went to see the film anyway.<br/><br/>The film, like the book, is condescending to the audience, frequently transmitting the next key point of the story long before it's revealed.

","From a cinema production point of view, this is a fine effort. Good acting, editing, lighting, sound, cinematography, etc. No quibbles there. It was a riveting suspense tale with all the elements of the genre thrown in: False leads, red herrings, -- As a movie, I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>As a valid representation of two thousand years of religious history, the movie falls short. While, over the centuries, there has been no shortage of persecutions, killings, banishments, etc. done in the name of Jesus, or the Pope, when you boil them all down, most were really the result of envy, greed, and good old fashioned political rivalry. They were mostly after gain, territory, plunder and glory. To ascribe most if not all malfeasance done during 2000 years to the central motivation laid out in this movie --Jesus was (gulp!)married to Mary Magdalene-- is just silly. Would people really kill each other because some think he was married, and others not? Most people would shrug their shoulders and say ""so what?"" Being married would have not been unusual for a Rabbi at the time. What of it? Also, the idea that if he was married, he couldn't have been divine, merits another ""say what, why not?"" Many believe that the very reason he alone could atone for all humanity was because, as a divine mortal, he was uniquely qualified to give his life for us. It was his free will gift. He could, of his own free will, sacrifice himself for our sins.<br/><br/>Aside from the theological arguments, perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this movie was the depiction of all religiously orthodox and devoted Catholics as despicable monsters capable of killing without a hint of conscience. This goes right along with the trend in Hollywood these days: Christianity = evil. Only those who somehow held out the secular ideal of Jesus as just a ""great teacher"" but not divine were depicted as good and honorable. This is a hurtful stereotype, and is deeply resented by religiously oriented people, yet it seems to be the stock-in-trade of filmdom these days. For falling into this trap, the movie is cheapened and is almost laughable at times in its excessively evil portrayal of all clergy. Maybe some day, an honest depiction of the overwhelmingly good priests, monks, friars, cardinals, etc. will be made, but it's not this movie."

It was two-and-a-half hours long, but the suspenseful pace was quick, even if the dialog was heavy (lots of talking - it was a book at one point after all). It was interesting to see how the story involves real events, places and things with fiction and conspiracy. That was really cool. A lot of it didn't make sense, but that's what you get when you try to make things exciting (why was this random guy interested in the cryptex?).<br/><br/>The Christians made a huge fuss over the movie, and I feel only one organization was justified in it - Opus Dei. They officially didn't make a huge deal out of it, they pretty much just opened up to explain what they're about,a nd re-released their founder's book, The Way. There really isn't a need for the Church to expend so much energy fighting Dan Brown when they should be focusing on teaching scriptures and sound doctrine. The secular world has been doing a stellar job discounting all of Dan Brown's claims - just watch The History Channel to see.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a solid rental, but that's about it."

But let's not forget, these same fundamentalists were convinced that Harry Potter will burn in hell for using Satanic magic. Also, these great controversy just added to the movies hype. So, does this movie live up to it? No, it doesn't, actually. Never having read any of the books, I went into the cinema completely unbiased, expecting an enjoyable and suspenseful, intelligent yet fast-paced thriller. Turns out, none of these four adjectives are any match for this movie.<br/><br/>The film drifts along uninspired, never going so far as to actually create suspense. What happens is either entirely foreseeable or so absurd that whoever wrote the screenplay should be taught that deus ex machinas need to be disguised. The only thing that moves the plot forward is people we thought were good constantly and absolutely *surprisingly* drawing a weapon and saying ""HA! I'm actually working for the Gnostics!"" or ""You filthy son of a byatch, God is our savior and Jesus died for you"" or something comparable. This gets so ridiculous at times that reasonably intelligent humans, as I like to call myself, feel a strong urge to laugh out loud, thus disturbing the other cinema watchers who are still trying to follow the incomprehensible plot, because they have read this film was so *intelligent*.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the ""I-N-T-E-L-L-I-G-E-N-C-E"" of this movie. Did you get that or was I too fast? Well, even if I was, you'll still have no problem coping with the *incredibly hard* codes and riddles presented to the sleeping, no sorry, avid viewer. Because even a kindergarten child won't. Every part of that, admittedly very complex, Star of David, is highlighted at least for ten seconds, so there's no possibility you can miss that connection. And even if you do, it makes absolutely no difference, because you won't get the plot either way as it makes zero sense.<br/><br/>Yeah, that's right, the plot makes absolutely zero sense. Leaving the cinema, you may or may not remember the film's title, ""The Da Vinci Code"", and you may or may not ask yourself what actually *was* that ""Da Vinci Code"". I don't know myself, actually. It could be that kryptex our favourite murdered Louvre director gave to his beloved daughter Sophie Neveu. It could also be the *staggering* fact that there is a gap between Jesus and the guy next to him shaped like a V in Da Vinci's The Last Supper, which Langdon immediately recognizes as the shape of a vagina. By the way, Neveu isn't actually allowed to talk in this film a lot, so she just has to interestedly nod at this startling remark.<br/><br/>So, is there any grain of entertainment in this film, any? Well, there happens to be quite a bit of - admittedly unintended - comedy! It's true, when Langdon - with his hair perfectly geled, by the way - is on the escape from the hordes of different sects that are pursueing him, all he has on his mind is to get to the next library. Haha, but he didn't remember that his escort Neveu has no problem to hit on some random man sitting in the bus just to get his cellphone, on which to search the net. But you *did* recognize right from the beginning that Langdon is too frumpy to use the Web, didn't you? And all this is not even to speak of the final scene, whose dialogue I still deem among the ""Top Ten Most Comical Moments in Cinema of All Time"".<br/><br/>So, summing up, please don't watch this movie. Don't. It will hurt your brain, a lot. It will hurt your eyes, a lot. It will hurt your stomach from the laughing. Thank you."
"avatarianism","3","1","2","6 August 2006"," Terribly boring.
","The book was half interesting, but still a poorly written thriller with a shallow plot and one-dimensional characters. Tom Hank's performance in the movie can be credited to this. He's a good actor, yes, but not even God himself could make characters as superficial as the ones in The Da Vinci Code seem interesting. Hence the reason why he was so damn boring.<br/><br/>Oh, and note how the most interesting character in the movie is Silas despite the fact he says probably no more than ten lines. I'd say that's a true testament to this movie; there would have been just as much character development had the characters said nothing at all.<br/><br/>Terrible book. Even more terrible movie."
"strangelexicon","6","1","2","4 August 2006"," Yes it is offensive but...
","...it is not a bad piece of cinema as many make it out to be. I put off reading the book just to experience the movie in its fullest form. While many people have put forth an argument that it is not as good as the book, I, who have not read it, found the movie quite decent. But coming back to the previous warning, yes, this movie can be quite offensive, especially to the Church. The Church and Christianity itself is painted explicitly in very negative light and I'm not talking about the Mary Magdaline controversy. So, if you are a bit sensitive, then I would advice you to not watch this movie. But as a piece of cinema, it has been quite well directed and produced. The acting and locations are quite good. It would be mild entertainer if you could ignore certain parts of it."
"Garry-10","4","1","2","28 July 2006"," Just a bit dull, really
","Meh. Just dull, really. No real tension despite an attempt to raise it by means of a few (ridiculously staged, convoluted set up) chases, a modicum of plot twisting that makes no sense, and a bit of the old ultra-violence. Toutou tries to be emotional with a few raised eyebrows, Reno sleepwalks through and says 'merde!' a few times, McKellen picks up a cheque for doing what he always does and Hanks continues his long slow slide into middle age without really finding a niche for himself - romantic lead? action hero? He tries both here, and doesn't convince in either. Howard plots the film by numbers, making sure that even the hard of thinking can follow it. It just looks like a low budget film made with a huge amount of money. You don't really care about any of the characters as they slip from good to bad to good without any real explanation apart from bizarre sociopathic behaviour and 'slap the forehead' obvious moments.<br/><br/>But I suspect the whole thing is unfilmable anyway. It's really a plot written around a supposition (the whole holy grail thing), and as such, the plotting of the film is not as interesting as the wider supposition, to which so much documentary footage has already been devoted. So we're left with this hotch potch: neither documentary, nor thriller, it meanders between the two with clunky dialogue that tries to advance the plot without losing the audience.<br/><br/>'I must find a library - quick'. C'mon.<br/><br/>By the way, in Britain, we do not all have red phone boxes, red buses, nor live within a couple of hundred yards of major landmarks like Tower Bridge or Millennium Dome. Amazing though it may seem."
"lordelm3lmeen","6","1","2","26 July 2006"," could have been better
","1st we'll start with the simple things then get to the more complicated stuff. acting performances: not the best performance by hanks,excellent work by Ian McClellan and Audrey. these are the most notable, the other actors (molina and co) were just fine. when i saw the trailer of the movie, i thought that the time has finally come for Bethany to breakthrough and become a really heavyweight actor joining the elite of Hollywood but that didn't happen mostly because the movie have ruined the character that we have read and sympathized with. i think the biggest mistake was making this movie a 2h something. of course most pros and script writers would disagree saying that there are certain rules when you adapt a novel, but this novel was truly unconventional in so many ways. it isn't enough that its turned into a movie it has to be turned into a truly great movie. because i believe that the success to the box office was a tribute to the book. but how could have this movie been better? first i would make it an epic adventure like pirates of the Caribbean or lord of the rings. because turning it into a thriller is of no use, its the most read novel in the history of literature! so its not a surprise that teabing is the murderer or that Sophie neveu is the ""decsendent"" of Jesus Christ. so having a breath taking epic adventure full of riddle's and mysteries traveling through time and space to find what jack sauniere has Left his grand daughter after his death. another point is why is this movie only two hours something? it easily could be four hours! and it wont be long because what we enjoyed the most about the novel was Dan brown's ability to end every page with a cliff hanger, so its not long. as long as their is action taking place and as long as this action adds something to the story it cannot be considered unnecessary. an example is in the movie where langdon is asked to explain the pentacle on sauniere's body. langdon says it has nothing to o with devil worship. while in the novel he goes on for pages analyzing how this star evolved from being a sign of goddess Venus into a sign for devil worshipers. this doesn't only supply the reader with interesting interpretations but also makes the reader safer so that he becomes more shocked when he finds out langdon is actually a suspect. the longer time langdon spends explaining to fache, the more shocked will be the audience to find out that is a suspect. to sum it up the film failed in bringing the dark and tense mode of the novel to life. but thats because Ron Howard wanted to deliver a message different than the book's. the book is an invitation to renew our faith, while the movie is the conclusion that Ron Howard has come to after reading the novel. our faith is good, and helps us the way it is regardless of the historical truth (the well scene). Kenneth Brana would have been great as Robert langdon! i give it 6"
"ROSSCLARK476","2","1","2","16 July 2006"," Not all its cracked up to be
","Probably one of the worst adaptations i have ever witnessed.<br/><br/>In all honesty i wasn't a major fan of the book, i found that to be a near plagiarism of a much more involving book ""Foucalts Pendulum"". This notwithstanding i watched the film hoping it may at least do justice to the Harry Potter-esquire novel. I was most disappointed in the lack of depth in the characters, through no fault of Tatou, Hanks et all, this lies squarely at the foot of Dan Browns door. Contrary to other IMDb reviews i found that large, very important sections of the dialogue and narrative were missing. Par example the way in which Langdon is able to solve the riddles and clues in no time and with seemingly little effort, whereas in the book it is a considerably lengthier affair. Add to that the lack of detail in the explanations of the symbology and iconography - supposedly langdons field of expertise - and you have missed a large portion of the books identity.<br/><br/>While the production team, Howard in particular may have deemed this story a little too controversial and thus ""softened the blow"" with endless subtle innuendo making the film constantly ambiguous, i found that the persistent divine interventions to be a bit of a cop out. Was it just me or did some higher power intervene whenever Langdon/Neveu faced danger? The white dove for one - ill say no more, if you have seen it you should know to what scene i am referring. <br/><br/>All in all an easy money making venture for all concerned i believe. Making a film off the back of an already popular book and not having to make it very well can yield spectacular fiscal results. As proved by The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>My advice to readers, if you haven't already, Read Foucalts Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Its a bit heavy going, but if you enjoyed the thought provoking qualities of the Dan Brown Novel you should be in your element with the pendulum."
"Avalon1178","3","1","2","10 July 2006"," The movie just missed it
","**** WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD ****<br/><br/>P O S S I B L E<br/><br/>P<br/><br/>O<br/><br/>I<br/><br/>L<br/><br/>E<br/><br/>R A H E A D<br/><br/>As many would agree, the original book is definitely way better than the movie as most movies are which are based on a novel or a book. To me, I'm disappointed with the movie because I felt it didn't represent the essence of the book. Besides the obvious controversy, the book's central theme is the glorification of the feminine. This is definitely not the point of the movie. Sophie, the story's main ""feminine"" character, was portrayed in the movie as weak and even unintelligent. In the book, Sophie was central in breaking the numerous codes left by Sauniere. The concept of the ""feminine"" is definitely not present in the movie. Instead, it felt like the movie simply wanted to focus on the Jesus controversy (the meeting at the Château with Leigh Teabing...they got that one right on the mark) rather than what the book is truly about---Sophie's search for the truth about her family. The movie even failed to capture the thrill of solving the riddles, which I thought made the book really great!<br/><br/>I understand that the movie cannot possibly include all the details in the book; but there's a difference between omitting certain details and actually ""rewriting"" the plot to fit in the movie. The first half I thought was right on the mark with the movie (albeit a bit too fast), but the second half completely deviated. Character portrayals were changed. How the codes were broken were missed. The list goes on and on....<br/><br/>Personally, if you want to enjoy Da Vinci Code in its essence, I definitely recommend reading the book first then watching the movie. Try to ignore the controversy behind it. I myself cringed at the fact that the so-called ""truths"" in the book were totally inaccurate and wrong (yes, I've done my research too), but if you can separate that and just enjoy the book based on its impressive storytelling, then you will appreciate it more. BUT, if you decide to watch the movie first though, you will fail to appreciate the suspense and mystery factor involved in breaking the code..."
"KarisLOVER","4","1","2","9 July 2006"," So disappointing...
","""So dark the con of man."" The words of a dying man written on the Mona Lisa ring true for Da Vinci Code; I came out of the theater feeling like I had been conned into sitting through this mess of a film.<br/><br/>This movie follows a symbologist, a French cryptology expert, and a holy grail fanatic across Europe in a wild chase for truth. In good thriller fashion, they are pursued by a variety of colorful villains, such as an albino monk, a catholic sect famous for self mutilation, and half the French police force. Everything starts off with a gristly murder scene at the Louvre. World renowned symbology professor, Robert Langdon (possibly the most boring main character ever) is called in to evaluate this bizarre crime scene. What starts out as a long, albeit interesting episode of CSI, quickly turns into a tasteless thriller. I won't spoil any more of the plot, for those who have not yet seen this movie.<br/><br/>Unless you've been living in a remote cave for the past 2 years, you know that there is a huge amount of controversy surrounding The Da Vinci Code. One of the (many) failures of this film, is that everything seems like no big deal. They claim to reveal something that will shake the foundations of Christianity itself, but It never arrives. The director treats the subject matter as though he may offend someone. Well, guess what Ron? You have to ruffle some feathers to make amazing movies. It's just part of film-making. <br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code features one of the most star studded casts in recent memory. Sadly, almost no one delivers. What could have been an interesting and thought-provoking performance from Tom Hanks, comes out wooden and just plain bad. The delivery of half his lines is pitiful. Alfred Molina, who is always a safe bet, is awful as Opus Dei founder Bishop Aringosa. He portrays him with a ferocity that is not present in the book, and there's a reason for that. Paul Bettany and Audrey Tautou both show hints of promise, but overall are mediocre. Ian McKellen is the one bright spot here. He shines, despite the terrible dialog written for his character.<br/><br/>What really bothered me about The Da Vinci Code is this: The entire film is a tease. Everything in the movie hints of greatness, but everything also falls far short of it. Ian McKellen's performance shows us what all the actors should have done. Several sequences in the movie, (namely the flogging sequence with Silus) display Ron Howard's prowess as a director. The book hints at how amazing and controversial the script would have been, if the director had grown some balls. But all of these moments, last for about 30 seconds each. Instead, we are treated to a cookie-cutter thriller that isn't good. Ultimately, this movie fails on three fronts.<br/><br/>1: It fails as the intelligent mind trip which it so desperately wants to be.<br/><br/>2: It fails as the lightning fast page turner which the book is.<br/><br/>And 3: It fails as the summer blockbuster thriller, which it disappointingly becomes"
"maatmouse","5","1","2","8 July 2006"," The Da Vinci Code - an okay piece of fiction
","With all the fuss made about the book's so called revelations and now the film pro porting to bang around fiction as if it's the truth, its a wonder that TDVC was ever made at all.<br/><br/>Firstly, the Catholic Church need not worry their heads about this one. Like the book, its a slightly hamfisted action movie with a bit more talking than action and the script is tedious. Tom Hanks doesn't quite convince as Robert Langdon, a role that in my opinion could have gone to Hugh Jackman with little trouble and Audrey Tautou is okay as Sophie Nouveau trying to make some sense of the situation she finds herself in. The other characters are quite flat. Only Ian McKellen comes out with any credibility and he is only playing the nice Englishman turned nasty he played in Gods and Monsters. Paul Bettany is little more than a scary looking monk who ends up being pitied rather more than booed for having to do the dirty work of his 'saviour'. Other people in this film, like Jean Reno are sleepacting or simply in it to pay the mortgage.<br/><br/>A not terribly good book made into a barely interesting film."
"bessy_dacow","5","1","2","7 July 2006"," a man is murdered and it leads to many mysteries
","The Da Vinci code in my opinion is not a good movie because it lacks mystery. The performances by some of the actors are horrible and the movie is quite unbearable since u work out half of the story before the movie is over. For me the only thing that makes it bearable is that fantastic performance by Ian Mckellen who entertains u a lot. The movie is not, for those who have read the book, very true to it and for those who have not read the book it can be sometimes hard to understand because the way it is put in the movie does not make sense or is not explained well. The Performance by Audrey Tautou is not very good and she is not convincing at all though it might be hard for her to act in English. Yet the movie is entertaining because of the things is claims which leave u think whether it is plausible or not."

"alanhaworth-1","9","1","2","29 June 2006"," A 98% faithful-to-the-book film adaptation
","As one who thoroughly enjoyed Dan Brown's novel, I was both excited and hesitant, as I entered the cinema, on my first of three viewings. How often do the screen versions of books disappoint? Far too often. But Ron Howard is a credible guy (who wouldn't trust Ritchie Cunningham?), so hopefully he will have seen the need to leave the story ""as is"". Remarkably Howard has almost pulled off the exact replication of the book on the screen in this masterpiece. Time prevented some of the detail (which begs the question ... Do those who have not read the book, follow the plot easily, if at all?). The tampering with the book's ending has added some (unnecessary, I believe) ""Hollywood Corn"" to the events in Scotland, but we can overlook this when considering the ""whole package"". In its entirety the film literally ""blew me away"". How many times had I almost convinced myself prior to seeing the film, that Tom Hanks is not how I imagine Robert Langdon? How soon after the film begun did I realise Tom Hanks is perfect as Langdon (hope he signs on for ""Angels and Demons"")? Sir Ian is everything Teebing should be, and deserves the Supporting Actor Award for this performance. The production has a majestic quality about it. Every scene a work of pure cinematic art. Howard will also hopefully return to direct ""Angel and Demons"" - he can be trusted! If you are open-minded, and enjoy a thought provoking plot, then this is a ""must see"". If you are troubled by challenges to religious doctrine and beliefs, then perhaps this is a film you avoid."
"mv-angel","9","1","2","28 June 2006"," A great movie indeed!
","This is the first time I remember seeing a movie that was BETTER than the book! Yes indeed I will repeat my statement saying that the movie was better than the book. Here are my arguments:<br/><br/>1. The movie was straight to the point, while the book was too diluted with additional story lines and details. For example: the missing brother in the movie. Or the Mickey Mouse watch. It is completely irrelevant to the story. Some may say it is not like in the book, but such story line was not needed anyways 2. The movie achieved much better interpretation of the main story of the book: The the holy grail being the secret identity of Jesus and his family. Some may argue that imagination is more powerful than the real pictures and text used in the movie, but they were used in so good fashion that it is completely working for me. 3. The actors WERE good. I did not like initially Audrey Tautou but at the end somehow she was in place already. 4. The cinematography and screen play were splendid. There was not a single wasted moment or shot in the movie. The script was more punctual and precise than the book.<br/><br/>As a summary, what else do you need? You have good actors, great screenplay, great cinematography all bundled up in a highly enjoyable 149 minutes of non-stop entertainment. The reality of the facts presented in the story is not under discussion here, bus as a pure entertainment and adapted screen play, I have not actually seen a better one so far.<br/><br/>Enjoy Mike"
"georgina-elizondo","6","1","2","27 June 2006"," Is good but.
","The movie is goodie, but I think its just a medium value. My Mom love it and told me, if I can go with her to see the movie again. I saw it once and well, if they (the producers, writers and directors) want to tell all the people about how bad is the elite power of church, they don't have to include things from Jesus Christ. Is like they want to make a bad testimony with science fiction and magic. I think it doesn't matter if Jesus loved a woman,because one man that recognized the power of women since then, was him, but from that, than to say he and Mary Magdalene, had children together, was not a good thing for the believers, because it could offended many people. The whole story need to be more polished, more deep in its meanings, to indicate precisely what they want to criticized. If they want to tell bad things about Opus Dei, they have to be more clear in their assumptions, and leave Jesus Christ's philosophy alone."

My point is, from this we could conclude that you'll either love it or hate it. Wrong! Now that I've seen the movie, I must say that I found the story interesting but nothing more. I thing that all those headlines like Shaking of foundations of Christianity"" are stupid. If you are a religious man and you believe what the Church says, then no book or movie can make you feel other. If it can, then you are a complete idiot. This movie has a great story and... that is pretty much it. Too bad that a great actor like Tom Hanks who was in so many wonderful movies like Forrest Gump"", Cast Away"", The Terminal"" and probably in one of the best movies in the history of Hollywood, The Green Mile"", didn't put in a better performance than this. I won't recommend it because I think there so many top quality movies to recommend, and this is not one of them. However I won't say it is bad or anything like that, I'll just say that you should go and watch it if you don't have high expectations."
"MichaelMargetis","4","1","2","20 June 2006"," ""So Dark the Con of Man...."" - Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks)
","Dan Brown's controversial religious fiction is one of the highest selling novels of all time. If you ask almost any one of my family members or friends they will tell you it was an amazing book, but having not read it myself (cmon, I hate to friggin' read) I couldn't say whether it was actually better than the movie. Well, I hope so, but even more, I hope the book was more plausible and well, more...interesting and entertaining. It would be one thing if 'Da Vinci Code' was just unbelievable and made huge borderline idiotic conclusions based solely on a painting from Leonardo Da Vinci, but 'Da Vinci Code' makes those leaps and it is pretty damn boring. At 149 minutes, the 'Da Vinci Code' constantly drags, and will have you constantly glancing at your watch saying to yourself, ""My God! When the f&*& is it going to end?!""<br/><br/>The plot follows a murder in the Lourve Museum, by a crazed albino Opus Dei priest (Paul Bettany). Supposedly, the Albino priest killed someone in order to secure a secret held by that order of the Catholic Church that is worth killing for. Tom Hanks is college professor brought in by the chief of police (Jean Reno) to investigate the crime, and realizes that the chief of police is working with Opus Dei and the only person he can trust is Audrey Tatou, a young spit-fire detective who for some reason knows the answer to everything. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou travel around trying to release the secret to the world and trouble ensues, and along the way they get help from....you guessed it....Gandalf himself.....Sir Ian McKellan who seems more interested in bickering about tea than the secret itself. What will happen in the end? I think by that time most of the audience will be asleep.<br/><br/>Finally the day I dreaded has arrived -- the day Ron Howard made a flop. After great efforts like Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man, hell even Ransom, Howard has finally released a movie that in more words than one sucks ass. It isn't that Howard's direction is bad, in fact it's one of the best parts of the movie, it's just that it goes to waste in a film like this. Akiva Goldsman, Academy Award Winning screenwriter of A Beautiful Mind, provides a screenplay that could have been written by an eleven year old kid with A.D.D., it's jumpy, annoying and in some parts leaves big holes. The acting is also pretty disappointing. Tom Hanks provides us with his first bleak performance, while Audrey Tatou who I praised for her amazing work in 'Amelie' really gives perhaps one of the worst female screen performances of the last twenty-five years. She is just plain awful, and I was so shocked seeing as though she was so excellent in 'Amelie'. I came to the conclusion it was probably because she was acting in English and not French. I might not be that good if I acted in German. Ian McKellan is good but he seems like he phoned it in, and Alfred Molina does his best with a small role. The only actor who seems like he gives it his all is Paul Bettany, who in every scene steals it from those around him. Kudos to Bettany who even when acting in a lackluster film, gives it his all.<br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Da Vinci Code' disappointed the hell out of me. I expected it to be very good, but it just flopped. It was Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, Audrey Tatou, Ian McKellan and Akiva Goldsman's worst work, which is a pretty bold thing to say, but I truly believe it. The only high point of the film is Paul Bettany, honestly, he should receive a freakin' medal or something for being the only person involved with this movie who didn't have his head up his ass. For religious fanatics who are worried the film who encourage Christians to lose their faith, I say don't worry. People coming out of the movie won't question their faith as much as Ron Howard's artistic integrity.Grade: C- (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, AZ, 5/19/06)"

My wife thoroughly enjoyed the movie, although not as much as she enjoyed the book. I am not a religious person and really I thought it was dragged out quite a bit. I like the acting performances of Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou who I had not seen before this film, but the outstanding job done by Ian Mc Kellen was just great. I also liked the acting job done by Paul Bettany. My advice is go see it if you like religious picture but skip it if you do not."

","The Da Vinci Code.....A secret maintained by Leonardo Davinci from the world. But the Government of the place where I live also wanted to maintain the movie a secret by banning it. My country is the world's biggest SECULAR country, and the state where I live is an epitome of it. But, the state government has banned this movie...after almost whole of its educated population read the book, religiously. So, I had to travel almost 600Km shelling some Rs.2000 to catch this movie, just to feel the spark of independence. I hate anything that is controlled by someone.<br/><br/>I expected a lot from the movie. And mostly I got what I expected. Ron Howard excelled in what he does. Some scenes were exceptionally handled on the celluloid. And there is nothing I can say about the Oscar nominated(and also won..twice) actors. Sir Ian McKealan, Audry and Tom Hanks did what they are expected of....But, the surprise is Paul Bettany. He was one villain that is going to haunt me for quite some time. Very convincing performance in the role of Silas.<br/><br/>If I had to say some bad things about the movie, then it would be the time. I enjoyed this story in the form of a book more than a movie. The book builds the tension of the plot over a period of your reading it...say 4 to 5 days for me. All that tension and whatever other feelings are shown in three hours. But a movie can't be longer, you know...Mixed feelings about the movie.<br/><br/>I think this movie will be more enjoyed by those who didn't read the book. But, there is a chance of not understanding it completely.<br/><br/>On the whole, ""The code"" is a fiction and that is all. When everybody knows that it is a fiction, why to make a big scene out of it, by banning it. When the movie is working fine at cinemas in Rome City, why/how the hell it would hurt people elsewhere on religious grounds? Since when are better Christians living here in India? Any ways, I don't want to give a political tag for this issue now..<br/><br/>My rating for the movie is 8."

","When I read the book, it was filled with excitement and I could not put it down without wanting more. I read the book in a weekend.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie does not hold the same excitement, in fact the first hour is quite boring.<br/><br/>As I read the book I made notes about who I thought should play the lead role. Tom Hanks did not appear in my notes. In fact there are two people who appeared in ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" who would have made much better choices.<br/><br/>The choices of shooting locations were excellent.<br/><br/>The casting for Fache was perfect.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks will not look back on this film as a highlight of his career."

","The acting is EXCELLENT! Exceptionally well cast! The screen play sucked. Why did they say that Saunier wasn't her grandfather? What about her brother? I can understand leaving out threads so the film isn't five hours long, but why alter the book for no reason? Tom Hanks is a brilliantly understated Langdon, and Audrey Tattou is perfect, but again the screen play limits their characters. I attended this movie with someone who hadn't read the book, and they were lost. You cant follow this movie if you didn't read the book, and if you did read the book, you were angry at the changes, particularly the end at Roslyn, and the shortening of the Vatican theme and the changes to the Fache character."
"Ainull_seepage","8","1","2","9 June 2006"," Great Mystery Movie
","After watching the first ten minutes of the movie I could already tell I would enjoy it. I am a big fan of murder mysteries, and mysteries in general. I have never read the book. Personally I got along with the movie great without reading the novel. I went into the film open minded and not ready to pounce on what's fact or fiction. I went into the movie believing Jesus did not wed Mary, and I came out feeling that Jesus did not wed Mary. I think people are reading a little too much into all that stuff. I never felt the movie was pushing anything onto the viewer. Like showing it all to be actual facts and history. By the end one of the main characters Robert Langdon quotes, ""Decide for yourself."" Overall, great mystery movie. Great thriller. Awesome summer popcorn movie. 8/10"
"jaccjl","Null","1","2","9 June 2006"," Loved the book - Movie disappointed
","I thought the actors did an absolutely wonderful job in their roles, I absolutely love Paul Bettany and I completely lost him as he became the character of Silas. (It impresses me when I can completely lose an actor in a film, and see only the character instead of the actor.) The others did a wonderful job in their respective roles as well, the acting itself gets 10 stars from me, I have no complaints there whatsoever. Having recently devoured the book in just a little over a day, the movie as a whole just didn't work for me though. I believe this is primarily because there were so many, many discrepancies between the book and the movie. At times it was like a completely different story was being told on the screen from the one I'd read in the book. I had a difficult time enjoying the movie because the differences were so glaringly obvious to me - some little, some absolutely huge. I understand that often things are changed here and there to make a movie fit into the time they have available to them, or to make it work better, but I just found the changes to be too much to do the book any sort of justice. On the other hand, my husband, who has not yet read the book, thoroughly enjoyed the movie. He said for him it was similar to National Treasure, a movie he loved. When The Da Vinci Code first opened I'd heard them say on the radio that the movie couldn't possibly live up to all the hype, but that if you went into it with no expectations you'd enjoy the movie version of the story. Apparently I went in expecting it to be too similar to the book, without that expectation perhaps it would have been more enjoyable for me. If it were a standalone movie I think I would have enjoyed it a great deal more because what ruined it for me were the changes to the storyline. From our experience it seems it would be best to watch the movie first if possible, then read the book afterward to learn the details. Either that, or if you've read the book already, be prepared that the movie isn't quite the same story as the one told in the book. I certainly didn't absolutely hate the movie, and would like to watch it again now that I'm prepared for all the changes to the storyline."
"sunshine_daydream42","6","1","2","7 June 2006"," Overall, it was entertaining....
","i thought that the film was an accurate adaptation of the book, but it seemed a bit slow in places whereas the novel was extremely fast-paced. part of what kept me interested was Ian McKellen's amazing performance as Sir Leigh Teabing. of the many movies he has acted in, i found this to be one of his best. the opposite could be said about Tom Hanks. although it was not a challenging role to begin with, he made the character of Langdon seem like a bland, expressionless figurehead. part of the reason i found the movie boring at many points is because Hanks did nothing to evoke a response with the viewers. Overall, the film was just an interesting action/adventure thriller. Ian McKellen salvaged what would have been a mediocre movie, and seemed to make the muddled plot and random twists make sense in the end."

","went to see the movie, yeah even though I had read the book. I must say I regret buying the book. The plot was interesting, the claims scandalous and the symbolism emphatic, but the style of writing was cheesy. I personally preferred 'Angels & Demons' by Dan Brown, it was a very well constructed thriller. Da Vinci code, could hardly match it's page-turning quality, in-fact I felt it was written by someone who has lost the zeal for writing. The movie however, was a whole new affair. I went to see the movie only and only because of Tom Hanks. The movie, I found, improvised on the book a good deal, in some cases changing certain portions of the plot (Ref: The drawing room scene where Sophie is supposed to hide the cryptex, The scene where the Priory of Sion members come to meet Sophie, The scene about Sophie recalling her grandfather performing the rituals, the rituals were more elaborately depicted in the book, The scene where the Teacher kills the butler etc. etc.). But I think these alterations, for the most part did not rob the movie of it's charm but could have added more mystique to the plot. Tom Hanks, acted his part, yes I hated his hair-style, and I'd have to say this wasn't one of Hank's greatest acting jobs, though to be fair to him, he could only do what the script allowed, and Dan Brown certainly needs to give Robert Langdon a persona-rehash. All in all, I'd say watch it before you criticize the movie. Was it worth the money spent on a ticket? I wouldn't know - I got two complimentary ones. Here's an idea - how about an Angels & Demons movie? P.S. Ron Howard could have done a heck of a better job by getting a better Sophie, what was he thinking?"

","Interesting position I find myself in trying to honestly review this movie, really enjoyed it, but came away empty, looking to be fulfilled so much more.<br/><br/>Thought the casting was fine, cept, for the life of me,I have a hard time with Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. Viggo, Hugh, Russell, even Paul Bettany, (as brilliantly as he portrayed Silas), I would have envisioned more impactive as Langdon, than Hanks.<br/><br/>Major problem was the constant breaks in the action to revert to flashbacks for the sake of historical significance. Really the only way to accomplish this on film, but it did have a tendency to slow down, and murk up the feeling of suspense. Also, the chemistry was a stretch between Hanks and Tautou. Still, all of the pieces still fit all together, making an enjoyable movie viewing experience, whether you have read the book or not.<br/><br/>Thought the soundtrack was haunting and beautiful, and Howard's cinematic eye was right on target as far as the filming was concerned.<br/><br/>Never really a fair comparison, book to movie, but I expected sooo much more. Have fun deciphering the summary line."
"bradtothebone","6","1","2","5 June 2006"," Don't waste your money/time if you've read the book.
","And if you haven't read the book, do it instead of the movie. The movie builds suspense by hiding events and revealing them after the climactic event (when the book would have revealed more of these events in real time). This isn't true for the entire movie, but I did notice how the movie compresses a lot of the story. This was a highly anticipated movie, and I left the theater a bit disappointed. To the directors credit, I would say that a lot of the scenes appeared on the screen disturbingly similar to the way I perceived them while reading the book. The movie was entertaining, but I would be interested to know how someone perceives the book after having watched the movie first."

","I really and truly don't get it. What is it about this film that is causing any controversy or entertaining any of the poor viewers who are paying hard earned money for the privilege of seeing it? I've read the book (simplistic writing at best - nice idea though) and the film doesn't have a patch on it. And that's saying something.<br/><br/>First of all, Hanks as Langdon. Watch the film - does he really have any reason for being there? And the lovely Audrey Tatou - a visual treat but again, I felt there was no purpose behind her character (quite ironic considering the outcome of the FICTIONAL story). The only reason this film gets a rating from me at all is for the stellar turns from both Bettany and Sir Ian, without whom we would be left with a series of overly-dramatic flashbacks and cold chemistry. Oh, and Reno's two-dimensional Fache...please....<br/><br/>Of course, I knew with Ron Howard at the helm, there was likely to be some schmaltz and characteristic 'niceness' about the proceedings and I wasn't disappointed. It was a mediocre film and that, in my opinion, is worse than it being a bad film.<br/><br/>I know that this review reads quite harshly, but I do feel it is justified. Any of the 'controversy' is so heavily watered down that the church comes out almost totally blameless - instead, they were cruelly tricked by Teabing, for he is the true villain (add your own maniacal laughter here) who has confused and mislead the ministers and various sidekicks along the way. And what happened to Aringarosa?? When did he become a bit part? I spent most of my time at the cinema fidgeting in my seat, waiting to be engaged, either by the story-telling or the characterisation. Sadly, apart from all-too-sparse occasions, I was sorely disappointed."

","I will not comment on the subject developed by the book, then the movie, and which was supposed ""to shake the foundations of Christianity"". I will just say that I like very much the book, quite convincing, but I find the movie not as credible and the people who recommended its interdiction or boycott, should not fear the consequences of this film. I would prefer to comment on the cinematographic aspect: <br/><br/><ul><li>The picture is very disappointing: in spite of a few good settings, it is generally dark, messy with ill-chosen close-ups, lack of general view describing the action, etc,... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The direction probably constricted by the will to respect strictly the book, and to avoid further critics on the subject, is rather dull, sometimes awkward, never even slightly close to any nomination for any award. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tom Hanks, an excellent actor, in every movie, looks stiff, distant, unconcerned. Audrey Tautou brings some life, an Paul Bettany and Jean Reno are very good, but the excellency goes to Sir Ian MacKellen definitely.

","See... that's the problem with reading a book which gets you so hooked you go to bed at 3:30AM only because you HAVE to be at work full throttle at 7am... you read it, you see it in your head, the movie becomes uninteresting because it left our parts you liked in the book.<br/><br/>I have to give Akiva Goldsman (screenplay) some credit... the concept of overlapping images to refer to situations on the book was nice, and some of those even looked like the one I saw in my head as I was reading the book, so, yea... it was nice to see that I was not far off Dan Brown's objective of being as explicit as possible for the reader to be able to look through Langdon's-Teabing's-Neveu's eyes, but it provided no new entertainment.<br/><br/>My wife whom had not read the book thought that the movie made her think, but that Hank's performance was the seen-before type, not mediocre, but certainly not innovative. I was expecting to see a more suave Langdon, as Brown portrays a highly-sought out bachelor.<br/><br/>Spoiler (?) Sir Ian McKellen's performance as expected, yet Goldsman's version of Teabing was not as fun-to-meet as Brown's, leaving McKellen not much to work with.<br/><br/>Howard's work was great, -big ""Directed by Ron Howard"" fan here, but the book has been read by SO many people that creativity for improvement allowed limited space for Howard's own version, as it is customary to be done by movie directors who like boos and 'translate' them into film. Why you ask? Because no matter how he came up with his own version, movie goers who read the book would have eaten him alive; what people wanted to do was see the book on the screen, and that pretty much leaves no room for a director's version of the story Spoilers: Although I did not like it, because of the way the movie was presented, there was basically no other ending BUT the one Howard went for, yet it was a little too pink. In all fairness, I do admit that the book's finale was a little too pretentious... you know, a French, white Beyoncé-type, gifted code breaker named Sophie Neveu offers Langdon a museum-less, church-less, tomb-less, art-less, relic-less week in Florence after learning that she is a Jesus-descendant... a little too the-good-guy-always-gets-the-girl, don't you think? If you have the $$$ for the movie ticket, you can probably afford the soft-cover version of the novel, so the choice is really yours.<br/><br/>Bottom line? Read the book instead, but if you are not going to read the book, watch the movie so you don't feel left out of the loop at lunch time chat."
"gazzo-2","6","1","2","3 June 2006"," Interesting movie, okay but not great.
","This thing goes too long, you wind up wondering just who the redhaired bank guy was working for, and the 'escapes' were really kinda SAD. Slow motion in a truck time-Again! What, time-lapse car chases not good enough for you Gazzo? Ummm...no.<br/><br/>The movie itself? Interesting concepts, great scenery, decent cast, bad writing, some miscasting too. What happened to Tom Hanks here? They might as well've hired Michael Keaton or Dan Ayckroyd to play this role. He just contributed Nada to it. The little brunette was cute but you wondered if she knew what was going on, too. Ian McKellan was a hoot, Gandalf again doing his thing. Our albino guy from 'A Beautiful Mind' well, he just sorta shows up and kills people. Seemed to be a nervous wreck. And what was Doc Ock doing in this? His role seems to be cut right down, he's a fine talent but given little to do and winds up being rather shunted aside towards the end too. Ditto Jean Reno. He came off as being a schmuck that turns 'good' late. Hmmmm okay.<br/><br/>From this you might think I hated it. No no no no no. I enjoyed the flashbacks to the first Crusade, Isaac Newton's funeral, Constantine, etc. That stuff was all good. I liked watching them shuffle along the consipiracy w/ Kings, scientists and the like all being in on the act. It was kinda cool to try and follow the conspiracy threads too and see which character was really on whose side. It wasn't always easy to tell.<br/><br/>Here's the problem. As a longtime Byzantine history nut, I can tell you that the central premise-Constantine waved his magic wand and Voila the Catholic Church buried Magdalene/Mrs Christ into oblivion-that's bogus in the extreme. Constantine Was a Christian for a good chunk of his life. He had no more ability to force church doctrine then than John Paul II could. Buying into such obscure legends ala Mary M being his wife, their kid coming w/ her to France, winding up somehow tracing lineage in an illiterate society for centuries, then marrying into the inbred, short-lived, fueding goober Merovingians--this just doesn't add up. Why not believe St Thomas personally sailed to India and started a church there? Or Andrew to Scotland? Paul to Portugal? What of the Veronoica Cloth? What of the Byzantines and their mountains of relics thru the ages? What of the early church fathers ala Iraneus and Origen who pre-dated Nicea by over 100 years each and clearly wrote of Christ's divinity etc? Selective cherry picking of certain apocrypia of being 'true' and dumping everything else is just as bad, seems to me, as being a fundamentalist and buying into the Bible w/out a shred of modern perspective. It just doesn't wash.<br/><br/>I also found the whole 'Templers found 1000 year old relics and got rich that way' to be silly. Really? The First Crusade happened due to the Byzantines losing a Gettysburg like battle in the far eastern range of their Empire to the Seljuks at Manzikert, in 1071. THAT scared the crap outta Europe. THAT is what freed up the church to divert these nobles, knights and petty barons eastwards to chase after land, money, trade rights and of course, salvation. NOT some hair brained 'dig up the tomb of Mary M.' wild good chase.<br/><br/>Anyways. I've skipped talking about the movie itself. It does what it sets out to, but then has three endings, goes on a half hour too long, and loses interest on the way. Ron Howard was a director for hire here and while he does what he was hired for, you kinda think Oliver Stone or even Michael Bay(!!) would have been better choices.<br/><br/>**1/2 for the flashbacks, scenes set in the Louvre etc. and just because."

","Ron Howard is one of the best directors in Hollywood at the moment. In this movie, he took one of the most popular modern books, and turned it into a faithful adaptation. Unfortunately for Ron, the book turned out to be not that good.<br/><br/>I biggest thing I have noticed with Dan Brown's work is that he tends to use a lot of false tension and false climaxes, something that does not transfer well into movies, unless the director uses the same cheap style. Ron Howard did not sink to those levels.<br/><br/>After all the bad mouthing about Tom Hanks, he did do a good job of portraying Robert Langdon. He transformed himself well into the role. The standouts in the cast, though, were Ian McKellan (Teabing) and Paul Bettany (Silas). McKellan stole the scene every time, and played up Teabing's eccentric side, while Bettany showed the pain that Silas has.<br/><br/>Kudos to the makers for keeping the foreign languages in, as too many American movies simplify so that everyone speaks English. Good work from Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno.<br/><br/>I still remember the discussion in Project Greenlight Australia, when discussing which script to pick. You can't make a good movie with a bad story. I think that sums up The Da Vinci Code."

It was almost exactly like the book, and it was almost everything I envisioned as I was reading. The one problem was, I felt that if you did not know the history of Opus Dei then you would have a hard time understanding Silas' plight, as well as the Capt. and the Bishop. If there was a way to explain the passion Opus Dei had for keeping the secrets of the church better (w/o adding more time to the movie, it would be a benefit to the movie. I could see how some would say it was a little long and somewhat anti climatic, but that is what I thought of the book. My expectations were right on.

I sat on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. The performances were entirely believable, the tension was palpable, the chase scenes heart-stopping, and the big brotherly affection from Robert Langdon (Hanks) toward Sophie Neveu (Tatou) was touching.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a seasoned actor and it is thrilling to see him at the top of his game - again! His genius shows, such as the scene when he was in the back of the van and freaking out in a restrained/constrained way. The viewer could feel his inner panic. Jean Reno should win an award for the intensity of his performance; it is great to see an actor of his calibre in a film such as this. Furthermore, this may be the best film that Ron Howard has ever so lovingly and passionately made.<br/><br/>Of course, the book is a work of ""fiction,"" but I believe that the reason so many people are upset by the book and now reacting against this film is that it may contain more than a grain of truth.

","If you like Indiana Jones style plot devices such as puzzle solving to find clues, you'll enjoy this flick. There were many twists and turns and a major revelation about the Christian church that would have floored most viewers had they lived in a cave when the book was released or during all the hype surrounding the release of the movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion, all the hype, protests, and TV specials describing what all the hype and protests were about gave away too much of the film's plot. Had this not been the case, I probably would have rated this film a little higher.<br/><br/>I've watched this film get beat up by professional critics and just don't understand why they were so harsh. No this wasn't one of Tom Hanks' best characters, and it probably wasn't one of Ron Howard's best efforts, but if your a fan of the novel, you'll be happy that Tom Hanks played the character ""to the tee"" and Ron followed the plot line of the novel very closely. This film did not deserve many of the 1 out 5 star ratings I have seen.<br/><br/>Although some of the suspense was lost on me, having read the novel, I still found the twists and turns exciting. Sometimes I knew what to expect next, but there was a thrill in seeing what I visualized when I read the novel actually happening on screen very much as how I had imagined them.<br/><br/>On that same note, I was amazed to see that Dan's Browns descriptions of locations and settings in the novel gave me a very incredible and near exact visual images of how these same locations appeared on screen, and that is to say in real life. I've never been to the Louvre or to the Temple Church in London, but when I saw the scenes on screen in these locations, they were exactly as I had pictured them.<br/><br/>The same held true for many of the characters, save for Robert Langdon. I did not picture Tom Hanks as this character at all. However, after the first scene, I found that he was in fact a good fit for the character.<br/><br/>I noticed quite a few people in the theater, probably those who had not read the novel, cringing and cowering in many suspenseful scenes and eerie depictions of a self-flagellation ritual performed by Silas, the devout Opus Dei disciple played by Paul Bettany. The suspense was effective, and Paul shined in what may seem to most as very far from any character he has ever played.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good film. If your the ""wait for the DVD"" types, this is one you should not wait for. Go see it in the theater."
"dfi-1","6","1","2","2 June 2006"," Over hyped book leads to over hyped film
","Let me start by saying this... I have not read the book. This review is on the merits of this work as a film alone. Now that we have gotten that business over with, let us begin.<br/><br/>This is a mediocre film at best that has been over hyped by the media in an effort to sell news papers and get you to watch the 11:00 evening news. I am a fan of both Howard and Hanks and the work they have done together so far has been exemplary. If you enter the theater looking for an excuse to dislike the film, you will find plenty of reasons. If you enter looking for a reason to praise the film, there are a few. Let's break it down...<br/><br/>Story: Suspension of disbelief is required in abundant amounts for this predictable story full of convenient coincidences, character arcs, and repetitive dialog and imagery intended to drive the point into you over and over until you feel as if you're being hit in the head with a hammer. While I can not speak to the content of the original book, I can not assume that all these obvious flaws are limited to the film alone.<br/><br/>Directing and Cinematography: On the technical elements of the film, it is a decent body of work. The lighting, camera position, movement of the actors through each scene; they are all executed well by capable hands. Each scene evokes the expected emotion giving you the excitement of a treasure hunt, the thrill of a chase, and the intrigue of a mystery. Well done Mr. Howard.<br/><br/>Acting: It is hard to find flaw with Tom Hank's work but in this film he comes across as a little too charismatic for the bookworm he is supposed to portray. Audrey Tautou does a fine job given the script she was handed but most of the flaws there have to do with her character not with her as an actor.<br/><br/>Supporting Characters: This is where the film falls apart. The supporting characters are often two dimensional and stray from their spine. What I mean to say is each character as they are introduced is given a spine that defines them. The spine tells you who they are and what their motivation is. When the character does something, you can read from their spine WHY they would do such a thing. In this film the supporting characters often deviate from their spine simply to drive the plot. Without revealing any spoilers, as you watch the film, look specifically at the characters of Captain Fache and André Vernet.<br/><br/>Finally the Media: The media has hyped the book and the film to the point of idolization just so they can knock it off its virtual pedestal in order to drive sales and to get you to watch the late night news. These reports about protesters and boycotts and other such antics are just a means for them to capitalize on the hype they have created. Oh, and by the way, it takes a special brand of idiot to think ANY of this fictional work is real.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, as a film I give this a 6 out of 10 vote. If you are looking for some entertainment and don't care much for some annoying plot holes or character flaws, by all means see this film. If you are a connoisseur of fine film and you are looking for a thought provoking story of good, evil, love, and redemption; I must recommend you rent Road to Perdition instead. It is by far the best work Tom Hanks has ever done."

","This is a must-see movie for anyone who likes mysteries, especially those involving thought provoking religious themes. While the book itself is a work of fiction, the story contains enough real elements to make the whole idea plausible.<br/><br/>Ron Howard did a terrific job in bringing the very complex plot to the screen, and the actors' performances only add to the enjoyment of this fast-paced movie. The time just flew by. Reading the book before seeing the movie is highly recommended, but not a necessity since things are clarified as the story progresses. Every actor was very well chosen, and the locations were all exactly as in the book. Unlike so many other movies that do not live up to the book, the Da Vinci Code meets or exceeds expectations."
"leanne_lane","6","1","2","1 June 2006"," Didn't quite capture the magic!
","In my very humble opinion, I think in general terms Ron Howard did a very good job of this screen adaptation. I never looked at my watch, plus the quality of the cast and use of the Louvre gave it a credible feel. However, there were a number of disappointing elements. Firstly - the entire film lacked the pace of the novel. The book reads like an episode of 24, however the film sadly didn't capture it as it was bordering the boring line. Secondly - there was absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between Robert Langdon and Sophie as described in the book, particularly at the end when the film was altered to fit the no chemistry factor. Audrey Tatou was a bit of a cold fish in this as well which was rather disappointing. Thirdly - what was with those special effects in and around Westminster Abbey?!?! That gave the whole film a completely unrealistic feel to it and brought the credibility of the film down several notches.<br/><br/>I also believe Tom Hanks didn't shine as he normally does in his films as the other cast members ie. Sir Ian McKellan, Jean Reno and Paul Bettany, were absolutely superb and such strong characters in the film that it took the limelight off him a little bit... another difference from the book to the film. I don't mean to be taking away his acting skills at all, just that the others were just as good.<br/><br/>Will be interesting to see how they go with Angels and Demons as I believe that was the better book of the two."

","What is the problem with everyone and this book/film? No-one has a good word to say about either, and I'm puzzled because I enjoyed 'em both! Okay, so they're not great literature - but I personally don't know many people who read Shakespeare in bed at night or go to see filmed stage versions of Hamlet and the like, although I've no problem with those who do. It's horses for courses and we don't all have to like the same things! I would say, I also noticed the arm thing but it was a trivial hiccough in an otherwise beautifully filmed and reasonably acted bit of entertainment. Langdon is an academic, not a special agent and I don't think there necessarily has to be a sexual chemistry between him and Sophie. To me, he came over as what he was; a staid academic thrown into a dangerous situation and trying to deal with it - I'd have been a bit off my best too! I thought the driving scenes were brill (...reminded me of me...) and I have to say Silas' self-chastisement made me physically shudder! Paul Bettany was at once a chilling religious psychopath and a damaged child (...which I feel could have been explained a bit more....). I do, however, feel that viewers who have read the book may enjoy it more than those who did not, as it is quite an involved plot to squeeze into a two hour film. I do normally sit there whispering 'that's not right - look at that - you wouldn't see one of those there...' etc. etc. but the fact that I was able to suspend this irritating trait for two hours tells me it wasn't that bad!"

","overall the movie was good, and when you haven't read the book you would like the story. i had just finish the book the day that i saw the movie, and almost every minute i noticed that there has been details changed according to the book. the changes were some little and some big. Some of those i could understand because of the time limit they had, but most of them were changed while in the same amount of time they could had shown the scene like in the book. an example is when Lt. collet approached langdon to take him to the Louvre. in the book this happens at night while langdon is asleep in his hotel room and get a phone call from the reception that someone likes to speak with him(this is collet). in the movie collet approached langdon while he is autographing his book after his presentation. the time they used for this scene was enough to do it like it is described in the book. more like this happens in the movie, which i cant use all now.<br/><br/>when you watch the movie without have read the book, you will like it. maybe there is 1 thing that can be disturbing, at least i did find disturbing, it was the speed of the story. every time they found a clue, they knew what it meant or solved it quick.<br/><br/>finally, for the ones who haven't seen the movie, go to the movie because its nice, but don't expect too much of it.<br/><br/>robin"
"eskdale56","7","1","2","31 May 2006"," True to the Book
","Follows the plot line of the book fairly close, and is generally a good ""who dunnit"". You will never guess who the murderer is--at least I didn't. The last portion of the film dealing with the St. Clair Chapel is where the movie gets a bit improbable. The underlying religious premise is questionable, but one does not need to believe it to find this movie worthwhile. The R.C.C. and Opus Dei don't come off too well in this movie--but I think they earned the portrayal they received--vicious, manipulative, stop-at-nothing types. Again, you don't have to accept this view of these organizations to find this movie worth the watch--you can merely accept them as the designated villains and that only some of the members of these organizations are vicious corrupt characters. In short, this movie can be watched at multiple levels, depending upon your own beliefs/biases. <br/><br/>There are some jarring scenes, including Silas' self-mortification and some of the murders--but what's a good ""who dunnit"" without some good murders? The violence and suggestions of violence are appropriate to the story. The shooting locations were excellent, the plot twists every bit as good as the book. Not sure why some critics panned it. I would say go watch the movie, form your own opinions and don't let any priest tell you what you should/should not watch. I would see it again."
"artiquels","5","1","2","31 May 2006"," A lot of noise about nothing
","I was looking forward to seeing this film specially as the Catholic church and other churchgoers were worried about the content.I wanted to see what the arguments were about. Well all I saw was a boring film with preposterous happenings and Ian Mckellen overdoing his part to a ridiculous extent. Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou et all fly to England and are greeted at the airport by approximately a dozen blaring police cars. No problem!! McKellen tells the detective in charge no one is with him and proceeds to London. No passports needed but then there is no immigration security either so anyone can go anywhere in this film including Hanks who seems to have an amazing knowledge of London and the English countryside. He goes all over the place even jumping on to a London bus which without having any English money is quite a feat. If I tried it I am sure I would get thrown off. The Albino monk is the best character in the film but maybe we are all at fault for thinking this film would live up to all the hype that was bandied around before it opened. The films best ally is the church who created so much free publicity about a lot of hokum !"
"freneevos","7","1","2","30 May 2006"," The DaVinci Code
","I read The DaVinci Code almost two years ago. I saw the movie on Saturday night at the drive-in. Tip number one: don't see it at the drive-in. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie. First let me say, I thought the casting was pretty damn good. Reading the book, I imagined Jean Reno as Bezu Fache, so I was pleased to hear he would be playing him. Also, while reading the book I imagined an older character for Aringarosa and I imagined a less feeble Teabing, for some reason. But personality-wise, Sir Ian McKellen and Alfred Molina were perfect. I also thought Audrey Tatou was a wise choice for Sophie. I couldn't think of any mainstream actress that could have played Sophie, but Tatou did wonderfully. Tom Hanks was good as Robert Langdon. I imagined a younger and more handsome Langdon, but nonetheless, Hanks did well. Not superb, as he has been in Forrest Gump and The Terminal. I even prefer the characters he plays in Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, but he did well. They stayed very true to the book. The only things lacking, and I know it's for time because the movie was long enough as it was, were that the book went a bit deeper. Also, while the movie was good, it didn't thrill me as the book did. Perhaps that is because I had read the book and they stayed so true to it I saw every step coming along the way. But when I read the book, I couldn't put it down."
"nicole-morath","8","1","2","30 May 2006"," A masterful tale despite the baggage
","When I saw ""The Da Vinci Code"", I concluded that it was a well structured, imaginative and quite inspiring movie. I have read the book numerous times, read its predecessor, ""The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail"", seen all the documentaries and had a well-rounded knowledge of the subject nature of the movie - before I went to see it. Ron Howard was actually quite masterful in the telling of this tale, as he had to live up to all the hype surrounding the build-up to the movie. He showed that he was willing to acknowledge the historical aspects of the movie, but made an effort to display the message with some use of computer graphics and the like. The medieval scenes that reenacted the search and discovery of the Holy Grail put actuality to my imagination, and Howard also put a good spin on the use of modern technology for the search for the Holy Grail - a mobile phone with the internet - to link the audience with what was happening in the plot of the movie. (It happens differently in the book.) I quite enjoyed Ian McKellen and Tom Hanks in the movie, as they both substantially stood up to their roles and played them to the best of their ability. The limitations ascribed to Audrey Tatou's role were her let-down, however, in the book the character of Sophie is much more substantial and strong as opposed to her mostly-clueless character in the movie. But, she is Audrey Tatou, and she is stunning, so I hope most of the limitations were because the director cut out her most profound moments simply because he couldn't find time. (Of course in the book, there were two more codex's, both of which Sophie solved, which were not in the movie - Langdon solves the only codex in the movie.) Now, lots of people bag this movie because of its controversial nature, historical inaccuracy, blasphemy against the Catholic Church, blah, blah, blah... What ever happened to just enjoying a good thriller? Which is really what the book and movie are all about - but it's good that people are finally sitting up and taking notice about such things! Overall, a very good adaptation of the novel, although some crucial aspects - including the romance between Langdon and Sophie and the revelation of Sophie's brother - were sorely missing from the movie. Women want romance at the end, Mr. Howard!!!!"
"rik_7","7","1","2","30 May 2006"," The Da Vinci Code Review
","Upon seeing the Da Vinci Code, I entered having read and enjoyed Dan Brown's successful novel. Whilst I knew the story line of the film, I was still expecting a good film to entertain me nevertheless. After watching the film I do not think it was as good as I expected. I think if you had not read the book it may have been more gripping, but for me I was never gripped as I was when reading the book.<br/><br/>I think the film on its own was still a good film that had good individual acting performances, in particular Paul Battany who played the character Silas. The two main chatracters played by Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou were also individually good however they lacked the chemistry together to make the audience get sucked into their characters' lives. I also think the film should have been made as it represents what all good films should be made for: making an audience think and leave the cinema pondering thoughts posed by the film. I think this film does this and on that front is thus successful, I left the cinema thinking and disscussing more the ideas put forward in the play.<br/><br/>On the whole I think the film was good but I expected it to be a little better. But that is expected for such a hyped film, where the audience enter thinking this will get 10/10 marks, but I give it 7/10."

I can understand that they eliminate some parts because was a long novel but I don't understand the changes that they made. <br/><br/>For me the best was the cinematography.Visually the movie was excellent!About the actor,what can I said?

If this secret has been hidden for thousands of years by some of the most brilliant people in history, why were they hidden by something comparable to a third-grader's scavenger hunt?<br/><br/>The whole thing was very lame and disjointed.

I never read the book, so I had few preconceived notions of what to expect. I am familiar with all the members of the cast from previous endeavors and enjoyed all of their performances. The backdrops of various cities were exceptional and in some instances, breathtaking. While I don't think that, as a director, Ron Howard will ever attain the skill level of someone like Alfred Hitchcock for this genre, he does a decent job here and displays a maturing of his style as a director. If you're concerned about spending $8.50 and then not liking this film and possibly feeling ripped off then see it at a matinée. Two hours of good entertainment for 5 bucks is a deal no matter how you cut it, and this IS good entertainment."

","The novel is just ""a prime specimen of masterful thriller writing"". Dan Brown's fiercely controversial action thriller about Jesus being married to Mary Magdalene, is somehow manufactured into a breathtaking, page-turning novel. The quality of entertainment that the book supplies is vastly reflected on the record number of sales of somewhat 60 million copies worldwide. <br/><br/>The film adaptation of Dan Brown's ultra-popular novel was placed in the able hands of Academy Award winning director Ron Howard.The formula worked. A good film was made. With an outstanding international cast that includes two time Oscar Winner Tom Hanks, French stars Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno,followed by elite Britishman Sir Ian McKellen and the uprising Paul Bettany who delivers a haunting performance and a minor role for Alfred Molina whose work is very impressive.<br/><br/>Faithful to the book, Howard has visualised a fine novel and made it into a fine film, recreating some historical scenes in a very stylised fashion."
"liekedons","6","1","2","28 May 2006"," Novel is far better than the movie
","Yesterday I finally saw a chance to go and watch the most discussed movie of this moment: The Da Vinci Code. After reading the book twice, hearing the great cast that would represent the main characters, and seeing the overwhelming trailers, I was so curious and full of expectations that nothing could spoil the screen version of this great book. <br/><br/>In a fully packed cinema I was able to conquer a nice seat somewhere in the middle of the hall. After watching dozens of commercials and trailers, the movie finally started. After the movie I left the cinema kind of unsatisfied. I think Audrey Tautou, Tom Hanks, Paul Bettany and Ian McKellan did a nice job playing the roles of Sophie, Robert Silas and Sir Leigh Teabing. They were just as I imagined them, reading the book. But what I really missed in the film was the excitement build up during some passages, greatly described in the book, but kind of neglected in the movie. For example, the excitement build up during the transportation of the cryptex, and discovering the cryptex hidden in the Bank of Zurich. In the movie, these things pass by in such a speed that there's is no time to build up any excitement. Also solving all the riddles left by Sauniere were solved so fast, that it's far from realistic. I also missed the emotional parts of Sophie and the relationship between her and her grandfather, especially when she was young. <br/><br/>The things I loved the most in the book were the little details most people never thought of: phi and its role in nature and the connection of Disney and his hidden messages about religion. They did not show up in the movie. But I know that when all these things would have been present in the movie, it will have a playing time of over 4 hours. For the people who want to go see the movie but did not read the book, I suggest them first to read the book, because I think they will have a great deal following the story. It's kind of hard to understand because of all the facts about ancient groups that pop up and pass by in a high speed. <br/><br/>Overall I think the book is far better than the movie, especially when you have great expectations. I think Ron Howard did not succeed in giving the movie the charms the book has got."
"pokerfjes","4","1","2","28 May 2006"," A sad day for adaptation.
","Today, I went to the movies to see this film. My anticipation was great, after having read the fantastic novel by Dan Brown. Just to be on the safe side, I would like to say that I enjoyed the book both as a thriller and as a book containing interesting questions. I like to ponder upon theology and philosophy, and history as well. As such, the book gets the mind racing.<br/><br/>But when it comes to the movie, I was utterly disappointed. Somehow, there's really not much that actually works in this movie. It lacks suspense, it lacks depth in characters (except maybe Silas), and it lacks performance. Tom Hanks really doesn't get a chance to show his ability to act, neither do any of the others. The only upside to the movie, was Paul Bettany, who shines in his portrait of Silas.<br/><br/>As for the story, plot lines and events; so much has been changed from the book that I actually got mad. Now, I understand of course, that changes must be made when adapting a novel onto the screen. But here, it just does not work. Not only does it not work, but it even confuses the spectator more, in my opinion. Characters are not only different from the book, but they have actually given them personalities I consider almost opposite of the book. And important events have been skipped, thrilling moments are lost, and secrets and facts have not been taken into the movie.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code in it's original book format, contains the suspense which has kept many people laying awake at night, because they just couldn't put the book down. They HAD to know what happened next. The movie, however, lacked any suspense at all.<br/><br/>In addition to all this, they have poured money into making flashy sequences of Templar Knights raiding Jerusalem etc., which I for the life of me cannot understand why. I mean, as Langdon explains the ""historical facts"", I don't see why it is necessary? Do people really need to ""see"" what happened instead of hearing about it? Directing and editing in this movie is poor, which again reflects upon acting. It's not that the actors can't act. I know Audrey Tatou is great, I know Tom Hanks is great, and the same goes for Jean Reno and Sir Ian McKellen. And I definitely know the basis for the film is great, since me and about 1 zillion others loved the book. So what happened? To sum it up, I think this has got to be one of the greatest misses in book-to-movie history. All the important things in the book are not really important in the movie. All the characters have been changed and are almost uninteresting. In addition, the directing and editing seems poor. I didn't even find the movie entertaining, even though I am easily entertained. And as is customary in reviews of films such as this, one has to ask if people who haven't read the book enjoyed the movie. Well, I don't think they will. And I don't think it's all the hype that has ruined it either. It is simply a poor movie.<br/><br/>So, my conclusion is this. For those that have read the book, don't waste money on seeing it, and keep the memories you have of the book. For those that have not read the book, save the money from the cinema ticket, and go buy the book instead. I promise, you will not regret it."
"girlygirl9127","4","1","2","28 May 2006"," Great book, disappointing film.
","I think you will enjoy this film if you have not read the book. I read it a few years ago when it came out and enjoyed it. This week I re-read the book so I could compare it to the movie a little better. It is not the best work of fiction in history but it is entertaining.<br/><br/>I have been looking forward to this movie since I found out it was going to be made. However, when I saw it this evening I was very disappointed. I feel like it didn't follow with the book as much as I would have liked. In my opinion the film is very loosely based on the book. With many, what I feel, important parts changed.<br/><br/>Robert Langdon didn't seem like the smart Harvard professor that he is. He wasn't offering up information in the same way he did in the book. Sophie Neveu also did not seem as smart as she should have been. With the book you really got the feeling that they were intelligent people who could follow the clues and solve the mystery. With the film I thought if these two can figure out the clues anyone can. It wouldn't take a Harvard professor or a cryptologist. You expect a higher intellect level from these people. Also, it was not the same give and take as in the book. It seemed Robert was solving all the clues himself. In the novel Robert would give a little, Sophie would give a little. It was a team effort with a good dynamic.<br/><br/>One of my main problems with the film is the way Robert thinks things through in his mind. It was reminiscent of the way Russell Crowe's character saw things in A Beautiful Mind. I'm not sure if this was done in an effort to save time, or to make Langdon seem smarter.<br/><br/>I saw this film with a friend who has never read the book. When the credits began she immediately said she thought it was one of the best movies she had ever seen. With that impression of it she still had a few negative things to say. She felt that there was was a lot of information that was hard to keep up with at times. She also agreed about the way Langdon's thought process was shown. She plans to read the book and see the film again to get a new perspective.<br/><br/>I did enjoy Ian McKellen's performance. I think Sir Leigh Teabing had the best lines in the whole film. Paul Bettany also impressed me as Silas.<br/><br/>I'm giving this a 4 out of 10. It was not the worst movie I have ever seen but I don't think I will ever watch it again. I was very disappointed and bored. The entire length of the movie I kept thinking ""I don't like that its so different from the book"". I couldn't turn my brain off long enough to enjoy the film and not think about all the changes.<br/><br/>I heard that Dan Brown's Angels & Demons may also become a film. I hope that it doesn't. I enjoyed Angels & Demons much more than The Da Vinci Code. After seeing The Da Vinci Code I don't think that a film would do Angels & Demons justice."
"Sweet_Ophelia","3","1","2","27 May 2006"," A lesson in mediocrity
","Yes, the old rule still applies; the book was better than the movie.<br/><br/>Its not that the film was 'bad'. It just wasn't good. Instead it was lackluster, simply going through the motions. Its as though Ron Howard and screen-writer Akiva Goldsman were creating this movie with the assumption that everybody and their grandmother had read Dan Brown's book and really just wanted to see what was on the page translated into images - its as though they knew that nobody expected much more from them than a competent translation from book to film. Unfortunately Tom Hanks in the pivotal role of Robert Langdon does not seem to have translated into most reader's conceptions of Brown's character. I agree with the general consensus on the casting of Tom Hanks; he's too old and not savvy enough; in the book Langdon is described as being like Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones, this is so far from being Tom Hanks its laughable. And it seems Hanks didn't have much confidence in himself either; his apprehension comes across, which means a huge chunk of the Langdon persona is missing from Hanks' portrayal. Most reviews I have read take a bigger bite out of Hanks than what I have just done, while agreeing that Audrey Tautou's talents are underused but she is bearable. Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany have been hailed as the film's saviors; but personally I think all the actors come across as being pretty run of the mill. All are undoubtedly talented; it's just that 'The DaVinci Code' seems to have put them all to sleep. <br/><br/>This is a very long film too; 149 minutes. I was yawning after about 40 minutes. While watching the film I was trying to imagine how someone who had not read the book would perceive the movie. Somehow I doubt it would manage to hold interest. I think the only reason I stayed awake until the end was simply to see how certain scenes translated onto the big screen; the mystery, for anyone who hadn't read the book and knew how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together; wouldn't have been particularly enthralled"
"jonathandhonig","8","1","2","26 May 2006"," Fabulous but key scenes for context and content were dropped
","The movie is not as good as the book for four reasons: (1) it should have included the call from the grandfather to his granddaughter at the beginning as this is needed for dramatic coherence; (2) it should have included a flashback to Silas leaving the Andorra jail after the earthquake because this has such cinematic potential; (3)it should have included Collet's finding of the eavesdropping location in the attic of the barn because Fache's actions make no sense without this scene; and (4) the ending change is incomprehensible as meeting one's long lost brother and grandmother and a wonderful kiss between two people who have shared an extraordinary adventure sure beats seeing a bunch of musty archives deep underground for a climactic moment."
"Enchorde","8","1","2","26 May 2006"," Great story, beautiful scenes... but read the book!
","Recap: Inside the Louvre its head curator, Jacques Sauniere, is shot dead and when found by the police Sauniere has left mysterious clues, written in part with his own blood. And he says to find professor Robert Langdon, who happens to be in Paris. Police brings Langdon under the guise of wanting help to decipher the clues and symbols, but Langdon is not there to help, he is the prime suspect. Sophie Neveu warns him of this and suddenly they are on the escape from the police, and at the same time trying to understand Sauniere's message. By doing that they enters the trail of an ancient secrecy and mystery, and finds themselves in the middle of an old feud between hidden, but powerful, organisations.<br/><br/>Comments: A movie is not a book, and a book is not a movie. So it's never fair to compare a movie based on a book with its source. Still, it is impossible not to do so. In general, the movie follows the story of the book pretty good, but of course there are differences, and in most cases the book is better than the movie. So if you have to choose, read the book. But that puts a dilemma; if you have read the book you know the ending. And that steals away most, if not all, of the suspense and mystery. I wonder if I had not appreciated this movie better if I hadn't read the book (I guess it is the same the other way around too). However, as the book is better, I don't regret it.<br/><br/>Anyway, looking at the movie by itself, it is still a good movie. The story is still good, the mystery (if not known) delightfully revealed. And there are a few scenes that are breathtaking. Include all flashbacks into these, as they are spectacularly beautiful, especially that of Newton's funeral. Howard shows that he knows how to use the special effects just right, and the right amount of it. The best scene of them all had little special effects though, and it was the only scene better in the movie than in the book is the ending itself. With Langdon kneeling and the music rising it was beautiful and emotional. A great ending indeed.<br/><br/>I understand that the cast was not clear from the start, and the cast ending up in the movie not always the first choice. But in my mind, it was the right choice. Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen are proved great actors, they do not disappoint one bit. Paul Bettany is somewhat of a personal favorite. Though he did not have the biggest role, or much freedom in it, he was good, once again. Audrey Tautou is a new acquaintance to me, but did good with her part too. So, to conclude, acting was never the problem with this movie.<br/><br/>The movie has some (minor) problems though. One is not its own fault, as the real suspense ends long before the actual ending, so the last part might feel a little long and dull, even if it is crucial to the story. One other (EXTREME SPOILER ALERT!) is the suggestion of the movie that Sophie, as heir to Jesus, can perform miracles. But if the Priory was right, Jesus was human, and couldn't have performed miracles, and certainly not Sophie. If the Priory was wrong, and Jesus divine, then there could have been no heir, or am I mistaken? Finally, this is a movie, not a religious statement. Nothing to get excited about, not in that sense anyway. It is a movie, and a good movie at that. If I hadn't known the ending beforehand, it would surely gotten a higher rating.<br/><br/>7/10"
"littleskikid","3","1","2","26 May 2006"," Poor recreation of an amazing book
","This movie was truly a disappointment to me. It was very very long, and hardly stayed truthful to the book. It felt slow the entire way through, and was an overall boring night for me. The one thing that really ruined it is the plot twists written into the book were not incorporated very strongly. The book made them very suspenseful interesting, while the movie merely placed them in just to follow the book. It would present the ""red herring"" and before you can think about it cast it aside. The acting was decent, but I felt Tom Hanks was a poor choice for Langdon. The actress who played Sophie actually did do a pretty good job though. The one thing that I feel was done very well was some of the sets, were exactly as I imagined them while reading the book. I almost felt as though I had seen the scene before which was an astonishing feeling. Overall, it definitely could have been better and in my opinion is not worth the money to see. For those of you who loved the book I suggest not ruining it for yourself, but if you must then rent it when it comes out on DVD"

","Well I would honestly have to say that this movie was a disappointment from beginning to end. Considering the fact that Ron Howard and Tom Hanks are two extremely reputable icons in the movie industry, they did a poor job. Tom Hanks did a poor job in creating the character of Robert Langdon and convincing his audience that he was Robert Langdon. His performance in this movie is an insult to the Lifetime Achievement Award he received in 2002. As for Ron Howard, he absolutely settled for mediocrity with this movie. Each scene was rushed and sloppy. This whole movie was in fast forward; especially the dialogue. However, the poor acting cannot be put solely on the shoulders of Tom Hanks. Nobody in this movie acted well enough to create a believable character. The Da Vinci Code was not even a solid portrayal of the book. This movie should have insulted Dan Brown and it absolutely does not deserve a rating better than a 4 out of 10."
"doomsday-8","6","1","2","25 May 2006"," Not what I expected
","Same story: good book, average movie. That's the kindest things that can be said. Though Tom Hanks makes a good performance I was disappointed by Jean Reno and Audrey Tautou. I would have expected more stamina from Fache since I originally thought that Jean Reno is a match made in heaven for this role. Ian McKellen plays quite a role and it would have helped if not for the poorly written script and sloppy directing it would have made quite an impact at the end. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is not bad though. Those who haven't read the book seem to enjoy it quite a lot, and so it may just be that my expectations were to high on this. On a good note the movie it's not doll but not as thrilling as the book either. A little more mystery would have helped, since even those that didn't read the book saw through the plot easily. I think Dan Brown did a better job in keeping you interested through the end. Also there were some points of interest in the book that the movie seems to pass through too easily, but it may be due to the fact it has to, in order not to last 6 hours.<br/><br/>My advice is to go see it. It's OK for an easy going weekend movie but for those who really enjoyed the book ... well don't get your hopes up or you might end up disappointed. Want to see a great movie? Go see Crash or Inside Man. They are far better."

","The Da Vinci Code: The, so far, highest anticipated blockbuster of the year for 2006, or the most, again so far, media hyped movie of the year. Whatever the viewpoint, for what ever reason, The Da Vinci Code turned out to be a nice little thriller, little here being the operative word, regrettably too. A thriller it is, with its beautiful English locations, such as the Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, Lincoln Cathedral, which was substituted for Westminster Abbey, London and Burghley House, again in Lincolnshire, England. The European destinations speak volumes here, such as the filming inside the Musée Du Louvre and the Ritz Hotel in Paris, France. These locations give the movie a taste of flamboyance and style. They are used very well, to inject a world of high-octane adventure that only the gifted and elite can acquire.<br/><br/>The cast here are of a pedigree to hold audiences captivated in their own right, with the skills of Messrs Hanks, McKellen and Reno and the French actress Audrey Tautou, who apparently, took the job after the original choice were for Julie Delpy and Kate Beckinsale. In addition, the role that was, eventually, given to Tom Hanks was considered for Bill Paxton, amongst others. This collaboration come together very well, in their own refined and subtle way, they are given a fictitious project to be apart off, they are in a plot of huge consequence and intrigue, the magnitude of the overall conspiracy theory is some what, sadly, eroded and in parts, deflated.<br/><br/>The historical story telling, by using a sense of flashback and a over lapping of the past with the present is interesting, this form of movie making is a procedure that does The Da Vinci Code justice and actually does project the story line to the next phase, giving the movie a true sense of Historical wonder and dread.<br/><br/>Apart from the high level locations and cast, we have a movie that is somewhat over drawn in the writing department, in the interpretation of Dan Browns book, who also acts as Executive Producer on this project too. Has Mr. Akiva Goldsman found this a tad too taxing? This question begs being asked, in the contest of a huge Production, why has The Da Vinci Code gone from being a Thriller Movie to a thrilling movie that does not thrill hardly enough? The script, I feel, has driven The Da Vinci Code's pace, in places, from high-octane to moderate B-Movie status. This is a shame, for who ever was in charge of this department should, again I feel, have looked more closely at reading between the lines, and given it more attention, this, regrettably, could be the weakest link in this movies chain. Alternatively, and fairly, has he merely adapted his skills to the environment that he has been placed in? <br/><br/>Mr. Goldman's other works for writing and screenplay consist of The Client 1994, Silent Fall 1994, Batman Forever 1995, A Time To Kill 1996, Batman & Robin 1997, Lost In Space 1998, also for I, Robert 2004 and the 2005 movie Cinderella Man. He has been nominated for many Awards in his career; he won has the 2002 Academy Award for Best Writing for A Beautiful Mind 2001.<br/><br/>The musical score is also worth a mention, with the work of Mr. Hans Zimmer, who during the early eighties was in the band The Buggles, their hit ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" became their best seller. He has worked on many, many classics such as My Beautiful Laundrette 1985, The Last Emperor 1987, Rain Man 1988, Thelma and Louise 1991. His vast workload was to include The Lion King 1994, The Rock 1996, Mission Impossible II and Gladiator in 2000. He worked on Black Hawk Down in 2001 and the list is endless. His work on The Da Vinci Code is a fine classical score that highlights the high quality message of this movie, with a combination of drama and suspense that kicks starts each moment into daring adventure.<br/><br/>To conclude: The Da Vinci Code is a good movie, it is a reasonably good thriller, with very stylish locations, cast and modest Director, but it, not at all points, tends to, for me, fall on the flat side, because of the high importance of the overall story line, the delivery of the script has fallen short. This is the Cross that The Da Vinci Code now has to bear. Shame really."

The different ending was a thing disappointed me, also because it's a sort of lie for all of those who have read the paper version. I appreciate the role of Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno, while, in my opinion, Tom Hanks was not the best actor for the movie. Ron Howard is a good director, but this time he missed the target!

","Although this movie is true to the book it has none of the excitement. I saw it with a friend who had not read the book and we both thought it was mediocre. The plot is too complicated to go into but basically its a combination murder-mystery and treasure-hunt centering around the relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Its worth watching so, if you can, wait to rent it instead of paying more to sit and be mostly bored for two and a half hours.<br/><br/>The main problem is not the screenplay or the ensemble of truly great actors who do their best. Its the direction. There is no change of pace. Actually there is not much pace to speak of. The musical score, like the movie itself, is dulled down and monotonic. Whoever bankrolled this should have paid whatever Doug Liman or Jon Turteltaub were asking to direct it. This could have been a mammoth blockbuster with the right person at the helm. Instead its going to be mildly popular for a time simply because of all the hype."

"RevSykes","7","1","2","23 May 2006"," Don't Believe the Reviews
","Much later than most, I read the book. When I heard that Tom Hanks was starring, I was surprised because there's really not much of a character for him to play in Prof. Langdon. After reading the reviews (did you see the crying Anthony Lane did in the New Yorker?) I figured the movie was wooden and too-close-to-the-book. I was especially deflated by the several reviews that said this was a terrible performance by Tom Hanks. The audience doesn't seem to agree and neither do I. I was at a 12:45pm show in New York today and the theater was 2/3 full. For a weekday, that's how we say ""hit.""<br/><br/>This movie is a fine thriller. Not the greatest movie, but a fine thriller Tom Hanks does very well with a role that doesn't have much in it. He doesn't overplay a thing and plays it real. I wish they hadn't had him say, ""this can't be so"" twice within the first ten minutes, but that's a nit. The movie follows Hollywood thriller conventions and does so well. The added wrinkle of the religious mystery they're unveiling is handled well enough, making for a successful ""family"" themed resolution. A little more development of Sophie and her issues would have made that resolution even better.<br/><br/>So why all the savaging reviews? I can think of a reason . . . or maybe 40 million of them. People who make their living in the arts (like many reviewers, particularly the effete ones)have trouble with Dan Brown's book selling 40 million copies. God knows why such things take off (pun acknowledged)but people who struggle to get published are kept up at night by what they see as the unmerited success of a hack writer. It happens. The movie is fine. Tamp down your expectations and it'll be fun."

"sullibrandon","5","1","2","23 May 2006"," Bad as both an adaptation and a Stand-Alone Movie
","The Da Vinci Code is probably the most anticipated blockbuster so far this year. Based on the obscenely popular novel by Dan Brown, this movie features two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks in the role of Robert Langdon, a symbology professor at Harvard who is suddenly called upon to solve a centuries old mystery. It doesn't work. The movie is a flat-out disappointment - poor in comparison to the book, and poor as a stand-alone film.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Paul Bettany, one of the two shining acting jewels in this film, in the role of Silas the monk, hunting down Jacques Sauniere in the Louvre. Immediately following this underwhelming scene, we are shown Silas whipping and inflicting self-torture, managing to incur more sympathy than Tom Hanks himself.<br/><br/>It is revealed that Jacques Sauniere, in his final moments of death, set up a clue for his niece, Sophie, and Robert Langdon, to follow. Right from the get go, it is clear we are supposed to think of Sophie and Robert as a sort of erstwhile couple, yet Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou do not share nearly enough chemistry to makes this believable. Hanks' brilliant career has earned him two Oscars, yet in this film his talents are wasted. He plays the symbologist professor as a cardboard cutout who merely exists to get them to next clue in the puzzle. They set off on the trail, figuring out each subsequent clue as if it where nothing more than a Blue's Clues show.<br/><br/>The film is slavishly faithful to the book - as if Howard was afraid that anything taken out would diminish its taut, tense quality. Yet it is precisely Howard's inclusion of every mundane detail that makes the movie seem so dull at times. The movie would have vastly benefited from being cut down to 110 - 120 minutes. It's two and a half hour running time is half an hour too long.<br/><br/>Another problem is how badly the action of the book is for action on the big screen. The character's long explanations of the clues in the book worked because reading is quite a different experience from viewing. In the film, the characters talk over history channel style grainy flashbacks. It is as if the audience can't be expected to listen to a character talk without some sort of action going on in the background.<br/><br/>Eventually Langdon and Sophie meet Leigh Teabing, an eccentric old scholar who knows more than anyone alive about the mystery of the Holy Grail and the Priory of Sion, a secret society dedicated to guarding the location of said object. Ian MacKellen's acting of Teabing is the other bright spot in the movie. This is what makes Tom Hanks's acting so disappointing. Admittedly, the character development in the novel is threadbare, and nonexistent in the movie. Yet that does not mean that Hanks could not have given Langdon a little bit of life. Hanks plays him as this dull history professor thrust into action which he immediately takes to like a duck to water. There is no moment of extreme surprise on incredulity, from him OR anyone else, in the entire movie. They just slip into their action hero jackets and plough straight ahead through the depressingly dull dialogue.<br/><br/>The controversy of the film is diluted as well, obviously to in some way quell the angered grumblings of a lot of Christians. Langdon is now a skeptic. It is hard to tell whether this helps or does not help the movie - though given the transparency of Hanks's character, it doesn't really make a difference at all. The Da Vinci Code has been talked about to death. Approximately 1897 TV specials have been done on it, and though it is still selling strong, the time for this movie to come out has passed. Besides Langdon's skepticism in the movie, everything else about the controversial message is there, but it just carries the air of, ""who cares?"" <br/><br/>Finally, the ending of the movie is the very definition of anti-climax. We are given a perfectly good climax - tense, taut, and fulfilling. Yet the movie goes on for another twenty minutes, dragging out every moment to the point of breaking. One of the final insults of the movie comes when Langdon attempts to summarize the supposed lessons he's learned. The lines are horrendously convoluted and make Langdon seem like a wishy washy wuss - he goes back and forth several times, never quite settling on what he has actually learned. And after that, we are treated to the final ""HOLY CRAP"" moment of the movie - which ends up working quite well, but is almost spoiled by an extra bit of camera-work that ends up feeling like a wasted bit of money.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code, in one word: disappointing. The acting, the story, everything. I was expecting a taut tense mystery thriller, but it came off as nothing more than a particularly dull detective story. The controversial message of it alone may make it interesting enough to be worth seeing in theatres, but that is not enough for a recommendation, at least not from me. If you want the controversial message, AND a good, taut, tense thriller, go for the book. It's a thousand times better."
"jester101","5","1","2","23 May 2006"," A disappointing rather slow paced movie
","Having, no doubt like many of you who have read the book, I was captivated from the first few pages. This interesting, fast paced, historical thriller blew me away like no books before could. <br/><br/>Mixing art, secret societies, historical and political intrigue with conspiracies of huge proportions this had everything you could want to activate your imagination.<br/><br/>So when I heard about the movie I was rather apprehensive as to weather this could live up to high standards and huge amount of hype which had slowly been gathering pace.<br/><br/>And, like I feared from the mauling this film took from all corners of the media, I too was left very , very disappointed. <br/><br/>Given the Director Ron Howard and his high standards of past film making, and some of the big names which were enlisted I just did not see how this could fail to hit the mark, but fail it did!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, due to a flat script, plot cramming and rather one paced direction this film never seems to get out of first gear. Add in the mix some very poor acting from Audrey Tautou, Jean Reno and yes, you better believe it, the great Tom Hanks, this film turns into a huge failure.<br/><br/>Tom hanks, who I admire greatly and is one of the finest actors around, just bumbles from scene to scene with what looks like road kill stuck to his head, but even his sub par performance is outdone by lame Audrey Tautou.<br/><br/>Her acting is comparable to a drama student who has taken a role which is beyond her capability and just never convinces you she is the character she plays.<br/><br/>I just cant help but feel this film would have been better using less well known actors, ones who would have reveled in such interesting characters and story lines. But instead run of the mill performances from past greats just don't intrigue or delight.<br/><br/>It's not all bad though. There are some excellent standout performances from Sir Ian McKellen as the rather eccentric English millionaire Sir Leigh Teabing and the very impressive Paul Bettany as the albino monk Silas.<br/><br/>Utimately though these small redeeming qualities are not enough to rescue a misguided, boring and flat film which if you must see, wait for DVD release. At least this way you have the option of stopping it and swapping it for better movie."

"dr_fava_beans","6","1","2","22 May 2006"," A foregone conclusion
","One of the biggest hype of the summer - The biggest potential blockbuster - And maybe the biggest subject of Controversy. All in one - The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>However, I had my reservations from the day I heard the book was going to be made into a movie. The simple reason was the bad writing on part of the author. Mind you, I am not talking about the plot. I found the plot quite interesting to begin with, but all my interest was subdued by the monochromatic characters, boring dialouges and cheap thriller style plot development. No doubt any movie which had to follow the original storyline of the book, had to suffer from the same weaknesses.<br/><br/>Given all these disadvantages, the movie actually does surprisingly well, especially in the first half. The second half of the movie (and of the book as well) where the character development takes place becomes cheesy at times, to say the least.<br/><br/>Some Points : Paul Bettany is perfect as Silas. Strangely, Silas WAS one of the characters in the novel who did not sound boring. Bettany brings the same malice and pathos on screen as I had felt of the character while reading the book.<br/><br/>Ian Mckellen does what he does best. Makes his screen time a treat.<br/><br/>Monila's character shares too small a screen time for any interest. In the book he had much more to do and say. Also because of this, the kind of ""Betrayal"" he refers to will remain a bit unclear for the non-readers.<br/><br/>I always envisioned Langdon to be a bit tired sort of guy during the events of the novel. After all, he had had a very busy day before the events kicks in... Tom Hanks does exactly that. However, he is devoid of any ""personality"" in the movie, he is helplessly driven by events surrounding him. If his character lacks depth, that's NOT the fault of the script writer or him. It's Dan Brown's fault, who never took time in his novel to give depth to the hero.<br/><br/>All I can say of Tatou is that she looks beautiful. Unfortunately, like Hanks, given the amount of screen time she chewed up (it was a major portion of the movie), her performance falls flat, once again thanks to Dan Brown's writing. Totally cardboard.<br/><br/>And Jean Reno was totally wasted, as was his character in the novel.<br/><br/>The score of the movie is similar to ""Epic"" kind of movies - in particular to epic wars. Especially, the score and sequence at the very end of the movie, reminded me of the finale of ""Last of the Mohicans"". Done in similar style.<br/><br/>Also, Ron Howard uses the ""Virtual Projection of the mind in 2D"" (something he did in the melodramatic ""A Beautiful Mind"") technique, here to make the audience ""see"" what Langdon is ""thinking"" while he is solving the clues. Does not work that well. And here is the only thing where the book does better than the movie, which is expected since, in the book, all the clues were explained in great detail, pages after pages. I understand the movie is at a disadvantage regarding this, simply because such a detailed approach will make things more boring. However, he might have presented it in a bit more ingenious way, rather than repeating himself.<br/><br/>All in all, if you want to see a pop-corn movie, it's going to be a treat, and you might want to see it again to understand the events more (especially, non-readers). However, if you are looking for ""thinking"" movie, it is not one of them.<br/><br/>Once again, I say - it is not the movie's fault. The fault lies with the book."
"godan0","5","1","2","22 May 2006"," Overrated movie, wonderful theory.
","Though my expectations were high when i first watched The Da Vinci Code, i understand now that i should have read the book first. The so well known ""book-better-then-movie"" formula applies here. In the movie, Tom Hanks doesn't quite brings emotion and depth to Robert Langdon, none does Audrey Tautou (one of my all time favourite actress). The only star in the cast that really brings something new and interesting to the storyline and generic scenes is Paul Bettany (plays Silas); wonderful acting. So it all comes down to this : If you've already read the book, there's no special reason to pay your ticket for The Da Vinci Code."

However, this is where the good points end.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou seems bored throughout and Tom Hanks appears to be going through the motions and nothing else. Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing is impressive but is let down somewhat by the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The brief moments of action in the movie seem rushed and haphazard, almost cheap. The whole film seems rushed and the story moves at an incredible pace, yet somehow, it seems overlong. <br/><br/>Overall, anyone that hasn't read the book will be carried along blissfully by the story but for the rest of us it will be a disappointment and nothing more."

","Saw it at 0930hrs Thursday in Queenland Australia - in a town of 25,000 - thanks to geography well before the major markets such as the US. Frankly I thought it was a hell of a lot better than the bodice-ripping prose of the book. I am not too impressed by Tom Hanks as an actor but the French lady playing Sophie (luminescent I thought) and the French cop were excellent. Since Teabing's arrest (forgotten his name but a great character - looked like Peter O'Toole) the movie lost momentum and the last 15mins were very slow. Of course the theory of Christ's bloodline is contentious, but so again is the divinity of Him and the virgin birth. But that is a matter of personal belief. I thought the film encapsulated the central thesis much better than the book. Tried to read The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail twice, but found it too hard - too academic."

","Well, too many opinions already, but i'll add this one anyway.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book. I think one does not need to read the book to see any movie. Reading the book leaves you with images that can't be transformed to a film. And reading the book after wards leaves you with the images the film has set for you. So i'm not gonna read the book now. That aside:<br/><br/>The theater was fully packed, so the bar is raised high. Although it's really a mainstream film, it has a long running time. I didn't mind that, but a lot of other people did, getting bored around half way trough the movie. Well, that happens with the MTV generation :) <br/><br/>So, probably the book was better. This 2 1/2 hour flick was to short to tell it's story fully. A lot of things happen, and some interesting theory's didn't get much attention due to the total length of the story. That's the biggest issue for me.<br/><br/>The main story wasn't too difficult to follow for me. But it's the little theories that should make this movie interesting. And some theories now get about 1 sentence attention. That's just too little. The story quickly moves on to the next scene. The main story isn't to interesting, but that's not really objective for me to say. So i'll leave that up to you.<br/><br/>I agree with a lot of people that the acting sucks. Especially the performance of Tom Hanks (weird since he usually isn't a bad actor at all). The rest is average, and because there is a lot of dialog in this movie, it shows. Making the average/bad acting twice as irritating. The dialogs aren't to interesting. could've worked it out better. <br/><br/>So: everyone knew this movie's gonna make a lot of money. So did Ron Howard. And thus he didn't make something special out of it. Sloppy... This movie could've been so much better."

","I liked The Da Vinci code the first 4 times I saw it...as National Treasure (absurd huge conspiracy idea), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Grail quest), Dogma (last relative of Jesus), and The Bourne Identity (chase through Paris). Without having read the book at all, knowing only that it dealt with a secret code hiding the supposed fact that Jesus married and sired a line of descendants with Mary Magdalene, I approached the movie skeptical of the religious issues that have been much debated. As an ordained minister in a protestant denomination I can tell you that it takes some liberties with conventional theology (assuming facts that aren't facts), but it strives to avoid spitting on faith, more attacking the idea of institutional power, in this case the Roman Catholic Church. I had an idea who was who and what would happen when it started, and I was right on all counts. Every plot turn was as obvious as if it had those convex mirrors hanging from the ceiling at corners in hospitals. There was absolutely no suspense for me. I guessed right on every character too, as to who would turn out to be a villain or a hero. It was just too obvious from the start. I'm frankly surprised Ron Howard did this. Apollo 13 is one of my favorites, and ironically it is much more suspenseful to me after a dozen viewings and being an accurate historical drama than this little work was the first time through without having read the book. Now, it was beautifully filmed, and the flashback/dream sequences were wonderfully done, except for the error of placing 4th century Constantine who ruled from Byzantium in 2nd century Rome - dramatic license, I realize, but distracting to me. About descendants of Jesus - statistically speaking, if He had any, most of us would be related to Him by now. It's been 2000 years. There would have had to have been a concerted effort beginning in the first century to be able to be able to kill them all."

","The audience reaction to this movie is so polarized, and the critical reaction to universally negative, that I had to go see it just to see where I would fall. My impression is that the book is a great page turner, albeit written at a 10th grade level. <br/><br/>First of all, I have not read the book, so I found it a bit confusing. But it was a very handsomely made movie, fairly provocative, nothing really outstanding, but certainly not bad. I haven't a clue as to the total dislike of the movie by the critics, I have sat thru far worse. I imagine to someone who had read the book, and knew all the intricacies would find it a very good movie.<br/><br/>My partner thought it was an excellent adaptation, though of course the book, as usual ""was better."" As for the religious controversy, I'll let the religious fight over that. In my view, anything that puts organized religion in the bad light it deserves is OK with me, even if the particulars of this story are ""fiction."" I can see why true believers might not be too thrilled with it. At least no one is getting killed over it.<br/><br/>Overall if you liked the book, I think you will find the movie very well done and beautiful to look at. If you didn't like the book, you won't. For the rest of us, worth seeing at least. <br/><br/>All this furor going on is, to me, a tempest in a teapot."

I wonder how many people fell asleep during the movie, as did the guy sitting next to me. I actually had to hit him with my elbow to get him off my shoulder.<br/><br/>Having read the book, there were no surprises for me. Ron Howard really dropped the ball on this. He should have told the story through much more creative imagery. Perhaps some creative camera angels or something to make it interesting.<br/><br/>And the boring dialogue... Sure the story depends on it, but Tom Hanks was so dull in his speech, actually so was everybody. Well, at least the audience laughed at one point - that was probably put there to wake people up rather than for entertainment purposes.<br/><br/>If you read the book, don't bother with the movie.

","**** no spoiler **** I believe it was a good friend who first brought Dan Brown to my attention, and as I always do  I chewed up everything he wrote book by book. In spite of all the controversy that surrounded the ""Code"" I found Brown's style gripping and couldn't let go of the book. One can not let slip the fact that the guy seems to include every detail he feels required to enlighten the scene. What you end up is a Novel that not only grabs you by the throat and doesn't let you sleep at night, but also teaches you a few things along the way.<br/><br/>All this certainly showed in this movie. You could feel Goldsman was struggling with how to fit everything in ""ONLY"" two and a half hours, and you could somehow imaging Ron Howard sitting on the director's chair trying to make Hanks seem believable in all this mess. It's a damn shame that what they wound up with was a complete mess that will probably deter people from actually going to read the book.<br/><br/>I saw a few people here that voted and commented after watching this flick without reading the book. To all of you out there all I have to say is  READ THE BOOK FIRST, because this movie is REALLY bad in comparison.<br/><br/>The actors deliver a non-convincing performance, and the conclusion at the end (for those of you who haven't read the book) is lost in a scatter of this badly written screenplay."
"warren-ripley","6","1","2","21 May 2006"," Works as a Thriller but not as a mystery
","Acting was, of course, considering the cast, excellent. It was thrilling and exciting and well photographed. It was fun to watch. Good movie.<br/><br/>As a mystery, it falls apart. And as history it is chock full of false information -- but, it must be remembered that the book and the movie are fiction, not fact. And, I think the majority realize this and I kept that in mind when I watched the movie and enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The characters depicted are supposed to be highly intelligent yet they make tortured intuitive leaps which weren't logical. There are almost too many to list. The obvious ones are 1.) Even if Mary Magdelene was married to Jesus, how does that make her divine and how does that affect Christ's divinity? Mary's divine and Jesus isn't? If Jesus was married, so what? 2.) The ""Sang Real"" is a huge, gigantic secret, yet at every turn in the movie it seems that everyone in the film knows about it. Ever try to keep a secret with just one or two people? Why wasn't this 'secret' widely known after centuries of so many people knowing it. And going around killing off the bloodline doesn't wash. 3.) The protectors of the ""Sang Real"" (Priory of Sion or whatever) show up at the end to ""Protect Sophie . . . 'as we always have'"". So, where in the heck were they throughout the movie? 4.) So what if Leonardo Da Vinci painted a picture with a woman in it or left a chalice out? It's not relevant. He wasn't at the last supper. How does that support a conclusion that Jesus was married? It doesn't. How could highly-intelligent people make these illogical conclusions? Historically, the council of Nicea did NOT meet to throw away gospels. They met to decide whether to enter 2 Peter and some other new Testament books into canon that had already been widely accepted by the first church. The gospel mentioned in ""The Da Vinci Code"" was written a few hundred years after Christ's resurrection whereas the canonical gospels were written within a generation of Christ, from eye-witness accounts, and were already widely accepted by the first Church.<br/><br/>The council of Nicea met to debate only one huge question -- Christ's divinity. 1. Was Christ pre-eminently divine and therefore the Son of God and God Himself OR 2. Was Christ appointed by God to be His son after His resurrection. The vote at Nicea was decidedly one-sided -- only two votes out of approximately 300 were cast for the second premise. It was by a landslide vote that the council adopted the biblical view that Christ was pre-eminent, that Jesus Christ was not a created being but the son of God and finally that Christ was God incarnate.<br/><br/>Good movie, bad history. Conclusion: A fine thriller that doesn't pass the smell test for logic yet enjoyable to watch."

","I may have been one of 5 people left that hasn't read the book.

I eagerly awaited opening day.<br/><br/>I stood in line; I paid top dollar for tickets. What a disappointment. This movie is boring and predictable. I actually nodded off at times and missed nothing! The most engaging parts of the movie were when Ian McKellen's character is providing background for the story. Not having read the book, I guessed fairly early on, the big ending and several of the minor twists. I don't consider myself a movie buff and don't often critique them but this movie left me feeling ripped off.<br/><br/>What has happened to Tom Hanks? Age has not been good to him. He looks older and a little too well fed in this movie. He doesn't act as much as just re-cite lines. I got no empathy nor feeling from him at all. The heroine, Audrey Tautou, also walked through the movie emoting nothing which is more glareing given the ending. The minor characters carried the show; Ian McKellen and Jean Reno especially, but also Jürgen Prochnow, and Paul Bettany.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, enjoy the book and wait for the DVD."
"DonutLover","2","2","7","6 March 2007"," Stupid Movie, for Intelligent, Unbiased People
","Sorry, but I had to balance out the other reviewer on this site who said the movie is great, and if you have a problem with it, it's because you have a problem with your faith. That is utterly presumptuous and arrogant. I do have a problem with this movie, for several reasons. First and foremost is that it's another example of Christianity being the target of all things liberal, politically correct, and elitist. Let's just put our thinking caps on for a minute, and ask the question: what type of reaction do you think we could expect from the Jewish community, or the Muslim community, regarding a popular, well touted movie based upon the premise that their sacred beliefs, and history, are a farce? Would everyone just say ""oh, that's just fiction, don't get your pants in a bundle"", especially if it was day in and day out where their religion was torn apart, analyzed by people who had no knowledge whatsoever of what they spoke? By people who had such a comically minimal knowledge of history, that they believed anything they read? That anything was possible, if it was presented well? That Aliens with nine heads and one foot were actually the conspirators who wrote the bible? Yeah, that could happen! This movie was so bad, and not just because it was slow moving, and forced. Teabing (McKellan) tells his version of the Christians coming to attack the pagans, which is in fact a gross misrepresentation of history (failing to mention the centuries of persecution of the Christians, by the pagans), and Tom Hanks makes a pitiful little comment, obviously aimed at an attempt to make the movie look balanced (but failing, miserably!) like, ""well, we don't know who started the war, first"". Oh, thank you so much for that thrown bone! Yes, it's such an unbiased movie, so enlightening, such great food for thought, and SO fair! Opie, Opie, Opie, where did we go wrong, son?<br/><br/>Also, the depiction of the council at Nycene (sorry, misspelled I'm sure) was ludicrous: hundreds of men in robes, yelling all at once and falling over each other, shouting out their opinions like they were at the horse races, or brokers in the middle of a heated and hectic day at the New York Stock Exchange. Was this really necessary? It's like, taking a historical event, such as say, the first day that African Americans went into the white school in the south, peacefully, and with police guard. Make a movie though, showing hundreds of African Americans forcing their way into the school, punching every white person in the face, and planting shovels and spears into the ground. But, it's just fiction, right? And who cares if it's blatantly historically inaccurate? African Americans wouldn't mind, right? So, why should a few disgruntled Catholics. Okay, the truth of the matter is, the council at Nycene was a thoughtful, prayerful gathering of scholars and men of the cloth, whose monumental, and difficult job it was to determine which gospels were authentic, and reliable, and which were the modern day version of National Enquirer. Which to include in the bible, which to exclude. These were not idiot, megalomaniacs given this job. Give me a break! The ending made me laugh (SPOILER!!!), and it almost seemed like Tom Hanks couldn't keep a straight face as he said "" you are the last descendant of Jesus Christ"". Oh, God. I can't even begin to explain how incredibly lame that whole premise is. It was good for a laugh, though, but in the end, the anger I feel for this latest stab at the ""Repressive Christian Organizational Administrating Establishment Conspiracy for Sheep People"" ruins any fun or humor the movie provided. Also, I was truly looking forward to seeing the Louvre, and scenes of modern day France, since I haven't been there in two decades. But, the movie was so dark, I really didn't see anything at all. Except for the pryamid, and for that I was kind of thankful......<br/><br/>Honestly, if the subject matter were different,and it was a different truth they were seeking, and it didn't involve a bunch of murderous Catholics gunning each other down (!), I MIGHT have enjoyed it........but I'll never know. It might have been more enjoyable if the Holy Grail ended up being the Easter Bunny, but what the film REALLY needed in the end was Barney Fife, holstered gun, earnest look on his face, pacing back and forth and complaining into his walkie talkie ""ANNNNDY, I CAN'T come to the picnic tonight, I'm guarding the tomb of the Magdalene!"""

The movie is also easy to follow even if you haven't read the book, so go ahead and watch it. One of the things I really liked about the movie is that it is wonderfully paced...you don't even realize it's more than two hours long. Ron Howard has taken Dan Brown's masterpiece and turned it into a masterpiece of his own.

","I actually wasn't interested in rushing to catch this movie at all until the critics posted their reviews and I saw that they were nearly all bad. Then I found myself curious - just how bad can it be, I asked myself (switching the letters of the words around to form an anagram, of course). The answer: purdy dern bad. And even worse, it's boring. And long. Much, MUCH too long.<br/><br/>It starts off in a cheesy manner and proceeds to get even cheesier as it goes on, and make no mistake - go on, it does. There is not one character that breathed as flesh and blood except for Ian McKellan's Sir Leigh Teabag - I mean Teabing - who stole the picture without any effort whatsoever on his part.<br/><br/>The problem starts with the script, which is dreary and uninspired in every possible way. Add to that Ron Howard's yawn-inducing pacing (and I use that word lightly), the trying-to-pump-drama-into-a-tediously-overwrought-storyline, aka 'The Plot', and you've got a turkey on your hands the size of the west wing of the Louvre.<br/><br/>Hanks' only 'good' line comes early on, when Audrey Tautou, whom I usually love but who comes off like a wooden prop here, shows him the hidden message on the Mona Lisa, 'So Dark The Con Of Man,' to which he replies, ""It doesn't say that!"" (I thought this was a good line, anyway.)<br/><br/>I was thinking while I was watching it, in an effort to stay awake, that the film would have been a helluva lot more fun if, say, Paul Giamatti had been playing Robert Langdon. And maybe they could've gotten, say, Kate Winslet to play Sophie, or perhaps Giamatti's co-star from Howard's previous film, So Dark The Cinderella Man, Renee Zellweger. I bet she could pull off a French accent."

","Today I saw The Da Vinci Code. I would like to mention that I have not yet read the book by Dan Brown.<br/><br/>The movie is bad, very bad. Poorly directed, poorly acted, poorly written, poorly paced. Almost everything was bad except for three things: 1) in some places the cinematography and special effects are mindblowingly fluid and beautiful 2) Paul Bettany was amazing in the role of assassin albino monk Silas 3) Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf in LOTR and Magneto in X-Men) was amazing as well and really made the movie a whole lot more enjoyable. Without him, this movie would have been a whole lot worse.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is useless in this movie, he does not even act, he just appears on the screen and says his lines, no acting at all. His character is pointless, all that he does is solve some puzzles at mind-blowing pace. NOTHING MORE.<br/><br/>The story is good, but it's not controversial. If anyone on this planet thinks this story is sacrilegious, then they are narrow minded, even stupid. I will not give away the story, although many know it already. Let me just say that this story does in no way reduce the importance or the role of God or Jesus, all that it does is to say that the Church, Catholic, Orthodox, etc is not as holy as it seems and that priests have been using religion to suit their own benefit.<br/><br/>This, I do not find disturbing at all. Why? If people don't think this is true, then you must have forgotten about the Inquisition, the Crusades, the slaughter of the Native American population, all in the name of religion, while actually they were done in the name of power and wealth.<br/><br/>But, while the story is mediocre and OK, the rest of the movie is so bad I thought that I was watching a soap-opera made by a drunk director and his porn-star girlfriend/actress.<br/><br/>Seriously, this is ONE movie that I recommend you download of the internet. I saw this in the cinema with a packed theater. Every showing in at least 4 cinemas at out multiplex has been packed. This movie is going to make a whole lot of money. And I feel bad that trash movies like this get to make money while other good movies go unnoticed.<br/><br/>DO NOT PAY TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. DON'T GIVE THEM AN EXCUSE TO MAKE SUCH BAD MOVIES AGAIN.<br/><br/>My mark for the film: 3/10 for Sir Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany who literally took cow dung (menure, fertilizer, SH*T) (and by that I mean the script) and turned it into gold."

","At the time of the film's release I had about all the hype of the Dan Brown book of the same title it was based, so I was keen, but it was only watching it for the third time I could appreciate it properly, and I'm glad I do, from director Ron Howard (Splash, The Paper, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind). Basically in Paris, France, American symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is called to the Musée du Louvre to the Grand Gallery to the view the scene of a crime, curator Jacques Saunière (Jean-Pierre Marielle) has been murdered, by albino monk Silas (Paul Bettany), but before dying he left strange messages in black light ink and his blood. French police cryptologist and Saunière's granddaughter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) shows up at the Louvre, and taking him aside he is told he is being tracked by GPS that investigating French police Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) slipped into his jacket, he is also told he is the key suspect of the crime, and Sophie believes the hidden messages are for her, asking to get Langdon and crack the code. With the police distracted to chase the discarded GPS device, Langdon sees the messages are anagrams, and following the clues many relate to the artworks of artist Leonardo Da Vinci, and find a hidden key behind his painting Madonna/Virgin of the Rocks, and he deduces Saunière was part of secret society the Priory of Sion, associated with the Knights Templar, who guarded the Holy Grail. Inspecting the key they are led to a bank safety deposit box, and opening with a ten digit number code memorised, and inside a rosewood container is a cryptex, a cylindrical container with five alphabetical dials to be arranged in a correct sequence to spell a five letter code word, if it is forced open a vial of vinegar inside will destroy the message hidden inside. After escaping the bank manager Andre Vernet (Jürgen Prochnow) and the police they travel to visit Langdon's friend Sir Leigh Teabing (Sir Ian McKellen) for assistance in opening the cryptex, he is a keen seeker of the Holy Grail, and using projected imagery of the famous Da Vinci painting of the Last Summer he proves his belief that the Grail is not a cup like everyone thinks, he believes it is a person, Mary Magdalene who was apparently pregnant with the child of Jesus Christ during the time of his crucifixion, this secret was hidden by the Priory. Silas breaks into Teabing's and tries to steal the cryptex, but the three of them knock him out and tied up take him with them travelling to London, following the next clue to the Temple Church in London, but this is a red herring, and in a frantic situation followers of someone known as The Teacher are revealed, and Silas escaping accidentally shoots his facilitator Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (Alfred Molina), before allowing himself to get shot by the police. Langdon was deceived by Teabing however, he is The Teacher, they follow him and the next clue at Isaac Newton's tomb in Westminster Abbey, Newton was part of the Priory, Teabing says he wants to find the remains of Mary Magdalene to prove his research was right and bring it into the public eye, he assumes Sophie, who was being trained to be part of the Priory, must know the cryptex code word, but Langdon threatened takes it thinking he may be able to solve, but after moments he throws it up and destroys the message inside. Teabing is distraught at not getting the message of the cryptex, but being arrested he realises Langdon did solve it before throwing, the codeword was ""Apple"" (relating to the famous Newton scientific discovery of gravity), and following the message clue they reach Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, the last place to hold the remains of Mary Magdalene, they have been moves, but they meet more members of the secret organisation that protected her, and documentation chronicling the blood line of Christ. Sophie is revealed to be the descendant of Mary Magdelene, therefore surviving the Christ, hence her past experience with the Priory, she is to go with them to keep her secret and safe, she and Langdon debate her significant heritage for a moment, but he tells her it is up to her what she does with the knowledge she has been given. The last sequence sees Langdon remembering the Rose Line in Paris, the line of brass plates placed on the ground through the city leading to something significant, and he finds it is the location the Holy Grail, the remains of Mary Magdalene are buried beneath the pyramid in the Louvre, and like the Knights Templar before him he simply kneels. Also starring Etienne Chicot as Lt. Collet, Jean-Yves Berteloot as Remy Jean, Marie-Françoise Audollent as Sister Sandrine and Clive Carter as Biggin Hill Police Captain. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Hans Zimmer. Hanks does well as the knowledgeable Harvard professor, Tautou is alright as the female investigator caught in the middle, Bettany is disturbing as the creepy and disturbed monk who self harms and kills for his god, and McKellen is likable and joyous as the double-crossing expert. The film is filled with powerful and thought-provoking ideas of the concepts religion, the meanings behind artworks, and the very foundations of scientific knowledge, theory and discovery, it works fantastically as a puzzle to piece together, as long as you can keep up, as well as watching fun chases with great locations (including Winchester Cathedral posing as Westminster Abbey), a most watchable and faithfully adapted mystery thriller. Good!"

Oh, they did try for 2.5 hours but somehow even with the long run time, I never sympathized with the characters as I did with the novel. Furthermore, the length made a mess of the pacing, which occasionally lurched forward whenever Silas appeared (people in the audience even screamed) and then slogged for so long it was easy to forget the protagonists were running for their lives. I always had the sense in the book that danger was just around the corner, but the film version completely misses this suspense.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, bless his heart, plays a truly realistic university professor... but the ""I'm a nerdy guy just caught up in things I don't understand"" shtick is completely wrong and overplayed for this context. Audrey makes a lovely Sophie, but much of her charm seems to have been dialogue- and accent- coached away. The character development is further short-circuited by Howard's decision to use odd semi-flashback scenes which reduce the rich stories of these characters to a few CG'd up flashes. One hideous example of poor directing choices comes when Remy is talking with the Teacher and we're not supposed to know the identity of the Teacher- this is easy to handle in literature, and admittedly difficult to render in cinema, but the sheer awkwardness of the camera movements and the gross transparency of the intentionally one-sided duologue is a missed opportunity for innovation.<br/><br/>Speaking of missed opportunities, let's talk about the art design... could the set of the final revelation have been any worse? A secret latch under a rug in the shape of a painfully obvious symbol? Come on! This completely misses the clever ingenuity of Dan Brown's puzzles. Although exhaustive time is spent on exposition, little is spent on the actual puzzle solving, making each revelation seem inevitable and contrived instead of suspenseful and intellectually exciting. If the medium had been leveraged more effectively, Howard could have given us a much better visual representation of the symbols in the text, but again, the opportunity is wasted, especially in the scene in which Teabing (sic) explains the meaning of the grail. Where was all the CG wizardry here? Even the painting represented on the big LCD screen is so grainy and washed out it loses the purpose of writing a story that utilizes the weight and genius of DaVinci's art.<br/><br/>With such dramatic locations, I don't see how this was screwed up so badly. Perhaps it was because I was stuck sitting waaay up front, but I noticed a *lot* of out of focus shots, and it wasn't just the projector, because the next shot would be fine. Someone needs to wake up the focus puller and get them to do their job!<br/><br/>**bad spoiler!!!**<br/><br/>The worst part about the film adaptation is the dumbing down of the material to make it less controversial. In the book, Sophie has a falling out with her grandfather because she sees him in a sexual ritual. In the movie, this is ever-so-briefly hinted at. This is a major omission because a) it motivates most of Sophie's actions and is a source of tension until the trust is formed between her and Langdon b) it contains one of the book's most accurate and damning jabs at misogynistic church doctrine. This was done almost certainly to ensure the film would get a PG-13 and not an R rating... opting for studio bottom line over artistic expression. Finally, I hardly see the justification of all the protests etc... when the film ends on such a dogmatic, pro-Christian note. Hanks' last lines were so horribly forced and so Hollywood ""you thought this was going to be controversial? Just kidding! We were on the side of hegemony all along!"""
"teejayniles2345","9","2","8","19 May 2006"," History - - written by the ""winners""
","I found the Ron Howard - Akiva Goldman collaboration to be on quite a set of parallel developments as the earlier A_BEAUTIFUL_MIND. The hero is quite a commendable figure and his feminine co-seeker is beautiful while never looking mussed-up or tired from the ordeals he puts her under. Like the Nobel Prize winner who observed a startling ""theory of equilibrium"", the hero-professor has a mind that solves millennium-old problems of a highly theoretical and conceptual level - - even resolving the difference in a riddle between ""the"" Pope and ""A"" Pope (i.e. Alexander Pope). Unlike a lot of the people who are wanting the film to be a clear extreme ""battle"" in the ongoing Culture War between believers and non-believers, I place the background material (2003 novel THE_da_Vinci_CODE) in the category of fiction, strictly tongue-in-cheek. I wish it had spent more time on Leonardo and a lot less on Emperor Constantine; the story of Jesus and Mary Magdalene will remain in the realm of the imaginative and can't be wholly decided as to the nature of their earthly relationship. While the best moments of the movie come when we're least expecting them (attacks by the deranged Silas who somehow has blue eyes while being an albino), the worst moments of the film come when the audience is presumed to already be fully initiated into what landmarks are in Paris (Louvre, Sant-Sulpice)and what's in London (Church of the Temple, Westminster burial site of Isaac Newton). As a puzzle-enthusiast I enjoyed the sequences that required us to do a certain rapid amount of anagram shuffling. What I didn't appreciate was the presumption that the blame for Crusades and Medieval Witch executions was some type of conspiracy that has had a ""lid"" on it until recent authors have opened and gathered all the clues. When you say that ""History"" is what you make it - - you have cut loose all the connections to what's reasonable and verifiable, granted that fair interpretation matters. I do believe that this film will last longer than the small-minded ""crusaders"" who dramatically view it as a threat to religion in general. Therefore, the Winners (Ron Howard, Akiva Goldman) have produced and directed a wacky and roller-coaster of a movie that can only be understood as fiction - - repeat after me - - only a story, only a story !"

","Sure, the book was excellent, but how was the movie? Well, its Ron Howard. The second most boring director in Hollywood. Once you get past that, the movie itself is intriguing enough to sit through. I have read the book as well, and yes my mind must be more interesting than Ron's... or he was just in it for the money... or in a rush... The performances are good- better in all scenes other than the Louvre, I don't think they had enough time there. Typically I scoff at religious, especially Christian, related works. And I generally think people, no matter who you are, should keep all of those related thoughts and ideals to themselves. This movie presents a different view of history. And if you're a woman I would suggest it. The true fact is that facts don't write stories. Writers do. The Bible is one story based on a few obscure facts, and The Davinci Code is another. If you live with logical process and reason, this movie is a version for you. I recommend this for all ages. And don't forget- no one on earth right now has offered any real physical proof that Jesus or Mary had ever existed at all. I call the consortium of modern religion ""Churchianity"" for a reason."

Critics tend to pounce on things when generally there is a great abound of hype surrounding. I am sure there is a great amount of bias in these reviews,It flopped in Europe, surprise, surprise. and is getting rave reviews in the America's. It would depend on your preference of beliefs.<br/><br/>Anyway back to the film, the runtime was perfect, even though i knew what was going to happen next. It is a dialogue heavy film, but it is so compelling. i think currant entertainment is dumbing down audiences, and i think with a few viewings of this film, people will see its true colours.<br/><br/>Mckellen displays a brave and colourful portrayal of Leah Teaburg, eccentric, charismatic aristocrat/historian, passionate about the astounding revelations that the puzzle implies.<br/><br/>The first scenes in 'code' with Mckellens character are likely the scenes that will divide audience and shock the religious, as he accounts the revelations of Mary Magdalene the sacred feminine and the holy bloodline with spite, it's potent stuff, but Mckellen is so wonderful in his characterization, undoubtedly an Oscar nod is on the horizon.<br/><br/>What can i say about The Da Vinci Code, visually rich, a provocative film with brave performances and brilliant direction.

","I work at a movie theater and one of the perks of the job is seeing movies before the general public. However, I rarely partake in this act because quite frankly, most movies nowadays don't interest me. However, this was one movie I had been waiting for for the last two years. Having read the book (and it's prequel, the even better (IMO) Angels and Demons), I could not wait to see this movie. Unfortunately, I left the theater last night a little bit disappointed. I know that 9 times out of 10 books will always be better than the movies, but I really thought, considering the source material, that this would be one of those rare exceptions. Now, I'm not saying that this was a bad movie, because it wasn't (despite what the critics are saying), but I expected more. The characters (with the exception of Teabing, played masterfully by Ian McKellan) lacked character. Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon was nowhere near as charismatic as his novel counterpart, although I don't blame Hanks for that. I blame the script. Despite being the lead character, Langdon didn't seem to have as big a role or nearly as many lines as I would have imagined. Another gripe I have with the film was that it didn't nearly get into as much detail about Da Vinci's art as it should have. The painting Madonna on the Rocks was especially neglected. However, the film does succeed in recreating that treasure hunt feel from the book. The chases, the twists, the turns, are all recreated, for the most part, faithfully.<br/><br/>I think people who come into the movie cold will most likely enjoy the movie most. My manager who previewed the film with me and some other co-workers absolutely loved the film and she said that she was on the edge of her seat the entire movie wanting to know what happened next.<br/><br/>As for the controversy, all I'm going to say is that in the bookstores this book is in the ""FICTION"" section. Keep that in mind."

","I enjoyed the first 10-20 minutes or so, but once the plot really kicked in, I lost interest very quickly. The script is long and bloated, packed with endless dialogue about history, religion, symbols, paintings, more history and more religion. A lot of it feels unnecessary and overdone. The trail of clues that the characters follow is slow and bogged down by all of these 'history lessons' that are fed to the audience along the way. After a while, all of the facts and clues just start to blend into one another.<br/><br/>You feel every second of the 2.5 hour runtime. The silly and contrived twists along the way don't help either. I personally cannot recommend it."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","13 June 2017"," As Trite As Religion Itself. A Bland, Overlong & Convoluted Conspiracy Theory.
","As tripe as religion itself, Ron Howard's The Da Vinci Code manages to create a sense of interest in its opening moments and is involving to a certain extent but the longer it goes on, the more absurd it becomes. Convoluted, inflated & packed with provocative Christian allegories, it's simply a series of nonsensical twists & turns that goes on for far too long.<br/><br/>The story of The Da Vinci Code follows an American symbologist & a French cryptographer as they team up to investigate a grisly murder the former is suspected of. With the help of clues present in Leonardo da Vinci's works, the two attempt to connect the dots and end up discovering a religious mystery that could shake the very foundations of Christianity.<br/><br/>Directed by Ron Howard (best known for Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind & Rush), The Da Vinci Code is intriguing at first, opening with the event that sets its story into motion, but it starts getting more n more confusing as the story progresses and its endless barrage of exposition crosses that fine line after which you just don't care where it's headed and wait for it to end.<br/><br/>While the storytelling aspect suffers from multitudes of issues, the technical aspects make the ride a little less frustrating. Set pieces are meticulously detailed, camera-work is fluid and captures each moment in a clear, concise fashion, and Hans Zimmer further enriches everything with an excellent score. Editing, however, is messed up and is unable to provide the level of transparency the picture required.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, the film features an impressive ensemble in Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina, Jean Reno & Paul Bettany but their respective characters lack the required depth. Hanks is in as Robert Langdon and is surprisingly wooden in the role, Tautou is often clueless & confused, not to mention that there's virtually no chemistry between the two. And the only good performance comes from McKellen.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Da Vinci Code garnered as much controversy as its source material at its time of release but it's one overlong, boring & bewildering conspiracy theory that isn't even worth the time or money. Whatever interest was generated within its first act goes out the window in the next, following which the story heads into the pretentious zone and unleashes one laughable twist after another before finally concluding on an unrewarding & forgettable note."

","Well, when we look at the movies which were made on the novels of Dan Brown i.e. Angels and demons and Inferno; The Da Vinci code is the best. The problem with Angels and Demons and Inferno was that these movies altered the story of the main novel and that's why if you have read the book and then you are watching the movie, the movie fails to impress you to the extent the book did. This is not the case with The Da Vinci code as the story line of the book and that of the movie are nearly same. The movie shows the history very beautifully with apt illustrations. The acting of Tom Hanks is commendable. The albino Silas also plays his role very smartly as is his role in the book. The background music in the movie is is very appealing to the audience and people feel as if they are in the movie ,as if everything is real. Do not go with the 6.6 rating on IMDb. It could have been that people who follow Christianity did not like this movie as it raises questions on their religion.However if that fact is ignored. there is no reason for not liking this movie."

When the book came out by Dan Brown it was taboo and just about anything that is taboo gets attention. But if you look as some aspect of this film as just fictional entertainment you just might enjoy this movie. Even if some parts just seems way too far-fetched or implausible and I am not talking about the spiritual or supernatural elements that are in the movie. It's still a well crafted and clever film. Watching this movie was like watching a way more entertaining, exciting and intelligent version of ""National Treasure"".

There is so much to tell that even with the original author on board for the screen play.<br/><br/>That is the reason this movie falls way short of what it could be. If you get the special DVD, this one sets a record for the most extras of any film. Once you watch enough extras, you realize there is a lack of depth in the story here too.

","My Take: A well-crafted and intriguing adaptation, Howard's self-importance notwithstanding. <br/><br/>After being a bestseller for many years, as well as being familiar to any literary adult, THE DA VINCI CODE arrived in theaters as one of 2006 biggest and most anticipated blockbusters. Directed by Academy-award winner Ron Howard and written by screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (whose works range from good ones like THE CLIENT and A BEAUTIFUL MIND to bad ones like BATMAN & ROBIN), THE DA VINCI CODE is bound to make a killing at the box-office, despite the fact that a lesser movie would have got better reviews than this did. I may be one of the very few people who hasn't read Brown's novel, but judging this, as a film, it's pretty good. So it does go on for two hours (some scenes look as if Howard was grooming this one up for an Oscar), but I was never bored. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks is just right as Robert Langdon, a symbolist sent to investigate the murder of a museum curator, who has strange markings written all over his dead body. The curator's granddaughter Sophie (Audrey Tautou) joins Langdon as he tries to configure a series of clues hidden in Da Vinci's paintings as well as other clues that could lead to a discovery that might change religion as we know it. Along the way, he is pursued by the French police Dept. lead by a Captain Fache (Jean Reno). Ian McKellen co-stars as Sir Leigh Teabing, a wealthy historian (and provides the best character in the film), as well as Paul Bettany as a tormented monk with a gun (Yeah! A gun.).<br/><br/>The film lacks the excitement it immensely requires. Although there are a certain amount of good car chase scenes, some of them are long and makes the film's already overlong run time longer. It's still good however, with its endless slew of code-crackings and riddle-solving (I was waiting for Indy Jones' father to ask ""This is what you call archeology?"" at any moment). There's a number of very intriguing plot turns, although the ending is still ludicrous. I haven't read Brown's novel, but the film ain't that bad at all. Catholic controversies aside, THE DA VINCI CODE is pure cinema, and not to be taken too seriously, and enjoy it for what it's worth.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."

","The notion that it was a huge bestseller and a stinker of a book is clearly without merit.<br/><br/>I had to laugh when I read the review on the title page where the critic complained that the movie followed the book too closely. Isn't the reverse the number 1 complaint on this website? That movies aren't true to the books they are based on.<br/><br/>The book was obviously very good based on the quality of the movie. The movie was also a hit with audiences (evidenced by ticket sales), despite the handicap of being unfairly castigated.<br/><br/>Howard is a good director, and his talent combined with the author's makes for a great mystery movie.<br/><br/>The reason this movie gets unfairly crucified is transparent. People can't handle the controversial story-line. Many of the critics are ironically intolerant because of their love for someone who suffered the ultimate intolerance. They are upset at a terrible sin: Questioning Christ's divinity. Those who are not religious dislike the movie because the very word ""Christ"" has become an epithet just like the word ""righteous"" has.<br/><br/>This movie is a fiction, but it touches on so many areas of non-fiction that it takes on the feel of realism. This is the movie's real sin to some. It provides a history lesson that is woven into a fictional history. But the rub is it could have an element of truth, since nobody alive today was around 2000 years ago to confirm everything that has been written.<br/><br/>In the end is it easier to believe that Christ was a man, with human wants and needs? Or was he a God? Regardless of which of those you believe you will be offended by this movie because it challenges your beliefs and understanding of history no matter what your beliefs are.<br/><br/>I think this is an excellent movie and deserves a rating much higher than 6.5."

","After being a long time admirer of both Tom Hanks and Ron Howard, I was personally disappointed that they would both be involved in the film version of a book that, as the Christian I am, I would disapprove. Either way, I was tempted enough to watch the movie. Well, besides the ever so present religious content, I was still left disappointed. It does have some good production values and good performances, average choral music and the classic chase sequences, one after the other. Being left horrified after watching Tom Hanks' incredibly disgusting hair do, and his notorious miscast from the entire film (I haven't read the book, but from what I have known, Robert Langdon was supposed to be way more younger)I pretty much was left speechless. Not because of the shock or the amazement that was the oh, so incredible secret (Jesus being married, which I oh, so incredibly didn't buy for a second) but because of the amazingly boring, pointless and anti-climatic middle and final acts, specially the way Langdon figures out the password. It was completely rushed, cheesy and pretentious, and in no way logical or explainable.<br/><br/>Funny, though. The film's title is ""The Da Vinci Code"", however, there was no real Da Vinci code in the whole story. The ""Apple"" password for the codex was what could almost pass as the title's reference, but, come on, you know that wasn't the story's center.<br/><br/>The whole crew was focused on the controversy around the idea of Jesus Christ being married and having kin (which, if you read your own Bible, doesn't make any sense), and the producers spent more time trying to make it more of an impact, that they totally left everything else unattended.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen's so called ""Explanation"" was more paranoid and confusing than accurate. So what if Holy Gail in french means the same as Royal Blood? What does that have to do with anything?<br/><br/>I thought the movie was pretentious and not very smart. I mean ""You could be the descendant of Jesus Christ"" doesn't sound like a real or likely dialog to be said, or written. Besides, WE ARE ALL SONS OF GOD, if you didn't hear the preacher's latest sermon.<br/><br/>My general recommendation for any reader is to avoid this movie. And not because of the religious aspect, I couldn't care less whether the viewer was life changed about it or not. It is really a boring, anti-climatic and self indulgent work, and a not very good adaptation from its source material. It's just an excuse from Hollywood to capitalize for a sensitive and popular theme. <br/><br/>National Treasure was much, much better than this."
"ktwebb68","4","1","3","13 December 2007"," Bad book, marginal movie
","With the ridiculous book as a source it was an uphill battle for this movie to be anything other than ridiculous as well. The movie however did have the benefit of a 2 hour, or so, format. The book is interesting for about 3 or 4 chapters before it spins into absurd puzzles, mazes, and riddles. By the middle of the book, it's virtually unreadable. I finished it but it was painful.<br/><br/>The movie never grows nearly as tiresome as the incredibly overrated book, but it does suffer from the same over the top tendencies. The script, given the text from which to draw, was decent. The scenery and cinematography typical Howard. Good to better than good. It's no Apollo 13, and cinematography masterpiece, but The Davinci Code is compelling visually.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks. Multi academy award winner, all around likable fellow, and a fine actor. Terribly miscast here. I was never able to buy in to him in this lead role.<br/><br/>I would say this is a watchable movie if you haven't read the book. If you have, well if you like the book I really couldn't begin to guess if you'll like the movie because you clearly have some issues with quality, but if you are like most sane people and think the book is complete rubbish, then the movie will be a bit more of the same. Sunday afternoon on HBO perhaps. Spending money at the rental store, definitely not."

","I am a big fan of a number of the major players in this movie - particularly Audrey and Jean - which is why it's so depressing to see how bad the movie is. I hate to think of how they must of suffered in executing the horrendous script - which is predictable, and shockingly bad at times. Amazing how terrible even Tom Hanks' performance is in this movie as his plods through ridiculous lines. It seems that you can almost see him thinking to himself how awful it all was. How did this happen? The storyline has a lot of potential. Ron Howard is a respectable and talented mainstream movie maker.

","This isn't to put down the fine cast and expression of sublime ideas that cause everyone to catch their breath the first time they hear them. It's just the nature of the ideas.<br/><br/>For those of you who were not swept up in The Da Vinci Code book, it was quite the page turner: An author and scholar specializing in cultural symbols, Dr. Langdon, visits Paris, France, to deliver a series of lectures. As he is finishing one of them, a police inspector (Fache) approaches him and insists Langdon accompany him to the Louvre. <br/><br/>We see all this evidence hidden in plain sightthank you, Leo, Giordano Bruno, and othersof the natural, normal, healthy, human, sexual, realistic Jesus (and Mary!there's definitely something about Mary) alternative to the asexual divinity myth of Christ contrived by sick, powerlusting men to foster mass psychosis. As I see more and more, I'm driven toward wanting to discover what the scholarship really tells us.<br/><br/>I.e. I stop really worrying or caring much about the fictional characters and what they're up to. This is the unfortunate curse for Dan Brown qua novelist, that he's presenting this earthshaking nonfiction that trivializes his fiction. He certainly isn't a bad novelist, nor of course is Ron Howard a bad director. It's simply that the suppression of facts in reality is far more interesting (to me) than the suppression of facts in a novel or movie. ...<br/><br/>For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.<br/><br/>Brian Wright Copyright 2007"

","When respected American religious symbology expert Dr. Robert Langdon is summoned to the Louvre by the French version of the FBI, led by Captain Bezu Fache, he soon discovered that he is the #1 suspect for the murder of a historian Langdon had been scheduled to meet with. Assisted by a French cryptographer and government agent named Sophie, Langdon is challenged to decipher a chain of cryptic codes and puzzles, all the while trying to stay ahead of Fache's lawmen in a chase through the Louvre, and out into the Parisian cityscape, and finally across the channel to England. Can Langdon and Sophie decipher the nature of a secret dating back to Leonardo Da Vinci and earlier before those responsible for the historian's murder add them to their hit list? Like many people, I've read the book, which was really good with a decent ending. It's actually one of the better books I've read. I had my own perspective on the book and ran through the scenes in my mind as a chase thriller. What I've seen in the movie might not be close to this perspective as I thought as I hoped.<br/><br/>Like National Treasure, I wanted this movie to be a chase thriller. I wanted it to be thrilling and suspenseful like another other chase movie. Let me say this: The first hour was a let down. It was not suspenseful or thrilling. It was rather boring and uninteresting. It could've been a lot better. Well, it should have, after what the book has set up.<br/><br/>With that being said, let's move on to the remaining of the film (the second full hour). Now, it gets interesting. The boring string score you heard in the first hour gets more involved and suspenseful. There's more action and it's more intriguing. Since the second half of the movie is more than the first half, I liked the movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' performance was decent, not at all that great. On the other hand, I liked Audrey Tautou's performance. The supporting casts, like Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, and Paul Bettany, were also decent. I didn't really mind the revisions in the film. It wasn't annoying or that at all different from the book. I have to say, though, that if I had not read the book, the movie would have been confusing.<br/><br/>This isn't a great adaptation as Harry Potter, but it is decent. The movie had some good special effects, great production design, and some good cinematography. Yeah, I liked National Treasure a lot better but if you're a fan of the book, you might as well see this and hope what you get is good."
"cblackburn12","8","1","3","28 March 2007"," Good movie, better book
","After having read the book and hearing friends talk about how much worse the movie was than the book, I have to be honest and say that I had low expectations when I rented the movie. The book went into so much depth about art, religion, and the conspiracy behind the holy grail that I was sure there was no way the movie could even come close to replicating that amount of detail, and explain the story the way it was originally written. Dan Brown did a great job with the book which right from the beginning set Ron Howard, the director of the film at a disadvantage as people have preconceptions as to how the movie should look. With a book every reader comes up with his or her own picture of the characters in their head, and when the movie comes out a majority are usually disappointed because the characters on screen do not match the ones created in his or her head. Taking all this into account I actually thought the movie was pretty good considering the difficulties they had to overcome. The acting in the movie was outstanding which is not uncharacteristic of Tom Hanks, but I was also impressed by the lead female role of the movie played by Audrey Tautou who did an excellent job of playing the curator's granddaughter. The supporting roles in the film were also great with actors perfectly cast for their parts. The plot of the movie was significantly different from the book in some parts which in most books turned movies has bothered me in the past (Sahara, The Bourne Supremacy, etc). However, with this movie I felt that it almost added some excitement because I wasn't entirely sure what the screen writers included or changed for the movie. One other positive aspect of the movie was the directing. I thought Ron Howard did an excellent job directing what had to be a very difficult film to direct. Turning a best selling book into a movie is hard enough in any case, but with a book that received so much acclaim and criticism at the same time, this film had to have been extra challenging. One of the few negative aspects of the film was the actual filming or editing in that the contrast of the movie was entirely too dark. I think a lot of the detail of the film was lost due to this problem. I thought it might just be my eyes but a few of the other reviews have had similar comments. I know I said that changing some of the aspects of the movie was good but in a few instances I thought it took away too much from the book. One example is the removal of the second cryptex in the movie. In the book a second cryptex was discovered which was completely removed in the movie version. Another thing missing in the movie is the part where Langdon and the granddaughter fall in love at the end. I know that almost every single movie ends with the guy getting the girl but in this case I thought it was an appropriate ending to the book. I tried not to compare the book to the movie too much because the movie will almost always lose but in this case I thought the film's ending fell a little short compared to the book's ending. Overall, I thought the movie was well directed, well acted, and well scripted with only a few disappointing aspects. I got my moneys worth and am definitely going to buy the DVD when it comes out. Although I don't think I will go for the extra bonus edition with a complimentary cryptex included!"
"MovieKen","5","1","3","11 March 2007"," A so-so that could have been better
","Of all the films I've seen recently, this one has the most mixed reviews. I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, so I tried to keep an open mind. What I saw was a film that was at times extremely well done and at other times, extremely mediocre. I found this film to be mostly uninteresting but sometimes thought-provoking. Maybe that's why it has so many mixed reviews. <br/><br/>This really isn't director Ron Howard's best work. To me, it really seems as if he has just followed a ""how to"" manual on making movies. Here is the movie in a nutshell:<br/><br/>1) There is a ""shocking"" scene. 2) The good guys find a clue. 3) The bad guys find the good guys. 4) There is a chase scene. 5) The good guys somehow barely escape. 6) The good guys stand/sit/walk/etc. and talk about what happened and what it means. 7) The good guys talk more about history and we see a little mini-movie while they talk about it. 8) Go back to step 1 and start over.<br/><br/>Repeat steps 1-8 until you've wasted 2.5 hours of everyone's time. <br/><br/>This kind of directing is just too tedious for my taste, and I really don't like movies that depend so much on dialog like this one does. I wish the director hadn't assumed the viewers were so stupid that all we could understand was chase scenes. I think it's insulting to the audience to have a film that has 5 minutes of visuals alternated by 15 minutes of discussion. Ron Howard seems to not understand one of the first rules of movie directing: you SHOW the audience what's happening instead of having the characters TELL the audience what's happening.<br/><br/>There are many things I liked about this movie, and many things I didn't like. But the bottom line is that this movie seemed to be about half-way done. It looks like a rough draft, not a final product. With a better script, better acting, and better directing, this could have been a fine movie. As it stands now, it's best left unwatched. Read the book instead."

","This is a movie of 7 stars based on a 10 stars book.<br/><br/>This great novel has been constructed all with real historic characters, real places and real pieces of art, but the events are fictitious. What makes you feel a movie in which your religion basis are questioned?, well, for me as catholic, it made me open my eyes, and finally love more the faith and ethical values of it. The historical data of the life of Jesuschrist can have been manipulated by men in past years, but the feeling of having a more human Christ as a basis of our religion is beautiful.<br/><br/>The movie is the story of Robert Langdon, an expert in symbols (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu, a cryptologist (Audrey Tatou) in an investigation about the murder of the Louvre's museum curator; these events start a quest trough codes, symbols, clues that are meant to resolve one of the most uncovered and deep secrets of the catholicism. The polemic facts shown here to the religion and specially to the Opus Dei have been matter of large discussions, research and opinions after the book was published.<br/><br/>This movie is far from the quality of the book, and some parts of the book are changed, it could have been a better movie, maybe if a different director had took the challenge. But taking these polemic subjects to the screen is memorable, for a time when you have to open your mind, and hold to the really important things of life.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks has a very bad acting, Audrey Tatou does bad too and Jean Reno is pretty normal, Ron Howard directing is terrible!<br/><br/>I recommend that if you haven't read the book, then don't watch this movie, because it can spoil it. But after that, watch the movie, so you can place visually in the art pieces, places, churches and all the things that you constructed in your mind while reading.<br/><br/>7 star for this movie, great locations, filming and composition of the characters, but lack of heart and passion to go deepest in the subject, and for not achieving the level of an incredible book."

","As theology goes, I find many of the religious zealots who overreact to anything and everything that says something slightly disparaging about what they believe in, to be people of extremely questionable character. Think of Brittany Spears with her head shaved and you get a picture of what some of the loonies are like when movies of this ilk are released. The same contingent lost their minds when Kevin Smith did Dogma. I will never understand this mindset as this film is fiction, most of it anyway. But when you protest and march and try to shut films down because they tell a different side to what you believe in, you show more of your insecurities than your conviction.<br/><br/>I preface the review with this little digression because I will never understand how a film can evoke so much emotion when the book was released under the fictional section at your local Chapters. I didn't get the memo that said it was non fiction. Now, do I believe that much of what the book subscribes to could be true? Absolutely! And at the very least, it is an alternate to what the Bible tells you. Kind of like watching Oliver Stone's JFK. I'm sure not all of it is true, but it is certainly a substitute to the Warren Commission and what they reported.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's The DaVinci Code is quite faithful to Dan Brown's novel. It is not quite as frenetic as the book, and not quite as in depth, but it does a fairly adequate job of retelling the story for a world wide audience. As the story goes, Leonardo DaVinci ostensibly has a secret that is revealed cryptically in his paintings. It is an age old secret that is guarded by a very select few. It is a secret so shocking and so nefarious that it could change the way people see religion, the church and all that it encompasses. This is a secret that has been guarded for centuries by groups like the Masons, and presumably the Illuminati, which is rumoured to include powerful names like Newton, Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The story goes all the way back to the 11th century when it is told that a massive treasure was discovered by a village priest who kept it secret enough and then suddenly fell into power. Many men lost their lives trying to protect the treasure. Now what this treasure is, no one really knows. But it subscribes to the theory that there is a secret society that controls the banks, finance, governments and every other powerful faction in the world. If this secret were to get out, it could devastate the balance of world power.<br/><br/>This is where our story begins. Tom Hanks plays Dr. Rober Langdon who is in France giving a lecture when he is picked up by the police so they can use his expertise in understanding a recent murder that took place in a museum. When he arrives, he sees that it is his friend Jacques Sauniere, who is a world renowned expert on the Holy Grail. Initially Langdon thinks he is there to provide any information he can to help out. But he is actually the prime suspect in the murder. When he eventually meets Saunierre's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, they embark on an adventure to clear Langdon of the charges that he is innocent of, and along the way we discover names like The Priory of the Sion, the Merovingian (remember the name from the Matrix Relaoded) and the Last Supper. All of these names are connected somehow and once it is all revealed, it is one of the most interesting twists in any film. Since most of us have read the book, the twist is no longer shocking, but it does rank up there with the Sixth Sense for pure shock value.<br/><br/>Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have created a fine film, in spite of what some have said. It moves at a breakneck pace, is blessed with likable actors like Hanks and Ian McKellen and Amelie's Audrey Tautou, and if you like religious obscurities and nebulous mythology, then this film should please you. If, however, you are a zealot who marches against freedom of expression, lay down your 5 bucks at the video store and rent it. When no one is around to see that you are actually enjoying a piece of fiction, you might even crack a smile. And there's nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>The DaVinci Code is a well made film and one of the best of 2006. It is certainly one of the most entertaining of last year. And if you are interested to see where Brown got some of his ideas, buy the book the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, the 1980's best seller that spawned the controversy.<br/><br/>9/10"
"joposa","5","1","3","4 February 2007"," Amateurish, but not void of entertainment
","Some of my criticism here is directed at the book version, but the film is a faithful adaptation, so some of that criticism applies to the film as well.<br/><br/>First, let me start by saying that the film, like the book, is indeed fiction, but the book was first billed as an expose, in novel form, of the ""true"" history of Christianity. That is what made it such a bestseller, not the plot line. It was initially used as a historical reference by people who had an ax to grind with Church (""read the Da Vinci code, it's all there!"" read one message on a message board by one anti-Church individual). Author Dan Brown enthusiastically proclaimed its historical accuracy, in carefully controlled interviews (I could just imagine him on ""The O'Reilly Factor""!) and on the book's ""fact"" page. Some felt threatened at first, not for themselves, but for those masses less educated about Church history. I heard comments from one person, a Catholic, who loved the book and defended it as pure fiction, but nonetheless was mislead by some of the historical claims, such as the nail-biter vote at the Council of Nicea that decided Christ's divinity, and that Council's decision of which books would be regarded as sacred scripture. Actually, the vote was more like about 300-2, and did not decide Christ's divinity, which was never in question, but rather Alexandrian priest Arius' teaching that Christ, while part of the Trinity, was created by, and not equal to, the Father. And that Council did not address the issue of scripture. Emperor Constantine called the council, but was not a participant, and attended only a few sessions. <br/><br/>Any threat the book might have posed soon subsided as a result of the sub-genre of books and documentaries that came out to debunk the ""Da Vinci"" myths. These were done by REAL historians, not moonbat conspiracy theorists. Only then did Brown begin to back off some from his claims that the book is fact-based, and only then did the ""hello, it's fiction!"" defense start. <br/><br/>I can't judge the movie by all these same standards since Ron Howard has maintained from the beginning that it's only fiction. However, some say the movie shouldn't be judged by historical accuracy. Why shouldn't it? How would ""Gone With The Wind"" be judged if it were Richmond, and not Atlanta, that was burned? Even ""The Wizard Of Oz"" wouldn't escape severe criticism if it had been a Kansas hurricane, rather than a tornado, that sent Dorothy spiraling into munchkin land. Why the double standard? <br/><br/>A brief word about the acting: I was not impressed by most of it. Nobody stood out as great, but Tom Hanks was not himself, and lent nothing more than name recognition; Audry Tautou was sleepwalking; and Paul Bettany was comic bookish as the murderous Albino monk (are there any good Albinos in movies?). <br/><br/>And, okay, last time: his name was not Da Vinci! it was Leonardo, and he was from a town called Vinci (in Italian), so calling him Da Vinci is like calling Joan of Arc ""of Arc"".<br/><br/>I give the movie five stars because it is not devoid of entertainment value, Paris is an interesting setting, and because moonbat theories are, if nothing else, fun.<br/><br/>ADDENDUM: <br/><br/>To the reviewer in Vienna, Austria, who says that Christians who are offended by the conspiracy theories in the book and movie are no better than Islamic radicals who reacted with violence as a result of the ""Mohammed"" cartoons: Do you seriously feel that way? No better at all? How many Christians reacted with violence? How many riots were there? Did either Dan Brown or Ron Howard need police protection? To establish any moral equation between these two reactions is completely irrational!"

","""The Da Vinci Code"" is the most over hyped/disappointing movie, next to ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" of 2006. That does not mean it is a bad movie, or horrible movie. Unfortunately, it also does not mean it is a good movie. It is just an okay movie. It is worth to watch but you should not expect much from it.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" is a movie based on the popular novel by Dan Brown. Robert Langdon is in Paris on business when he is summoned to The Louvre. A dead body has been found. Suddenly Langdon, with the help of a Cryptologist and a British Royal Historian, sets off on an adventure to unravel an ancient secret that has been hidden for over two thousand years. Can he decipher that code, well you will just have to read the book or watch the movie to find out.<br/><br/>The main flaw of this movie is the pacing. It is a very slow-paced movie. It was very hard to sit through the 2 hours and 29 minutes runtime. There is an extended cut, not out in the United States, which is 2 hours and 54 minutes long, which would have been even harder to get through. It is so dialog driven that the movie turned from what could have been an interesting mystery thriller to an extended history class you are forced to be a part of. This reviewer had not read the book, so it all felt a little overwhelming.<br/><br/>The saving point of this movie, or at least what made this from getting a lower review, is the acting. As mentioned in the last paragraph, this reviewer had not read the book, so there will not be any comparisons to the characters in the book. Of course, Tom Hanks is always professional, and it is the same with his portrayal of Robert Langdon. Audrey Tautou, while her French accent was very difficult to understand, was good as Sophie Neveau. Ian McKellen was great as Sir Leigh Teabing. Jean Reno was in there too as Captain Bezu Fache. Paul Bettany stole the show as the murderous albino monk, Silas. Alfred Molina as the Bishop, Manuel Aringarosa was also good.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while there were some good thrilling parts, the information was just too much and it was overwhelming. At least with a book like this, you can pause, write notes, and eventually stop when it gets to be overwhelming. The movie is not as bad as some people has made them out to be, Ron Howard does not even deserve a Razzie for the direction of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" but it was not outstanding either. One thing ""The Da Vinci Code"" movie does well is makes you, and mainly the people who did not read the book, want to read the novel. Unfortunately, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is only recommended to those who have read the book!"

","Dan Brown's book was basically an old fashioned conspiracy thriller and could have been written by Robert Ludlum or even John Buchan. Potboliers like the Da Vinci Code can make terrific movies in the right hands, the Bourne Identity is a good example. Unfortunately Ron Howard has made a slow, lifeless movie with no tension and characters you don't really care about. The direction was unimaginative and too passive for an action thriller. On the whole it felt like a TV-movie. <br/><br/>The film's hero is an innocent American abroad, who stumbles into a strange world of intrigue and murder. There are safe deposit boxes, police chases through Paris and a damsel in distress. Hanks is pursued by a mysterious organization that will stop at nothing to protect its secret. Hanks is on a roller-coaster ride trying to avoid police capture and is very much in the dark as to the identity of his adversaries until the inevitable twist at the end. The plot is very similar to the 39 Steps and on the whole its a very predictable thriller apart from the ""secret"". Most of the experts seem to doubt that Christ and Mary Magdelene married and had a child, although its a clever idea. The other stuff about the battles between the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and the Knights Templar just seemed slightly ridiculous. <br/><br/>The acting was disappointing. Tom Hanks looked bored and disinterested. He's probably made so much money, he doesn't care anymore. Ian McKellen, Paul Bethany and Alfred Molina hammed it up outrageously. Audrey Tautou wasn't quite pretty or sexy enough as the heroine. The dialog was wooden and predictable. Ron Howard may have shot this film down a coal mine because all the scenes are dark and gloomy. Doug Liman or Paul Greengrass would have turned this into a more exciting film."

In fact, most history buffs know, some of the things depicted in the film aren't historical at all, but that's another story...<br/><br/>As to the movie review, I enjoyed the film. It was entertaining. We all know Ron Howard can cut film. Tom Hanks is a very good, well, excellent character actor (although this film is really more of an ""action lead"" role), he is very believable in the ""average guy thrust into mortal danger"" type situation.<br/><br/>I did figure out who the true bad guy was sort of early (I won't give that away though), but still enjoyed watching to see if any of the other characters caught on. You have to pay close attention, because there are several major characters that move in and out of the story, just as one storyline advances they go back to another one.<br/><br/>One thing I wondered about though, they spent so much on the ""secret societies"" of Opus Dei and the Templars---in a ""church conspiracy"" type of mystery, but didn't touch on the Rosicrucians the Masons, or any other conspiracy ripe protagonists. Sort of curious, but oh, well.<br/><br/>Now I can understand, to a degree, why some of the 'faithful' may be upset. It's why, quite frankly, I don't discuss religion with most people, because when one is raised in a tradition, for a lifetime, and suddenly hears things that dispute whatever that tradition or faith is, be it, alternate theology, textual criticisms, alternate gospels, and so on and so forth, they many times feel threatened and upset But religious beliefs are based, and predicated upon faith, and as someone stated previously, if you have faith (whatever that faith is), then a movie, or book, or discussion, should not affect that faith. Finally, as an American, I feel quite angered when ANYONE tries to tell me what I should and should not read, or see, or discuss. Remember many of those that condemn this film the most, have never seen it, and never intend to. It's entertainment, nothing more. Calm yourselves."

This DVD, like the film, might not be like a good wine that improves with decades of aging or a good cheese that gets finer and finer with weeks and months of patient loving care in some cool cave or cellar. But this film is the most inevitable and unfathomable film of many years, just like the book it has grown out of, just like the DVD now with its extra 25 minutes and its two hours of extra resources. Don't ever try to watch it in French. It has to be watched and enjoyed in English, that is to say in its multilingual version : English, French, Italian and Latin. It has to be appreciated in its shooting language to enjoy the subtle finesse of the contrasting accents of the actors and actresses. The French actors and actresses are nicely airing some kind of light French flavoring, while the Americans and English actors and actresses are mesmerising and hypnotising us with the two mid-Atlantic and British linguistic brothers, though avoiding the Scottish cousin that could have sprinkled the end with its gravelly roughness. You will enjoy the scenery : the Louvre of course, but also Westminster Abbey, which is revealed in the DVD as being nothing but Lincoln's cathedral (a film is the ultimate illusion but a DVD is the ultimate revelation), Saint Sulpice's and Rosslyn's Chapel, Place de la Concorde and various Triumph Arks (an allusion to the albino Noah's ark ?), the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben, the French police and their distant cousins from Scotland Yard, the nicely sectarian Opus Dei and the just as much sectarian anti-religious French spirit. You will let yourself dive and delve deep into the mysteries and the riddles, the enigmas and the secret codes, just for the fun of a nice red apple that you will get at the end of the game and present to your teacher in divinities, Dan Brown or Tom Hanks who are benedictally brown nosing with us and maybe with the catholic church. You will discover a crypt under Rosslyn Chapel that the Saint Clair owners refuse to acknowledge. Maybe it does not exist. You will imagine a crypt under the Louvre's inverted pyramid that President Mitterrand secretly buried as a homage to the Merovingian kings (since he believed he was the new King of France), to Jesus Christ who has always inspired French politicians who are obviously sacrificing their many lives to the cross of politics, to the masonic pyramid of the famous greenback dreamt by Benjamin Franklin when he was strolling along the Seine river as the first US ambassador to Paris a couple of centuries ago, and Mitterrand has always imagined himself as being God in person, the father of that poor Jesus. You will in your turn dream of Mary Magdalene, the chalice of a promise, Jesus Christ, the silice of a Passion, and Leonardo Da Vinci, the most ambiguous vision and smile of a Mona Lisa who has forever captivated the attention of the world's past present and future innumerable generations. You will probably never get an answer to all your questions but at least you will get the questions and be able to store them in the back of your mind, in some drawer in the portmanteau of your brain. Enjoy the trip and intensify it with a dose of claustrophobia, if you can get one from some street dealer of quick extra-terrestrial pleasures in some Parisian park or garden for the pathetic sum of fifty euros (I defy you to find a junky ready to sell you his equipment for the miserable sum of fifty euros, even in the Bois de Boulogne). And the DVD will not answer any question but will add some more mysteries and secrets to the list of all those you have already accumulated through the book, the film and now the extended version of the DVD.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne"

","It was confusing and had little interest for me of any kind. I am a person of faith and that's of no issue. The movie was simply not entertaining, it made no sense. Why would any religious sect if it knew the truth about Christ decide to skewer the truth? This and other stupidities make the movie not worth your time! I found the action scenes to be boorish and disgusting. To have a perversion of faith that would call for self-mutilation to atone for murder. It's awful junk. There is no atonement for murder. The characters seem to come out of nowhere and have little purpose the backgrounds of the characters were not explained in any concise manner. Perhaps though even with explanation nobody would care. Since the movie seemed absurd and stupid in its assumptions its assertions etc to me in any case. And as I think now I can't even remember the plot I didn't care. It seemed that the movie tried to be like the book but didn't succeed in being like the book or being a very good movie either."
"DrunkenMasterIV","4","1","3","8 January 2007"," Two Hours Is Not Enough Time
","The movie ""The Da Vinci Code"" is amazingly bland in comparison to the book. The whole problem with the movie is that all of the ""eureka moments"" from the first half of the book are just skipped over without any fanfare. The murder scene at the beginning of the movie in the Louvre is central to the plot and in the book the finding of the clues at the scene, and the discovery of the Da Vinci paintings are filled with suspense and detailed explanations of the symbology, and anagrams. In the movie Langdon, and Sophie run around like characters on ""Supermarket Sweep"" discovering clues and filing them away. Langdon and Sophie almost seem to be checking items off of a list as if they were on a scavenger hunt.<br/><br/>Did anyone else think ""Da Vinci"" wasn't featured prominently enough in this film called ""The Da Vinci Code?"" I did. The analysis of the imagery in ""Madonna Of The Rocks"" was fascinating in the book, but in the movie the emphasis was on the fluorescent magic marker writing on the painting. There was no mention of any hidden imagery.<br/><br/>I think the problem was essentially that two hours is not enough to explain all of the nuances of ""The Da Vinci Code."" The result is a muddled mess of flashbacks, poorly explained plot twists, and double-crossing characters. <br/><br/>A family member who never read the book was really frustrated trying to decipher what was going on at various points. For readers of the book it makes sense, but for the unfamiliar following the film may be a challenge. The makers of the film made a valiant effort, but the book (especially the first half of the book) is a lot more fun. Two hours is not enough time to capture the energy of ""The Da Vinci Code."""

Those who opposed this film for religious reasons must *imho* ask themselves if their pattern of faith is really such a solid one to enrich their lifes (as it should be) or rather narrowing it down if their belief gets disturbed by such an unsubstantial discounter-heresy. Sorry, no offense given... The entire movie as a statement about confessions, religion and history is totally pointless. It's neither a valuable source to trigger a religion-based argument nor even a decent discussion about theological perspectives. The provoking"" theories shown here are as such nothing new and apart of that actually shouldn't tremble no one's faith. Even IF Jesus had a woman (or even if he was a woman): so what?

","Robert (Tom Hanks) is an expert on historical signs and symbols. Giving a lecture in Paris, he is suddenly summoned by the police to aid an investigation. It seems a gentleman at the Louvre was killed but managed to write a message in blood on his body. While giving his opinion, Robert is caught up in a very tangled cat and mouse game, along with Sophie (Audrey Tautou), between the police and other forces. Robert and Sophie's lives are at stake and so are the secrets long kept by various Catholic societies. Just what is going down? This is an interesting movie, despite its slow story and shadowy look. Hanks and Tautou are great as the souls caught in an intrigue without a compass. Paul Bettany is downright scary as a terrorist Catholic monk. The tale is a bit wandering and long and the decision to shoot the film under a cover of darkness may turn off a few viewers. But, not many. For those who read the book and, for those who did not, here is a movie that has a sensational tale to tell, no matter the final production values. Most folks who sit down to watch the film will find it a great popcorn and soda kind of affair. What is more, the film may inspire people from all faiths and backgrounds to delve more into the world of history, both of Christ and of the Catholic church.

","Notoriously controversial adaptation of the best selling novel dealing with secret historical codes, evil priests, and pursuit of the holy grail fizzled out as soon as it premiered last year in the theaters for many reasons. While I applaud the producers for taking popcorn entertainment down an unusual route, Ron Howard and constant collaborator Akiva Goldsman just miss the mark in too many ways to effectively put across a film of this magnitude with their immature adaptation. Let us not criticize the movie more then it should be however; the insane amount of pre-release hype and controversy coupled with the subsequent and immediate, intense letdown upon arrival surely embittered and affected many of our more cynical viewers upon rating the movie. The Da Vinci code is a refreshing pop movie, with some historical heft thrown in for fan appeasement. This material could have been interpreted in so many different ways, from dumbed down adventure fare, to stodgy intellectualism mired by historic observation. The team behind the movie adaptation do succeed at combining these two traits into something that is more accessible to the most amount of potential viewers, leaving fans of Indiana Jones type exploration or history buffs alike open for a relationship, it is just that they explore both of these avenues in very shallow, yet awkwardly scripted ways. Fans of the book already have much working against their favor with Hanks being a major miscast and the general dumbing down that comes along with adapting for Hollywood. However, viewers who didn't get on that gigantic trend that was the book a few years ago, and leave their willingness to criticize and take seriously at home (in another words, normal folk who go to the movies to be entertained, not snobs like us), will find themselves at the least mildly entertained and hopefully even a little more intrigued at this glossed over, but still, age old mystery."

","How many people might approve of the interference of their will into the faith in God? Believe it or not, regardless of your religion, there have been so many mysteries and miracles throughout the entire human history. (If you are not a believer of the history, just simply ignore it.) Long time aspiration for adventures and challenges against the nature has continued their inspiration to the human being who had been struggling with his/her own hopes and wishes for the exploration of the universe and its understanding. The more they reach out to the truth, the more they are, at a loss. For all those who are in search for any reasonable answer, the truth seems so much far from the originality of the subject connected. Mathematical theories and all philosophical complications are simply calling for another piece of puzzles unresolved. Therefore, in the presence of the human frailty, remaining is only the weakness of the human being before God. How far can you afford your living without God, I cannot tell. But would your wishful thoughts for such life as this give you the answer to this question? God willings. I must ask, therefore, to be importuned no further on the subject."

The Da Vinci Code is based on a novel, not history or fact, but rather on a series of wrong assumptions which makes it a good thriller, that's all. I am a Muslim, not a Jew or a Christian. We believe in Moses and Jesus Christ as Prophets of God and we also believe that they are human beings with a message to humanity same the Prophet Mohammed, last God's messenger on earth.

","Christians are a gutless lot.<br/><br/>Whenever a new fiction dares question their established fiction, they turn into the very backbiting, provincial bigots they accuse everyone else of being.<br/><br/>The ""new"" fiction is Dan Brown's novel, *The Da Vinci Code*. The ""established"" fiction is *How to Murder with Impunity*, otherwise known as *Common Sense for Dummies*, aka *The Holy Bible* (the word ""holy,"" as always, used in its most broad and ambiguous sense.) Through director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, Brown's fable has been demoted to Over-Hyped Hollywood Movie, bringing out the backbiters in force, which says something about the condescending attitude religious leaders harbor towards their ""sheep"" (so judiciously termed), whom they do not trust to think for themselves. <br/><br/>In order to ""save"" their flock from  who knows what they're afraid of (maybe ""independent thought"")?  and proving once again that they have absolutely no faith (that's the million dollar word, right?) in the supposedly omnipotent invisible guy they claim can do just about anything, religious leaders take it upon themselves to attempt stymieing this harmless, edge-of-boring media. Trickling this attitude down to the sheep themselves, we end up with protests and undue animosity towards free-thinkers, which of course, eventually escalates to murder and topless dancing.<br/><br/>I have not read the book. Apparently, it's a page-turner. Or a well-marketed fad. But *The Da Vinci Code* movie - for all its touting of ""shaking the foundations of Christianity"" - is just not all that compelling.<br/><br/>Threatening to bog itself in esoteric jargon and weighted with *faux-gravitas*, this fable posits an interesting twist to that hoary tale of virgins and saviors and whores (oh my!), maintaining that Jesus took Magdalene as his wife and sired a bloodline that exists today. (I'm already feeling unholy.) Symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks, sporting Vitruvian Man mane, and working from his Handbook on Furrowed Brows) and Detective Sophie Neveu (dull Audrey Tautou) find themselves embroiled in a murder frame-up which leads them on a Quest for The Holy Grail, no less (without the aid of Monty Python, who undertook The Quest 30 years ago on a smaller budget in a superior film).<br/><br/>Pursued by Detective Fache (Jean Reno), and by a self-flagellating, Opus Dei albino monk (Paul Bettany), who kills with the blessing of the church (which is what Christianity is *all about*), Langdon and Neveu seek asylum with the old man from Scene 24, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), a Grail expert, who exposits most of the ""sacrilegious"" aspects of this tale, invoking Leonardo Da Vinci, Sir Isaac Newton, The Knights Who Say Templar, the fictional Priory of Scion and the real  though not self-flagellating  Opus Dei order (a kind of cult within the larger cult of the Christian church).<br/><br/>Trapped between the desire to deliver a ""summer blockbuster"" and to stay true to the cerebral nature of Brown's text, Howard serves us a kind of *Columbo* episode on crank, where clues and riddles click into place like jigsaws. Though it delivers on the mystery and mental levels, the movie trips over in its execution.<br/><br/>*The Da Vinci Code* is intriguing, yet far-fetched enough not to affect any person over the Age of Reason. Unfortunately, Christianity has no place for reason.<br/><br/>And what most scares religious leaders is not that this world-shaking fictional ""secret"" is *provable*  exactly the opposite! The secret is itself based on ""faith""! Who is going to test Jesus for his DNA? So how can anyone prove, through documents or riddles alike, or by chopping down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring, that they are of JC's bloodline? The real life church is scared not because it believes its followers will intelligently discern that *The Da Vinci Code* is guff; it is scared because it knows its followers already have the propensity to believe inexplicable malarkey  they've been feeding it to those followers for the past 2000 years! Lose enough followers to other religions/cults/Reason and your ""church"" is demoted to merely ""cult"" status (where it rightfully belongs), with no tax exemptions or impunity to fiddle with boys.<br/><br/>Langdon cracks the final code on the strength of a fallacy. In recalling Newton's grave, he remarks that ""all the orbs were represented, but one  the apple that inspired Newton to work out the laws of gravity."" Firstly, Newton died in 1727, before the discoveries of Neptune, Uranus and Pluto. How then could ""all"" of the orbs (planets) have been represented on his tomb? Secondly, Newton's apple is an apocryphal tale. Thirdly, relating a fruit to a planet is stretching a premise to begin with; the fact that the puzzle is solved through this fatuous symbolism only further illustrates how the church can sell provincial fables from Israel as Holy Writ.<br/><br/>As Langdon laments, ""Why couldn't Jesus be married and still be an important figure?"" But instead of standing his ground on the evidence that points to the supposed ""truth"" of Jesus' bloodline, Langdon folds to the gutless notion that a lie based on faith is more honorable, or more worthy, than the truth that would destroy that faith. Why are we being inculcated to believe this insanity? In a movie that trumpets its heresy, who is it trying to appeal to with its eleventh-hour recantation? <br/><br/>In the greatest paradoxical idiocy of all, the movie's slogan entreats: ""Seek The Truth.""<br/><br/>(Read this review unabridged at: http://www.poffysmoviemania.com/DaVinciCode.html)"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","1","3","5 June 2006"," A solid adaptation, but as its own film it lacks substance
","Time and time again people have criticized movies like ""The DaVinci Code"" with that movie- bashing mantra ""it's not as good as the book."" To say that this doesn't apply to Ron Howard's adaptation would be wrong, but it does deserve, in a few areas, more credit than it is given. It is a strong adaptation of a best-seller, but does little else to make it a great movie.<br/><br/>First of all, a movie is a movie and book is a book, and as such there are things that make good books good books and good movies good movies. With that said, the key to an adaptation of a book to a movie is to take an already good book and translate it so that it can also do what good movies do. With DaVinci, this movie does a few of these good things. A good movie is visually interesting and Howard's greatest strength is bringing images and art to a novel that is strongly art-associated. To understand Brown's books better is to look up and see the images of the art he mentions. Howard also visually creates the historical explanations that are simply dialog in the book. That, and the dark, mysterious nature of the book comes out in Howard's visual choices.<br/><br/>Another signature of a good movie is good characters. The trouble is Brown's novel is so plot-driven, that only the book could allow someone telling this story enough time to give insight into the characters. Howard decides accordingly that the plot is most important here, and Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's talent goes to waste and their ""normal people"" characters suffer as a result. They become mere pawns of the greater themes, theories and ideas the book has founded its popularity on. The only character who gets time devoted to him is Paul Bettany's devoutly religious and murderous character Silas. Him, and Ian McKellan's quirky Sir Leigh Teabing, another theorist on the sacred feminine subject.<br/><br/>With a plot-driven adaptation, 'DaVinci' and especially Ron Howard can only do so much, and though I'm not one of them, anyone who is unfamiliar with the book can enjoy the movie more on plot and theory alone. Especially being released in a time where the book is still incredibly popular, I don't hesitate to believe audiences who read the book expected new light to be shed on the story through film, not something a straight adaptation can provide. <br/><br/>So if you're looking for a movie to strengthen your love of the book's ideas, you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours of a book put to the screen, this movie does a more than satisfactory job of it."

Direction, settings, color, acting ... every cinema aspect superb. <br/><br/>Several scenes appear as though they were lifted from INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE.

","The movie wasn't that bad based solely on the fact on its reliance on the book. The part that irritated me was the ending. I didn't see the purpose of changing the grandfather to not being the grandfather. Oh well. It wasn't as bad as everyone is saying it is. It is different and could bring about change, and most people fear change. Acting was good, Hank's hair sucked, imagery was beautiful,directing was so-so. Also coulda done without the self-mutilation scenes. Yuck.<br/><br/>In addition, and this is just a side comment, you will find this novel in the fiction section of your local book store. The fact that the author probably went through years of research is what makes this book and movie so likable. And seriously, 60 million plus readers, come one, something had to be right about it."

","This is perhaps one of the best movies ever made. The Historical references are exactly what this world needs to remember. The pace is just right, you don't even feel the two and a half hours. It is just like a roller-coaster ride from beginning to end. Forgetting about all the tough choices different popes made so they can save faith (or something) has been the main objective of so many people. The fact is that if it weren't for the exaggerated claims and misleading truths this film would possible have brought the whole Christian world to its knees. Too many people have lost their lives over this religion thing. Believe is all you need. Hate is not godly, love is. Love everyone always."

","I personally thing that this movie was very entertaining and the critic was undoubtibly not in the target auidiance. Personally i think he is a little too set in the ways his parents raised him he cant separate his religion from his life and this makes him unable to to enjoy the movie. Then again when i think about it i have more of a omptimistic outlook on things allowing me to see the best in any movie. So maybe through the eyes of another the movie can be boring and misunderstood but thats just something for others to think about.

Acting was superb, mind blowing, the music calls for special praise, the music pulls out all blocks from the movie. Direction, screenplay, film editing, and the special effects, every thing has been brilliant. This movie calls fro special praise of Paul Bettany as the albino monk. He was absolutely unbelievable. Tom Hanks gives a credible performance, but really he had nothing to prove in this movie, it didn't require his special acting abilities. Audrey Tatou is brilliant, after Amelie she again steals the show. Ian McKellen proves once again why he is one of the grand old men of British Actors. Alfred Molina was a bit lame in his small part. Jean Reno was also too good. The casting guy was brilliant in his part, he chose every person to perfection.<br/><br/>Overall this is a too god movie to miss.

","I must agree with most people who've seen the movie: it's not as good as the book. But still I enjoyed it very much. I watched it with my brother yesterday. He hadn't read the book, but even though he didn't completely understood the story and required some clarification at times, he still thought that, and I quote his words here, it was 'a kick-ass movie!'.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie I felt was too hastened and too quickly for people who hadn't read the book. After about fifteen to twenty minutes the tempo slowed down a bit to a more understandable level. Like I said before, my brother did require some clarification at times, but that was partially solved by the cinema itself. They gave us a small list with some keywords like Opus Dei, Leonardo Da Vinci, the Priory of Sion and among other things the Knights Templar.<br/><br/>The movie could have been a whole lot better if it had followed the book the letter, but in most cases that's impossible with book-to-film adaptations.

","As a huge fan of the novel I had a very high standard of what to expect. Not only was it just as I imagined the movie would be in terms of action and visuals, it was really well cast. I had my reservations about Tom Hanks in the role of Robert Langdon as I had pictured more of a Hugh Jacksom sort of character, but he was fantastic. I can't imagine anyone else playing him now. <br/><br/>The film is very true to the book and I still found myself waiting in anticipation to what was about to happen. The religious aspect of the movie is no different then the book and I think they way they told the story was not offense to anyone. It's just a movie folks, people are looking to much into it. <br/><br/>My friend who went with me had never read the book before hand and she enjoyed it a lot, she loved the mystery treasure hunt feel.<br/><br/>Give this movie a chance, you'll be nicely entertained."

Just when I thought I had it figured out, I was slapped with another! I don't see why the critics bashed it so much. I almost didn't see it after the negative reviews. I'm glad I decided to check it out anyway. Maybe they're all afraid of the movie's and book's take on religion. Anyway, great performances all around and great directing by Ron Howard. I should've known it would be excellent. When does Tom Hanks ever disappoint? I'd recommend it to anyone mature and open-minded enough to handle it."

","I read the book and saw the movie. The book is beyond words and the movie portrayed it very well. I have seen it three times since its release on Friday and love every second of it. I have never had two and a half hours go by so quickly! I'm glad that it's doing well at the box office, and would be doing much better if it weren't for the church interfering. I have nothing against the church, but honestly it's a FICTIONAL movie and they should understand that. There is no need for the protests and all of this nonsense. It never says, ""based on a true story,"" anywhere, does it? Therefore it makes it fictional. Aside from that I believe that Tom Hanks was a perfect choice for the character of Langdon. Ron Howard is one of my favorite directors and I'm glad he worked on this. Every aspect of this film was truly perfect, I see no flaws whatsoever. Of course as usual the book was better, but this is probably the first film I've seen that was this loyal to the original novel. I would recommend this for rather intelligent and open minded people. If the Christians want to protest let them, but don't let it influence your opinion of the film."

","Many times when you go and see a movie based on a book you get disappointed. Not so for me with this one. Ron Howard, in my opinion, deserves an Oscar for his brilliant direction. I was impressed at how closely the movie followed the book. Tom Hanks was superb as always and so was Paul Bettany as the evil monk Silas. Ian McKellen is a great actor and his portrayal of the rather insane Sir Leigh Teabing was excellent. I'm not very familiar with any of Audrey Tautou's work so it's hard to judge whether the role of Sophie Neveu was one of her best performances. I thought she did a pretty good job. Both the book and the movie made me think about and question my religious upbringing quite a bit and that is a good thing, I think."

He just doesn't fit the part. I like him as an actor but when you read the book you picture what Langdon looks like and it's not Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>The woman who played Sophia though was a very good choice.<br/><br/>The scenes with the Louvre, Paris in general and Rosslyn were very nice to see."

The acting is good, I loved all the characters, since the very beginning, the cast is an excellent choice, no matter they are not as you could imagine (Sophie isn't exactly lookalike Audrey Taoutou) you can leave the theatre with a good taste. I prefer 'Cinderella man' or 'A beautiful mind' if we talk about Ron Howard's movies, but DaVinci Code is pretty good.

","After having read the book and watched the movie, my final opinion is that while it is a good and entertaining movie, it is not a good adaptation. The first half of the movie was nearly dead on in story and plot from the book. However, in the second half, I think that it fell apart. There was no more suspense for me. It seemed to be reaching for believability and falling short. I felt that they left out key important information the helped to make the story believable.<br/><br/>If you HAVE NOT read the book, this is a good movie to see.<br/><br/>If you HAVE read the book, please watch this movie with a grain of salt and remember Hollywood often butchers literary works."

As the movie goes along we start to see how the Holy Grail could possibly be a women, and that someone has the bloodline of Christ.<br/><br/>There was just so much action that it's almost impossible to state them all, but I do think that the last main action part was the best. The part where they find out that Landon's old time friend has betrayed him.<br/><br/>The main question to ask your self is who right, The Teacher or the Bible?

But I thoroughly enjoyed it. And found a lot of stuff in it very wondrous and interesting. It certainly caught my attention and I don't really pay attention to religious stuff or read the bible or go to church. I'd say go see it. Plus I have one extra thing to add. Religious affiliates say that some of the stuff in or about the movie are rumors or lies and aren't true but think about this and just try to hear me out here. I told my mom this yesterday morning when I came home from work. The Bible, a book consisting of telling about life BACK THEN, and telling about Jesus and Mary BACK THEN. The bible today, older and newer versions are all we really have to go on about back then, so there is no way for any of us to know for a fact or certain(other than what we believe to be certain reading out of a book written originally back in a time we did not exist in) that what we believe today naturally about that stuff in the first place to be right or true. what if what we know today through the bible or from church or any other source talked about, learned, or put into daily life isn't a cover up for something we shouldn't know or see(maybe kind of like the fact of maybe time travel or time viewing possible but not letting it be known to us at all, cause everyone knows if you see your future your life is practically done, you have nothing to work for or at and you take away the secret of how your life will turn out). What if what we believe religiously has been a million year setup to cover up stuff we shouldn't know. Be open to the fact that maybe improbable but not impossible."

Perhaps it is because your faith isn't strong. I believe that people are afraid to think for themselves, and religious organizations are afraid of losing control over people."
"slk_live","9","1","3","22 May 2006"," I was impressed...
","""The Da Vinci Code"", a novel that has captivated the world, and sold over 40 million copies finally makes its' film debut on 5-19-06.<br/><br/>Getting right to the point:<br/><br/>Despite previous reviews, ""The Da Vinci Code"" was a very good film!! I thought, for the most part, it was true to the source material. The pacing and progression were done well, allowing the audience to understand, but not be bored by endless explanation. Ron Howard did a wonderful job with his direction. Performances were on point. I read some reviews stating Tom Hanks over acted and became melodramatic at times. I did not think this true at all. Hanks portrayed Symbologist Robert Langdon perfectly appropriate to Dan Brown's vision of him. Audrey Tautou was brilliant as Agent Sophie Neveu, as was Paul Bettany playing the Opus Dei Monk, Silas. Mr. Bettany should be very pleased with this performance. Reading the book you see Silas as a villainous foot soldier there to do his masters bidding. Watching the film, I actually felt sorrow for him, not pity... but sadness. With a glint in his eye, reminiscent of one Gandalf the Grey, Ian McKellen stole the show!!! He was amazing as Grail enthusiast Sir Leigh Teabing. Providing just enough sarcasm and wit to give the audience a bit of comic relief. <br/><br/>Now for those who have read the book...You will notice a few changes and deletions. From the beginning to mid-point they are very minor. Mostly made to speed the film along and preserve time. However, the ending takes a different route from the book (note: the epilogue does take place in the film...it remains intact and accurate). If you want to find out how the ending is different....continue reading. If not....STOP READING NOW:)<br/><br/>**BOOK/FILM SPOILERS AHEAD**READ AT OWN RISK**<br/><br/>Book ending: Langdon and Sophie arrive at Rosslyn Chapel, thinking they've discovered the resting place of the Holy Grail, only to find Sophie's grandmother and brother instead. Sophie, believing her parents, brother and grandmother died in a car accident when she was 4(ish), was now in need of explanation:<br/><br/>""And so Langdon had remained, standing beside Sophie and listening in mute astonishment while Marie (Sophie's grandmother) told the story of Sophie's late parents. Incredibly, both had been from Merovingian families--direct descendants of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ. Sophie's parents and ancestors, for protection, had changed their family names of Plantard and Saint-Clair. Their children represented the most direct surviving royal bloodline and therefore were carefully guarded by the Priory. When Sophie's parents were killed in a car accident whose cause could not be determined, the Priory feared the identity of the royal line had been discovered."" Chapter 105: The Da Vinci Code: Dan Brown, author. Sophie is now reunited with her only remaining family.<br/><br/>Film ending: Langdon and Sophie arrive at Rosslyn Chapel thinking they've discovered the resting place of the Holy Grail. Finding a hidden passage into a, vault like, storage area they discover records dating back thousands of years. Langdon believes they are indeed ""Grail documents"". He begins to tell Sophie he thinks Jacques Sauniere was not her grandfather at all. The Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, was merely the guardian of the greatest secret never shared. Sophie. She is the last surviving descendant of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ. The royal bloodline ends with her. At this point we meet her grandmother and are shown other Priory members. <br/><br/>This, in my opinion, is the only real change from novel to film. I thought it was unnecessary for them to speculate that Jacques Sauniere was not Sophie's grandfather, just guardian. Other than that, I found it to be an interesting take on Brown's ending. <br/><br/>All in all I give ""The Da Vinci Code"" an A-. I enjoyed it emencly, and plan to see it again very soon. I would like to thank you for reading and welcome you to post your comments. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Review by Sarah K. : Saturday~May 20, 2006"
"ijrichter","9","1","3","21 May 2006"," As a non-reader of the book........
","....I got to say, I really enjoyed this movie. You can see from the very beginning that it's not a movie that people should take very seriously, yet too many people do. My parents, who did read the book, saw the film with me, and they told from the very beginning, this is a book that reads like it was made to be a movie. Well, if what I saw was what Brown wrote in his book, I couldn't agree more (I did read the beginning, but couldn't really get past that). It has great action, and the mystery is plotted very cleverly. Ron Howard is one of my favorite directors. Even if he's not exactly the most creative director out there, he's made some of my favorite feel-good films (A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man, the Grinch), so I was really looking forward to this because of him. Even though this could've been done by anyone else, he does a great job with the locations, and his inter-cutting scenes between modern times and old times, and his great tricks for keeping the mystery, all impressive. What really stands out here though is the cast. I've heard some people didn't think Tom Hanks was right for the part of Robert Langdon. I say, Tom Hanks can do just about anything.He's one of my favorite actors with roles like Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, Big, Saving Private Ryan, Toy Story, even Catch Me if You Can (which I agree is one of his weaker roles). Here, he plays a man who can crack any code at the blink of an eye, as an expert in symbols. I love his first conference scene, and from there, he never breaks character. Audrey Tautou is just lovely. She also never breaks character as the lovely Sophie Neveu, a woman who finds the past is about to haunt her. She invokes every emotion with grace, and you can't help but love her. Ian McKellen is fantastic as always. I loved him as Gandalf, and here, the moment he appears on screen, he's both funny and creepy. And, the moment he appears, Paul Bettany scares the hell out of you, but also makes you feel sorry for him. He's controlled by the people who hired him, but at the same time, his face brings out so much hatred, you don't want to come across Silas. The script has its flaws, including some underdeveloped characters, like Fache (though wonderfully portrayed by Jean Reno), and even though some lines came across as pure bull (I'm not really religious, so that's probably just the way it sounds to me), it didn't get in the way of me enjoying this fine piece of entertainment, which is all it really wants to be. It may give a message to the audience, but it's not for people to take so seriously as they are. It's fun, pure fun."
"jpalmer08","10","1","3","21 May 2006"," The Da Vinci Code: Simply Exhillarating
","The Da Vinci Code is one of those movies that you would rather it not end. It is cinematic genius at its finest and despite its controversial claims, backs them up with fact. Stong performances come from Hanks and Tautou, however it is Bettany (Silas) and McKellan (Teabing) who really shine. Each scene they are in is stolen by these two and their colorful performances are the best parts of the Code. However, the plot requires thought. If you can and don't mind put two and two together to get four in a summer movie, than you can figure out the fairly complex plot. The music is fantastic and proves that Hans Zimmer has come to the forefront of composers in Hollywood. The only slight problem that one might find is the pacing. The first and last half hour are slower than the brunt of the movie. However, this is only a microscopic tarnish on the piece of gold that is the Da Vinci Code."
"moviemanMA","8","1","3","21 May 2006"," This is fiction, understand?
","Ever look at a painting, see something, and have someone else see something completely different? This is important to comprehend before delving into the mystery and controversy that Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code takes you through. Whether it is Da Vinci's painting of The Last Supper or different geometric shapes around the world, just about anything you want to believe can be twisted and turned to fit a certain belief.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's take on the book that has sold the most copies second only to the Bible, The Da Vinci Code is a fictional journey to figure out what the Catholic Church has been hiding for thousands of years. It is a thrill ride, uncovering secret societies that were believed to be nonexistent and exposing the untouchable. Mistaken identities, incredible theories, and astounding character revelations create the tip of the ice berg for The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>The movie opens with the death of a man at the hands of what appears to be a derange monk. Following this murder is the introduction of Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), speaking at a Religious Symbology seminar for his new book. While signing autographs, the French authorities come to take Langdon to the murder. While there, he encounters Sophie Nevou (Audrey Tautou) who tells him he is in grave danger and Captain Fache (Jean Reno) is not one to be trifled with. From here on out, the duo rely on Langdon's capability of memory and decoding and Nevou's own history to guide them through a sea of madness, leading only to the truth about one of the most astounding questions in history: did Jesus have an offspring?<br/><br/>To accompany them on their journey is Sir Leigh Teabing (Sir Ian McKellan), a Grail enthusiast bound to find out the truth behind Jesus's divinity, or mortality. The troublesome monk Silas (Paul Bettany) and his mentor Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina) provide much needed suspense to the plot of the story. They are apart of the secretive order Opus Dei, portrayed at a murderous creed sprouting from the Catholic Church, trying to protect the world from something they need not know about.<br/><br/>Again, this story is fiction. This must be understood before reading the book or in this case seeing the movie. To think that this is an attack at the Church and all of its teachings would mean the Indiana Jones trilogy is also trying to bring down Catholicism. Just because a story involves real groups doesn't make it true. Certainly, there are people who might take offense to what this film deals with. The film is meant to entertain and tell a riveting story.<br/><br/>Without a doubt this is not just an ordinary film. It isn't groundbreaking or instrumental to cinema history. What it does, just as the book did, is grab hold of the audience and stays with them long after. Questions about the Knights of Templar and the truth behind Mary Magdeline don't just stay in the theatre, but stay with the person long after the credits roll. <br/><br/>The film works on many levels other than the story. Howard's direction is right where it has been all these years; stellar. His mixture of real time, flashbacks, and even the thoughts the characters have are a delight for the senses. Accompanying his direction is Hans Zimmer's breathtaking score. Much like his other works, this is a spine-tingling soundtrack that is a perfect match with the film. On top of this is the acting. Although Hanks has had better characters, he does what is needed for Langdon. McKellan and Bettany truly shine in their roles as well.<br/><br/>Movie goers alike can't deny the fact that this is an entertaining movie. Who is to say what is true and what is not true? This is the premise of faith. Faith is being able to believe in something and no matter what people say or what is presented your faith remains the same. The movie isn't a brainwashing tool, it is different way to tell a story. Entertainment. That is what this is."
"glashock","10","1","3","21 May 2006"," Fantastic Movie!
","I had been reading and listening to the reviewers over the last few days so I was preparing myself for disappointment yesterday. I went with 2 friends. Two of us had read the book and 1 had not. We all thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Personally, I would have made the last 20 or so minutes different than Ron Howard but it still was great. I cannot understand all of the reviews I have seen. I have heard a lot of them call it boring...not in the least! Don't believe it. I actually thought that the ideas and clues were cleverly written and adapted for the screen. As for no chemistry between the 2 main characters, all I can say is that the reviewers must have flunked Chemistry in school. I also heard the criticism that the character Sophie had very little to say. I really don't know what to say to that except that maybe that reviewer went to the wrong movie because it certainly wasn't the one I saw! I usually don't buy into conspiracy theories but with the way this movie is being trashed across the board I think that Oliver Stone better get on the case! I can tell you that I will go to see it again and will be buying the DVD when it comes out."
"chrisbhom","8","1","3","21 May 2006"," Very unlike Pinocchio indeed....
","i would like to clear the air by stating that Tom Hanks was incredibly ""unwooden"" so to speak. In a role that allows no allowance of being over emotional and powerful without undermining the rhythm and the effect of the film and other characters, Tom Hanks shows himself to be quite effective playing a believable role as a sceptic but open minded professor. I think the film on a whole was mildly entertaining and quite involving, showing the storyline and plot to be somewhat entertaining but also a bit confused. Stella performances from Paul Bettany and sir Ian Mckellen save the film from being entertainingly mediocre and showing it to be a good watch. i am yet to read the book but i strongly disagree with tom hanks being far too wooden as the character he plays, is underlined from the offset as being a well mannered logically thinking sceptical but open minded professor who is highly reserved but emotionally balanced."

","When I read the book ""The Da Vinci Code"" by Dan Brown, it was the last piece in the puzzle of my opinion in that the Christianity is a fraud.

Some of them are even proved.<br/><br/>Back to the movie.<br/><br/>I really had huge expectations to the movie, and it did not disappoint me at all. I have taken notice to some of the ""commentees"" here at IMDb who claim lack of chemistry between Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, and I could not disagree more. Sure, that is an individual question, but for me was like sparks on the screen! I am a type of person that if I read a book and really loved it, it still has to be visualized for it to go all the way to ""up there"". And that is probably why i loved this movie so much. To get (almost)everything from the book on to a screen at the cinema made my day! Especially at the end, when Langdon kneels over the so-to-be grave of Mary Magdalena, and we can see the actual grave beneath him was astonishing, and something I can never get out of any book, ever. It sent shivers down my spine! Also the settings and characters was like I had imagined them to be from the book.<br/><br/>This is probably the best movie I have ever seen, but if it had not been for the book and my passion for it, I am sure I would not liked it half as much."

But, have any of these critics picked up the book? The entire point of the book is to TELL the tale of Jesus and Mary Magdalene from an interesting, and pretty persuasive (in my humble opinion) point of view.<br/><br/>This movie is not for the bible-beaters, the close-minded, or the particularly conservative. Whether you think it's true or it's just a well-written story, it makes no difference; Da Vinci Code was well-filmed, interesting, and true to the book."

","I'm really perplexed at the backlash against this movie. It seems like quite a few rather disdainfully snobby literary types don't like that the book was popular and are thusly taking it out on the movie, no? I can only picture the self-absorbed critics laughing at the climactic moment in the movie--which was neither funny nor poorly done. If you give yourself an attitude to stay distanced from the movie, you will assuredly do that--teenagers who think they know everything are capable of doing the same during ""The Godfather"".<br/><br/>It isn't a Shakespearean tragedy, but it is a fun adventure/mystery that awakens the imagination and fictitiously connects historical figures and art in a really interesting way.<br/><br/>The book was of that caliber and the movie did a fine job of capturing that quality. I'd give it a 7 / 10. Not nearly one of the best movies, but an entertaining and imaginative bit of fun.<br/><br/>Also, if it causes someone to research art and history more--and more importantly IMO, question a faith in a book of preposterously false myths written by ancient man--it's done a service to humanity!"
"pinkdonkey","9","1","3","21 May 2006"," Honest review
","I'm an avid reader and I've read books of all types written by authors around the world. Before this book came out I had already learned about and researched the controversy surrounding the history of Jesus and his marriage to Mary Magdalene. With that said, I read The Da Vinci Code as soon as it came out and I really enjoyed it. Yes, the novel is fiction but a lot of the historical content has been proved true.<br/><br/>Getting to my point the movie is a very good adaptation of the book. Aside from a few tiny changes that really don't take away from the movies plot, the movie follows the book very closely. If you want to escape for a few hours go see this movie. It will leave you with a lot of thought sparking ideas and perhaps it will even provoke you to study the history that was portrayed in both the book and the movie.<br/><br/>I am absolutely appalled at the Christian crusade taking place to bad mouth both the movie and the book. For those who didn't watch the movie and didn't read the book, do not believe what you hear about it being anti Christian or anti anything for that matter. If you're a mature human being you will really enjoy this movie as it is a great film to watch if you want to escape the world for a few hours.<br/><br/>I would defiantly recommend this movie."

","I loved this film! I had only read half of the novel before seeing the movie. I loved it! The film may not be as detailed as the book, however, it is just as exciting!! It's a very very interesting ""story"" and people just need to take it as that. This is a movie that I'm afraid people will write off because of critic's reviews. Sometimes, critics think about politics before telling their true feelings on the movie! I would recommend reading the synopsis before seeing the movie. I think the synopsis helps those who have no read the book follow the story. My boyfriend who had not read the book found that very helpful. We both gave this movie two thumbs up!"

","Although such controversy lays on it, I thought the movie was as good as the book itself. Of course, no movie can be EXACTLY based on the book, there are some flaws. Tom Hanks played Robert Langdon exceptionally well along with Audrey Tautou and Ian McKellen. I really liked the way they tried to fuse the book with the movie as much as possible; and actually focusing on bringing the book to the big screen. With a great cast, it surely went above my expectations. I recommend this movie to anyone who feels open enough to share their thoughts and beliefs on the Catholic/Christian/etc. religion or anyone who plainly enjoys great Mystery flick."

The movie was true to the book, and Ron Howard did a great job maintaining the integrity of the story and the characters. If you enjoyed reading the book, you'll appreciate the job that was done on this film. The dream-like sequences portraying the events leading up to the Templar Treasure and Robert Langdon's use of his ""almost"" eidetic memory to cipher out the clues were pure genius. Even though I knew how it would all turn out, I found myself enjoying the ""ride"" to the conclusion and felt the movie was definitely worth the price of a ticket. In fact, I plan to add it to my collection as soon as it is released on DVD."
"pebwriter","10","1","3","21 May 2006"," This is a great movie!
","I'm always cautious about movies based on popular books because some Directors go off in a totally different direction than intended by the Writer. Not so in this case. I think Ron Howard did an excellent job staying true to Dan Brown's story.....and yes folks...it is a story. But with usual movie time constraints he had to skim over some details that might have cleared up a few things for people who have not read this book. I think Tom Hanks was his usual great self and Audrey Tautou was wonderful and Ian McKellen was great for some comic relief. Religious controversy aside this was a great movie, it's too bad that some people take fiction too seriously! Religious zealots don't seem to understand that they are giving this movie its greatest publicity.."
"xxMaloutje","8","1","3","21 May 2006"," Well done, Ron
","It's not hard to write a screenplay, if it's a book you're going to film. Dan Brown's bestseller The Da Vinci Code is ridiculous at some points. The plot is based on nothing, it's a theory Brown believes, maybe he doesn't even believe it. The movie adaption is preciously the book, with a couple of exceptions. So the plot doesn't work here either. <br/><br/>We see Sauniere being killed by Silas (Paul Bettany) and during that murder, there are flashes of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) giving a seminar in the opening scene. God, I love the shooting and editing style of this movie. The movie continues and it actually gets exiting. The Da Vinci Code isn't a stupid Cat-Mouse / Run-Catch movie, the pursuit scenes are actually exiting. There are funny moments in the movie and Ron Howard keeps us to the screen with his brilliant editing style. It's amazing to see how flashbacks and modern-day images are in the same frame. Langdon and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) walk in the past. It's amazing. <br/><br/>Talking about Tautou. There were a lot of critics who didn't think Tom Hanks was appropriate to play Robert Langdon. When I read the book, I knew Hanks was going to play Langdon. I could totally imagine Hanks playing it. What I couldn't imagine was Tautou playing Neveu. She said herself that she thought see was too young and not appropriate for the part. I agreed with her. During the movie, I realized I was totally wrong and I mean totally. She plays it wonderfully. The whole cast play it wonderfully. Hanks, Tautou, Sir Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, Bettany. Bettany's role, Silas, is what I think the hardest part of the movie. Silas is the albino monk, remember? He has to hit himself and he's walking around with a cilice. Bettany made it work. THere was just one slight error that occurred. At some point Silas places the cilice around his right leg and in the next shot he's still limping with his left leg. But that's not Bettany's fault.<br/><br/>I fell in love with the movie, the music was great as well. The right kind of music in the right part of the scene, that's the true power of a soundtrack. If you don't do that, you might as well make a silence movie. As said, I fell in love with the movie, but the editing and shooting was the best part of my night. Ron, thank you."
"Animus","8","1","3","21 May 2006"," Very interesting and thought provoking.
","The DaVinci Code is a well acted well written bit of fiction that brings up a lot of religious doctrine and explores theories behind Christianity and looks at what may have been left out of religious tenets. The key part of this sentence is ""fiction"". The loud critics of the film and book would do well to remember the word. The movie entertains even as it seemingly undermines the church (but not the faith) of the Christian world, all the while giving the viewers more information on the early days of church than most would have ever known otherwise. I was impressed by the acting on all levels and the complexity of the films elements. The puzzle solving sequences were beautifully done without being overdone. I found the ideas put forth in the movie fascinating and am intrigued by the take on the Holy Grail legend. With respect to the people who feel threatened by the film I would like to suggest that maybe its their own belief that is shaky and not the foundations of their church."
"stevenlamsf","8","1","3","21 May 2006"," A movie quite stick to the novel, yet it is what I needed
","I have read the novel before and am quite eager to watch the movie.<br/><br/>I appreciate the director's effort to make the scenes in the book come true. I quite accept to cut those places from the books as the movie does. But the middle part of the book, which is full of information, is quite difficult to deal with. So, not to my surprise, the movie is quite dilatory in the middle. On the other hand, The film has not enough time to show the suspense and mystery of the story. To those people who have read the book, like me, I won't oppose to give those audiences who haven't read the book some time to feel. For example, we all know from the introduction of the movie that the curator would be murdered. But the great tension in the novel is that why his life is so important and what tremendous loss will be made if he died. The movie seems to neglect this. Moreover many magnificent places in the novel could also be displayed better, such as the ""24, haxo"".<br/><br/>The movie, however, add some new value to the story. The discussion of Langdon and Sophie near the end of the film, to me, is a better conclusion compared to the novel. And the concept goes rather beyond any religion. At the moment even some idea of Buddhism has come to my mind.<br/><br/>Recenly the local bishop here has been newly raised as an archbishop by the Pope. Surely more Hongkong people will have interest on this movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks all crews for bringing this story out. I enjoyed most of the time during the movie."
"TheScience_Geek","8","1","3","21 May 2006"," Critics are definitely wrong about this one.
","The Da Vinci Code has generally been trashed by critics, and after seeing it I cannot comprehend why. Controversy or no, this is one of the best mystery/thrillers I've ever seen, and the 150 minute runtime is exactly as long as it takes. You'll find yourself trying to figure out whose side everyone is on, and the story throws a bunch of wonderful twists at you. There are, perhaps, a few scenes that didn't need to be put in, and the small amount of nudity is completely unnecessary. Personally, I'm surprised that this movie didn't draw an R rating, with the amount of intensity, mildly disturbing scenes, and nudity in it. It does drag at times, but in general the movie has an excellent pace and keeps you moving right along. There are a few moments of humor (""then you'll just have to shoot us...starting with him""), but for the most part it is a dark and engrossing thriller.<br/><br/>In short, go see it subject to these conditions: 1) If you're an easily offended Catholic, don't touch it. It is just as inflammatory as the hype says. 2) Do NOT take children to this. I wouldn't touch this with anyone under 14-15. 3) If you hated National Treasure, don't touch it. The two are very similar movies."

","After reading the book at breakneck speed several years ago I was interested to see how the movie would develop the characters and the detailed historical background which provided the necessary information to follow the plot. I thought Ron Howard did a masterful job of bringing the viewer along so even one who had not read the book could know and understand what was happening.<br/><br/>While disappointed that many media reports panned the film I found that the movie was reasonably true to the book, created the same sense of suspense found on the written page, and moved at a pace much quicker than I was led to believe. The actors played their roles well, although I thought Audrey Tautou's character could have been a little bit more forceful coming off a little too naive and demure. Funny though issues like the length of Tom Hanks hair neither added or detracted from the movie and to me he made a very believable college professor. Jean Reno and Ian McKellen were up to their usual standards and fit their roles perfectly. Paul Bettany was new to me but he nailed the part of Silas creating a truly sinister and frightening character."
"shadowofandromeda","7","1","3","21 May 2006"," If you keep an open mind and watch this film for what it is, you'll enjoy it
","After a year of waiting for this film's release, I finally got to see it yesterday afternoon, and I have to say that I really did enjoy it! To be honest, I can now understand the negative reviews it has received since the Cannes film awards ceremony - I can't even explain what was wrong with it. I suppose it had something to do with the pacing, and the two main characters did seem a bit one dimensional - but then again, I thought exactly the same when I read the book! Sir Ian McKellan (as Sir Leigh Teabing) and Paul Bettany (as Silas, the albino Opus Dei monk) were the best, by far! They really made the entire film, in my opinion. They were both excellent and nobody could have played those roles any better than they did.<br/><br/>When I had read and listened to reviews of this film, there were lots of comments on the audience laughing at a certain part (I can't remember which) and also people found the line ""We need to get to a library."" Now, is it just me or does that just mean that people are just more easily amused than ever? I didn't find anything about this film whatsoever. Unless I missed something.<br/><br/>Also, there is no way that this film should have been rated a 12A!! They should have kept it as a 15. For one, it meant that I had to sit in the theatre with a gang of kids no older than 13 giggling and screaming (mainly when Silas kept jumping out on people) at the back, and walking up and down the stairs and in and out of the theatre. Seriously, why would kids that young want to see this film? No offence to them, but I really doubt they even knew what was going on. I suppose them walking in and out of the theatre continuously and giggling and messing around proves that they were bored - or perhaps it was their first time at the cinema without their parents. I don't know. But another reason is the violence. We all know that 12A means that children under 12 can watch the film with a responsible adult. There is no way I would take a child to see this film. The flagellation scene at the beginning is a bit graphic - it could be worse, certainly...but it was enough for me to cringe. So yes, they should have kept it as a 15.<br/><br/>But that's my only complaint :) I walked out of the cinema, not totally blow away by it at all, but me and my friend did have a very in-depth conversation about the whole Jesus/Mary Magdalene theory and I even took her to the book shop so I could show her the portrait of the Last Supper in detail. And even though I thought I wouldn't see it again on the cinema, today, I have to say, I've changed my mind and want to see it again a.s.a.p All I say is, keep an open mind! Just watch it for what it is, and you will enjoy it!"

","I have just watched the movie. I was going to watch it next week, but I can't understand why a multi-million dollar movie could get such a bad review, so I watched it today. I'm more than sure now, it rated poorly because of the areas and ideas this movie touched on.<br/><br/>My Review.<br/><br/>9/10 - I felt Tom Hanks lead role, was somewhat over taken. The movie was very easy to follow, and had a huge and interesting plot with twists. I guess you could say this was one big treasure hunt movie, similar to say ""National Treasure"". I understand one scene could have created a bit of a stir to some viewers. The telling of the ""Last Supper"", created ""other"" ideas of the past (history) going against for what is believed already about this painting by some groups. I see no reason for anyone not to see this movie as what you believe and what you see, means nothing unless you don't believe what you follow. I'm proud that someone has created a movie, that has touched on some of this (hard to show/talk about without upsetting someone now days), because I knew nothing about any of this type of history, wheather right or wrong. I love a treasure hunt, the twists were great, and I had not read the book. Excellent movie, top job again Tom. You really are a power and strong actor.<br/><br/>Remember you all have the right to see it or not to see it. <br/><br/>You have your own minds use them and enjoy the movie.

The best actor at the movie to me, was Paul Bettany as Silas. He performed magnificently. Audrey was also a great actress, but this movie really represented the book, although you could say it left out quite a lot of interesting details.<br/><br/>**I really recommend you go buy and read the book first, and then view the movie,it really changes your thoughts on it.<br/><br/>Hoped you liked my review.<br/><br/>qk"

Granted, it is exciting at some points, most of the film is taken directly from the long conversations in the novel.<br/><br/>In the movie, Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu try to uncover a series of riddles and puzzles that in the end, lead to one of the biggest secrets in history! Supporting characters are Sir Leigh Teabing ( whom is acted out perfectly by Ian Mckellen) and Silas, the albino monk (played by the chilling Paul Bettany ) All in all, this movie is very excellent. The only reasons i stopped from giving it a 10 out of a 10 is because of the length of the movie, and the long dragged out conversations. I do advise everyone that read the book to be aware of some minor changes in the events that happen in the book. I think that changes were merely made to save time and not bore us any longer.. which is kind of disappointing. . . seeing as it shouldn't have bored us in the first place.<br/><br/>So in the end, great adaption, and great cast.. just a little bit shorter of a film would have been perfect."
"highkite","8","1","3","20 May 2006"," Fun and entertaining!
","The movie adaptation of the Dan Brown novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" isn't your typical summer blockbuster thriller hit. The interesting thing about it is that even though it's not as good as the novel, the movie still finds that key audience and brings it home. I didn't expect much more than a fun edge of your seat pop corn flick, and that's why I wasn't entirely disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie pretty much follows the book dead on. It starts up with a death and an opening to a much larger mystery. The only thing I found a minor flaw is the lack of intensity and suspense the book so boldly created. While Ron Howard's god-like point of views and swinging camera movements create a magnificent cinematography, the action paid very little homage to the book. The ""twists"" weren't twists at all, but rather, a quick burst of a plot change that had the audience in absolutely no hysterical awe.<br/><br/>The acting was decent. Ian McKellen proved once again that he is one of our modern day's best actors, portraying Leigh Teabing in a much more animated way than I would have thought. And while he steals the spotlight, Tom Hanks (Robert Langdon) chooses to create a much more ordinary character. The more poignant role was that of Sophie Neveu, portrayed by Audrey Tatou. The sheer lack of believability that Audrey exhuberates to convince us that she is a genius cryptographer is almost as bad as her key monologues that fail to be clearly enunciated. But my personal favorite performance is Paul Bettany's creepy portrayal of the uber-creepy albino monk, Silas. His much underrated and overlooked ability to master the perfect accent and wow audiences with his convincing interpretation of an Opes Dei creation sticks through the entire film.<br/><br/>In all, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a mind-boggling adventure ride. It spins our thoughts about a controversial topic and bounces us around with some pretty interesting ideas wonderfully portrayed on the screen. The score written by Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, Lion King) is perfect, and the set design is brilliant.<br/><br/>In all honesty, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a movie that can be watched more than once, but not to over-analyze it and discuss the much talked about issue of religion, but because some audiences seem to forget that some movies are made for pure entertainment and nothing more. I really don't see the big deal with ""The Da Vinci Code,"" it takes an approach to both sides of the argument about Christianity -- which is hilariously captured in a conversation between Leigh and Robert.<br/><br/>I'd give it an 8/10 for proving that the second biggest selling novel of all time can in fact be shown and be seen by all audiences without damaging the reputation of the novel itself."
"jerrywilson","8","1","3","20 May 2006"," Intrigueing and Thrilling
","Let me start by saying I did not read the book. There is one thing I've discovered about movies based on novels. Most often, if you've read the book, you hate the movie. Those who don't read the book are usually in a better position to provide an unbiased review.<br/><br/>I love Tom Hanks as an actor. He can play almost any role to perfection. Having said that, this part is still a stretch for him. It could have been better cast.<br/><br/>Still, I really liked the movie. It was all it was billed as. I liked the cinematography. And I even enjoyed the ""talking heads"" moments. I know it's fiction, but Brown has said his research while writing the book did reveal factual evidence, and I believe there is probably more truth in the movie than what most religious groups would want us to believe.<br/><br/>Face it; if it were all nothing but fiction, the Catholic church wouldn't be so worried about it. And, of course, everyone knows the church has been one of history's biggest villains. I know something of religious history, and much of what the talking heads were discussing is true. That makes the movie better, being based on actual events, even if highly embellished.<br/><br/>Even though it's fictional, it's still a movie everyone should see. It can lead some to question the role of religion in their lives. And that's a good thing."
"Pegapus","8","1","3","20 May 2006"," A nice thriller from start to finish
","I went into the film cold, without having read the book, and I enjoyed it. It stands on its own, apart from the book, which I will likely read now to compare the two.<br/><br/>The performances for the most part are understated, though at times the dialogue is too expository, and doesn't lead to any new actions, however much it gives background. I think that perhaps a rolling ""credits"" scene in the beginning might have helped make some points clearer, though I can understand the need for the characters to learn new elements as the story moves forward.<br/><br/>In comparison to other films in the ""treasure hunt"" type of action films, it is a lot more cerebral, but whether that helps or not depends on your point of view! There is very little in the way of graphic violence, though there are some scenes which might frighten smaller children. There was also very little profanity. I could compare it with ""National Treasure"" in some ways, but a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" it isn't.<br/><br/>The film (and obviously the book) pour down heavy criticism on certain historically religious groups, and I suppose this is one of the reasons why some are boycotting the film--however, since the whole thing has been designated fiction, I can't understand why people just don't accept it for just that--a ""fictional"" story.<br/><br/>The mood is dark, and there is some humor, too, though it's almost whispered at times. Perhaps this tone of ""reverence"" is in the novel, too, I don't know; Ian McKellan's character is the only one audacious enough to laugh out loud.<br/><br/>I recommend the film, but if people aren't prepared to check their own beliefs at the door, they might be disappointed in the film's outcome."

","Dan Brown's book ""The Da Vinci Code"" was a great story, which got the Christian world quite angry and it made Dan Brown very rich man, though he's been on a courtroom quite long now, 'cause of the greedy bastards who wants their share of the treasure.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's adaptation of that book was an expected event, because of the books famous theory and the all-star cast. I just saw the movie about 7 hours ago, and I must say this: I wasn't disappointed. I've read the book, and yes, they do rush some scenes and they left quite a bit out of it, but still the result was good. I'm not saying that it's a masterpiece like the book, but it was not bad.<br/><br/>Main cast does their job well, all except Alfred Molina (Bishop Arigarosa), he is like a ghost in this one and he's scene's are the most dullest in this movie ( bishops playing pool, what's up with that? ) But all else, Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Sir Ian McKellen, Jean Reno & Paul Bettany does their job well. And I must say that, Sir Ian McKellen saves a lot. Just when the plot is getting a bit boring, Mr Mckellen's Sir Leigh Teabing is a pleasant surprise to the complex plot. He was the best thing is this movie. Paul Bettany was a bit scary as Silas, due to his accent and that ""self-hurting"" sequence.<br/><br/>But what really hurt the film was the rush. I know that you really can't make a straight copy of the book and make it film, it would last hours. But you have to play it smoothly to get the thing go right, like for example The Lord of Rings movies. And on my opinion, they should have waited a bit before releasing/making this movie.<br/><br/>On the bottom-line, The Da Vinci Code is a good movie, it's entertaining, it's got a good cast and the best thing: You can see great place's like the Louvre, Roslyn Chapel etc. It was nice to have a entertaining ""history"" lesson"

","In case you've read the DaVinci Code then you must know it's a very specific book with interesting and complex dialogues, but at the same time it captures your attention whether because it deals with humankind's past or because it's just a great FICTION book. However, the film does show the scent the book once made feel us all, so that's a good point. Unfortunately, some of the actors were unspoiled and rather disappointing. Tom Hanks is well-known for being a great master of acting and we've been witness of his talent throughout all of his movies. But this time, he appears like a cold and inexpressive Robert Langdon, who doesn't seem to be worried of his charge of murder. Audrey Tautou performs her part very well actually, but also has no expressions but a cold reaction when she's told to be of Jesus's bloodline. Ian McKellen, I think, it's the best of the movie. His performance is right on top next to Paul Bettany's Silas. McKellen has always given the best of him in any movie he's done and I think this is one more. Although most people will consider McKellen's sequences rather boring, I believe he really sustains the movie making it as interesting as the book. Ron Howard's The DaVinci Code is a great adaptation of the Dan Brown's novel. But, once again, the performances are a negative point which makes impossible to the movie to entertain the audience."

","By Bil Gekas<br/><br/>It is supposed to challenge your faith, shake the foundation of 2000 years of history, and some would say, condemn you to hell for seeing it. Dozens of books and TV Specials have been churned out to explain it. Everybody and his bodkin has given an opinion. It would certainly be disappointing if all the hype turned out to be exactly that: all hype. After scanning the many of negative reviews that came out after the Premier, I was not expecting much of a film of The DaVinci Code. I should have had more faith. <br/><br/>It seems that every film critic wanted to be first in line to criticize Dan Brown's ""preposterous"" story that has sold more than 60 million copies. One wonders whether their taste is influenced by the story, the film, or by the Catholic Church, which again lives up to its reputation of condemning those who dare to doubt its version of the ""truth."" This reviewer found an intelligent, faithful reproduction of the book that only slightly shied away from Brown's challenge to Christianity. To the contrary, Ron Howard closed the story with Professor Langdon leaving the audience with rather tepid advice; ""all that matters is what you believe."" Hardly the stuff of heresy. <br/><br/>Fair warning: if you are looking for Tom Cruise rather that Tom Hanks, you will be disappointed. There's plenty of excitement, but the story requires the use of your brain for a little more than two hours.Between chases it requires a few calm and talkie scenes to tell that story. Those used to Music-Video style pacing may be put off at first, but the pauses are rewarding, especially for those who have not read the book. Unfortunately just telling the tale leaves little time for character development and the eerie flashbacks might be more confusing than enlightening. Such is the challenge for Ron Howard, a director brave enough to undertake such a challenging story from such a popular book.<br/><br/>Hank's portrayal of Robert Langdon, the claustrophobic Professor of Symbiology from Harvard, seems effortless--even though the author described Langdon in the book as ""Harrison Ford in Harris tweeds."" Ron Howard gave us Tom Hanks in shaggy hair. But it worked. No longer boyish, Hanks' natural charm and intelligence blends easily with the tentative confidence of Audrey Tautou for an odd marriage of convenience as he helps her character, Sophie, find out the awesome secret for which her grandfather gave his life. Naturally, Ian McClellan is brilliant as Teabing, reminding me of his Richard III with a curiously similar end. The brilliant casting continues with strong performances by Jean Reno, as Besu Fache, the crusty detective, and Paul Bettany as the horrifying Albino, Silas. <br/><br/>Of course, reading the book before seeing the film will make understanding easier, but I suspect that seeing the film will encourage many more movie-goers to seek out the book. Perhaps you may want to find out more about what you believe. In any event, as McClellan said on the Today Show, ""It's a jolly good tale."" That it is--fiction or no fiction."

","I would totally have to agree with the previous reviewer. I saw the movie last night, and I was quite disappointed with it, considering I thought the book was absolutely brilliant! The movie I felt had a quick pace to it, and that the ""code breaking"" wasn't really being done.. not too much thought was being put in. The acting was great, but I feel the story and the pursuit to find the Grail wasn't as exciting and breathe taking as the book. Now obviously a book is a book, and a movie a movie.. but still the quest seemed reasonaly boring from scene to scene, and I seriously thought that being 2½ hours long it would have been a breathe taking movie.."
"basrutten","6","1","3","20 May 2006"," A flawed but still entertaining adaptation
","Let me start by saying that I'm quite a fan of Dan Brown. His books, while often over the top and not very believable, do have a lot going for them: lots of suspense, high pace, interesting facts and theories, and fun characters.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's movie adaptation stays remarkably true to the book, so many of the things that apply to the novel apply to the film as well. That means that if you're looking for something really deep or thought-provoking, you should look elsewhere. But if you want to be entertained, you could do a whole lot worse than watching the ""Da Vinci Code"".<br/><br/>For the most part, I've found DVC a reasonably fast-paced and fun action thriller. After a somewhat slow start, it actually becomes fairly suspenseful roller-coaster ride full of twists and turns. The fast pacing and constant stream of information that is poured over the viewer almost hide the fact that the actual plot as such is even less believable than that of the book, though. The ease with which the main characters elude the police at every turn and solve the most complex riddles in mere seconds is really a bit hard to grasp.<br/><br/>That being said, having a 125 million dollar budget certainly helps the movie. For one, the budget really shines through in the production values: DVC is beautifully shot and very atmospheric.<br/><br/>Secondly, it allowed the makers to hire a very talented cast of actors who mostly do a good job. Ian McKellen is obviously having the time of his life and steals every scene he's in. Jean Reno does yet another cliché French cop part, but he's very good at that part so I don't mind. And Audrey Tautou is just as lovely as ever. Oddly enough, Tom Hanks is surprisingly disappointing. His Robert Langdon goes through the movie almost as a zombie, devoid of any kind of emotion. Paul Bettany as Silas didn't really work either...he wasn't nearly as frightening as he was supposed to be.<br/><br/>In the end, DVC is a reasonable adaptation of a good book. It's for the most part an beautiful, well-made and entertaining action thriller that contains some amusing theories. It might have been better with a director and script-writer who were willing to take a bit more risk and/or add a bit more of themselves into the movie instead of sticking so closely to the book, but it's still solid entertainment *** out of *****"

","The Da Vinci Code, perhaps the best book I have ever had the privilege to read, and when the fact I heard a movie was going to be made I swore. How can you make a movie that would live up to the book? I have never seen it done, and this movie is no exception.<br/><br/>The casting of Ian McKellan was an inspired choice, as was Jean Reno as Fache, Audrey Tautou was not what I would call my first choice, but she carried the movie along okay, even though her accent did get in the way of some dialogue. Now for Tom Hanks...Tom Hanks!...who the heck in their right mind would cast him as Robert Langdon,...I pictured Dennis Quaid myself.<br/><br/>What made the novel's ending work so well was when they were at the Rosalind Chapel, you never discovered the hidden documents as they did in the movie. It was one of the great twists in the book, you think they have discovered it, but alas, it had been moved, but Sofie discovered her grandmother and her brother,...which was only hinted at in the movie. The way it was done in the movie just threw me out of it completely, I was going to say the movie was acceptable, but the whole Rosalind Chapel sequence could have been done better. Also her grandfather was her grandfather in the book, not just a man who took care of her at birth. Some other subjects from the novel, such as the sex ritual, where not explored in enough detail in the movie. It was just there to be there and for those who have never read the novel it was just plain confusing and seemed out of place. Which was how the movie was like for some friends of mine that have never read the novel. They were confused and lost, always leaning over and asking me questions. The dialogue was terrible,...the whole script in general should have been redone...Dan Brown should have written the screenplay,...usually authors adapted their works better for the screen themselves than to have someone else do it...(a good example of great adaptation is Arthur Miller's The Crucible) I was highly impatient for this movie to be release, but now that it has happened, I feel disappointed and disgusted on the way Hollywood as treated one of the greatest mystery novels of our time. The only thing I found really enjoyable was Hans Zimmers score, which at the end was beautifully done. My bet is the only Academy Award this movie will be nominated for will be Best Score, but the Razzie Awards are going to have a field day."

"dtennen-1","6","1","3","20 May 2006"," an OK achievement in a book-to-screen adaptation
","OK first of all I read Dan Brown's book and actually had a great time while at it. I don't consider him a great book writer but he certainly knew how to keep me interested and entertained, and for that I give him credit. I don't want to get into the whole Christianity thing that's going around the movie's plot, as I feel that it is a fiction novel and an intriguing theory, regardless of how offensive it may sound to some people (it is one's right to free speech, isn't that what everyone was shouting at the danish cartoon terrorists?). Anyways (sorry for drifting away) the movie stays true to the book's story most of the time, changing only a couple of minor details that won't really matter in the long run. The whole plot seems very compressed tho as there is a lot to go trough and not a lot of time to do so. This results in some underdevelopment of most of the characters, and there's a feeling of shallowness to them, as much of their background is rushed trough in the middle of the action. Also some lines from the book have been forced into the script, resulting in a couple of poorly acted scenes, but other than that all main actors did a very good job, specially Paul Bettany and Ian McKellen. All in all it's a cool movie, despite of all the flaws. If you haven't read the book, and don't take the whole religious thing too seriously, give it a try, it's far from being a bad movie. If you have read the book, go check it out too, either way it'll be a fun evening if you're not expecting a lot."
"brandonccw","6","1","3","18 May 2006"," treat it as a ""film"" and still find it a strong sleeping pill
","I have to say i have quite high an anticipation when i walked in the cinema, and obviously i was not alone to have high emotions tonight: the whole cinema was packed and my friend and i had to move to the front rows. my neck is still sore.<br/><br/>Anyone who had read the book may find the film version terrible as all the twists are known beforehand. But let's be fair and treat it as it is--a ""film"", there are still a whole lots of things making me bored and yawn. The film's flow is slow and all the twists and suspense you expect from the book are clearly overshadowed by the slow pace and clunky conversations. Ron Howard, as expected, tries his best to shoot this film in a linear way, in the sense that it squarely follows the chapters in the book, and that, makes me bored and yawn. Not did i want it to deviate from the story but if the purpose is to keep the audience' adrenalin going, Ron Howard just did the opposite. <br/><br/>The cinematography and the background sound effect doesn't really add up and help this movie a successful thriller. I don't agree that the movie is ""dark"" or ""nocturnal"" as according to the book, the incident happens in the middle of the night and only when the setting moves to London can one see the daytime activities. It is supposed to be 'nocturnal"". <br/><br/>In a nutshell, the fatal flaw is it lacks the elements what a thriller should have: the tantalizing puzzles that make the audience baffled and desperate to know what will happen next; the looming sense of insecurity that keep the characters make the whole matters make-or-break. But for this one, you would probably just sit there and like ""so?""<br/><br/>Still some good points: The visualisation of the plot, the architecture and the paintings are very much captivating. Ian Mckellen is just remarkable and fitting (though a bit of over exposure recently given his new work: X-Men3 is out soon); Paul Bettany's Silas wins my sympathy; Jean Reno, as some viewers said, was made for the role of Bazu Fache. Who could've done better? Audrey Tautou is convincing as Sophie Neveu. Finally, Tom Hanks, ha, guess we all need to give ourselves some time to get used to his hairstyle. <br/><br/>P.S. (no pun intended for the Priory of Sion or Princess Sophie) the emotions were equally high outside the cinema as some serious Catholics and priests gathered along the street to denounce the screening of this movie. Not that kind of promotion Sony Picture can get even if it pays."
"techchad","1","2","12","22 May 2006"," Question: ""Is there any truth to The Da Vinci Code?""
","Question: ""Is there any truth to The Da Vinci Code?"" Answer: Is there such a thing as Da Vinci Code truth? It is important to remember that The Da Vinci Code (The DaVinci Code) is entirely fictional. As much as author Dan Brown would like you to believe, The Da Vinci Code has no solid basis historically, Biblically, or theologically. The Da Vinci Code is essentially an attempt to ""humanize"" Jesus Christ by inventing a story of how His true identity was distorted and hidden for nearly two thousand years. In The Da Vinci Code, Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had children. Mary Magdalene and Jesus' descendants were the ""holy grail"" that carries the blood of Christ. The Da Vinci Code states that these facts about Jesus Christ were covered up by the early church in order to protect the idea of Jesus' divinity. All the Christian books which told of Jesus' relationship with Mary Magdalene were destroyed. Any evidence of such a relationship was covered up.<br/><br/>Again, The Da Vinci Code is fiction. It has no basis in reality. It is a well-written, entertaining book  but that is it. Dan Brown, the author, is of the persuasion that these ideas about Jesus are true. Since there is no historical, Biblical, or theological basis for his beliefs, Dan Brown presented them in a fictional account. Jesus was not married to Mary Magdalene or anyone else. Jesus did not have any children. Yes, the early church attempted to destroy many ""gospels"" about Jesus, but they did so because they were almost universally recognized as heretical, not to cover anything up. Even these ""gospels"" only give hints of a relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene. The church did not cover up the truth about Jesus being married to Mary Magdalene. Rather, the church protected the truth about Jesus being God in the flesh (John 1:1,14).<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is in reality an attack on the Person of Jesus Christ. People do not want to believe that Jesus is God, that Jesus is the Savior  so they make up false beliefs about Him in order to create a false Jesus that they can believe in. That is what The Da Vinci Code is all about  presenting a false view of who Jesus Christ truly wasand then explaining why this ""truth"" has been ""hidden"" for nearly 2000 years."

","The Da Vinci Code is a film,I expected to dislike,mainly due to my lack of interest in the subject,but to my surprise,despite it's over length,The Da Vinci Code managed to satisfy me for the most part. It's not that I don't believe in god,cause I actually do quite a bit,it's just the whole subject really didn't seem to keen for my interests. The film is very low key for the most part,keeping the action and suspense to a minimum,focusing more on, the plot and dialog. While that isn't necessarily a bad thing,I did however,want them to get on with it a couple of times. The locations are absolutely beautiful,as are the set pieces,it created a nice atmospheric type mood to the film. I had heard how Tom Hanks was miscast as Robert Langdon,and how he played it too straight. I thought he was a key component to this film,he and Audrey Tautou shared chemistry and charisma together. The film itself is quite confusing sometimes,and hard to follow|The twist at the end came out of nowhere for me| but I managed to find The Da Vinci Code,quite the interesting time waster. I don't think it's a film that deserved to make well over 200 Million at the box office,but it was a decent film.<br/><br/>Performances. Tom Hanks is one of the best actors of all time in my opinion,but I was a bit worried,due to the criticism of the reviewers. Thankfully to my relief,he came through as always,with his special brand of charm and undeniable charisma. He was the main component to making this film work,he gave a sly show. Audrey Tautou started off rather mediocre,but got better once the film got going. She's classy,with the looks to boot,I enjoyed her performance. Ian McKellen is superb here. You can't take your eyes off of him,whenever he's on screen,not only that,some of his banter with Tom Hanks, are some of the film'best scenes. Jean Reno is pretty good as the bulldog type cop,he did fine with what he had to do. Paul Bettany's performance as Silas,may come across as over the top to some. I however found it to be mesmerizing,and thoroughly creepy at times. Alfred Molina& Jürgen Prochnow have small roles,but as always add some class to it.<br/><br/>Bottom Line. The Da Vinci Code isn't something,I'd wanna sit through again,I don't think,but it certainly passed the time amiably. Recommended if your in the mood for a low key,thinking type film.<br/><br/>7/10"
"WyllyWylly","7","1","4","17 September 2009"," Worth the watch, but is it a classic?
","The Da Vinci Code. Talked about a great deal, caught in a firestorm of controversy for fictional theories on one of the world's major religions (Christianity), and a star-packed cast... all the fuel is there for a potentially great fire. But does the Da Vinci Code satisfy? Let me evaluate the movie as a movie, for movies are a different animal than books. If you've read Dan Brown's novel, you will have preconceived notions. I encourage you to take this as a movie and leave out the comparisons until later if that is the case.<br/><br/>Casting is well done. Tom Hanks is a strong name and with that comes the task of making the character its own. For actors with star power the challenge is to make you forget that you are watching the actor and are instead watching the character. Hanks does well as the lead in this regard, but is not perfect. Audrey Tatou is not a household name, yet her Sophie Neveu is also fairly strong. The pairing of Hanks and Tatou does not generate stellar chemistry, but is not objectionable either.At the top of his game is Sir Ian McKellen. His portrayal of Leigh Teabing is excellent and believable. Alfred Molina is a great actor, yet I found his priestly character a bit melodramatic. Granted, the character is a supporting role, yet there are moments where you wonder if a priest could really be ""that way."" Paul Bettany IS Silas and is suitably creepy as a fanatical if misguided monk. Jean Reno puts forth a strong performance as Bezu Fache. <br/><br/>Cinematography is lush and consistent. The film is visually appealing and makes excellent use of lighting and color. It's easy to believe you are in Paris, which is helped by the sparing and timely use of the native language, which is captioned where it appears. Special effects are sparingly used and to good effect to help advance a complex story. One niggle for me is the fact that the albino monk does not have pink eyes - although it appears Bettany is wearing some kind of contact lens to make his stare burn into you, it's a strange inaccuracy.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is excellent in that it's transparent. Tension is built at the appropriate moments but never overwhelming. Thankfully, the film is not used as a vehicle to promote singles or artists, allowing the score to do its job effectively without jarring the viewer.<br/><br/>Pacing starts off quickly - you are brought into the action almost immediately without confusion. Many ""aha!"" moments keep the movie from becoming a snoozer. All the same, the length of the film (2.5 hours) is a factor, and the long running time might make the viewer feel a bit tired. If you experience something for long enough, you become fatigued and this film feels a bit languid towards the end. The climax of the film is almost understated and not substantially more dramatic than the events leading towards it.<br/><br/>Finally, the production is excellent overall. The sets are designed well and do not overpower the acting. The locations were well chosen and provide an excellent environment for the heart of the story. Ron Howard develops the characters well as the movie progresses and brings out strong performances from most of his cast. There are also a few cheap scares and plot devices, but they are infrequent and forgivable.<br/><br/>Having viewed this on both the big and small screens, I find the Da Vinci Code to be an entertaining evening. Where the film suffers tends to be in minor things: the length contributing to a somewhat slow feel at the finish, and some perfunctory character development where the leads are not concerned. A 7/10, the Da Vinci Code leaves you satisfied but not wanting more."
"johnnyboyz","6","1","4","16 April 2008"," A definite puzzle that takes some working out but is this a puzzle you'll want to revisit again and again?
","I can understand the upset and the controversy this film dug up and still does now. The ideas behind Da Vinci and his hidden codes were first introduced to us a few years previous to this film, by novelist Dan Brown and whilst I have not read that book, it seems this film is less an exciting and intelligent piece of medium to sit through and more so a slap in the face to those who have spent countless hours, days, weeks and months actually reading the bible. The Dan Vinci code does, I suppose, feel like a big budget Easter egg hunt  ironic then how something like an Easter egg hunt (something linked to but not directly involved with Jesus Christ) should be used to compare to a film about the supposed myth that Jesus Christ actually was.<br/><br/>I think it's quite sad when a film takes on a difficult and challenging subject matter but invokes mocking and ridicule more so than discussion on a constructive nature. But then again, it's not like I immediately took to this film because I felt under-whelmed. Instead of being presented with an argument, having the argument developed and then being given an oppositional reading, I got a blockbuster inspired film with chase scenes, characters with guns, espionage and criminal underworld activity - I'm not sure how honest to the book the film is but if Brown has written all of this also, then it makes me think he's trying to do a Bond or a Bourne but uses religion as a front for the story instead of The Cold War or amnesia.<br/><br/>The critical analysis begins as soon as the film begins; Robert Langdon (Hanks), who it would seem is the reoccurring hero of Brown's books, gives a lecture to an audience of multi-ethnical students about symbols and how they can mean different things: the Nazi symbol with Far East religion and the peace symbol muddled in with something else. ""Tonight, this will be our quest""  that is he will investigate these codes and clues and get to the bottom of it all, but is he speaking to us the audience? The students are all of different ethnical groups and nationalities; maybe we, the watching audience, are the hall of students being told what to expect from the very off. The theme here being 'all is not what it first seems.....' (cue eerie yet tacky music).<br/><br/>And so Langdon goes on a journey. He is ripped from his world of lectures, students and book signings and thrust into a world of criminals, police and espionage when I was really expecting a world of intrigue, argument and debate. The one scene that demonstrates this is when Sir Leigh Teabing (McKellen) goes off on a rant at his mansion presenting us with The Last Supper drawing and gives us his little insight into phallic challis meanings. Hanks plays Langdon with a stern face and a downbeat voice, he is a rabbit in the headlights but it is not Hanks' fault  he has nothing to work with; in fact I preferred his performance of the exact same nature in exactly the same situation in Saving Private Ryan (a man torn from his world and placed amongst war and everything that comes with it).<br/><br/>The major problem with The Da Vinci Code is that it just does not inform, nor does it really entertain. The film might be quite fun, if you can understand the language of Latin; it might work, if you are lightening quick with anagrams; you might be engaged, if you know your ancient history and your facts and figures. The film might even work if you've either read or have a general knowledge of the bible, but toward the end and especially after Teabing's little rant you'll just feel insulted. Thus, it's a case of insult the one demographic that may be intrigued by your film: not a good idea. In fact for most of the film, we needn't even look at the screen but just listen to the apparent argument as well as facts and figures that are apparently being presented to us.<br/><br/>It is a shame that the best parts of the film must lie within the opening and closing twenty minutes with most of the in-between stuff just filling in. There is a scene when Langdon and his female sidekick Sophie Neveu (Tautou) are about to be executed in the back of a lorry; it works and is suspenseful but these should not be the best bits of the film. Similarly, the same situation occurs in a church; the camera cuts to 'on high' as some pigeons flutter and disturb the gunman  the chance to escape presents itself. Another good scene, as is the exchange between three people over an enclosed coded map. One question, were those pigeons from 'on high' an act of divine intervention? All seemed lost but a coincidence saves the day; perhaps this little inclusion of a composition and an idea isn't actually there, maybe it is  but that's the theme: all is not what it first seems.<br/><br/>There are other flaws that double up as interesting ideas. Silas is brilliantly played Paul Bettany, a religious freak who must inflict pain on himself but I doubt God will approve of the nun killing. The film unravels its plot points and twists in a fashion that forces you to merely accept them and move on than really give you a chance to appreciate and acknowledge them. By the time the denouement involving a certain character has arrived, The Da Vinci Code has used up all of its best scenes and put to bed most of its best characters. Still, at least it was better than Dogma."
"catrachaboricua","5","1","4","30 January 2008"," Book was better well shot though
","I had read the book the Da Vinci Code before seeing the movie therefore the movie version was somewhat of a disappointment. Perhaps if I had seen the movie without reading the book I would have a better predilection for it. The Da Vinci Code in both the movie and book is hidden in the subliminal imagery of Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings. According to Dan Brown the Da Vinci Code is the secret of Jesus' marriage and holy bloodline. However, although this is widely accepted as the Da Vinci Code, Scholars and researchers of this topic know that this in fact isn't the true Da Vinci Code. If you look at Da Vinci's paintings you can see that he hated the holy family as he always painted himself with his back facing the Madonna and child. So, yes the theory of Jesus being married is in Leonardo's work but it isn't the most important hidden message. The real Da Vinci is hidden most perceptibly in two of his paintings: ""The Madonna of the Rocks"" and ""The Adorning of the Magi"" Da Vinci believed that the true Messiah was John the Baptist and that Jesus Christ selfishly ""took his place"" in a matter of speaking.<br/><br/>Well the movie was acceptable although a lot of key elements from the book were left out and I didn't agree with the casting. I pictured other actors/actresses for some of the characters. Despite all of this the film was adequate. I particularly really liked two scenes: The first being towards the end of the film when he's solving the cryptex and reveals that ""the missing orb from Sir Isaac Newton's tomb that fell from the heaven's with rosy flesh and seeded womb"" was an apple! I have admiration for clever wordplay so I appreciated that riddle. The other scene was the last scene because of how it was shot with the motif of his voice narrating the riddle as he's solving it and the final realization that he had found the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene."
"madpigmadpig","4","1","4","10 November 2007"," Not entirely forgettable, better than I thought it would be.
","The very first you'll notice is that the director is madly in love with Hitchcock, from the overly bouncy shot of the old man running in the first scene, to the constant close-ups of everything (even chase scenes), all the way to the shot of blood swirling down a drain. Even the basic meter of the movie is much like the later works of Hitchcock. I wouldn't complain about the acting, it's really kind of interesting to see this kind of movie done by a director and cast that one thinks of as the emotional equivalent of comfort food (porridge, hot cocoa, etc...).<br/><br/>The basic concept of the plot is very reminiscent of several science fiction stories (which is why I forgive the out-of-place computer graphics used to display Dr. langdon's thoughts) and is a refreshing departure from rather more monotonously mundane or emotionally disgusting story-lines that choke the entertainment industry. Having said that, however, I must point out that there is quite a bit of unnecessary material such as the overabundance of scenes where the crazy monk stands around naked and/or beating himself, we can see their makeup department has a talent for realistic wounds, but we don't need that much time to appreciate it. Then there's the constant barrage of hints, making the entire plot known to the audience and leaving no surprises to look forward to. it just isn't as much fun if you already have all of the important story points handed to you by a careless camera shot, a character blurting out something that gives away the end when your only part way through, or a ""good guy"" that seems just a little too naive to actually be a good guy. Lastly, I found the all of the flashbacks and personal phobias unhelpful, uninspired, and unconvincingly portrayed. Also they never did explain what that ritual was that frightened Sophie as a little girl.<br/><br/>I recommend that you come in just about when they introduce Ian McKellen's character (a scene entitled ""Seeking Sanctuary"" and watch from then on, you'll miss the boring stuff and find that it actually manages to be an entertaining movie."

I broke down and finally read it too, to get ready for the movie since I figured that a movie with Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellan, Paul Bettany and Jean Reno can't be all bad. Flat out, this is a case where the book is much superior to the movie, although that's not really saying very much. The Da Vinci Code is a second rate story trapped in a third rate novel and it's much worse on screen since all its flaws are magnified to the size of 100 foot screen. <br/><br/>There is no chemistry between the main characters, at all. This is a real shame since Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou look great together on screen but they don't look like they had a lot of fun making this movie. Both Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon who is a Harvard professor of symbology (a discipline that doesn't exist and just seems to be an excuse to sound like you know something when you really don't know anything) and Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, a French police cryptologist aren't convincing in their roles. They both sleepwalk through their parts and look bored delivering the plot boiler, pulp fiction-like dialog. In the many chase scenes there is never a hint that either Langdon is being chased by the police for murder or that Neveu is risking her life and career helping the accused murderer of her own grandfather. The tension that should be in the movie is totally absent.<br/><br/>As a viewer, you never really feel a bond with the main characters, but you really feel something for the supporting actors. I think Ian McKellan's portrayal of Leigh Teabing was right on. He completely stole the show and obviously didn't take the movie seriously at all and completely hammed up his role of bête-noir in the story. His explanation of the Holy Grail in his French castle estate is probably the best part of the movie. Paul Bettany as Silas the albino assassin monk is menacing and frightening. I really wanted his character to come out a lot better in both the book and the movie since he has the most interesting story of all the characters. I do think the two scenes where we see him making penance and scouring himself are a little much and those scenes probably lasted too long for the movie's good. Jean Reno as Fache, the French police detective is great too playing a relentless detective who isn't like Javert and sees his mistake in the end. Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa has some good moments too and does fine in his role.<br/><br/>Having filmed on location in Paris at the Louvre, in London at Westminster Abbey and at the famous Lincoln Cathedral that doubles for The Temple Church, director Ron Howard couldn't go wrong. The cinematography great is and so is the sound. The flashback visual effects that Howard uses to illustrate the past history as Langdon or Teabing explains the history and back story of the movie is very effective but it made me want to see more of the Crusades or more about the Knights Templar. Ron Howard is good at making big cinematic gestures but somehow he forgot that the whole movie is a big chase from Paris to London and as I said above the view doesn't get the feeling that anyone is ever in danger or there is anything really at stake. The movie is about half an hour too long and could have used some work in the editing room to make the pace of the movie from a drama into a thriller, which the movie wants to be. The music by Hans Zimmer really sounds like it should be in a thriller but without the action on screen the music falls flat and just sounds like it was taken from an Indiana Jones movie.<br/><br/>After seeing The Da Vinci Code, I have to wonder what the fuss is all about. It's just a novel or a movie and not a very good one on either count. Anyone who is taking this fictional account at all seriously has to I remember there were a lot of yawns in the theater and everyone left very quickly as they were talking about how underwhelmed they were about the movie. If you're really interested in this, read the book, or read Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which Dan Brown liberally took his ideas from, even going so far to name Leigh Teabing after Leigh Baigent who is one of the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail. The Da Vinci Code proves the old phrase of the book being far better than the movie to be true at least in this case."

I liked the first 1:45 of the movie, then well it seemed to me that too much was revealed at the wrong time, making it less than suspenseful after that. I loved the character of Silas, played by Paul Bettany, Tom Hanks character i liked very much. seeking the truth, very studious, always thinking, i respect that. I absolutely think Jean Reno shined in this movie, he is one of the best French actors today. I think that this movie came too quickly after the book, I haven't read the book, but i will someday. The movie took us to magical places. Westminster Abby, the Louvre, just to name 2 .

"za-andres","2","1","4","12 March 2007"," Trashy Book, Trashy Film
","Dan Brown's novel, The Da Vinci Code, was a blast to read. And I remember to this day that a major motion picture was written all over it. Unfortunately, the film isn't as good as many expected it to be. With a terrible script, bad acting, and wrong interpretation of the book, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a dreary and cheap piece of entertainment. Ron Howard's interpretation of the book is terrible. And like all book adapted scripts, the dialouge is a mess. To their credit the director and his screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman (who collaborated with Mr. Howard on ""Cinderella Man"" and ""A Beautiful Mind""), have streamlined Mr. Brown's story and refrained from trying to capture his, um, prose style. ""Almost inconceivably, the gun into which she was now staring was clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long white hair."" Such language  note the exquisite ""almost"" and the fastidious tucking of the ""which"" after the preposition  can live only on the page.<br/><br/>For those who read the book, I will keep it short by saying that it has some mistaken parts to it, and perhaps is not at all what the readers want to see. Tom Hanks is useless as Robert Langdon, a cryptologist who discovers a deadly secret, and is being framed for murder. Tom Hanks is a slick haired Smarty that acts very bad in this one. Why? Oh, well it seems that Mr. Hanks tone is dry and apparently has no expression on his face. Compare this this to ""Forest Gump"". Perhaps the highlight of ""The Da Vinci Code"" is the acting of Ian McKellen, who is Leigh Teabing, a complete backstabber with a moronic attitude. Again, a better film is needed.<br/><br/>And so, The anticipated ""Da Vinci Code"" came crashing down like I didn't expect it to. And you have to ask yourself: Why do they make the movies in the trailers so good?"

And though I didn't agree with the casting of Tom Hanks (I thought Clive Owen was a better choice), I couldn't argue that Hanks is a great actor (his last few pictures notwithstanding). Seemed a pairing of Ron Howard & Hanks would deliver an excellent film.<br/><br/>This certainly was not the case. The movie drags even when it's in high gear. So much of the book is just glossed over that there is no soul to the movie. Hanks' Langdon is walking through the movie as if what's happening is an everyday occurrence... where's the fear, awe and incredulity?? Such a great book and story completely wasted in this movie. <br/><br/>As I've said; if you've read the book, this movie is a waste. If you've never read the book.. you should and forget this mess.

I viewed the film for what it is - a piece of fiction and another angle on the story of Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>Nothing could rock my solid faith and this film didn't even raise a speck of dust. At the end of the day it's just a ludicrous story and in no way should be taken seriously.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it very much indeed and was amazed that I'd sat through 2 and a quarter hours by the time the credits rolled. It is rare that a film grips me enough to prevent me from continually clock watching but this film did just that. It was entertaining from beginning to end and I though everyone played their part very well indeed, especially Sir Ian McKellan.<br/><br/>Several of my church friends refuse to watch this film but I can't think why. Probably their faith isn't profound enough and they fear this film may make them re-think their beliefs. I was much the same when I first heard about the film and the associated controversy with my church but after time I realised my faith was strong enough and was in no danger whatsoever of being swayed by the screenplay of a fictional book.<br/><br/>I can honestly say, as a devout Catholic, that I enjoyed this film very much and, ironically, it has helped to deepen my faith even further.

And then some stupid asshole decides to make a movie out of it and of course all it becomes is crap. This is not a good movie!! Tom Hanks does a lame performance while Audrey Tautou on the other hand does a more even performance. Ian McKellen does a good job and fits in pretty good in his role which also goes for Jean Reno. The plot follows the book and works a little better than the actors. It truly surprises me that the leads in this movie can suck when they have got a pretty good manuscript and an interesting plot. The poor performances in this movie sinks it to the bottom of the drink. The best actor in this poor half ass production is Paul Bettany, who does a very good job.

","I cannot hide the fact that I WAS expecting this film for quite some time, and I WAS expecting something really good. I had very high hope for this movie, Ron Howard being the director, Hanks, Reno, Prochnov and McKellen being the main characters and a few years of time given to make this thing. I also cannot hide my disappointment when I saw it. What is more, I intend to show my disappointment in this humble review. First of all, the script is chopped into little pieces, I believe in order to somewhat imitate the original novel. However it does certainly not serve the production well. The action is quick, that's true, but all the rest totally sucks. The dialogs are meaningless because the action goes on ""without thinking"" I'd say. The viewer does not consider the things the actors say as significant to drive the action or create a mysterious atmosphere, a chilling one or whatever (I read the book a long time ago, by the way). Secondly, I was really confused by the actors' performance. I said to myself ""Tom Hanks and the gang can't possibly mess this up, there's no way something like that would happen"". Again, I was left speechless after the movie, and it wasn't because of my utmost admiration. The actors are surprisingly weak and uncool, not one of them showed anything above an awful sope opera (then again, sope opera characters can at least imitate extreme emotions). I was especially sad by the acting of Reno and McKellen as they are my favorites in this production, and they have always made me admire their work, no matter what. Next, the music..... WHERE IS IT, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD? Music is one of the most important issues of a movie, it cannot be omitted like some petty minor role. Needless to say, the scriptwriter himself tried to be very witty, but it didn't work out. What he was trying to do was twisting the facts presented in the book (I still can't even fathom why) and make some kind of deranged version of The Da Vinci Code strictly for those who haven't read the book and don't know the brighter side. Overall, this is some kind of piece of art and it pains me to give it a whole big 3."

","Ron Howard must be at the top of my list of BAD directors. I went to see the movie two days after i had just written the book, which if i might add, pretty dull.

Of course, having read the book a few days before, i was just hoping to visualize the story, and got pretty annoyed when they tampered with the book. Foundation number one for any film is good acting. What happened here? Jean Reno, Audrey Tatou, Tom Hanks and Ian Mc Kellen. All save the last two seem to have seen their talent washed away with this project. Jean Reno, the detective from Crimson Rivers, The assassin of Leon, must have given his worst role in this movie. Audrey Tatou was despicable and Tom Hanks, Though playing the part well was just extremely annoying. And Mr.Howard, when the hero of a story is a history teacher, you better get the most likable one on the planet. Ian Mc Kellen was good during the scene in château Villette. As for the directing, it seemed as if every scene was given to a different director without any of them knowing what feel the other scenes have been given. I will forgive Amelie Poulain, the prison guard in the Green Mile, Leon the professional and Gandalf as none of them could have delivered such a bad part without the help of Mr. Howard. So next time you are about to see a very well marketed film, remember the heap of trash i have just commented on, and rent an old classic along the line of Kubrick or Leone."

"johnnychimpo","3","1","4","6 June 2006"," This film is sloooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwww.......
","Before reviewing such a 'controversial' film, it may be worth making it clear where I am coming from.<br/><br/>First of all, I thought the book was entertaining, if badly written hokum. Second, as someone who was raised Catholic, I did not find any of the ideas in the book offensive, as I consider myself to be intelligent enough to realise that the central conceit of the film- that Jesus fathered a child- is a fiction, just as I now believe that much of the bible is apocryphal.<br/><br/>The problem I have with this film is that it is so slow. Every scene has the life stamped out of it by journeyman directing , painful (long) moments of exposition, and what I can only assume was penny-pinching by the producers. An example- the film contains the shortest and least exciting car chase ever, lasting approx 20 seconds and involving a car driving between two bin (garbage to Americans) wagons. I seem to recall the chase in the book was quite involved, allowing the Prof to have a Dan Brown trademarked 'really big think' whilst Sophie handled the driving.<br/><br/>Some bits are just plain hilarious- exhibit 1- Paul Bettany's mad monk turn was straight out of panto exhibit 2- The low flying plane- Sophie looks out of a plane window at the police cars, the way it is edited gives the impression that the plane is about 30 feet in the air. I'm no air traffic controller, but I would assume that planes do not fly that low until seconds before landing. exhibit 3- when they are investigating the body of the old bloke at the Louvre- why do they always shine a really bright light at the body's crotch? To be fair they do this on CSI as well, so it must be standard practice for Coroners to do this.<br/><br/>To be fair, I thought there were two good scenes- the scene with the Cryptex (where the prof visualizes the planets after visiting Newton's tomb- another 'really big think') and the scene at the end where he visits the Louvre- more thinking. This had nothing to do with the writing, directing, editing (etc), rather the music swelled up real good, and Tom Hanks did some of his best 'thinking acting'. He is one of the few Hollywood actors to be able to convey the impression of someone who is actually thinking (and remain credible) rather than just daydreaming.<br/><br/>Also it just occurred to me that Ian McKellen steals every scene that he's in, and the scenes showing stuff happening in historical times look awesome- like they are out of a much better movie. So I give it an extra star (from 2* to 3*).<br/><br/>In all, a big let down. I don't think I will ever watch this again, even if it shown on TV on a Sunday and there is nothing else on."
"liam1694u","3","1","4","5 June 2006"," Rushed Job...not what it ""could have/should have"" been
","This was poor movie. Please allow me to take some time to explain why I feel this way. Let me start by looking at it from the POV of someone who never read the book, Someone whose expectations shouldn't be too high.<br/><br/>It seemed like this movie was rushed to get it into the theaters. I don't think too much effort was put into it at all. The acting is anything but good, which is a sign of poor directing (sorry Ron). Except for a few characters (Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany) the acting was mediocre at best. The editing was very bad. The cuts to-and-from the action, as well as key events, were spastic and unclean. They did not flow worth a D@mn. And it wasn't like the movie was intensionally made jumpy as an editing technique. It was just poor editing. I've seen High School student projects with better editing. On the plus side. the DP did a GREAT job. Very nice cinematography and lighting, but that isn't enough to make up for just a plain bad movie. I am sorry Ron, but this film does not reflect your talents as a skilled movie director.<br/><br/>Now from the POV of someone who has read the book, I don't care that it doesn't follow the story line perfectly. I understand that some things just don't transfer to film very well, while other things can be easily cut from the story for time and to make it flow better. Yes there are plenty of changes to the original story, all of which I was able to live with. In fact I am very pleased with how it followed the book, which is usually the biggest complaint when a popular novel is transfered to film. However, anyone who has read the book, would agree that one of the things that made the book such a big hit were all of the codes and secrets, all of the mystery surrounding artwork and architecture, all the history(real or fake). This movie however, treated these elements of the story as an after thought. Every time a puzzle came up, a mystery had to be solved, or a revelation had been made, the movie breezed right through them, never giving the audience time to ponder the clues or to even to 'know' the clues. It went through them SO FAST that even someone like me, who had read the book, had trouble following what was going on and what had just happened (once again much is due to very VERY poor editing). Every part of the movie where things should have been slowed down and given more detail, it was drastically sped up and cut short. Every part of the move that was just transitional and could be taken at a nice easy pace ended up being drawn way out and was turned into the focus of the whole movie. The hidden elements in the artwork and architecture were never explained or given any screen time, except for a short sequence on DaVinci's ""Last Supper"". Not a single ""double entendre"" was ever revealed. Not a single element of what made the book such a hit, was added to the movie.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, if you liked the book, don't go see this movie. If you didn't like the book, don't go see this movie. If you have not yet read the book, don't go see this movie. If you never have, nor ever will read the book, because you have absolutely no interest in it or it's subject matter, don't go see this movie. It was made simply for the sake of making it. Zero thought and effort were put into making it a good movie. The screenplay was OK, the directing sucked, the acting sucked, the editing REALLY REALLY sucked, the cinematography was good. It was built on hype and a desire for money alone."

","Having always been wary of Summer Blockbuster books whose title clearly follows the magic formula of : Definite Article + Classical Reference (a name, or letter from the Greek alphabet) + Code/Conspiracy/Affair, I wouldn't have gone to see it, but a couple of friends asked me along. Well, it was nice seeing them and having a beer beforehand.<br/><br/>The film itself? Two and a half hours which could be usefully reduced to two, removing all the pointless flashbacks for a start. Even so, the film still lacks pace - 80% of the point in a thriller, as it creates suspense even when the scenario is painfully thin, as is the case here. It is much too easy to see what's coming next.<br/><br/>The acting? Apart from Ian McKellen, who does his considerable best to make something out of a two-dimensional character, it's frankly wooden. Some of these people have won awards for performances in other films, but you'd never guess. No doubt the lacklustre direction nobbled them.<br/><br/>All in all, an extremely disappointing film which fully merited its panning by professional critics when shown at Cannes. Don't waste time and money on it: it'll leave a sour taste in your mouth and might even put you off going to see better films with the same actors *actually being allowed to act*.<br/><br/>Incidentally, nobody it going to make me believe that a professor in an obscure branch of theology writes bestselling books and can afford to stay at the Ritz, any more than you can see the stars through the pollution in any major city anywhere in the world.

","I had just finished reading the book a week before seeing the movie, and every detail was fresh in my mind as I saw it with my daughter. As one who hadn't read the book, she had little idea what Silas's true calling was. The book portrays him as a devoted re-born man with a tormented past, willing to kill or be killed serving his beloved bishop. The movie offered a muddled collage of Silas's past that left him looking more like an emotionally needy ex-con with a zeal for self abuse.<br/><br/>Teabing's character was toned down considerably compared to the book, which really disappointed me. Peter O'Toole would have been fantastic for the part, and perhaps would have brought the broader ranges of the character to the screen. Though Remy (his man-servant) was instrumental in the book, his character could basically have been written out of the movie without affecting anything. His presence was trivial, and his murder pointless to the movie plot.<br/><br/>Considering the story was designed to pay tribute to the ""Sacred Feminine"", Sophie's book character as a brilliant cryptographer was reduced to more like a side-kick chick who received occasional compliments.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think that certain cast choices were off, and that Ron Howard should have made the movie thirty minutes longer if that's what it would have taken to tell the story thoroughly."

","After being underwhelmed by the book I had my doubts whether I should see the movie or not, but I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt and seeing the line-up of the actors I hoped that Ron Howard would make the most of it.<br/><br/>But, to be honest and in my opinion, after all the hype that preceded both the book and the movie I found The DaVinci Code to be a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon performed incredibly flat and one-dimensional; and he looks like Steven Seagal and I can only hope Tom didn't try to emulate Steven's acting abilities. Audrey Tautou looks lovely, but she played her role as Sophie Neveu without any emotion whatsoever and her grandfather (or at least who she thought was her grandfather) was murdered. Jean Reno was horribly painful miscast as Bezu Fache.<br/><br/>The only two that made the movie a little bearable were Paul Bettany as Silas, since he was allowed to show a range of emotions, although still I had the impression they were downplayed by the director and/or editor, and Ian McKellen who stole the movie as Leigh Teabing in every scene he was in showcasing his class and talent.<br/><br/>Considering they shot a great part of the movie in Louvre, they could have done so much more with it; for all I know, they could have filmed this entirely on a sound-stage. The other locations were pretty bland as well and much more dramatic effect could have been achieved with more daring camera work. The movie could also have used a little more humor; I think I smiled about two times, while I believe there was more room for a few quips.<br/><br/>And the movie was way too long with 2.5 hours. I realize that making it shorter it would mean that there would be less room for flashbacks telling the back-story of some of the events, but leaving out all this detail could have been beneficial for the story arc. Also, every lead Robert and Sophie follow up is explained to death, so it shows that this is an American movie made primarily for an American audience (no offense, though). I saw this movie in its second week, and halfway during the movie people left, the friend I went to see it with fell asleep for about half an hour and after waking up he felt as if he didn't miss anything.<br/><br/>Perhaps another director and a different cast would have made a difference, then again, the book was pretty bland as well, so perhaps not turning this book into a movie would have been the best choice. For all the people who loved the book let me point you to Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco, written 15 years before Dan Brown's movie script, but so much better on all levels.<br/><br/>Overall, let me advise anyone who is in doubt to go see it to wait till the movie is releases on DVD and spend the ticket money on another film; I'm sure you can think of a few, because I can."
"stephaniewuk","4","1","4","2 June 2006"," Entertaining Enough But Glad I Got a Concession On The Ticket
","Having not read the book I think my review of the film may well be savaged by devoted fans of the best-selling novel although considering I was not particularly impressed by it, perhaps it will coincide with the views of those who were thrilled by the book and feel let down (as is often the case) with movie adaptations.<br/><br/>Audrey Tatou gives a solid performance as the beautiful and doe-eyed Sophie (the only thing I have seen her in is Amelie and she shook the character off quite well) Hanks is OK although not particularly charismatic as Robert Langford.<br/><br/>Though the story is essentially quite silly, difficult to follow and even dull in parts (I think this is why you should read it first) the film is on the whole entertaining enough - the final twist in the tale nicely rounding off what was an interesting spin on, dare I say it, the traditional ""story"".<br/><br/>Dan Brown cannot be given full marks for originality, however; anyone who has seen ""Dogma"" will notice a similar twist in the plot line. Like JK Rowling and her Harry Potter books, Brown simply got scribbling at a time when people wanted something a little controversial and juicy to read. Ron Howard cashed in on that just in time, while Code was fresh in people's memories and before Brown's other books got popular.<br/><br/>I'm inclined to agree with other reviewers of this movie about whether or not Catholics should be offended by its content. Don't be. It's just a story created for entertainment value; if anything it gives the Church free publicity!"
"saralee-etter","5","1","4","1 June 2006"," Missed opportunities
","I read the book and enjoyed it very much, but the movie didn't quite measure up. I think this may be partly because the screenplay followed the book too closely. (I can't believe I just wrote that.) <br/><br/>For example, I think an opportunity was missed at the beginning of the film when Robert Langdon's character is established. I would have liked to have seen him waiting for Sauniere as the credits rolled, and then when Sauniere doesn't show, having him run into a bunch of other academics who have read his book. They scoff at him, but he explains his theories so logically and brilliantly (writing symbols down on a cocktail napkin) that they're blown away. They are full of respect. Then he dashes off to do his lecture, having been fully established as Symbolic-Man for the rest of the movie. That would have been better than the lecture alone, even though it was interestingly inter-cut with the opening scene at the Louvre.<br/><br/>But if we had seen him waiting for Sauniere, we would know that he was speaking the truth a little bit later when Fache asks him if he's met Sauniere, and Langdon says no.<br/><br/>Langdon should be the audience's stand-in throughout the movie, and I don't think we identify with him enough. The storytelling seems distant and removed from his character. The book was great because readers could solve the puzzles along with the characters, but in the movie you don't get the same feeling of urgency and triumph.<br/><br/>If Langdon's character had been all about ""puzzles are cool! symbols are my life!"" I think we would have been drawn in more deeply. Unfortunately, Langdon doesn't care deeply about anything, so neither do we.<br/><br/>The scenes with Ian McKellan and Tom Hanks are brilliant, and full of the kind of excitement that bring the movie to life. Finally, SOMEBODY cares about these darn symbols. It seemed to me that the story really caught fire once it got to that part, when it should have been like that from the beginning. They're so ""Gee Whiz! look at these cool secrets hidden in the painting!"" It was great. That same excitement should have been present in the opening scenes.<br/><br/>Also, I think Sophie should have had a chance to solve a puzzle. Audrey Tatou's character is emotional and handles her gun competently enough but doesn't get a chance to display any intellectual prowess. Another missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Anyway, the rest of the movie was fun. It just took so long to get the ball rolling. Jean Reno was terrific (and his sidekick was great, too), Albert Molina was in great form, and Paul Bettany was a scary Silas.<br/><br/>I don't give a hoot about the so-called theological underpinnings. It's fiction, nothing more. No sense straining at gnats and swallowing camels, folks."

","It was utterly predictable an outcome - a much anticipated screen adaptation of Dan Brown's indeed horribly written, but quite entertaining (and even somewhat thought-provoking - quite a feat for the area of contemporary mainstream entertainment) in terms of its plot, and certainly humanistic in terms of its message, ""The Da Vinci Code"" turning out to be a disappointment. What has become a surprise is the extent of it. Actually, it was an announcement of Ron Howard to become a director on this project that instantly turned a cheerful anticipation into a concerned apprehension. Mr. Howard is commonly known as a conscientious workman, but nothing more than that. While in this case some real creativity was needed. Well, judging by the result, even the director's not quite imaginative craftsmanship seems to have been seriously exaggerated.<br/><br/>The way in which the movie is made clearly suggests that its creators assumed that their potential audiences were acquainted with the book. I might be mistaken, but it's immaterial - a good portion of those who wound up as the viewers of this one, if not the overwhelming majority of them, WERE familiar with it. So I wonder if it ever occurred to the creators that they were actually supposed to come up with some idea in order to overcome this unfortunate circumstance? And if you come to think about it there was only one approach that gave a chance to stay faithful to the book and, at the same time, provide people with something which wouldn't reduce their experience to a dubiously entertaining undertaking of getting themselves acquainted with a weather forecast for yesterday. <br/><br/>To illustrate this point allow me a brief deviation. For any sentient viewer the ending of M. Night Shyamalan's minor ""ghost"" masterpiece is more than predictable - after all the answer is being delivered in plain words somewhere in the middle of the movie. Nonetheless, the finale with its ""revelation"" works out superbly and is indeed quite overwhelming. It's just that it's rather strikes you with its dramatic than surprising effect. That was exactly the way to go on this occasion.<br/><br/>The similar shift of emphasis - enigmas giving way to drama - might have saved this adaptation. Through creating a dense atmosphere, arranging meticulously all elements in every scene, introducing, if necessary, sensible alterations to the original developments, and engaging some real acting it was possible to try to shift accents from mysteries to the dramatic meaning behind their resolutions, characters' feelings about them and gradually transpiring behind each of those events the general message. Thus it was possible to repeat the effect as it occurred in the process of reading of the novel - despite the fact that, strictly speaking, none of those revelations would be something actually new to the audience. Consider, for instance, Mr. Shyamalan's ingenious use of a chain of subplots for deviating our attention in a very organic way from contemplating the obvious truth and creating the perfect emotional landscape which in turn is then used to sweep us away in the end. So it can be said that such an accomplishment was well within the capacities of a mortal. But, obviously, far beyond the abilities of two creative ""corpses"" who teamed up here to write and direct.<br/><br/>And , unfortunately, what we are offered instead as a result of their joint efforts is just an idiotic recountal of the novel's well-known events in pictures - obviously meant for those who failed to develop their reading skills. And properly speaking those pictures suck. The performers exchange their lines in a hasty manner which would be more appropriate for a first reading rehearsal. As to Mr. Howard's directing skills in general manifested here they simply seem laughable up to a certain point in the movie. After that point it ain't even funny anymore. Though the director has certainly managed to provide one single contribution to all the original mysteries - when for some profoundly enigmatic reasons decided to make Jurgen Prochnow with his ""a working class hero is something to be"" looks pose as a refined French aristocrat.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that Mr. Brown had probably made a mistake when he rejected the initial proposition to turn his book into a TV production. Had the material been properly rendered it might simply have exceeded all the reasonable time limitations applicable to a theatrical release. As it is the movie does the same thing - but in terms of its quality. And now what can be said? - A CON HID VICE, DET."

Basically, proof that a poorly-written book doesn't translate well even when-thankfully-the movie is shortened a bit.

"professorbb","6","1","4","30 May 2006"," An acceptable summer popcorn movie that improves on the book
","SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/>While not a perfect film by any means, and surrounded by far too much hysteria, the film can be an enjoyable experience if one puts aside all the hype surrounding it (which may have contributed to the negativity of some of the reviews of the film).<br/><br/>Although others disagree, I thought the film improved many aspects of the novel. Because I enjoy mysteries, and have some expertise in symbols, myths, and archetypes, my Catholic-raised spouse recommended the book. I enjoyed it, but thought it was sloppily written, derivative, and not particularly compelling (as in the page-turning sense mentioned so frequently by others). As someone who is knowledgeable in history, I found the ""historical"" aspects of the books laughable, but I didn't take them seriously. As a long-time feminist, I was more perturbed by the claim that it was ""feminist,"" because it certainly did not strike me as remotely feminist, or even very empowering to women, in its depiction of the ""sacred feminine,"" an archetype often seen as ensuring male enlightenment, a point both Langdon and Teabing bring up in the novel (Men find heaven through sex! Mary Magadelene moves from prostitute to wife and mother! Very enlightened).<br/><br/>Because I am also a film scholar who has started a research project on the film, I went to the film with some trepidation, hearing that it was faithful to the novel. As I tell my students, such faithfulness rarely makes a good film. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the movie is close to the book, but there are some key changes that made the film better for me than the book (those who love the book certainly would disagree, but I thought the changes made the story better at my first viewing. I still think that after viewing the film three times and reading the book four times).<br/><br/>I won't detail all of the changes from novel to film, but one is the choice to have Langdon be more skeptical of the more far-fetched ""historical"" claims spouted by Teabing (the wonderful, scenery-chewing Ian McKellen). As a college professor, I found Tom Hank's low-key, somewhat befuddled performance appropriate to how an academic might behave in such circumstances (unlike the ""Indiana Jones in tweed"" description of Langdon in the novel). I also felt it was better to make explicit the implied connection of Bezu Fache to Opus Dei.<br/><br/>I also thought Sophie Neveu fared better in the film. I know a lot of people believe the book Sophie was stronger, but I did not (nor did my husband or many others I've talked to). I was not impressed with her character in the novel, nor did I find the character particularly believable. I thought she was far too weak, naive, sheltered, and dependent for a French police cryptologist. Beyond throwing the soap out the window (implied in the film), threatening a painting (filmed but not used), and holding a gun on a taxi driver, she doesn't do much else except to solve three puzzles by herself (the Fibonnaci sequence, the Madonna on the Rocks anagram and the mirror writing; all the rest are solved by the male characters, even the first cryptex, where the men help her get the right answer). She certainly never thinks for herself about the preposterous stuff Langdon and Teabing are feeding her. Perhaps many think she is strong because she comes on strong, like Marion in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" but as the story progresses, she loses power and presence, becoming in many ways a prop dragged about by the male leads. <br/><br/>In contrast, I thought the film Sophie (the luminous Audrey Tautou) was stronger, and more believable, both in her behavior toward Langdon and in the reasons for her conflict with her grandfather. In the film it is revealed that he has forbidden her look up anything on her family (a departure from the book; indeed, in the published screenplay, the grandfather slaps the young Sophie to get her compliance). She is sent away to boarding school, then, on a visit home stumbles upon the hieros-gamos ritual as a much younger girl, so her shock is more credible, at least to me (I found it very unlikely that a grown woman in graduate school would be shocked, shocked! to find her grandfather having sex in the basement. Turned off maybe, but not so much she'd never speak to him again). The film Sophie does almost all the things the book one does (okay, she only solves two puzzles, not three, and the whole taxi scene is not shown). She is far more physical toward Silas, both at Château Villette (where she slams his head on the floor twice, and takes his gun--not in the book), and then in Teabing's plane (where she slaps him twice when interrogating him, also not in the book). It is true she does wind up being dragged around at the end, but that is a problem in the novel as well.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, the desaturated flashbacks also added to the film, as did the choir-like score, enhancing both the mystery and the suspense. The cinematography, while not the best, blends real location footage with sound-stage work and CGI effects to make it appear first as if the characters are really in various spots (e.g. Westminster Abbey, parts of the Louvre and San Sulpice--the mattes are especially effective there) and as if people from the past are surrounding the main characters at points in the film.<br/><br/>Because I love all types of movies, and have seen thousands, I've rated it as 6/10, but I really see it as more 6.5./10. No where near outstanding, but certainly not horrible either, given its genre (I've seen far worse)."

","I read the book and truly enjoyed it. Furthermore I understood it and that includes all the characters, plot twists and so on and so forth. I found it to be better than Brown's ""Angels and Demons"" which. in my opinion, should be read first in order to get a grip on all the Vatican deeds and misdeeds. At any rate, I urge anyone intending to see ""DaVinci"" to FIRST READ THE BOOK because if not, then the film will become ultra ultra confusing, hard to follow and BORING. Come to think of it, even though I read it, it still was confusing, hard to follow and boring.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is definitely miscast. He had a rather astonished look about him throughout the 2:29 minutes. It was if he was trying to tell us,""You know...that DaVinci fellow is like a box of chocolates. You never can tell what you're gonna get."" The hero of it all, Dr.Robert Langdon,is a world famous symbologist and Mr. Hanks came across as a ""simpologist."" Although he's one of Hollywood's great actors, he simply does not convince as the type of egghead Langdon is supposed to be. Audrey Tatou, one of the French ""fuzz"" looks innocent, cute and pixyish enough to be able to walk on water but would have made a better race car driver than a detective but you'll have to see the movie to figure out my symbolic metaphors. On the other hand, Ian McKellen who plays Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on the mysterious society called the Priory of Scion, steals the show. He does a superb job even though it does NOT totally reflect what he's all about in the novel. Close but no cigar. Jean Reno,playing Captain Bezu Fache, a man with a secret and who acts the part of someone in charge of the French version of the Keystone Cops, does an adequate job but I still prefer Mack Sennett's Keystone Cops. Paul Bettany, acting as the murderous Opus Dei monk, Silas,is indeed convincingly frightening even though Opus Dei Headquarters in New York has stated that, in truth, they are as sweet and caring as Mary Poppins. So go figure.<br/><br/>In the book,the ultra famous ""Mona Lisa"" plays an important role for several reasons but is glossed over in the film as a human looking like a male on one side of the face and a female on the other. Yes,that statement does touch on the book's subject but doesn't go anywhere deeply enough into what the painting's all about and what secrets it holds. To me, that was a major disappointment in the film. And of course the main ingredient of the book is the legendary fresco of ""The Last Supper"" which is treated quite well in the film. It should be because it is the central theme of the entire novel.<br/><br/>I read about the anger of the Vatican over the film. Beats me why. The movie stinks compared to the book so it's angry at the wrong venue. I venture to say that the movie makes a mockery out of Brown's novel. So help me,some of the scenes are downright laughable therefore I don't see where the Catholic Church will sustain any type of a hit thanks to Columbia Pictures,Imagine Entertainment and Brian Grazer/John Calley.<br/><br/>How ironic is history? Plenty and I'll explain. Not too long ago, Mel Gibson came out with ""Passion of the Christ"" which stirred up resentment against the Jewish people and of course the State of Israel. Now we have ""The DaVinci Code"" which gives Roman Catholicism a black eye and does nothing at all to enhance Roman Catholicism's offshoot, Protestantism. Can we not say that the combination of Judaism and Christianity represents western civilization, something being challenged and targeted by radical Islam? The answer of course is YES therefore it behooves us all living in the Judeo-Christian world to UNITE against a common enemy. It makes sense to do so but along came Mel Gibson and Dan Brown who, despite their artistry, drive wedges between us. Make us uncomfortable with one another. Makes us question our own beliefs and values. Puts us on the defensive. Introduces uncertainty among us. You know what all this adds up to? WEAKNESS. Just the opposite of the solidarity we need."

","I read the book, and I liked it very much. So I watched the movie, and I just don't get how they could mess it up like this. There were several scenes which only made sense when you read the book, otherwise they just look totally stupid and seem to connect the plot line which would have had a whole if these scenes weren't there (and they boost the feeling of a stupid action-flick).<br/><br/>But worst, probably to strengthen the sympathy for our ""hero"" Langdon, they gave him abilities which -in the book- Sophie had. In the movie, Sophie is reduced to a stupid little girl just asking questions so that someone explains to the viewers what they need to know.<br/><br/>To sum it up, for those which didn't read the book, the movie will be unintelligible and look like a stupid action flick with a treasure hunt, but they won't understand what the treasure is and means. Many scenes and decisions made can't be comprehended and the message of the book (may it be right or wrong) is not to be understood.<br/><br/>For those who read the book however, the movie will be dispensable, because it doesn't reach the depth of the book and is altered in some really annoying ways (i won't mention cause that would spoil the movie). They did anything to make Langdon look perfect, which in the book he was not. This elevates him (mostly at the expense of Sophia) to a Hollywood-Hero.<br/><br/>The story has lost all depth and they made (out of the really extraordinary book) a totally normal, stupid but entertaining treasure-hunt Hollywood action flick without any depth."

","There are some intellectual movies (and books) that are just right for the precocious 12-yr.-old. This is one of them. Lots of stylized intellectual arguments between characters, but also occasional action and humor woven into a strictly formulaic plot. I won't give anything away, but if you are like me and didn't read the book, there is a ""surprise"" twist at the end. I began to guess it, though, and I became convinced after the conflict in the plot ran down but the movie kept going. To keep going after that point, there has to be a really potent plot twist and I guessed it. Telegraph received.<br/><br/>This is a fun, entertaining movie (see four points of Redeeming value below). A lot of stuff is silly. Several facts are just wrong. For example, the Catholic Church no longer holds that Mary Magdelene was a prostitute. It once held that position --held it for almost 1500 years-- but since 1969, Church doctrine has been that she was not a prostitute. So some of things in this movie are, to one degree or another, not to be taken as true. On the other hand, the contention that Emperor Constantine was not a real Christian--that is true. <br/><br/>Some of my favorite scenes in this movie are the burnished tableaux of historical and speculative events such as the death of Constantine and the Council of Nicea (those are historical). The Council is shown with the Bishops of the fourth century Church in a great hall that is lined with Roman soldiers; some bishops in togas and neatly coifed while others are in rude tunics, long hair and beards. They are all shouting and arguing. Yes, that is what it probably looked like.<br/><br/>The characters are either flat or caricatures. The plot is unbelievable in whole if not in a few parts. Liberties are taken with real life organizations. This could have made for fun satire, but ultimately it's a pseudo-intellectual suspense yarn that delivered little intellectual stimulation and little suspense for me. So why see this movie at all (say, when it comes out on DVD)?<br/><br/>1.

In a way I wish I'd never bothered but like the rest of the population I was curious to see how such a terrific story would translate onto the screen. Tom Hanks is always very watchable but he was definitely miscast as Langdon and as for Ms Tatou...her heavily accented voice was a constant irritation and her lines delivered in a monotone fashion.

I'm sure had someone like Spielberg taken on the task of directing this movie it would have been a different story altogether. What a waste of 2 1/2 hours."

The reason why I did not like the movie is because the whole plot of the movie is rushed and there is no thrill or suspense at all, whereas you open the book and read the first 2 pages and you're hooked already..this movie had me closing my eyes after the first scene. I applaud Hollywood for trying, and even though it may be the number one movie in America, only those who have read the book would really understand where i am coming from.

","I liked the movie more than I thought I would. It was fairly entertaining and moved pretty well. The casting was kind of awkward though. I really didn't like Tom Hanks as Langdon. For some reason, he just didn't seem to resemble my vision of what Robert Langdon would be. I liked the guy from the Professional as Fache and I liked the guy who played Teabing. But, Sophie, although very pretty, seemed to struggle a little too much with her English to put on a convincing performance. Maybe that was intentional to be authentic? But, I don't think so. But, to the point, the biggest thing that disappointed me was the movie's depiction of Robert Langdon. I didn't like the fact that he was depicted as a defender of the Christian faith. Now, I'm sure Christians would not see it this way at all... But, he kept referring to all of the theories that Teabing and he would bring up about the Sangreal as ""myths"". I'm not arguing that they are or aren't myths, I'm just saying that this is not how he was depicted in the book. I also realize that changes need to be made from the book to the movie for it to work on screen. But, in my mind, this change was made to pander to the Christian world and paint a more ""open"" picture. The book clearly has Langdon as a ""believer"" in the Sangreal ""myth"". But, the movie pits him in direct contention with Teabing and his thoughts."
"craig-boehman","1","1","4","26 May 2006"," A Malign Mutation Spawned From A Surplus Of Talent
","I loved Dan Brown's book. That being said, this movie should be a let down to anyone who enjoyed reading it.<br/><br/>This was the last possible outcome I expected from a corroboration of distinguished stars-- a tractor/train wreck. Who would have thought that a movie involving Ron Howard as director, Tom Hanks as star, Audrey Tautou (from 'Amelie' & Dirty Pretty Things) as co-star, and Akiva Goldsman as screenwriter, could have created such a 'distortion' of the original Dan Brown text? This very act could be compared with the Catholic Church's shameful distortion of the New Testament! All jabs to the holy rollers aside, this movie failed and was painful to watch.<br/><br/>The question that begs an answer is this: did Ron Howard actually direct any of this horrible acting? Tom Hanks was too nonchalant portraying the role of scholar on the run from a secret society and INTERPOL, not to mention all of France. I was convinced at one point he was a heroin addict who just checked out of a methadone clinic. He was that bad! And poor Audrey. . . I loved this woman in many of her previous roles. None of her talents were brought to the big screen for her American debut. Her charm, beauty, and wit- curiously absent from the film. This in itself is a crime against humanity. And I expected a hell of a lot more from Akiva Goldsman, who brought us the masterpiece, 'A Beautiful Mind'.<br/><br/>What went wrong, Ron? Did the Pope slip you a 'bad movie-making mickey' into your drink? Did Opus Dei members get together one dark evening by the light of the moon and chant Latin curses? Or perhaps. . .<br/><br/>It was just a fluke.<br/><br/>My one positive comment is this: this movie will incite conversation for years to come."

","The book was cool and even made me put it down to go online to find a photo of the Last Supper to check for myself if it could actually be Mary sitting next to Jezus. As a bonus I liked the controversy surrounding the book. Not being the least bit religious I was fascinated to see people around the world fighting a book of fiction to defend their own books of fiction (ie bible). Travelling in France and visiting Cannes just before the premiere of the film, I decided to go see it. And I was not at all impressed and left the cinema with a feeling of being cheated out of what might have been a great film.<br/><br/>What's wrong with the DVC? Too much to mention, but here are my (spoiler) highlights:<br/><br/>1. The book is quite intelligent, fast paced, gets you to look at 'common knowledge' cultural 'facts' with a thrill. The film is never thrilling, not even during action scenes.<br/><br/>2. The premises in the book about equally intelligent etc male and female counterparts, also found in the relationship between Neveu and Langdon is missing. The character development in the book is missing in the film, with the exception of a couple of way too obvious personal trauma's that are used to bring religion back into the context of the film (Langdon's experience in the well as a child).<br/><br/>3. Some things that didn't come across as silly in the book (must have been more elaborately constructed) were plain stupid and inexplicable in the movie: It's ridiculous the way the Professor is suddenly turning against them. You fin yourself asking why he went through the whole theatrics before showing them his malicious intent. So in other words, essential plot structure is missing. This also happens when the beginning hints at Sophie's falling out with her grandfather and later Langdon suddenly says: what happened? I'm being shot at, so I deserve an explanation. In the book that makes sense. At this point in the movie it doesn't. There is no factual evidence presented yet that suggests her falling out with her grandpa has any bearing on the situation.<br/><br/>4. , I didn't like the ending of the book all that much either, but I didn't feel the urge to throw up as I did with the film. <br/><br/>5. The actors: To me Hanks simply is too much of a religious family man kind of actor to pull off the (religiously) critical scientist with an autonomous mind. Tatou is great to watch (her mouth!), but this film didn't give her the opportunity to shine as a performer. And although Jean Reno is one of my favorites ever since Le Grand Bleu, his character was just plain weird here. Unlogical again due to the script.<br/><br/>To summarize: Howard must have thought this film, based on a bestseller, was a guaranteed winner. I'm however left with the distinct feeling that he sacrificed the sharp edges of the book as to not alienate too many viewers. By not adding anything interesting to the script to make it an original and captivating new controversial art product, and also by choosing an actor with the aura of a good Christian family man, Howard took out the exciting atmosphere of the book. Add to that the many abrupt revelations, the absence of thrills on any level, flat characters in general and towards the end a religious revelation to please the religious viewers (nooo, this is really not an anti Christian film people) and you've got a movie that offers extremely little besides disappointment.<br/><br/>PS It seems Howard plus his scriptwriter now plan to turn the Bernini Mystery into a film, apparently hoping to cash in on another Brown-novel. However, that book wasn't half as controversial ór interesting as the Da Vinci Code was, so that doesn't bode well for their next project."

People should relax about that, since even the author of the book stated this was a work of fiction. My main complaint of this movie was that it was just plodding, they should have cut at least 45 minutes of it. Many of the actions scenes were poorly conceived. Tom Hanks also made a weak lead. And I went to see it with three other people, and I kid you not, two of them fell asleep during this film.

A platinum blonde Bettany feigning an Italian whisper was laughable, even Tom the great just writes the performance in. No one took it seriously with the exception of the secondary characters. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: And will someone please tell Ron Howard to stop using Disney effects and learn once and for all that the audience is much more intelligent than he gives them credit for. I don't want to see glow in the dark letters and numbers, and stars twinkling in the sky. I want to see numbers, on paper, or where they sit.

","I did not know what to expect from the movie as I never read the book. I must say the movie disappointed me. It looked to be made very quickly. Sometimes actors, especially Tom Hanks, looked like they just said a line in the script... Did they realize they were not at the lunch break anymore and they should at least look like they thought about what they were saying? The puzzles looked childish. Langdon (Hanks) solved them all within seconds... Wow! What a perfect way to protect Holy Grail! And then there was this ancient secret note written backwards... And in perfect English! All ancient people in France, Italy, Vatican and wherever probably spoke perfect English. I think children at primary school would laugh.<br/><br/>My girlfriend asked me after the film - Did the characters actually change their dresses throughout the movie? - I guess they did not.

","Having read the book i was expecting so much more from the film. The DaVinci Code is set in beautiful locations and Ron Howard holds mostly to the books plot.<br/><br/>At first it is hard to get used to Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon just because having read the book there is such a preconceived notion of the character. Audrey Tatou is a believable Sophie Neveu but in comparison to how she is in the book she's a watered down version. Paul Bettany is perfectly creepy and intense in his portrayal of Silas. Sir Ian McKellen is exactly how I pictured Sir Leigh Teabing, he brings the comedic element to the film which otherwise would make it too heavy going. Jean Reno and Alfred Molina are good in their roles of Captain Fache and Bishop Aringarosa. Apart from Paul Bettany and Sir Ian McKellen the acting seemed rather flat.<br/><br/>I found there to be an over reliance on computer graphics. For example when Langdon is solving the first clue the fact that the letters flashed or when he visualises the tomb of Sir Issac Newton. Wonderful graphics yet slightly unnecessary. The flashback sequences designed to help you understand the history better tended to annoy me more than anything else.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a fast pace but in the middle it just starts to loose momentum. Overall the film is average. I was expecting it to be much better. If you've read the book you may be disappointed with some of the changes that were made. In this case the book was better."

","Over two years ago, I'm at a bar, meeting a few friends. Around the table, conversation is awash with tales of an exciting new book that everyone wants to get their hands on. Upon closer inspection, it is revealed to be Mr. Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, and a rather scuffed looking copy at that seeing as several members of the clique have been going to great pains in circulating it amongst themselves.<br/><br/>After sitting through a lengthy recount of what TDVC is all about, I still didn't really get it, much as I have yet to get the hoopla around that magician-cum-heartthrob, Harry Potter. Then again, I'm not a big fan of religion-inspired high adventure, and think that Indiana Jones and the Holy Grail remains the franchise's weakest outing by far.<br/><br/>But this is a bias, and to those enamored with the book at hand, my sincerest apologies. Although never having read TDVC may put this reviewer at a certain disadvantage, it also allows me to behold its cinematic rendition with more of a clean slate. Building on those pillars, I still don't see the great attraction, as Ron Howard's long-winded motion picture, although far from a catastrophe of biblical proportions, comes across equally removed from big-screen supremacy.<br/><br/>Taking its cue from mysticism and backstage whisperings about the legacy of Christ on this earth, The Da Vinci Code puts itself in a precarious position by establishing most of its premise on assumptions any budding cynic will easily discount. On top of that, the story lacks a fantastical punch to compensate for the above-mentioned shortcoming, unlike previously discussed Indiana Jones and its various counterparts. TDVC's most formidable challenge lies in selling mind-blowing theory in a straight-faced style more suited to a documentary, and unfortunately, it's one hurdle the pseudo-opus fails to surmount.<br/><br/>In fact, at two hours and quite a bit of change, Da Vinci sags noticeably in the frills department, putting viewers to sleep faster than on the edge of their seats. And while the almost complete lack of tacky visual red herrings is commendable, it nonetheless contributes to the general state of languor afflicting this project.<br/><br/>Perhaps, then, its main audience should in fact be those legions of converted fans who've read the book and took to it. They certainly have much to enjoy here, even if they emerge disappointed. At least the comparison between the two formats in itself can be pleasurable for those in the know.<br/><br/>As a standalone film, we have little to recommend here. The story's decent enough, but again, minus suitably mind-blowing slights of hand comes in as a distinct ho-hum letdown. In terms of acting, as well, nary a highlight crops up. Tom Hanks appears as Robert Langdon, a US researcher and novelist specializing in ancient cultures and symbolism. Langdon's international repute marks him as a man wanted by French officials in a Louvre murder investigation. The main cop, done by Jean Reno, presents an ambiguous character with an agenda we're not supposed to glimpse early on, but due to a lackluster performance on the part of Reno, nor do we really care to anyway. Much the same can be said of Hanks, who's usually a solid actor. Here he's flying on instrumentation only, almost entirely devoid of gusto.<br/><br/>Additional also-rans in TDVC include young female lead Audrey Tatuou, who we loved in Amelie and Happenstance, as Langdon's righthand lady and professional object of desire, Sophie. Save for being pretty in a Lolita kind of way, Tautou adds little to the course of this movie. There's also the conspiratorial contingent, led by stalwart Ian McKellen. This guy's getting somewhat long in the tooth, to the point where one can no longer discern between him as eccentric man of the occult Sir Leigh Teabing and as world-dominating mutant Magneto. Identical tantrums in either case.<br/><br/>Probably the only ones really doing their jobs faithfully are Paul Bettany as errand-assassin Silas (beforehand we saw him alongside Russell Crowe in Master and Commander), and former Dr. Octopus of Spiderman 2 infamy, Alfred Molina. He does a church operative coordinating schemes aimed at silencing the greatest secretive conspiracy ever, and together with Bettany gives the movie its only impactful ingredient. At times Silas's violence repulses enough to induce the odd cringe, thankfully.<br/><br/>Without giving away the plot to those few uninitiated still out there, the struggle to trace Jesus Christ's living heritage in the modern world brings into conflict several factions, including science, the law, the clergy and an underground secret society. This arguably sounds like a recipe for explosive antics, but in truth has no such effect. For all the anger and furor over TDVC's alleged blasphemy, it poses in reality little threat to anybody's feelings or belief systems, not simply due to freedom of speech issues, but because it's so flat and uninspired.<br/><br/>The best thing we can say of Da Vinci, as a work of cinema, is that it keeps rolling at a steady clip and steers clear of cheap trickery. It has you sitting there, ever on the verge of dozing off, but not wholly in pain.<br/><br/>Otherwise, there's hardly any facet of it worth getting worked up over. It's not touching, moving or stirring, possesses no groundbreaking film-making techniques, and provides barely detectable quantities of good acting.<br/><br/>Is torment the exact opposite of pleasure? Maybe not. Look at The Da Vinci Code, proof positive there's at the very least 150 minutes of middle ground between the two.<br/><br/>Rating: * * ½"

Simply sub-par in comparison to all it had going for it with the director, actor and interests that was going for it. I believe the first weekend (as it was) would be exceptional.

(sorry, first thing that came to mind) Either way, I wanted this to be a good film yet as much as I hoped, as much leeway I gave it, it was a waste of my time. Ron Howard... no special touch as in his past films. Tom Hanks.. pound for pound one of the top actors out there yet he seemed to contribute not a thing any other actor could have. And again the script... they should have brought someone in far better because he really helped sink this film.<br/><br/>The only real point of interest at all.... Paul Bettany.

I've read the book (lucky of me that I borrowed it from someone) and I hoped Howard was going to make an improvement out of it or even make it somehow more bearable, but nothing!

Boy was that a mistake. Going into the movie with a fresh knowledge of the story only amplified my frustration. Ron Howards interpretation of the book was all wrong. I felt he left out key bits of information. For instance, he could have focused more on the Pagen symbolism, the Prior and umm how about Da Vinci? Also, the infamous Micky Mouse watch makes a brief appearance but no mention is made.<br/><br/>The movie (w/o even reading the book)fell flat. The script was bland at best.

Tom Hanks gives a fine performance and his hair is a non-issue! I have no problem believing him as Robert Langdon, a College professor who fits into the plot. Audrey Tautou is beautiful and, despite her heavy accent, a delight to watch as Sophie. If you chose to believe that the story is 100 % fiction, it is a great story, totally engaging. If you have an open mind, and are willing to entertain the possibilities, you will have a most rewarding experience. Ron Howard shows as once more that he is a master movie maker. Considering the complexity of the plot and the huge amount of information that the writer had to pack into the 2 hours and 20 minutes, writer Akiva Goldman did an incredible job. I feel that reading the book before seeing the movie is an asset to understanding; but not necessarily a pre-requisite. If you get a bit lost, you'll understand better if you read the book afterwords, or, better yet, see the movie again! If you have a closed mind, are a Christian fanatic and must have everything stagnant, do yourself a favor and don't see it. You don't have to you know. Just live and let live!"

It was disappointing to read of efforts to suppress or censor the film and the professional critics had a field day at its opening, panning it as a turkey. I have just returned from the cinema where I saw a very well made film, faithful to the book, and mainly resisting the temptation to over dramatise the action. I realise there are a lot of factual inaccuracies in this piece of fiction, just as there are in the Holy Bible, and some sections of the original book do seem improbable but this should not prevent those who enjoy conspiracy theories having a chance to consider alternatives to the established doctrines while being entertained. <br/><br/>What are the chances of Angels and Demons reaching the screen and how much cooperation will be forthcoming from the Vatican?"

I being quite picky now, but Silas does not shoot about 5 police officers and then Aringarosa.

I almost fell asleep in a few parts. The acting, especially that of Hanks and Tautou - both seem like cardboard cutouts, reading a very lame script. Tautou, especially - uttering the same few french words under her breath at just about every pouting scene she plays. Hanks too. ""Oh my God - a rose"" - when he first sees the cryptex box. Looks like a cheesy Chinese box, with what looks much more like a white petunia than a rose - hardly an 'Oh my God' moment. This sort of thing repeats and repeats and repeats. I've never seen Hanks so dull and lifeless in a film.<br/><br/>I think the problem with making a movie of such a book is that there is so much information (whether fact or fiction) doled out in the book that you can digest at your leisure - perhaps even rereading a section or two to make sure you got it all. But in a movie, that sort of thing comes off as stiff and force-fed - the actors are made to feed out this information in scenes that come off as totally unnatural. It just seems dull and forced.<br/><br/>The whole thing culminates in a cheesy end scene that is just over the top in trying to convey deep 'oh my God' thought and emotion, and to me just seems silly and trying too hard to be dramatic.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie, but I have no intention of buying the DVD and really don't care to see it again.

","Writing a action/adventure book based on a conspiracy theory, in principle, is a bad idea. But when you make a movie based on that very book you get a recipe for disaster. I don't know if you heard about this but there is a conspiracy theory concerning the Beatles; it basically suggests that starting with Seargent Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band - LP, the original Beatles were replaced, and this theory is supported by ""facts"". Now imagine you would make a adventure novel and movie out of this. Imagine having a scene where outside the studio where the historic Let It Be is being recorded, the ""real"" Paul McCartney would try to take out the new Paul McCartney with a sniper rifle. You get the picture here? Now Da Vinci's Code is really an unimaginative book and film. It ""steals"" a very well known conspiracy theory, turns it into a freaking circus, done in bad taste. Clichés and kitsch hit you every 5 minutes. The French look disgustingly boring....

But I will say this: for a movie that is supposed to be bold and a a sort of taboo-breaker, the almost complete silence regarding MASONS and FREEMASONRY is pathetic. I mean, what were the movie-makers afraid of? They can mention that Jesus had a sex-life but let's not talk about Masons cuz I guess it's taboo. Booooooo!.Those Masons are soooo tabooooo !!! Booooo!!!!!!! Jesus!. I mean Jesus, Mary and Tautou !!!! Boooooo!!!!!! P.S.1 point is for the actors, who really kept me awake. Cuz the movie was a sleeper. Zzzzzzz!!!!!!"

","i don't understand why people take this movie seriously. it's fiction novel for God's sake!!! F-I-C-T-I-O-N! it's sad that people don't see the real movie beneath it. while everybody wrote that book was great, all journalists and writers, i can't see why the movie is considered to be awful. and let's face it, those reviews were written by theologists and the Church and they are trying to effect others. they don't understand that this is a movie not something that can destroy Catholic church. if they are such great believers, they shouldn't find this movie as a threat. there are a lot of other movies that are a lot worse than The da Vinci Code and Church don't find them offensive. why? because they are not no.1 at box office, and they didn't draw so much attention as The da Vinci Code did. people should understand that this is a movie, and as i recall it never said ""based on true story"" so what's the fuss all about???"

","""The Da Vinci Code"" was OK. It wasn't a great movie and I don't think the book could be made into a great movie. The book was too much about ideas, word games, anagrams and puzzles that are better read than seen. The movie suffered from too much dialog used to explain the plot. Movies are visual and time taken for long swathes of dialog tends to be boring. In this movie Ron Howard chose to fill the exposition periods with many jump shots and extreme close-ups that I found irritating. In fact the movie is filled with jerky cuts and extreme close-ups. Given the lure of the locales used in the movie I expected to see some nice shots of the Louvre and old cathedrals but what I got was some quick overall establishing shots then it was back to the extreme close-ups and jerky camera. Why make a big deal about where the movie was filmed and then hardly use the setting. Most of the shots in the Louvre could have been done in my family room. Put some old painting on the wall with the actor's head in front of it and presto a museum shot. I disliked the look of the movie. It was very dark and gloomy and the active camera work tended to be irritating. The latest trend in movies is to have a very mobile, jerky camera maybe used to add interest to an otherwise boring scene but for me it detracts from the scene and cheapens the movie. If you need a mobile camera to keep the audience entertained maybe you should rethink the scene. Many, many, many wonderful movie scenes were filmed using a static camera where the actors created the interest not the motion. Tom Hanks was miscast. I like his work but he is best as an everyman caught up in extraordinary circumstances not as a supposed expert who looks mostly befuddled. Audrey Tautou was OK. She is attractive and did a competent job but there was no spark in her performance. Ian McKellen was the best thing in this movie and scenes containing him were highlights. The rest of the cast was competent and forgettable. Given the hype of the book this movie could never live up to the expectations. Unless my watery coke got turned to wine or I was levitated out of my seat the movie would have been a let down. I read the book, ( a good airplane book, not at all great literature), and I wonder if the movie would have been better watched cold. I based my rating on the movie alone since most movies made from books are a disappointment. I would have probably been more entertained if the story line was discovered as the movie unfolded instead of being known and anticipated. It's worth a watch but it is flawed."

","I think Dan Brown is a brilliant writer. I loved the story, and the fact that it is making people think and debate is a major bonus! However, I felt the movie did not capture the intensity or the heart of the book. Making a successful movie out of a book this huge is not an easy task. I feel everyone involved did the best with what they had. But they did not have enough to work with. I believe it might have worked if people could sit through a 6 hour film, but even then I have my doubts that this story could be properly told in movie form. I do need to say, I loved watching all the buildings, the paintings, all the sets. Those things were the highlight of this film for me."
"Chris Knipp","6","1","4","24 May 2006"," Code blue
","'The Da Vinci Code' was a big bestseller, not, generally, a sign of great literary merit. The author Dan Brown's method, as well as one can detect from the Ron Howard movie version, is to bombard you with arcane-sounding information about Christianity, the divinity of Jesus, signs and symbols, the Priory, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, and of course Leonardo Da Vinci, who's woven in as an officer of the Priory and unifies the story, to a degree, because it begins with a murder in the Louvre (wasn't Da Vinci an artist? and doesn't he have a painting or two in the Louvre?) -- and to add absurd and quite unbelievable twists, in the interest of -- what, exactly? Well, keeping the story going, I guess. Some who read the book say it looks very foolish on screen. Yes, it does. One doesn't need to read the book to see that. One wonders if this movie will bury the book or revive it. Certainly with the libel trial in London and the pore-opening publicity about ""anti-Christian"" content, the book has so far done well for the movie's box office.<br/><br/>What's 'The Da Vinci Code' a story about, exactly? It could be regarded as simply a murder mystery, but it's both much more ambitious and much less successful than the usual detective story. Brown's revisionist account of the Council of Nicaea and claim, at least for the purposes of the novel, that Christ's divinity was a matter of general dispute at the time of the Emperor Constantine, and that Jesus started a blood line with Mary Magdalene, that this was covered up, that the Holy Grail is really a feminine symbol -- the blasphemy gets lost in absurdity and the tangled web adds up to very little, but it keeps Ron Howard and hapless viewers busy and befuddled for two and a half hours. All of this is too preposterous and silly to deserve to be considered a threat to anyone's faith, but the fact that Christians have objected to Brown's book and to its being made into a movie has been amply capitalized upon by the Hollywood promoters (See Frank Rich on the op ed page of Sunday's NYTimes -- May 21, 2006).<br/><br/>What happens? A guy gets murdered, pursued by a faceless monk, and flays himself on the floor of the museum. A Harvard professor and expert on symbols named Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who's conveniently in Paris to give a big lecture (conveniently in English) is summoned by a certain French detective (soon replaced by the main detective, Bezu Fache, i.e., the trusty Jean Reno -- looking bloated, and wasted here) to help out with the symbolism of the cuts the murdered gentleman has made in his body -- and the story is on its jagged way. Clever Prof. Langdon may be, but he needs help, and it comes in the form of a French police cryptographer, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou).<br/><br/>Langdon and Neveu proceed to lecture each other through the rest of the movie, augmented by an old friend of Langdon's, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McClellan, who shouldn't be here; but who should?), a sort of expert on the Holy Grail who's supposedly in search of that mythical object. What sinks the movie for any intelligent viewer is that it treats us as idiots. It explains the obvious and claims the most ludicrous absurdities to be true.<br/><br/>Brown's story demonizes the ""prelature"" known as Opus Dei, to a degree toned down, it's said, in the movie -- but Opus Dei in the movie still includes homicidal self-flagellating monks, most notably the albino madman Silas (Paul Bettany), whose use of the cilice, a way of digging nails in one's leg, is gruesomely illustrated in a scene that would appeal to any masochist and shows off Bettany's hunky nakedness. Silas comes in every so often to start up our pulses, which tend to die down with all the tedious explanations that make up the bulk of the movie.<br/><br/>Langdon is a professor of ""symbology,"" which Walter Chaw accurately describes as ""a malapropism invented by idiots so as not to confuse their flock with real words like 'semiotics' or 'epistemology.'"" He's a debased -- horribly debased -- version of Joseph Campbell -- as if Campbell's unifying humanism were reducible to riddles and word games. The movie does a bit better with its monsters -- Silas, and a couple of initially kindly-seeming figures. But the screen-time belongs to the boring explainers, and Hanks and Tautou make the least sexy couple imaginable.<br/><br/>Reno's casting as a daring detective in a mystery involving murderous monks makes a kind of mindless casting sense, since he played the same thing -- in the person of the intrepid Commissioner Niemans in Matthieu Kassovitz's rousing horror-actioner 'Crimson Rivers.' The sequel, ably directed for visuals by Olivier Dahan but less well for character, also stars Reno as Niemans and is full of FACELESS, HOMICIDAL MONKS. Either of the 'Crimson Rivers' films provides five times the satisfaction of the talky, absurd 'Da Vinci Code.'"

","I think with this film they were trying to translate from page to screen as accurately as possible. However this approach not only bores those who've already read it, but those who knew nothing about it. Small changes are made just because it cuts a few corners and because the book was actually a sequel so Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) isn't greatly developed.<br/><br/>In theory the cast is really great but the character work is so paper thin(pun intended) they all look rather rather bored, Hanks especially who is bland and uninvolved. Jean Reno comes out OK as bullish detective Bezu Fache and Sir Ian Mckellan does well with what he has.<br/><br/>On a technical level and I don't know if it's just me but the focus pulling seemed really bad and the one action scene was totally botched through bad editing. Suspense was lacking, the pace the slow, despite the book being frantic until the last third and comically Tom Hanks seemed to have magic vision that allowed him to solve everything.<br/><br/>Silas the albino monk (Paul Bettany) was daft and useless, as he was in the book. If he'd have given the flagellation a rest until after work he'd have stood a much better chance. But that's just me I guess.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed in the mystery element to the film, there are so many puzzles, they're solved too quickly and it detaches the audience, plus the exposition is so arduous that it becomes dull and you wish Ron Howard would've had the balls to deviate from the book and rework it so that characters were developed better and suspense can be built. I think they should have been brave and created new scenes separate from the book and taken risks, but then it is Ron Howard, so middle of the road he should get his license revoked for bad driving.<br/><br/>To sum up, this film is not worth seeing if you've read the book, because you'll gain nothing, but you might want to give it a try if you know little about it. 4/10"

","This is not a great movie and it's not going to win Tom Hanks another Oscar nomination, but I quite enjoyed it. There! I've said it! I enjoyed it. I do appreciate that it's really rather naff to admit to liking this movie, but truly, it's not as bad as the critics made out. I've passed worse time in a cinema on a Friday night after a long tedious week at work. Had I seen it at a time when my brain was functional, possibly I would be less kind.<br/><br/>I won't go through the plot again, so if you are one of the ten people on the face of the planet who don't know what it's about, read another review. The story premise is interesting, and ties together some history, lots of myths and many half truths in a way that suggests it could be plausible...maybe. It seems to get people riled up for some reason I can't quite fathom, but then I'm not a practising anything, let alone Christian.<br/><br/>I read the book, which I thought was just appallingly written (yet somehow I couldn't put it down...) and I thought the movie stuck to it pretty closely. Probably too closely, as some acknowledgement that the screen and the page are different mediums might have helped the rather leaden dialogue. But the action trots along briskly, the editing is good, and the French actors all did their stuff in a suitably Gallic manner. I rather enjoyed Jean Reno's impersonation of a bloodhound, and Marie Francoise Audollent stood out in a small part. There were some pretty pictures of the Louvre's glass pyramid, and it made me nostalgic to see Lincoln Cathedral (a few miles from where I used to live in England) standing in for Westminster Abbey. Apparently the Abbey wouldn't let them film inside, but Lincoln Cathedral will do anything for money and the Chapter House, as shown here, is certainly worth a visit.<br/><br/>As for any controversy - it seemed to me they bent over backwards to be non-controversial, with Hanks character Langdon, and McKellen's character Teabing giving lengthy expositions of balancing opposing views to the point of tedium. In fact, the movie would have been improved by more controversy, not less. Sir Ian was wonderful, worth the admission price alone. Without him, the movie would be very dull and I get the feeling he's had rather a lot of fun with it. But far and away the best reason to see The Da Vinci Code - as opposed to reading it - is because you will be spared Dan Brown's terminally banal prose.<br/><br/>Not too bad a movie. But I doubt I'd ever watch it again."

I think those who dislike the movie have no attention span for detailed and intelligent dialog or are perhaps just put off by the controversial content. Some have criticized the apparent lack of chemistry between the two main characters but this is not supposed to be a story about a flourishing romance between the two of them anyway. I felt they had enough of the chemistry needed for two people acting in a dire life and death situation that demands they move quickly and search to find the answers required to solve the mystery.

I was the day of the opening and the truth is that it disappointed to me enough, nor point of comparison with the interesting thing that was the book to me. It is truth that is very difficult to transfer all a novel in 2 hours of film but it disappointed much to me because the interest does not wake up for anything and have changed some things that Dan Brown in the book does not explain. In the novel Sophie it knows his brother who was been taking care of his grandmother, for example; Robert Langdon far from it discovers the messages so easily, and thus many things.

You don't just go for it. Take at least the time to study the painting and then come to it. Didn't you see their faces as the key dropped to the ground? They looked so dumb as to 'what is this?' There was no reaction what-so-ever. They looked at the key disinterested.<br/><br/>Most of the time, Langdon looked LOST.

I am shock it did as well at the box office as it did the opening weekend. I can only think word of mouth had not spread fast enough.

"dreamdemon-1","10","1","4","23 May 2006"," Quite good, somewhat disappointing
","Being quite intrigued by colliding reviews I got about the Da Vinci code, I went to see it last night. It was a full house at the cinema but I got the better of it taking a seat on the floor on the walkway between the main seat rows.<br/><br/>I followed the movie's action thoroughly and I must say I was rather disappointed. It's true that this movie isn't supposed to be a work of art and its main goal isn't character development. But that's the thing: it reaches for that direction. Why do we get flashbacks of Silas? Why do we get those images of him flagellating himself? It doesn't help the story at all, wastes some good time that might've been put to better use in the story. Those flashbacks don't reveal anything useful. Sure, we get to know how Silas got to be with the archbishop, but that's not interesting at all, nor important. When it comes to the main characters, the situation is slightly better, since our finding from flashbacks do contribute to the story ... but ... What makes the movie really dull is the director's never to try and explain everything the characters do. Why on Earth does he spend a minute to show us how they got out of the plane and into the car? No matter how half-witted the audience might be, they could figure that out by themselves, there's plenty of time with the plane turning and all. Why on Earth are we shown Teabing killing his butler? Again, anyone could've figure it out, but showing this makes the pathetic attempt at suspense (with the butler bragging around) useless and another waste of time. The movie is plot driven, not character driven and that's understandable so if you like character development and all, you're better off without spending your money here. Speaking of the plot, it's pretty solid (given the book anyway). Still since the movie misses on a lot of book material, it gave me the feeling that Langdon himself is not so bright (a protector of Christianty's roots raises a girl and tries to train her mind and he doesn't see the light at the end of the tunnel). The movie gives a half excuse as it conveys the feeling he doesn't have the time to look at his partner's past. That's a half excuse because they do spend some time talking but he never asks the right questions. The cast's weakest point is Tom Hanks. He acts completely without involvement and is hardly believable as Rober Langdon. Hell, Nick Cage was much better at this in 'National Treasure', no matter how ridiculous he looked there. Unfortunately this casts a shadow on his closet peer, Audrey Tatou who does a slightly better job. Alfred Molina is OK, he doesn't have too much space to do his thing but spends his time acting. Paul Bettany looks OK, he has no room to really act but does his moves with some style. Jean Reno is OK too, not great though but provides the movie with some much needed humour from time to time. Ian McKellen however couldn't do a bad job if he tried. He actually saves the movie's cast and his character seems the most plausible and 'in-character'. Overall not bad, I liked the scene where Teabing and Langdon argue over the 'last supper'. It's not too much of a foot up Church a*se but it takes a lot of spirit and attention to identify some interesting and valid points of view and questions to be asked."

","The book takes nearly 600 pages. The film lasts about 130 minutes plus who-knows-how-long in credits. So that there was plenty of time for the book to advance its theories and show how the codes were broken. But there just wasn't enough time for that in the film. So we were left with long periods of talk and inaction, then a few minutes of fairly over-the-top action to make up for it. Hence I felt that the film dragged. What did come over very strongly is the frightening belief that if a ""believer"" has different views from another ""be-liever"" but one with a different faith, then the second person is wrong  God hates him, and he deserves to be: framed for murder; killed, tortured  who cares? And if you truly believe in a certain God, then it's great to murder provided you also flagellate yourself and wear torture implements. But if you treat this film purely as fiction (which is quite likely what Dan Brown intended in the first place), then it lacks pace and surprise. By the way if Leigh Teabing really was the master criminal (or teacher) he had several opportunities to do what he did earlier on. The so-called climax and surprise identity of the teacher, was just wrong. In book as well as film. This film is advertised as 150 minutes. The credits started rolling at 130 minutes. I didn't time them, since I really have no interest in who supplied the donuts or did the washing up.

","I have to agree with others on the casting aspects. Hanks not a good choice for Langdon. Tautou took some getting used to but in the end I liked her, it was if she grew throughout the film. Reno was excellent as Fache, Jurgen Prochnow as Andre Vernet? Oh dear. Molina makes a good Aringrosa. Silas was about right. But to cap it all, Sir Ian as Leight Teabing, perfect. Made for it and acts Monsieur Hanks off the screen. I knew it was going to be difficult to see a film of a book I knew inside out. What makes it worse is that even if I say so myself, I am somewhat of a well read person on the mysteries which the book itself is based on, so I suspect I was hoping for a lot from the film. The adaptation from the book was clumsily done, bits from the book which should never have been lost were and some stupid bits were added. For instance a scene on the top deck of a bus where instead of using a database at a library, Langdon uses WAP on some poor kids phone was laughable, especially as he was chatted up by Sophie. Then the absolute travesty that was the change of story lines. Neveux has messiah-like powers. Also Langdon has developed a gift for making words and figures dance in front of him like apparitions. All rather badly done. The final insult was what appeared to have been a hasty change of story. When Langdon and Neveux get to Rosslyn, the young lad who should be her brother suddenly has no part in the story. The the mysterious Priory members tun up, looking like they had been dragged off the street. The screenplay writer should be ashamed, and it would appear that they had no love for the story or else they would have done a much better job. I'm surprised if Dan Brown likes what has been done to it. Should a film of Angels and Demons ever be made, please keep Tom Hanks and Ron Howard should be kept well away. Onle last thing, the dialogue, oh please, ""Godspeed"" from Robert Langdon at the end. I cringed. Who on earth was responsible for that. The 7 out of 10 I gave this film were for my passion on this subject and for the performances of Sir Ian and Reno. The plot changes and terrible dialogue are almost unforgivable."

","I watched this movie last night, and felt like leaving after the first twenty minutes. If you enjoyed the movie then I advise you not to read on because I will be trashing this movie starting now.... First of all, the acting was horrible. Tom Hanks and Jean Reno gave some of their worst performances i years. Audrey Tatou was weak, cast well yet she couldn't perform. Paul Bettany and Ian McKellan were fine and saved the film for me. Next, the idea of having one cryptex was confusing enough for viewers who haven't read the book. The ""apple"" clue isn't supported with enough background info. and seems meaningless. Also, the fact that in the end, them finding all the documents was cheesy and not truthful. Like a ""private"" sign would stop anyone. The list goes on about how they inaccurately portrayed the book and quite frankly, I was disappointed at Ron Howards attempt at this series."

The book was cut up so bad, things were added things were deleted, the ending was nothing like the book. I wonder if the actors, director, and anyone else working on this movie ever read the book. I would read the book over and over again, the movie on the other hand was a waste of $7.50. All the critics were 100% on the money about this movie it was just plain crap. The acting was so flat, no emotion. If I was the author of this book I would sue Ron Howard for taking my book and destroying all the hard work that went into it.

In the book Langdon is much more suave and clever even if he is a professor at Harvard. This movie did not live up to the hype. While a quality film overall and one that I did enjoy, it was not so good that I had much good to say afterward.

","***potential spoilers*** Ron was presented with a 9 course meal when he wasn't hungry and 7 months later we got the DA Vince code.<br/><br/>Before the camera: Given the chance to emulate Lucas in creating his own Indy, RonH fell face flat at the outset by trying to ""langdonize"" hanks. Hanks is no Robert, so lets leave all the Indy parallels to rest @ the outset. Hanks was no scene stealer either and was found wanting and misplaced in most of the scenes.<br/><br/>Case in point: Indiana Jones and the last crusade has a scene in the end where Indy has to choose the ""true grail"" to save his fathers life. RobL is in a eerily similar predicament when Sophie has a gun to her head and hanks has to think on his head to get out of the situation. Compare the scenes, its an open and shut case.<br/><br/>The other main protagonist, Sophie nouveau. We have a lady who in 12 hours(time duration of the plot), learns of her grandfathers death, hasn't talked to him in ages, faces the prospect of getting killed, finds herself having to place her trust, life and grandfathers legacy on a man she barely knows and if the requirements weren't enough, she faced the prospect of being the sole surviver of the man up there. This is a role many ""actors"" spend a life time searching and Audrey just wasn't equipped to handle it.<br/><br/>The Silas I had in mind when reading the book was an innocent yet tough character. He had unquestionable faith(in Christ, aringarosa and the teacher), he wasn't supposed to react. But Ron's Silas is projected as a man with an agenda. He came across as a doped guy from a crazy cult and the way he ""enjoyed"" the killing Jacques and the old lady took him further from my Silas<br/><br/>I wont even bother covering Collete, fache and aringarosa. the guys I saw in the movie weren't in the book I read.<br/><br/>the silver lining, and this silver had high luminosity mind you, was without doubt IanMc. He had the right amount of senility, humor, awe, excitement, vulnerability, tact and the lack of it for an aging grail historian with no other aim in life but to uncover the location.<br/><br/>Behind the camera: RonH had a tough act to follow. On the one hand he could have made a docu drama like the ninth gate, on the other he could have made a racy action thriller, a national treasure or a mummy. Turns out he made a very bad decision. The book came with a lot of baggage, not counting the 2000 year old history of the grail, each of the protagonists and antagonists had their own story to tell and the editing needed to be top notch to drive home the point. I will reserve judgment on who takes the most blame for the failure, the screen play or the editing dept, after watching the deleted scenes in the DVD.<br/><br/>There was a lot of french commentary and the subtitles just seemed increase the agitation of the viewers who were already in the middle of a patience test. The team decided to deviate from the book quite a bit and the changes didn't add to the viewing experience IMO. The sensational grail revelation at the château, could have heightened the tension quite a bit but I guess Ron took the safe way out and the viewer was left with a 5 minute grail history 101 lesson.<br/><br/>In the theater My group had both Christians and ""pagans"" The Christians had the advantage of at least hearing about the gnostic gospels and decided the film was a tame affair low on thrills. The pagans were lost with the proceeding on the screen and had bucket loads of questions<br/><br/>The film fails on all fronts and all were are left with is a 150 minute ""im sorry i suck at this"" message from Ron"

","I was really, truly, honestly looking forward to seeing this movie, however I was blinded-sided when I realized that the scriptwriter didn't even read the book and decided to write a movie based on what he/she thought the book was about . . . the movie was hardly anything like the book and ending was royally messed up and incorrect. I was absolutely dissatisfied! HORRIBLE. The premise of the book was to state that there were TWO living survivors and the movie destroys this premise. The jokes, which were funny in the book, seemed long and drawn out in the movie. The movie gives away the identity of the 'teacher' before the book does and ruins the movie entirely, seeing as you don't know WHY this person went to the extremes because there is NO detail or Character depth. What a horrible, horrible movie! For a better time, read the book!"

","Like many people I wanted to see the film after reading the book. I actually remember saying to my partner, who had also just read it. ""What a great film this will make"" We even spent time guessing the cast! (We need to get out more). Overall I was disappointed. I could see what the director was trying to do. It was very transparent the he was doing his best to stay true to the book, and with over 20 million copies sold or what ever it was, you can understand why. I think the film lacked the pace the book itself had. There were some real James Bond moments and these were left wanting. Where was the high- tech barn? or the homing device in the armoured truck? The narrative within the book described it in such encapsulating detail, the reader was gripped. Not so with the film. A few great camera shots. But it needed Spielberg behind it to give the spit and polish it deserved."

Believe you me, where's there's smoke there's fire. The world wide critics aren't to far from the mark. I mean did they screen this thing ? Anyone who knows film in the least, would have told the filmmakers ( hey guys your film dosen't work ). Maybe some re editing would have done it some good . I doubt it. And to think, the subject matter is a filmmakers dream... What the hell happen ?????<br/><br/>Dan Brown must have watched this thing, and hoped another Director would have made this film.

"Funny_Girlz","7","1","4","22 May 2006"," Overall a good enough job...
","First of all, I totally hate it when people criticise this film on the basis of its storyline....That is THE BOOK!!! So, I am not gonna give my opinion on the BOOK here....just the film. Of course though, I would like to compare with the book at times, but that's different. Let's see: First of all, the main good thing: Excellent acting by Sir Ian McKellan and Paul Bettany. Well done, gents.<br/><br/>Then the main bad thing: The acting by Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautoo. I love Tom Hanks, but whether it was due to bad direction, bad screenplay or poorly written script, his portrayal of Robert Langdon was far from perfect. His lines were poor AND poorly executed. The film had so much scope for facial expressions of surprise, etc and even some funny moments. But it had none of that. Leigh Teabing's ""The more penises you have the higher you rank. Boys will be boys."" was about THE only comedy element in the film, whereas in the book (and hereby start my comparisons), there were more comedy moments. And I had imagined Langdon and Sophie's characters to have more to do in that sense and more (which would have made the film more entertaining) than just look like puppets / robots. Their characters were very lacklustre. They lacked emotions. They lacked depth.<br/><br/>Fair enough, Ron Howard only had about 2 and a half hours to portray the characters AND tell us a complicated story. But even then, I had imagined better in my head when I had seen the film Which brings us onto the debatable bits (the dark side)...<br/><br/>Was it just me or did the film seem to assume you had read the book? I know millions of people have indeed done so, but that is no reason to assume. Some parts of the film are not well explained at all. I mean, what on Earth is one meant to understand from Silas's flashback of his life?? That would make no sense at all for someone who had not read the book.<br/><br/>Talking about flashbacks, I had gone to see the film knowing that there were flashbacks even to the days of Mary Magdalene and had initially thought it a bad idea, but it kind of worked well enough.<br/><br/>Now the main debate: How true to the book, and, really, does it matter? A lot of the minor changes helped rather than hindered the story telling overall. Most of them made me start to cringe and then wave them off as acceptable. So that's good so far...<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD.<br/><br/>The order in which things are revealed to Sophie in the film is all over the place. And that kinda annoyed me. But it always worked out in the end, so that was okay as well.<br/><br/>The fact that Langdon is made to sound anti-grail-theory (I know, not exactly, but kind of) left me with mixed feelings. On the one hand, it made no sense. Why does he take Sophie to Teabing if he does not believe in the grail?? But then at least that showed both sides of the story for a more balanced view on things in the film that it is in the book. And quite frankly, at the rate some people out there are ready to accept every word written in the book, that seems like not such a bad thing. ((And to those same people: what's with the refusal to believe blindly in the church if you then go out and believe Brown blindly??!! But I wasn't gonna comment on the book, so stop there.I did totally enjoy the book myself)) Then they chopped out a whole bit - in the film, there is no cryptex within cryptex. We go straight to the 2nd one. I agree it was probably needed to shorten the film, but also does not help explain how Teabing realised that he was gonna need help solving the riddles, so attacked Silas and kept Langdon and Sophie with him longer...<br/><br/>And then the last bit: I totally do not understand why it had to be changed. But in a way the alternate ending was not so bad. And not so different really. So I do not mind.<br/><br/>OVERALL, pros and cons (no puns intended). One can't complain about the far-fetched storyline, nor the double endings, as that is how the book goes. Not the best film of the year, but it was okay. Watchable, though not as enjoyable as the book. Could be better, but not bad...."
"SRance","6","1","4","22 May 2006"," Dodgy Da Vinci???
","In a packed cinema (it is opening weekend)I waited in anticipation of THE summer blockbuster. Having witnessed several adaptions before after reading the book (Potters all, American Psycho, blah blah) I wondered what the afternoon would hold in store. Especially as I found the book extremely entertaining and a definite page-turner.<br/><br/>The store (unfortunately)was replete with a large helping of average. The practically catatonic audience were only stirred to the occasional titter raised by Sir Ian McKellan, who clearly decided that he was going to get in a bit of early practise for panto season. The normally elegant and alluring Audrey Tatou looked decidedly uncomfortable most of the way through, and Tom Hanks bore a puzzled look all the way through the film, even when he wasn't deciphering a puzzle. He just does not fit at all. Perhaps he was working out whether he's going to pick up an Oscar nomination or maybe he'd left the stove on? Only Jean Reno, Alfred Molina & the superb Paul Bettany as Silas (Yes, I know Opus Dei don't have monks) looked as if they were giving it their full attention.<br/><br/>The film is decidedly flabby somewhere and in definite need of a visit to the gym. Which aspect (be it director, screenplay, editor, leading man etc.) I shall leave up to you. If the execs decide they want another Brown conversion, perhaps the slightly better 'Angels & Demons), then they need to look seriously at some personnel changes, if they want it to do justice to the page turners that Brown produces.<br/><br/>I'm sure it will make the money; it's just a shame that in so many aspects it falls flat."

","Standing in line for any of the Star Wars prequels, a car driving by might yell; ""Get a life!"", as I jokingly yelled out of the car at the sting of protesters in front of where we tried to see The DaVinci Code. See, in line for Star Wars, we were gathered in common appreciation, not common disdain or ignorance. There have been many movies I find offensive, but no group ever is boycotting them, or causing some controversy... everything offends someone, and I was offended by The DaVinci Code myself, for being BORING. We got to the box office, and it was sold out, every screen that it was on in our suburban mega-super-whatever plex, plus the IMAX attached and lost in some small corner of this small city of a theater. Just as we were leaving the parking lot to find a different theater, the protesters were leaving... I said to one; ""Don't leave now, it's sold out..."" ""That's why we're leaving."" The other theater had no protesters, and no crowd... The friend I went with is from a devout Catholic family and his mother loved the book. He saw nothing to be spiritually offended by probably because it was a movie the waste is that people allowed themselves to get upset by such a bad movie. I haven't read the book, for all I know the filmmakers may have thought the story was a pile of crud. Take all the Jesus you want, and religion out of the movie, and it's still a pile of crud Why? Two hours of ruminative reaction shots, about some secrets that everyone nods because every character knew it already and it was all kicked off by a murder where you'd think there might have been a security camera. Probably wouldn't have thought of that, if it hadn't been so long."

Russell Crowe would have been perfect: professorial, handsome in a rugged way, and very charismatic. Tatou, ditto. No spark. These two alone would sink this movie. And Bettany was no albino. His skin was too dark and he didn't look sinister enough.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER AFFECTS Didn's play true to the book. For one thing, Sophie WAS Sauniere's granddaughter and her brother survived.

","Overall, The Da Vinci Code was a good theater experience. However, when compared to the book, it was seemingly dumbed down for general viewing and pointless changes were made to the plot. In general, the plot line remained similar but emphasis was taken away from the character's challenges and placed more on character interactions, some of which it was difficult to follow or to place exactly why they were happening. <br/><br/>If you haven't read the book, save the $10.00 from the movie ticket and buy the paperback for $7.99, you'll enjoy the book far more than the movie and hopefully appreciate the character's challenges and obstacles far more than watching the movie.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, it was a decent movie but definitely not worth the cost of a theater ticket when compared to the book itself.

"echobase","Null","1","4","22 May 2006"," A rather dull adaptation shows the flaws of an overrated book
","Sorry to tell you but I found it all rather disappointing... First of all, the translation onto the big screen showed the flaws of the book which, however ""grabby"" it was, let's face it, it wasn't the big masterpiece most people believe it to be... It's an incredibly static movie: there' s so much exposition that it hurts!!! On a book you might get away with long scene of dialogue that go on for chapters and chapters (after all that was the strength of Brown's book: all those conspiracy theories) , but on a film, it all looks and feels rather dull! The few ""action"" scenes are so badly handled that it's almost incredible they got away with making them and have them financed by producers (The producer is the same guy who produces ""24"" a TV show that keeps you on the edge of your seat from week after week, with a twentieth of the budget DVC had)... I mean, let's take the car chase for example... It was all done in close-ups and cut so fast to try to deceive the audience that it was bigger and better that it actually was.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks looks almost embarrassed to be in the film bringing NO depth to his character at all... I could hardly care less about him... and (sadly) our lovely ""Amelie"" is ...erm... well lovely, but she should definitely stick to French films, where she is way better! The Character of Silas is very well portrait and Ian McKellen does a pretty good job too with a part that is so full of dialogue for the sake of exposition that it's unbelievable!<br/><br/>The direction itself by Ron Howard is pretty standard I have to say. He brings absolutely nothing new to the picture... The film is an exact transposition from the written page to the celluloid... but since we are talking about a book that's hardly ""Shakespear"", the end result feel all rather conventional. Ron Howard shoots everything in a pretty standard way. I have been to half of those places where the film takes place, and all of them(Louvre aside) looked much better in reality, something quite rare in an age of movies looking astonishingly perfect.<br/><br/>Some of the strength of the book was its construction: the way it left you hanging form one chapter to the other... Unfortunately the film follows he same tricks, and it failed! What works on the written page doesn't necessarily works on film. I'll give you an example: in the book Tom Hank's character arrives at the Louvre and is amazed by the sight of ""something..."" End of a chapter... Next chapter is about something else... and it'll pick up in the Louvre in a couple of chapters... That works in a book obviously. You just want to turn the next page and see what's going on. you don't want to go to bed, you just want to carry on reading...<br/><br/>The film does the same thing, it leaves the audience hanging for a moment... the same way TV series do... like a cliffhanger, but unfortunately it spoils the mood of that moment and ruins it all... It's against everything that movies (especially blockbusters.. which this clearly is!) are supposed to be. Movies are about creating the right mood, making people scared, making them laugh... creating tension... and so on. They are a different medium from books, and they should work in different way. Theer's no need to break the low of certain scenes, just because the book does so. In a cinema, you're sitting down anyway, and you're inside a dark room.. You just want to enjoy the moment, you don't want to be teased by a scene and than pick it up later when you're attention has already gone somewhere else and your nerves relaxed<br/><br/>In other words, it was all too literal, and to sterile if you ask me. And also... VERY LOOOOOOONG!!! The last half hour really lacks fuel... And that scene towards the ending... ""I'm your grandmother"" Oh My God!!! It was so dodgy. Just like a bad soap opera where relatives show up from nowhere... Another example of how something might seem right on the written page.. but when it's materialised on film it looks very cheesy and rather unbelievable!<br/><br/>Maybe it was because I had read the book, but it all felt very slow to me. But I suppose people who are new to the book might enjoy it more... Let's face it, it's just a ""one-single good idea"" (the whole Madgadalene thing) stretched for 2 and a half hour of ""clucky"" dialogue, 2-dimentional characters, rather standard recreations, and cheap twists!"

All of the actors and actresses did an amazing job on this movie and I couldn't believe how well they depicted the book.

","I was born and raised as a Roman Catholic, but after reading The DaVinci Code prior to viewing the film, I feel there is a connection between scientific proof and Christianity. The DaVinci Code does NOT insist on Catholics changing their belief in Jesus, but rather attempts to bring people to be more open-minded enough to weigh the option that there may be a great possibility that Jesus was human. Why not? Jesus was a man, he was human, and therefor it can be presumed that Jesus felt the emotions and urges that all other human males feel. I believe Jesus was a great man who had the power to see things that average people could not see, or rather, comprehend. But the movie was wonderful at bringing to light other possibilities as just that: possibilities. It does not claim that the theories are reality, but instead attempts to open the minds of the closed-minded and embrace the possibility that there are just those: possibilities. Overall, go see the movie....with an open mind!"

Novel has space where locations, thoughts, ideas can be described virtually without any limitation on the number of pages but my friends, this is not the case with the movie. A movie has only limited time and to present the novel in that time is no easy task. With that I would say that Ron has done indeed a great job. I would agree that the choice of the cast might not be the best but he did a great job of making an honest movie that does complete justice to the novel. I would rephrase that Don't try to compare it with the novel but I think Ron presented the big picture and key aspects very well. Locations were amazing. This is not Tom Hanks' best performance neither it is for Audrey but they are not bad. I think the movie has bad rating because of (i) biased audience, (ii) people comparing it with the novel, (iii) people who have not read the novel and could not understand what was happening owing to the fast pace.

I was leaning forward in my seat anticipating the scenes I knew were coming, and enjoying the excellence of the directing and shooting when they happened. most of the scenes took place exactly as I had imagined them in my head.<br/><br/>As far as the content is concerned, I being a Christan, was not offended in any way. In fact the information in the book and movie actually has motivated me to do some studying of my own on the subject. The story is FICTIONAL and not reality. So I guess if a movie can upset you and challenge your faith, it probably wasn't all that strong in the first place.<br/><br/>I give this movie two thumbs up. The storyline from the movie holds up on it's own. You don't have to read the book in order to get it all, but once you see the movie you will almost definitely want to read it anyway."
"zken","8","1","4","21 May 2006"," This film allows for excellent conversation-and everyone is talking
","As the Hollywood hit machine is in a definite lull, there is nothing finer than a film that stimulates great discussions. The Da Vinci code certainly achieves that and more. Combine this fact with the divine Tatou (what other actress can make the ending seem even remotely plausible?)and no one should miss this experience. Now I am one who really resents the ""I read the book first"" crowd who will always dismiss a film like this. Nothing is more irritating than this silliness. ""Da Vinci Code"", which I haven't read yet, and may not get to is no work of great literature. It may even be a well written work of mass culture, but in any case, movies and books are two totally separate art forms. This film works because it keeps you thinking and guessing right to the end, and that is quite an achievement in an era where utter stupidity is worshipped and praised. Secondly, opening the can of worms which is the history of the Catholic church is a delicious morsel for all of us who have been starved for such fair since ""The Mission."" Frankly, I am rather stunned that the outrage isn't a roar because no movie in years has portrayed these men of the cloth with such a black and historically pointed brush. If you have even a remote interest in such things (history that is), and you can sink yourself into the delicious melange of Paris and London that this movie produces, and you haven't spoiled your imagination with actually reading the thing, you will have a fine time. The best part is outside the theater, because this is a movie that is just as much fun to talk about as to watch. And conversations are to be cherished. Take a stroll and bring it up. You won't be sorry."

","The Da Vinci Code stands as a prime example of critics being out of touch with their audience. Despite negative critic reviews, The Da Vinci Code has launched with a well deserved strong box office result worldwide. <br/><br/>While some debatable casting errors and a long running time can be an annoyance, the film remains very well adapted from the book. Hanks, McKellen and Bettany deliver quality performances that enrich the film with both comedy and suspense.<br/><br/>Ignore the protests and the hype, see it yourself and make your own call."

","yuck. and yawn. I almost fell asleep numerous times during this boring thriller! Very Hollywood, so it will appease those types. The characters are flat, and boring...but it's not the actor's faults because the book doesn't give them much to work with in the beginning. I thought the casting worked pretty well with a few exceptions, however it just wasn't enough to save this thing. I'm not going to say it was completely awful as some of the scenery was nice and the acting good. I found myself laughing at moments that were supposed to be serious, like when Langdon was figuring out things so quickly. I'm sorry but in real life, this just wouldn't happen. I don't care how smart you are, it would be almost impossible to do the things in this book. Again, not the actor's faults. More because the book wasn't very good. My advice is to save your money."

Unlike many books turned movies, the Da Vinci Code skips basically nothing. It was just as entertaining and mysterious as the book itself and it left me wanting more. The acting is excellent, everything is put together very well. The Da Vinci Code is absolutely worth seeing."
"itsfuntostay","5","1","4","21 May 2006"," Looking forward to the remake!
","Although this movie got its quality moments, it totally lacks the punch that the book gave us. It's far from as fast-paced as the book and it ends up in a rather slow moving chatterbox thriller. Some of the plot has been watered down and what's left is played out by uninspired actors. Tom Hanks has been one of my absolute favorite actors, but in The Da Vinci Code he hugely disappoints. He's in some kind of auto gear in this movie. He doesn't give all and there's few and far between the the typical ""Hanks moments"" in this movie. But I won't blame him for the embarrassing role, as little in this movie's chemistry seems to be right. However, kudos to Ian McKellen for his role as the eccentric Leigh Teabing. McKellen plays his role so well, he doesn't seem to be even remotely affected by the, at times, poor scripting. Appropos the script. I won't give away any details, but there's some plain awkward moments in this film. Like a scene (that's - thank God - not in the book) on a London bus featuring a random guy on the bus and his mobile phone helping Robert and Sophie finding the ""knight a pope interred"". And let me put it this way; the movie's ending is ruined.<br/><br/>This movie is hardly Oscar-material and I highly doubt I would recommend it to anyone. Instead, I'm hoping for a remake in 20-30 years time because the book really deserves a better movie than this!"
"chiarastorm","6","1","4","21 May 2006"," Not bad - but not outstanding
","After hearing some bad reviews, I was sceptical about this movie. However, I was surprised - but only because my expectations were low.<br/><br/>First of all, I really was not particularly impressed with the book. All comments about the plot aside, I simply found that Dan Brown wrote like an accountant - it opened well, but degenerated quickly into very bland prose. The direction took a similar turn. It opened rather well, but I found that towards the end, I felt entirely bored with it. I expected something with a greater climax - it didn't seem to go anywhere. Visually it is very stunning - but whilst the direction is competent, it is quite bland. The historical sequences don't add much to the plot, and all it does it break up the endless talking. <br/><br/>Secondly, some of the casting was very good. Ian McKellen was very good as Leigh Teabing, and got a few laughs, although, I must admit that the casting of Paul Bettany was completely inspired. He really was very good as Silas, and his final scene was really compelling. Alfred Molina's role was smaller, but he did a good job with it. However, I felt that Jean Reno was not a strong enough villain. I was expecting a much more powerful villain - although he did impress me in one of his later scenes. Tom Hanks I found also was a bit lacklustre - his character didn't seem to do anything other than run around a lot and crack all the codes inordinately quickly. Audrey Tautou was very gorgeous, but despite the fact that she was meant to be the cryptographer, she didn't seem to have much of a role in the actual detective work; she just stood there and looked astonished.<br/><br/>Whilst the Da Vinci Code just about works on paper, the major difference between the book and the film is that you can't pad the film out with pages of description. Everything had to be explained through talking, which meant that the whole film boiled down to two hours of wooden dialogue. The Latin and French conversations seemed to be thrown in simply to make the viewer watch the screen. <br/><br/>Whilst this film is definitely worth seeing, don't go in with high expectations, and you might just be surprised."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","4","21 May 2006"," An opportunity missed
","""The Da Vinci Code"" has been a publishing phenomenon. Even before the film version appeared, the novel had been translated into 44 languages and sold an utterly amazing 40 million copies. Rarely then has a film been so anticipated by millions and then so panned by virtually all the critics. In truth, I had hoped that this would have been one of those very rare occasions when the movie would prove better than the book because the novel contains some interesting plot elements but is appallingly badly written. Sadly I have to record that the critics are right and my hope has been dashed.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, as the American professor of symbiology Robert Langdon, sports a strange haircut and speaks as if he has a cold, while gamine Audrey Tautou, as French cryptologist Sophie Nevue, struggles somewhat with her first English-speaking role and accomplished actor Jean Reno - here playing the policeman in charge of the murder investigation - is underused. Only Ian McKellen, in a rather camp and breathless performance as the Holy Grail expert Leigh Teabing, really impresses.<br/><br/>I had thought that the movie might soften the portrayal in the book of the Catholic Church and more especially the Opus Dei organisation and that it would ease back on the self-punishment inflicted by the albino monk Silas, but there is no sparing of Catholic sensibilities here. Indeed the film is remarkably faithful to both the substance and the style of the book - and this is mainly what dooms it to such tedium. The movie, like the novel, has little characterisation, is excessively wordy, and concludes in a limp and most unsatisfactory manner. <br/><br/>Director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer can do much better than this (""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Apollo 13""), so I blame Dan Brown. He wrote the book, he was executive producer on the film, and he even supplied a bit of the music and some extra codes. The film look quite good - with location shooting in places like The Louvre - and sounds good too - with music from Hans Zimmer - but it is too long (two and half hours), too dense, and poorly written and paced. In spite of these serious flaws, I suspect that the movie will still do well enough to recoup its considerable investment and will push the novel back to the top of the best-seller lists because so many people have a restless urge to see patterns and meanings and conspiracies even when there are none."

The actors portrayed the characters well and the atmosphere of the historical locations was a real treat. It is a very well made movie. Entertaining and a perfect movie to see in a darkened theater on a big screen.<br/><br/>I would bet that most of the criticism of this movie is coming from people involved in the religion portrayed in the film. It's just a big, fat hot button. Although, I'm sure some religious people can see it for what it is. Just. A.

The more Sophie learns, the less repulsive she finds her grandfather and she builds up respect for (according to this film) Real (more sexual) Christianity and Paganism. In the book she starts off despising her grandfather slightly, but as she uncovers his clues and learns more about the attitudes behind the ritual, she realises that it was really only her own Constantine-Christianity prejudice that made her feel that way and slowly grew to forgive him.<br/><br/>Maybe this theme did exist in another way somewhere in the film and I just missed it.

"willandcrystalyates","3","1","4","20 May 2006"," Alas and alack.......
","Well let's see....Ron Howard is a great and accomplished director, the success of past films has proved that. Tom Hanks and Ian Mckellen are both fine, successful actors, awards and accolades have proved that. Dan Brown wrote a provocative and bestselling novel, millions of copies in sales have proved that. So at the convergence of those three matrices, you would expect that a fantastic film would come forth out the these fine talents and persons. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the Da Vinci Code, and I can say these educatedly as I just returned from the theater. First of all, I am a pastor at a church. I have my beliefs, and I stick to them, others have theirs, and they stick to them. I respect that. I did not go to watch this movie to try to make Dan Brown or Ron Howard out as Satanist who are out to disprove the Bible, I just wanted to see an interesting movie. So, let's accentuate the positive: The cinematography is beautiful. Paris in the evening never looked so good, nor have the outskirts of London. The story line is very thought provoking, and your mind is alert throughout the entire film, you are always wondering what will happen next, and you are constantly trying to anticipate the next part of the ""code"". That's all for the good. Seriously. Now for the rest.... All of the persons in this film are fine actors, however the writing does not do ANY of them justice, they are constantly over-explaining details that the viewer could easily infer, thus making it more interesting. The dialog is chock full of these over-explanatory terms, so that you almost wish that someone would shut-up and let a moment pass. This is not a spoiler, but the entire crux of the film is laid out in a single moment that happens far too quick, the viewer is left with no imagination. Tom Hanks' dialog is almost wooden and emotionless, it is almost as if Mr. Spock has become Robert Langdon, everything is ""logical"", and he logically proceeds through every step of the movie. I LOVE Sir Ian Mckellen, he is a FINE actor, however, he too falls into the jabber of over-explanatory dialog, and muddles his natural acting ability. Suffice to say, however, he is the shining moment of acting in this film. The screenplay of this film is VERY poor. Too many impossible, implausible, and inconceivable things take place too fast, and the characters figure things out too quick for it to work. Had this been ""The Never-Ending Story"" it would be acceptable, but shot as it is, in the present-day, it simply does not work well. And my final comment, the make-up and hair in this movie are completely unnatural. Again, no spoiler, but after a vigorous chase scene, Audrey Tautou and Tom Hanks' hair and makeup are absolutely infallible, Ms. Tautou looks as though she just applied lipstick whilst running for her life. All in all, this movie is, as the other comments have said, a major disappointment. I believe that there is so much story and information in the novel, that the director, writers, etc. tried to cram it all into a 2.5 hour movie, and unfortunately failed. I think had this been a longer movie, with more time to let things evolve, I would have been more satisfied (I hope). Again, this is my opinion, and offered here for your review, I hope you find it beneficial.<br/><br/>will"

If you loved the book don't listen to what anyone says go see it and make up your own mind.<br/><br/>P.S. this movie is best seen in theaters and also don't be turned off by the choice of Tom Hanks. while he was not ideal for the part it was not a major flaw in the presentation of the movie. and anyway it is nice to see a celebrity who looks aged and natural."

"artzau","7","1","4","20 May 2006"," So, what's all the flap about?
","Look. Dan Brown wrote a mystery thriller. He researched it using some revisionist themes and built it on an earlier novel and it became a best seller. Good fiction always spins yarns on bits of facts and figures and then weaves them into patterns to excite our fancies and footsies. The more fantastic, very often, the greater appeal. In the case of his novel, it worked. But, is this novel based on hard evidence? C'mon. It's a novel. If one takes it seriously as an exposition of esoteric beliefs, arcane knowledge and sinister conspiracies, that is one's problem. Ron Howard made this film because he likes meaty, twisty plots and got a great crew together to do it. Tom Hanks is great, as always, so is the very lovely Audrey Tautou, Paul Bettany is creepy, Jean Reno is intense, Alfred Molina is sneaky and Ian McKellen is slimy. The film is lively, fast-paced, follows the story line of the book and if anyone's offended, that's their fault for making this tale more out than the novel it is. The end product is an entertaining movie and thanks again, Ron Howard, for giving me my money's worth."

","I just got home from seeing the DaVinci Code. It was good but.......yes a caveat. I'm not sure why Ron Howard added material to the end but it would have been a much better and stronger movie if he had just let people use their imaginations. Up until the last 20-25 minutes the movie was going along swimmingly and, I thought, pretty well done. It had taken most of the important scenes from the book and translated them fairly well to screen. But then he re-wrote the ending. What was that for? Sophie ended up more of a pretty face than the intelligent cryptographer she was in the book but still the character was good. I thought Tom Hanks did a pretty fair job but it was Paul Bettany that made me jump in one scene. He did a really scary villain in Firewall and his Silas in this movie was just as scary.

The movie also lost the love story between Sophie and Robert.<br/><br/>i advice one to watch the movie first, as one is more likely to enjoy it then, the one would also be able to fully appreciate how good the book is.<br/><br/>to end on a good note, i was thoroughly surprised and impressed by Paul Bettanys performance as Silas, at one point i genuinely jumped even though i kind of new it was coming, he is actually quite scaring looking in this movie as well, his performance was probably the best out of all the high profile cast members, what makes it even better is hes British."
"neilmarshall-1","8","1","4","20 May 2006"," A Movie For The Ears Rather Than The Eyes
","After months of anticipation, I finally got the chance to watch the Da Vinci Code tonight and I was left wanting a bit more...<br/><br/>I read only half the book and because the release of the motion picture was not too far off, this hindered me from finishing it. The first thing that struck me about the movie was how the casting of Tom Hanks and Jean Reno tarnished the content. As an actor myself I thought that Hanks should not have been cast in this role, however his performance grows on you throughout the movie. I think Hanks is an exceptional actor, but after watching it I think that a fresh face would have been more appropriate. Maybe if they decide to create a movie of Angels & Demons they might not use Hanks again. From what I could gather from the book, the character that Reno played was not what I expected. He seems to always play the French guy in Hollywood movies and I suppose it seemed only natural to cast him as a French guy in France for once. But, I could not steer my mind clear of the fact that I was watching Jean Reno and not a French equivalent of an FBI agent.<br/><br/>The movie itself was always going to be a hit because of the success of the book and as a whole it did not disappoint. It is rare in movies that the dialogue is more successful than the action. But, Da Vinci Code is an excellent example of using the spoken word to its full potential.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie for me was the feudal debate between Robert Langdon and Sir Ian McKellan's character (who never fails to disappoint me with a performance) where he exposes the painting of The Last Supper as being a controversial alternative version of Jesus'last supper with his disciples. 'The eyes see only what you want them to see', is a clever phrase that is repeated quite often throughout.<br/><br/>The worst parts of the movie for me were when we were shown Robert Langdon's fear of claustrophobia. Having already read Angels & Demons and half of Da Vinci code before watching the movie I already knew a lot of information about Langdon's character, but the way his fear was depicted reminded me of a 1980's American Soap Opera. And his fear wasn't exposed until it was dropped into conversation about three quarters of the way through the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I really did enjoy this movie and I have no doubt that I will be buying the DVD when it comes out and I will be eagerly awaiting the movie of Angels & Demons. It's a must-see movie, which appealed to me more than the similar boom of the Lord of the Rings movies over the past four years. It's two and a half hours of education and entertainment and it won't have you looking at your watch."

","The Da Vinci Code was a fun movie. It was as entertaining as a James Bond movie. Nonetheless, as The Da Vinci Code progressed my understanding of the plot grew confused. By the two-thirds point I wasn't quite certain if Opus Dei was bad or was it the Priory of Sion. And, exactly where was the movie headed too? Would I recognize the end when I saw it? Apparently not, because I thought the movie had reached its end at least four times. And that finally ending  well, yah sooooooooooo.<br/><br/>I didn't get it.<br/><br/>But as long as I'm not going to be tested for comprehension and understanding, then I don't really care  except for the talking parts. Perhaps because the talking parts 'caused me to zone out into ADD land that I missed those crucial plot points. The James Bond parts though I liked. Silas (Paul Bettany) the albino psychopath monk was definitely a James Bond character. Funny there was no romantic interest between the characters of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou).<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was OK. Imagine if they'd cast Leonardo DiCaprio? Leonardo in the Da Vinci Code. Bad joke maybe but DiCaprio would have carried the adventure part of the movie better than Tom Hanks did.

This was the feeling I had when I read the novel, I couldn't put the book down. I was very impressed with how close the movie was able to follow the book. I thought the acting was very good and the actors believable in their roles. If I wanted to, I can poke holes in part of the plot, but that isn't why I go to movies or read books. I go to movies and read books to be entertained, and both the book and movie are very entertaining. It is funny that some many groups dismiss the premise of the movie/book since there is no proof Jesus was married. But it is equally true that there is no proof he wasn't.

The biggest (and probably only) factors of the book that had an impact on me were the controversial challenges against fundamental religious beliefs, as aside from this, this thriller differs very little in its suspense and storytelling than most half-decent thrillers.<br/><br/>It has been years since I've read the book and so the impact this story had on me has had years to fade away, and sadly I realised while watching this movie that it had faded completely. Since this movie is such an accurate portrayal of the novel, it expresses the exact same controversial issues that I have gotten over in the last few years, and so this movie generated very little excitement for me and provoked no thought whatsoever.<br/><br/>However, if you haven't read the book before then you should give it a go because if you strip away all the hype and controversy, it isn't a bad movie."

","I was intrigued to see the film even though I thought the book was a real disappointment and a waste of trees and time (you can see my book review here: http://angusabranson.livejournal.com/326531.html Saturday 9th July 2005). I've said for a while that I thought it would be a better film than it was a book (which is something I will rarely say as books give you so much more that is not captured on celluloid) so was interested to see the film despite all my opinions on Mr Browns lacklustre novel.<br/><br/>I've also been surprised that the film has been fairly universally panned in the press. I've not seen a positive review of it as yet and many places have called it this years dullest film. I, strangely enough, now find myself defending Mr Browns novel. For starters I guess they haven't read the book. The book is hardly an action thriller. It's a 590+ page book that covers the event of ONE day. The book is slow, the book doesn't give the reader anything real to think about - just leading them from one encounter or discovery of a bit information to another. THE DA VINCI CODE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE A FAST PACED FILM!<br/><br/>I also find myself flowing against public opinion once again.<br/><br/>Public Opinion on the book: Loved It Angus Opinion on the book: "" the book is actually about as controversial and ground breaking as a book as Busted is to Punk rock.""<br/><br/>Public Opinion on the film: (So far) Found it boring Angus Opinion on the film: Far better than the book and actually pretty enjoyable<br/><br/>Yes that's right folks. I, Angus, Hater of All Things Brown ""LIKED"" the film adaptation.<br/><br/>And it is an adaptation. They have changed a number of things from the book (as with almost all adaptations) some of which are for the better others of which are not. Maybe because at it's core The Da Vinci Code seems to have been written for the big screen as well as airport lounges. Maybe it's because I prefer wasting a couple of hours at the cinema than several nights reading a bland piece of fiction. In any case I enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>Yes, it is slow paced. But, as I mentioned before, anyone who has read the book should be expecting this. The ideas and settings suit the big screen and have been very well handled by Ron Howard (yes, he of Happy Days fame). Tom Hanks does a fine job as Robert Langdon - won't be getting any Oscar nominations for it, but he portrays him well and once again comes across as a good actor - Audrey Tautou (whom I've loved since Amelie) is still sexy and lends Sophie Neveu an added element of charm and sex appeal, Ian McKellen is brilliant as Sir Leigh Teabing and Paul Bettany is an excellent Silas (the albino monk).<br/><br/>It was odd seeing Alfred Molina playing Bishop Aringarosa as whenever he came on screen I just kept thinking about Doctor Octopus! Jean Reno (who was excellent in Leon/The Professional - depending on which continent you live on) put in a disappointing performance as Captain Fache. I can't really put my finger on it but he just didn't come across as well as he did in the books. This is probably partially because of some changes they made in his storyline.<br/><br/>I had to smile at a couple of scenes (mainly street scenes in Paris) as the director must have done some homework because some of the location he uses (that aren't mentioned in the book) are actually fairly important in Templar history. One in particular near Notre Dame :p<br/><br/>Overall I was surprised by the film. Despite my views on the novel - and the fact that I feel they changed a few of the good bits in the transition - I found myself enjoying the film and would certainly recommend it to people as long as they like slower paced more thinking films.<br/><br/>I can't believe I've actually said good things about this! If you've ever thought about reading the book - don't. Go and watch the film instead. If you want a proper book dealing with the Templars and conspiracy theories go and read the excellent Focaults Pendulum by Umberto Eco instead. That is something that deserves the title of 'Masterpiece'.<br/><br/>School Report: B (Ron Howard somehow made a bland book into an interesting film)"
"matjusm","8","1","4","20 May 2006"," The DaVinci decoded
","Probably one of the most anticipated book to film adaptations of recent times, this film does live up to expectations.<br/><br/>The plot, in case you aren't familiar with the book, revolves around a Harvard symbology professor by the name of Robert Langdon and a young French cryptologist named Sophie Neveu who go on a kind of a treasure hunt to find the greatest secret in history that could rattle the foundations of modern society. If you have read the novel, I have to say that the film follows it quite faithfully and never really deviates far from the words of Dan Brown.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks may seem like an odd casting choice but he does an excellent job with his role. Convincing and intelligent, he even looks the part well. Audrey Tatou looks simply adorable with that awesome hairstyle of hers. The chemistry between them works well and doesn't go into any unnecessary or cheesy romance. There are also some good supporting roles by Ian McKellen (playing a historian who helps the leads on their quest) and Paul Bettany, the main antagonist. Alfred Molina also shows in the role of a villainous bishop but I felt that they could have given him a little more of a back story and explained his intent.<br/><br/>Ron Howard does a decent job being the director. Along with cinematographer Salvatore Totino they have created some nice dark visuals and used and portrayed the locations (the Louvre in Paris among many other spectacular place) well but never having those overtake the story. There were also some wonderful flashbacks into various points in history while the back story was being explained. At 149 minutes, this film may seem long but that time goes by fast, but fortunately not too fast. My only complaint to Howard is that the film's biggest action scene is like is the case with many films these days, hampered by overly fast editing and unclear camera-work. Hans Zimmer has created a nice score that adds to the atmosphere of the film but never really rises above that.<br/><br/>However what made me very mad was the ending. They could have done something incredible with it (for the sake of your enjoyment of this film, I'm not going to reveal it here) but instead, went a very politically correct route.<br/><br/>Although it doesn't rise to any grand or new heights, this is still a very enjoyable film.<br/><br/>8/10"
"diac228","7","1","4","20 May 2006"," Not a masterpiece but not a disaster either, Da Vinci Code will leave you entertained...and thinking
","Every single time that religion is depicted on film, there will be a problem and plenty of controversy behind it. It happened with Dogma years ago, Passion of the Christ not too long ago, and now with The Da Vinci Code. Now, apparently, I totally missed the memo that I was supposed to thrash this film to no end because it's confusing, boring, repetitive, and a written catastrophe of epic proportions. The Da Vinci Code is far from that; it is nowhere near as a bad as critics say it is. While the writing is different from the book (what book-to-film adaptation isn't?) and the directing is a bit flawed, this is still an entertaining murder mystery that requires an open mind and a will to receive a plethora of background information that will be revealed throughout the lengthy movie. It is rather obvious that critics and most of the public were ready to fail this motion picture from the moment the title is revealed.<br/><br/>While it still isn't as shocking or as much of a page-turner than the original work, its Howard's fear of a backlash that results in this being different from Dan Brown's instant best-seller. Like Ron Howard's critically acclaimed Best Picture winner A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code frays away from shocking even more in order to avoid a recoil that will result in fewer people watching it. The weakest part of the movie is the writing and the pacing, which is what keeps it away from being an excellent film yet gives it potential in becoming an eventual box office success-turned cult hit (The Matrix). Anyone expecting an accurate description of the book will leave disappointed, even though some of the differences are actually pretty minor, and some actually result in the movie being a bit better. Lack of romance in the movie is a breath of fresh air as it goes against the average drama that needs to throw in some random love story in between the carnage. But, the first part of the film is built up way too slow, too much dialogue and pointless trivia can be found all over the place within the first half hour.<br/><br/>Pacing is ruined because of this. Clocked in at over 145 minutes, The Da Vinci Code has the potential of giving you that nice, long nap that you've needed. Fortunately for us, the pacing totally picks up in the second stage, when the two main characters run into a crucial character, Sir Leigh Teabing. After they meet, the movie picks up and does not let go except for a few moments of slowdown. Ironically, the best action sequence involves a short yet satisfying drive towards incoming traffic while avoiding the enemyin the beginning of the movie. But, don't expect to just sit there and watch, thinking is required, learning is required, and so is the fact that this is all fiction and in no way is trying to question your faith. Actually, The Da Vinci Code does not question or bash any religion, it is an obvious fictitious tale. But when a thing such as God and Jesus is questioned, no matter what the circumstances are, we will have chickens with their heads cut off gawking obscenities at the body of work.<br/><br/>It is about Faith against Fact, Fiction against Non-Fiction, Science against Christianity. This is the sort of stuff questioned constantly in the hit show ""Lost,"" but it is presented in a more underlying manner, which is how it avoids the smoking gun of the public. Da Vinci on the other hand, is not afraid of such a touchy subject, even though Ron Howard obviously is. There is an entire portion of the book left off the movie, just so that it doesn't add to the negative hype. Another reason why The Da Vinci Code the movie failed a little is because Howard also underestimated the intelligence of the audience, as his clue-leaving skills from A Beautiful Mind sadly results in the majority of the public figuring out the plot twists before they happen.<br/><br/>If there is a reason to watch this movie, it is certainly for the acting. Tom Hanks though, he really couldn't make his character that interesting, as hard as he tried. Robert Langdon is not that memorable a person, he is just another person jumbled in a religious mess. His assistant throughout the film is Sophie, played by unknown actress Audrey Tautou, whose previous works are mostly foreign movies. The best performances come from the supporting cast, especially the unrecognizable Paul Bettany as the amazingly creepy and psycho monk whose views on God and whatnot is just scary. Sir Ian McKellen also shines as the friendly and intelligent Leigh Teabing. Other notable performances come from Alfred Molina, and Jean Reno. The acting here is above and beyond the average summer flick, and runs this movie when the writing is running out of gas and Howard is taking a break from leaving obvious clues.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Risky, but not risky enough. Decent, but not decent enough. While it is not a horrible disaster, it does stand just a few steps above mediocre because of a few flaws here and there. A different director could have been better, and a better writing staff could have quickened the pace of the movie and also cut back on all the worthless dialogue that happens from time to time. We do have some Oscar-worthy performances here though, and we do have some beautiful, beautiful scenery to marvel at. While the Indiana Jones movies are much better in terms of hunting for religious artifacts, this movie isn't as bad as what the bitter critics have been showcasing as. The Da Vinci Code: Enter with an open mind, leave entertained and ready for discussion."
"bobbones1","9","1","4","20 May 2006"," Book adaptation worth seeing
","When I walked into the cinema last night, I was excited, apprehensive, nervous all rolled into one! That's because I love the book so much that I never expected the film to live up to my expectations. By the time I came out, I felt like Ron Howard, Tom Hanks et al. had done justice to the novel, with regards to the time limit they had. Although not everything from the book was in the film, all the major plot was there, so I don't know why people have been slating it as 'unloyal' to the novel! Only minor points were missing, which neither added nor took away from the actual story telling.<br/><br/>The actors themselves fleshed out the characters in a way that I wasn't expected, after reading several bad reviews. Paul Bettany and Ian McKellen stole the show in any scene they were in, bringing real emotional depth to Silas and Leigh Teabing. I felt Audrey Tautou was an inspired choice as Sophie Neveu, and Tom Hanks filled the shoes of Robert Langdon perfectly (with a much floppier hairstyle than expected). <br/><br/>When reading the reviews, I found it highly annoying that critics were saying there wasn't enough action in it... Well it's not supposed to be an action film! Throwing unwanted explosions and gun fights here and there would have taken away from the thoroughly gripping seriousness of the story (Although, to all you devote Christian's, IT IS A WORK OF FICTION!) <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code A LOT! Fans of the book shouldn't be disappointed! And if you haven't read the book, watch it anyway! Just don't take things too seriously..."
"christinee5","8","1","4","20 May 2006"," Invitation to think beyond the square
","Hello, I have just returned home from enjoying Da Vinci Code and I am totally disappointed as I know too few people with whom I can enjoy a healthy discussion on the possibilities behind the script.<br/><br/>This also reinforces my belief that until we question and explore the foundations of all organisations we cannot come to belonging via choice and integrity and without that we cannot mature into personal peace let alone global Peace. While ever we need defend without listening or discussion we will not free ourselves of any teaching that is passed generation to generation via the hand of dogma.<br/><br/>I thank Ron Howard and the entire cast for co-creating a visual version of a story which, with respect, invites question and exploration into the political history of the Church of Rome and the man who stands at its Heart and foundation. I do not feel there is a wrong or right conclusion however I am fascinated when I think of the number of people who cannot imagine that it is entirely possible that what Christians believe may not be accurate and that what is behind their belief can be made stronger by exploration of the mystery.<br/><br/>I hold great movies as the ones that keep returning after viewing. A scene, a word, the music, something plays in my sub-conscious and invites me to ponder, consider, think or feel and in the case of DaVinci Code I wonder what I would do if I found myself in the position of Sarah. Would I set in motion the deliberate destruction of a faith and a religion that sustains many while its political side is responsible for the death of many or would I take up the challenge to find a creative, gentle Path of renewing and retelling the most enduring, mysterious story in our history and psychi. Their is more than one way to view everything? <br/><br/>Congratulations on a great movie which asks us to think beyond the square. walk gently Christine"
"sensei-20","9","1","4","20 May 2006"," I liked and did not like parts of this movie
","I have seen much better movies and seen much worse movies. It was well acted I thought and it did make you think. I liked the part Tom Hanks played and while some make fun of his hair I thought it became him. As a Christian it did not sway me on how I feel and believe about Christianity. It did make the Catholic religion look bad though so I can see there being upset by the movie contents. Since I knew it was fiction I did not let it effect my feelings that the religion was corrupt. I enjoyed the film and liked it's ending. I thought to myself before going to see it that it was a fiction and factual movie. It was entertaining and the 2 1/2 hours did not seem to drag on for me. I feel others in the theater enjoyed the movie for what it was. I hope that it does not create static to a younger person's attitude about what the movie says verses the Bible. I will believe the Bible any day over any movie. It did make some people probably wonder about the relationship of Jesus and Mary because of the painting being dissected by the actor. Again it was fiction. I am not sure totally how I feel for sure about the movie but after seeing it a few hours ago I feel it was well made, good acting, but it should not have challenged the Catholic religion as it did. At times it was rather deep and hard to figure out some of the things in the movie so if you see it pay close attention, like no bathroom breaks or you might get a bit lost on the story line. The good seeing this movie may do is to make some Christians firmer in their beliefs. The bad is that it could make others doubt what they already believe and know from the Bible. After thinking and hearing more comments on this movie I might add another post here. Being an open minded person and curious I had to go see it myself. I did not read the book and now will probably not read it ever since I know what it is about. Mary, OH. OK...... back again with a note..I thought about this movie more the next day and I really did enjoy watching it and I thought it was well worth the time and money spent. It is thought provoking, and made your imagination work as well as made you think. I liked the actors and think they were right for the parts they played. I really like the ending and found it touching. I think everyone should see it that is at least around 18 or older and judge for themselves. It was a movie I would watch again. I want to change my rating and give it a 9*****. Well done!"

"lovelylialuvzya","9","1","4","20 May 2006"," Fabulous!
","I saw this movie the day it was released and absolutely loved it. I too read the book, and disagree with the generally negative reviews it received. Critics claimed it was 'boring' and long-winded, however that's because these critics most probably (subconsciously) expected some sort of romantic development between the main characters. I have to say it was incredibly refreshing to watch a movie that focuses so entirely on plot development without polluting and diluting the story with unnecessary romantic rubbish. I do believe however that in order to fully appreciate the intellectual dimension of the story one must have read the book, and that the story is better as a book than as film. One of the benefits of watching it on a screen however was the visuals - when I was reading the book I had to actually google some of the images to make sense of the words! A must see...But I recommend reading the book first."
"bertjd","8","1","4","20 May 2006"," I think this film is taken a little to seriously
","I have just returned from seeing The Da Vinci Code and would like to say I really enjoyed it. I cannot understand some critics rating this as a bad film, it does have some minor drawbacks in its story telling but overall is good to see in the cinema. I have not read the book yet but am looking forward to it, so my review of the film is based on what I saw on screen only. This is a film where the viewer has a chance to see real fiction at work, which is why I think it has been given some bad reviews, remember it is fiction, so if you can go in with an open mind you may enjoy it. I found it was similar to the film National Treasure, apart from the fact that Jesus was involved in The Da Vinci Code, the film runs much like a treasure hunt, as stated by Robert Langdon (played greatly by Tom Hanks). Perhaps the reason for bad reviews is that the film does go into great detail that it could be called heresy, fiction, fiction, fiction. Overall I found it interesting, and thought Ron Howard has made another good film, and remember it is a film, not real, made in such a way that it has angered some people, like Mel Gibson did with Passion, which apparently was real, you be the judge."
"albertosanchezmd","9","1","4","20 May 2006"," Very very good adaptation of a book that INCITES TO THINK BY YOURSELF about the History written by the winners
","The DaVinci Code movie contains the most important points of a book that is extremely engaging but, also rich in ideas and raw historical data. And to respond right away to the critics of the History here told, I just remind them what the famous historian Will Durant stated, more or less that History is 10% facts and 90% prejudice (prejudice of the particular historian). Do an experiment on your own try to attend a potentially historical event, such as an important public protest (it is important that the event you attend is not micromanaged, so there is opportunity of spontaneous behavior from the people attending), and then afterward read newspapers or watch TV or listen to radio about that event you attended, making sure you get different sources, and then you will get an idea first hand of the distortion of history, not just of the history of 100 or 1000 years ago, but from the history of yesterday and of last week. <br/><br/>The movie hints to the reasons there are many flavors or variations of History, of an idea, or of an ideal ( such as a religion has orthodox, ultra orthodox, different kind of protestants branches, liberals, etc ) One of the main reasons is that most people tend modify everything to their own convenience, both consciously and unconsciously; and then there are the manipulators who manage to get to control over an idea or religion or activist group, for their own benefit deceiving anyone willing to be deceived and anyone unable to see the deception, into what they want them to believe. Some people understand that deceptions/distortions happened in the past in the Soviet Union and other countries, and maybe even understand that it happened in this country, but few less see it to contine happening in the present in other countries and in this country. What most people do not understand or do not want to understand is that deception and manipulation for power, money, and all other self-serving reasons happens and can happen any place, any time, for as long as any person has any power without supervision. People, in general, do not check thinks up by themselves. And people do not want to realize that every single act we do we do it for ourselves, and that we can not avoid this even if we want to.<br/><br/>This movie by Ron Howard does almost the best that can be expected considering the large number of important ideas implicit in the DaVinci Code book story. If Mr. Howard had tried to include more information, the movie would had been a heavy ""forced down your throat"" dissertation on history, the distortion of history by the winners, symbology, mythology, and some of what is known about the corruption and manipulation of ideals (ideals as those first expressed by religious and political icons such as Buddha, Jesus, Mohamed, and others, that later on have been used by the next wise guy as tools to become powerful and rich, as most of the winners of the internal dog fights AKA ""chosen leaders"" of modern religions and political parties in power are. The movie can not include, as the book does, how in the past politics & religion were mixed even more than today, as when popes had armies, and as when people were tortured and savagely killed by the Inquisition and other ""self-righteous"" and ""I am doing it for your own good"" movements. The movie just barely has time to touch some of this points, while remaining engaging entertaining. However, there is a chance some in the audience may actually start thinking something new, and this is what the church really fears. Because, that is why the church says the ""first virtue"" is faith. The church can not tolerate any real questioning otherwise its self-stated monopoly on Truth falls apart. So if you question you are committing ""heresy"" and automatically out; unless, of course, you have a very big group with you (read market), in which case the church may adapt to you (for example the changes in the official position about Galileo's ideas or about the inquisition, or the recent changes to try to include evolution under the name of ""intelligent design""). Or at least it may create a branch to include you (and your market), if possible. An example of their effort to control their people's thinking is that of very orthodox Jewish people, who are told not read some newspapers, nor to watch the news on TV. They are told that their religious leaders will give them ""the news which are important and pertinent to them"" ""to avoid the contamination of their minds"" (read the opening to questioning of their minds). Another form of thought control, which is less severe, but more common are the school, religious and others. That is why teaching people to think for themselves is very important. <br/><br/>For those who may begin to question History as told by the winners there are many many books out there, including those about the ""Dead Sea Scrolls"" which contain some of the several gospels which did not make the cut of the editors of the Bible.<br/><br/>However, most people find those history books boring, and here is for me the main merit of the DaVinci Code movie and book; that because of being very entertaining it has caused some people, which otherwise would had never read or think about the innumerable distortions in History, to think for the first time about ""unquestionable subjects."" In this particular case about ""the History"" The Church does not want people to think about, and much less to question at all."

"allanhclark","8","1","4","19 May 2006"," Generally good movie without the excitement of the book
","The movie is a faithful rendering of the book in almost every detail. <br/><br/>What made the book a real page-turner was the cutting back and forth between two parallel but finally intersecting story lines. In movies this technique is called crosscutting and Dan Brown made it work on paper by alternating short chapters, ending each with a cliffhanger. That doesn't carry over into the movie with at all the same effect.<br/><br/>A difficulty Brown overcame in the book was explaining so much historical research without turning the book into a treatise. The movie has harder time doing this and at some points it sags under the weight. A few things aren't explained at all in an effort to speed the action. <br/><br/>The final scene in which Hanks returns to the Louvre is puzzling. It's meant to sum things up by using the two pyramids in the Carrousel du Louvre, the underground shopping center adjacent to the museum, but it doesn't work. Apparently you are supposed to think this is the center of things at the Louvre and not simply an element of decor in a mall. Anyone who has been there won't be fooled.<br/><br/>One thing the movie does better than the book is the visual analysis of Da Vinci's painting, The Last Supper. On the screen you can show the visual components very effectively. <br/><br/>As for the acting, I thought Tom Hanks was wooden and Ian McKellen a delight."

People who have not read the book will probably be like ""What what what? What's happening?"" I find the movie enjoyable bcuz it's nice to see things that you've made up in your imagination come to life visually. I would have liked to see a bit more chemistry between Langdon and Sofie. In the book there's this unspoken attraction between them that is not portrayed in the movie. I kinda missed that sexual tension, not that it takes anything in particular away from the movie. The ending of the movie, however, is actually better than the ending of the book, which kinda leaves you like ""ahhh!!!!!"" Also, there are some things that are shown in the movie, but not explained, like the very graphic sex rite. People who have not read the book may think it was a quick pornographic scene to make sure you're awake. The definitely needed to be more of that characteristic Dan Brown elaboration and explanation. In conclusion, the movie is worth seeing only if you've read the book. If you have already read the book, go see the movie.

Talking about the picture, we can see some disappointing things: In the beginning, the story told, was too fast(some people that were watching with me, realized that too),and Tom Hanks, was a little bit confusing in his ""work""...he was a little embarrassed with all that speech, about symbolist and that audience behind him, was disgusting..i have to tell...seems like people taken out of streets that never saw that pictures and opinionated about that..for God sake,they were too superficial... After that,when Langdon(Tom) received an advise asking him to go to Louvre Museum, i felt some insecurity action between Langdon and Fache(Jean Reno)...seems like chemistry was awful in the set... In Louvre action, all things happened too fast, something that was cleared in the book, that never happened in that way...It was like Langdon and Sophie were genius...and somewhere, somehow,they had a mystical power to discover everything that happened there...another time...a superficial sequence... In the bank, things get a little bit better,Langdon and Sophie seemed more connected and with some tenderness between them...Finally the movie become to take off, and begins to satisfy the audience... After that,when Langdon and Sophie searched for Teabing, things get a lot better and the picture, becomes more substantial with all flashbacks about Langdon and Sophie lives'...It seems that director Ron Howard could make himself comfortable after that point... Well, i won't talk about the rest of the movie because i don't want to freak out other people that wants to see, so let's talk about the cast: Tom Hanks-I Think he had a disappointing performance here,he is much better in other movies,and with no time to improvise he seems a little bit robotic...just in last five minutes you see how great actor he is... Audrey Tatou: A lovely surprise...i thought that she won't have ability to act with Tom...but she's much better than he is in this movie...Deep performance...a lot like Sophie in the book... Ian Mckellen:Maybe, the best actor here...got all maniacs of Teabing and transported well to the screen...Excellent..I will see X-MEN:The Last Stand,in some way because of him... Jean Reno:An slightly disappointing performance...i fought he would be better...Maybe next time... Paul Bettany:He is perfect...Great...An Oscar nomination isn't a grievance for this man...All movies that i saw him, he's acting great...Excellent work...He deserves stardom... All other performances were good too,and besides that,they weren't so important... Finally,i wish for people that didn't see this movie, to have fun...Don't go with great expectations...this is not a favorite for an Academy Award nomination..."
"rje-5","7","1","4","19 May 2006"," Decent attempt, not as bad as what people are saying
","When I first read the Da Vinci code I was overwhelmed and captured by the level of detail that Dan Brown went into about the myth of the Holy Grail and the conspiracies surrounding it, which I think was the key characteristic that allowed this to become one of the best selling books of modern times. Given the audience that Brown has reached with this book, Howard had an almighty task of being able to portray such story in a way that would satisfy all parties.<br/><br/>Personally I think Howard did a good job of being able to summaries a novel that goes into great detail surrounding the main plot and still produce a film that keeps on you the edge of your seat about an idea that has caught the imagination of people of all religions. Howard was able to use an outstanding cast and multiple locations to build the grail story and stick to closely to the story that Dan Brown originally published. The cinematography and music in the movie kept you as gripped to the ever developing story as a first time reader of the book.<br/><br/>Special mention should go to Paul Bettany, who played the dark character of Silas to perfection and added to the intense plot of the story. In addition Hanks, McKellen, Tautou & Reno all put in a masterful performance and contributed significantly to Howards attempt of recapturing the essence of the novel that gripped millions of readers world wide.<br/><br/>Overall I think this was a very well made film, with great directing (as always), a clever & yet simple screenplay of the original novel, clever cinematography and music that allowed the viewer to follow the plot and enormity of the events unfolding in the film. The film is not as good as the book purely as it can't go into as much detail that made the book so good, but it was a very good attempt and rendered very closely to how I would vision the novel as a film. Kept me an enthralled as the book did when I first read it. 8 of 10."

","First of all, I had not read the book when I went to see this movie in the theaters. Therefore I have an unclouded judgment about the movie, not having to worry about the book vs. movie comparison. And that's exactly what I advise everybody else who's going to see this movie to do: Go and see this movie without any prejudice nor expectations. You'll find that this film is what you expect from a movie: Entertaining! At least, that's what I expect. I do not want to see art, I do not want to learn some moral lesson, I simply want to be entertained, which this movie has succeeded in. It has suspense, mystery, action, a good plot, great filming locations and good acting. The pace of this film is perfect and will keep you intrigued with the story for more than two hours. I think this was a great movie and I will certainly read the book too, because the story intrigued me.<br/><br/>In summary, I found this a very entertaining movie to see. And if you want to relax and entertain yourself for more than two hours, I don't think The Da Vinci Code will disappoint you."

","The Da Vinci Code is one of my absolute favorite books. Great turn-paging action and impressive yet shocking facts. I could not have been more excited to hear that two of my absolute favorite actors, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, were starring in the adaptation.<br/><br/>The word that can best describe what I felt as I left the theater this afternoon is disappointment. The movie just didn't work. It couldn't live up to its name. The actors themselves were great, but the movie didn't flow. It never really picked up the pace and it honestly seemed rush. Before I even knew what was happening, it was over.<br/><br/>People who have not read the book, like my two friends that had not, will most likely enjoy this film.

"galahad58","8","1","4","19 May 2006"," Well Worth It
","The Da Vinci Code is an outstanding film. Ron Howard does an excellent job of direction. The timing is nicely paced, the acting is outstanding, the scenes are beautifully shot and the film feels right.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen steals the movie. McKellen is superb and his performance is definitely worth an Oscar bid. I enjoyed every single moment that McKellen was on the screen. This is McKellen's best work since he played Gandolf and he took full advantage of every second that he was on film.<br/><br/>While the church, and the ignorant religious zealots, are condemning this movie; there is nothing in this film that exhibits an anti-church or an anti-Christian movement. The film does show the ignorance of some members of the church in their quest to gain more power over people. The movie shows the evils that religious intolerance can cause when one priest says that Christ sacrificed himself for the betterment of mankind and so shall his descendants. The priests talks about this to assure himself that it is right, and good, to kill innocents in the name of the church. While this is going on, that same priests talks about how the Vatican would punish him, and his cohorts, if they found out what they were doing. Therefore, the movie shows that it is not the entire church, but a small part, doing the evil things. As intelligent people, we see that this is true in all religions. This is exhibited in the news on a regular basis. There is nothing in this movie that would make a person question their faith--but there is enough that may make someone take an interest in Christian history. Is that a bad thing? I do not think so."

","I saw this tonight with someone who had read the book (very quickly), and they enjoyed it more than I did I think. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it. The music was good, the composition was very good. Ron Howard has carved out a niche or trademark in the ""the solution appears to the protagonist using CGI and stuff"" for himself. A lot of the actors were on autopilot though, namely Hanks and Reno. Bettany and McKellen put in good, solid performances.<br/><br/>Some things were just a bit convenient to me, not to mention one or two plot holes but I really can't be bothered going into them here. I also don't understand the controversy here - did the Church whine regarding the first and third Indiana Jones movies?<br/><br/>Anyway, there were one or two moments where it seemed like the end but it continued for just a little longer, and character development was somewhat thin but not completely amiss.<br/><br/>All in all, not a waste of a night out, a definite critic-proof movie, although more of an OK thriller than a revelatory, iconic piece of work."

","The critics really blew it on this one! I thought this was a fabulous portrayal of the book...verbatim!

I think the critics are just jealous because Ron Howard did it just the way it should be done....a suspense story, nothing more. Not too gristly...but just enough to tell the story as close as possible to the way Dan Brown wrote it.<br/><br/>An absolute MUST SEE!!!! I can't wait to go again next week while on vacation."
"dejohnson2002","7","1","4","19 May 2006"," Da Vinci Code
","The movie, while good, did not capture the gripping, fast paced action I experienced in reading the book. After reading the first few pages of the book I just had to finish reading it. The movie moved along smartly, but not at the Indiana Jones pace that I was expecting. Tom Hanks didn't fully convince me that he was Robert Langdon although he didn't appear as Forest Gump either. While, in my opinion, the book was outstanding the film was merely good. I would recommend the film to people who have read the book, but not to those who haven't. The film does not do justice to the book. The Da Vinci Code is a work of fiction and should be read or viewed as such. It is entertainment pure and simple. The book and its forty million readers are tributes to Dan Brown's story telling expertise. The movie left out the anticipatory angst to which the always pressured main characters were subjected in the book."
"leesha_lou","6","1","4","19 May 2006"," Good but not great...
","Like many people, after reading the book, I couldn't wait to see this film on the big screen. I think in general, for people who hadn't read the book, people will find this film quite good. For those who have read the book, they will realise that they have changed/left out a lot of the film. The authenticity of the film, I thought was quite good. I really liked the way they had the central French characters spoke to each other in French....Small little observation I know, but I like these little things. As for the acting, I think we can all agree that we have seen both Hanks and Tataou in better roles. In the beginning of the film Hanks seemed stiff, he loosened up a little but both lacked the chemistry needed for the role!...Tataou, as well wasn't at her best, but given the fact that this is her first major film role being spoken in English, she can be forgiven!....Personally I thought the age gap between Hanks and Tataou was too great for people to totally except a possible relationship. The best acting in the film came from the non-central characters, being Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina and Jean Reno, Paul Bettany also gave a really good performance playing Silas. In general, this film is good, nothing at all what is built up to be, but still worth the watch. Those of you who have read the book, get ready for some ""odd"" changes, you will find yourself coming out saying ""in the book it wasn't like that etc..."", if you haven't read the book, sit back enjoy the story that has caused so much (might I add unnecessary)controversy!"
"felicianosandra","9","1","4","19 May 2006"," Sharing a curiosity
","Well, the story is great; the book - as well as most books that explore the same subject - was great; so the movie had all conditions to be great and off course it is. The actors do their job very well, but even with giants like Hanks, Reno, McKellen and Tautou on the screen, what still shines is the story and not the acting - there's nothing wrong with the acting, though; its just the story that is too absorbing!<br/><br/>Anyway, my reason to come here was mostly to share a curiosity: Have anyone noticed that among the Bus passengers at the London Bus scene are Lynn Pricknett and Clive Prince, the authors of the book ""The Templar Revelation"" - one of the books that inspired Dan Brown to write ""The Da Vinci Code""? It was really funny to spot them there!!! ;-)<br/><br/>P.S.: I have not selected the ""spoiler"" option, because I am not telling anything about the movie story, just sharing a two second's frame that can easily pass unnoticed for people who are not familiar with these author's faces - so, my advice is that you look for their pictures on the internet before watching the movie. That way you can easily recognize them at the London Bus scene."
"parhat","5","1","4","19 May 2006"," Great Concept Sleepy Story - Mainstream Conspiracy Theory
","It was not as exciting as the book where it is page by page thrills. The movie should have been done in an adaptation of Alfred Hitchcock movies. As in all Ron Howard's film, the movie is sleepy at best. I always go to sleep in all his film and the movie tends to be like one of those stagnant films that Ron Howard himself played as Opie in Andy Griffith's Show in a sleepy town. If it had not been for that wide eyed Don Knotts, the television series would have fallen flat. Will, this movie does not have any really great memorable characters like those of Minority Report, the story is slow. I think Ron Howard would learn more by trying to create excitement minute by minute like those of Crichton's books, which are really page turners. For the film it should be like frame by frame thrills. The movie hopes to cash in on one of those ""if you think it is true"" but it is really really not then I think Ron Howard made a big mistake. Those movies have a uniqueness in themselves, such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or Blair Witch project. Of course, he would have improve greatly if he at least make it into some horror like suspense out of this Da Vinci thing. Now for the conspiracy theories, be warned: Mainstream Conspiracy theories have very little truth to them. For a good reason: they are designed for people discredit the real conspiracy theories, which can NEVER be a mainstream and a lot of truth exists, but will always be an underground one anyway. Mainstream conspiracy theory movies include, Mel Gibson's Conspiracy Theories, the Moon Hoax (many of these), and In Plane Site. <br/><br/>I am sure this movie will spark debates, so I will clear something here to save your time.<br/><br/>Most of these mainstream are designed to discredit them. The more interesting underground conspiracy theory movies that is a lot better are those movies which you know are from Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore, Alex Jones, and a lot of others. So don't take these movie other than the art of the movie. Is there any truth in all this? Well just watch the Real Da Vinci code, which is popularly downloaded for free using your own P2P. If you want a more in-depth really eye opening books just download some underground books such as the bible fraud, the God Code, which are most of the times very interesting. Or the conspiracy surrounding the cover-up of the Dead Sea Scrolls, before a couple of really bright scholars finally found it from some ""insiders"" who leaked out thousands of those pictures for public viewing. In fact it is a LOT MORE interesting to read those Dead Sea Scrolls because many of these were almost destroyed during the preparation and writing of the bible. And a lot of it was actually omitted. Now this is a place where we can start. Or perhaps look at some underground videos on the origins of the bible where scholars actually showed an exact copy of the story of the bible coming from the pages of Egyptian lores and that was an almost exact copy from the Babylonian ones. Many will miss the point that the bible has something to hide. It doesn't, it just simply left out in history where hundreds of these books were hidden in the Dead Sea for thousands of years to protect historical knowledge from destruction. I therefore salute those who hide them.<br/><br/>In summary of the movie, don't take a salt of truth of the movie. If you want to just investigate and get yourself the movie The Real Dead Sea Scrolls or a British documentary the Real Da Vinci Code. Authors want you to believe its real, to get sales no doubt just like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Just sit back and enjoy Ron Howard film. If you haven't fallen asleep in Ron Howard's The Alamo, then you have a good chance to sit this one through."
"alfred-guernica","5","1","4","18 May 2006"," Worth seeing, but not much entertaining, a fall between two stools
","First of all I hate the critics, who are acting like this. Sometimes they are not capable of judging the movie itself. They hate the book, so the decided to hate the films. They should use good reason not bashing the book. Because the movie doesn't stand on his own. It fails to reach the level of the book. Now it is the time to ask the question: what went wrong? Everything seemed right. Good cast, good director and writer. And just all turned out wrong. I like Ron Howard, I think he is a very good director, but his latest work is very poor. He isn't very brave. He tried to make an entertaining movie and a smart, serious thriller at the same time. But it's a failure in both ways. The script is awful. It's ridiculous. To tell you the truth they're just reading out the book in some part. The action scenes are really short, although the entire movie lasts more than two hour, and it is boring in some places. As of the cast: Tom Hanks was a surprise to me. I think he's one of the best actor in Hollywood, but definitely it's his worst acting ever. Audreay Tatou was an awful choice from the beginning, Paul Bettany hasn't got a chance to act behind the make-up, Jean Reno didn't add anything special, neither did Alfred Molina, only one person did his job brilliantly: Sir Ian McKellen. He is the perfect man to play Teabing and he saved this movie. When he first appears, that's when the movie starts. The first part is very boring. There isn't any excitement, although the book was very exciting from the beginning to the end. Something missing. The dynamism and the power. It's not a bad movie at all, but it disappoints. But I have to admit that it can be a real fun and joy for those who didn't read the book, but I really doubt that the fan of the book will be satisfied after watching the movie. About the controversy: it's pathetic what the Church and the anti-DVC believers are doing. The Passion wasn't a good example for them? This controversy will be make this film into a big hit, although I'm sure that the WOM won't be good. The ending is great. And there are some good scenes, but the flashback scenes and the whole concept is just not working. The music is great, but they used it very poorly, that's why the scenes are not effective. Only the action and the dramatic scenes are poor, what else left? Find out yourselves! :)"
"PyTom83","5","1","5","11 June 2009"," Disappointing
","General consensus was that Da Vinci Code failed because it didn't live up to the book, though I've never read the book, so I'll just judge the movie on it's own merits; this was a poorly put together movie with bad pacing. The plot just felt way too rushed to be enjoyable. And Tom Hanks (who is awesome) looked completely uninterested during the entire film and that hair OMG~! I'd say it would have been better as a much longer movie, except I have a hard time saying that about a movie I found boring to begin with. If I entered an alternate reality where it had a better script and was done by a different director, I'd probably give it a chance. There was potential there.<br/><br/>Also, when I say it could have been longer, I mean it could have been stretched out some while giving the plot some room to breathe, not have another 45 minutes of plot twists thrown in.<br/><br/>The other thing I thought was dumb was when Hanks and Sophie was about to be shot by the butler, and doves fly out of no where. Seriously, did John Woo direct that portion? Though saying that, I'm very much looking forward to Angels and Demons"
"ShootingShark","5","1","5","16 May 2009"," Interesting But Self-Important And Unsatisfying Religious Conspiracy Thriller
","Robert Langdon is a visiting professor in Paris who is suddenly accused of the violent murder of a curator at The Louvre. He is rescued by a young woman, Sophie, who has a hidden connection to the case. The two go on the run from the authorities and are drawn into a shadowy world of murder, conspiracy and religious distortion <br/><br/>It's best to reveal prejudices first. I think the plot of this movie, from Dan Brown's 2003 bestseller, is pretty lame at best, and pilfered at worst. The concept of a female Last Scion descendant of Christ comes from Kevin Smith's film Dogma. The idea of Christ marrying Mary Magdalene comes from Nikos Kazantzakis' novel The Last Temptation Of Christ. The notion that the Knights Templars hid the Holy Grail in Rosslyn Chapel comes from a non-fiction book, The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail. The closest the story gets to a cinematic idea is that John the Apostle in Leonardo Da Vinci's 1497 painting The Last Supper is really Magdalene, but even that comes from yet another book, The Templar Revelation. So in terms of originality, it's right up there with Not Another Teen Movie. I haven't read the book, so maybe it works better in print, but on film it has lots of boring, talky, confusing scenes where characters argue about theological conspiracy. A woman's figure or a desert sunset may be clichéd images, but I'd much rather look at them any day of the week. There are good points though - by far the most interesting character is Silas, the self-flagellating reformed albino monk assassin, nicely played with a zealot's fervour by Bettany (check him out in Gangster No. 1), and stalwarts Reno, Molina and Prochnow pep things up a little, albeit with rather threadbare characters. McKellan strains credibility however, and edges dangerously close to camp. Crucially, there is a tremendous low-key string score by the always-reliable Hans Zimmer which lifts the whole film up, adding suspense, menace and pathos where there wasn't much to begin with. Without the music this would be an stultifying experience. Like most of Howard's films, it's too long, the action is weak, there's too much dialogue and the style is flat. There are better movies on similar subjects - John Carpenter's Prince Of Darkness or Gregory Widen's The Prophecy to name a couple. Worth a watch, but afterwards, check out Dogma as an alternative - it has just as many religious twists, but is very funny, has lots of action, terrific characters and is a total original, all lessons this movie could do well to learn."

The movie is flat and uninteresting instead of being an exciting cinematic exploration of a contemporary masterpiece. For my $8.50, it was a disappointment to say the least - it reminds me of 'Star Trek: Nemesis'; lots of unmet expectations and a waste of top-notch talent. Howard and Hanks are capable of much better work.<br/><br/>The casting is so bad I can't believe it. The albino has blue eyes and whiskers.

Sophie is green-eyed and has burgundy hair. Fache is supposed to be a guy that looks more like Danny DeVito on steroids than unshaved Tommy Lee Jones. The guy that played Fache looked totally wrong and Jack Palance should have played Teabing - totally botched. Gates McFadden should have played Sophie.. or maybe even Jennifer Connelly (with burgundy hair and green contacts).<br/><br/>The scene where Sophie is in the bathroom with Langdon is supposed to result in the authorities thinking he committed suicide - this is totally botched in the movie as is the murder scene from chapter 94 - which is supposed to occur inside a car.<br/><br/>Read the book.

Ron said loud what other think low - religion was invented to control the masses and make money...that's why this movie comes in as a revelation...and wakes people up. I liked the interview where Ron said ""this is fiction"" - it invites the audience to see it. If the Church has nothing to hide then why are they making a big fuss about it and hide behind 60feet tall walls in Vatican?"
"hitechbrad","8","1","5","23 May 2006"," Protesting?? Bible fiction?? I don't get it...
","Read this first, then listen to the audio clip that I've posted below. It's very interesting and will get you thinking.<br/><br/>There are a few things in life that really confuse me. Catholics and Christians say they were taught to accept and be tolerant to all religions and beliefs, but they spend their time protesting a movie where the author has announced that it's pure, fun fiction. How crazy is that! How can you protest something that is labeled FICTION?? Why, because even if it is fiction, they can't stand the fact that it's implying the fictional possibility that the Mona Lisa proves something they truly believe in to be completely wrong. I need someone to explain this to me and everyone else that agrees with me because it doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Seeing people protest over this movie proves one thing, people still mistaken their religious beliefs as facts. This is no different than what's going on in Iraq. Humans NEED to understand that what they study, what they pray to, is nothing more than a belief, an ideanot a fact. It's that simple. When Mel's Jesus movie hit the big screen, I wasn't sitting at the movie theater quoting scientific facts about why religion is not correct. Besides it being a complete waste of time, I realize that what I believe in is just thata belief. Plus, I respect others and their opinions. It's not my job to change their mind or be mad because they don't believe in what I do. <br/><br/>It's amazing how humans have such a hard time admitting or accepting the fact or possibility that what they believe in could be wrong. Call it ego, call it ignorance, it's almost funny. I'm surprised we were able to convince people that the world actually is round amongst many other things that science has proved which has gone against popular religious beliefs. That in itself is a huge accomplishment for mankind, not landing on the moon! :)<br/><br/>Many Catholics and Christians were angry with the 'idea' of which this movie presented. Has it occurred to anyone that the Bible could be purely fiction as well? If you truly believe that religion is just that, a belief, you must take into consideration that your beliefs, your Bible, could all be fictional and written for control and profit. I'm not religious and have many beliefs and facts that I think support my argument. However, I can't 100% prove it so therefore I acknowledge the fact that everything I believe in about life and death could also be just fiction. The problem is when people mistaken their religious beliefs or non religious beliefs as facts. No matter how much scientific data I have that I think proves most major religions to be nothing more than a form of human control and guidance, I can not 100% prove it and yes, it could all be fictional. That's why I just live my life with an open mind. I'm a good person and at night I can sleep with a clear conscious.<br/><br/>Over the years, science has proved many religious facts to be wrong, and will continue to do so for many years to come. The bible can only be edited and re-written so many times folks. I've been lucky to work with some of the most advanced technologies on earth today and I'm pretty certain the real truth about life and death in general lies somewhere within advanced mathematics. Everything in life seems to always point back to math in one way or another. Actually, the real truth about life and death is probably a lot simpler and less complicated than we think it is. But humans have always been great of making simple things very complicated (usually only for profit :) ) That's for a different discussion.<br/><br/>One quick note, my Grandfather was one of the VPs for Arthur Gallagher, insurance company of the Catholic church. Through him I discovered that Arthur Gallagher knew about the whole 'touching little boys' issue way before it ever hit main stream media, the first happening almost 20 years ago. It's amazing how long it went on before hitting mainstream media and I was informed on how powerful the Catholic church really isnow there's a scary movie! I can't grasp the idea that people can forgive child molesters and rapist as long as they ask for forgiveness from god. The only thing they can't do is not believe in God or Jesus. I don't know about you, but that sure sounds like a great form of control and brain washing. Again, that's just my BELIEF.<br/><br/>It's been amusing to see what kind of fire this movie has caused. A whole forum could be created just for this one topic. If any of you (religious or non-religious) would like to be entertained for 120 minutes, download this audio file where science and religion go head to head. It's great and well worth your time.

"Lmiklowitz","Null","1","5","22 May 2006"," This movie is definitely not boring, just bogus
","New York Times critic A. O. Scott filed one of the first reviews of this movie, from the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday the day before opening. The film was not released ahead of time to reviewers, which, by conventional wisdom, signals a turkey. Scott kvetched about how boring it was. There is no ennui. The film kept me jumping with ambushes, chases and plot twists to keep my adrenalin level high. <br/><br/>The contrasting scenes between 21st century Europe and medieval Europe in flashbacks are eye-catching. Hanks is low key, but he's usually low key, whether he's a high school teacher turned captain overwhelmed by battle and responsibility or a lone castaway on a Pacific island using assorted washed-up cargo items like a deflated basketball to keep his sanity.<br/><br/>If you want to see how bogus Dan Brown's story is, check out the History Channel this week for programs on Opus Dei, Leonardo DaVinci and other topics suggested by the story. How much more powerful this story would have been if it were more grounded in fact! And certainly a case can be made from facts in the Gnostic gospels and other sources for all that is suggested. There has to be worldwide hunger for a better understanding of the Christian mythic monopoly given how a book with such awkward writing could sell some 65 million copies."
"georom4","5","1","5","22 May 2006"," Lost In Translation
","Let me start off by saying that I DID NOT read the book. So I was expecting a masterful story-telling session of the highest order, given the success of the novel. How could you screw this up? This film was not about the characters, it was about the story and setting. Howard got the setting right, the locales were breath-taking and exquisitely shot. What was lacking however was the suspenseful buildup of the plot as it delved deeper into history's sordid past. Rule number one of a mystery drama, let the viewer take part in the detective work. Maybe Ron Howard assumed that we already knew what the clues were, and how they were going to be figured out. So the action on the screen was relegated to crappy car chases, goofy gun play, and anti-climatic near-misses. Meanwhile the mystery aspect of the film was absent (save for the best scene of the film, Teabing's lecture on The Last Supper). This script should have been sandbagged from the moment Howard looked at it. The fact that author Dan Brown allowed his story to be told this way is a blot on his artistic integrity. I guess he was laughing all the way to the bank too hard to notice that his book was being butchered.<br/><br/>Having said that, I did not hate the film. It still was more thoughtfully done than 75% of the other schlock out there. Tom Hanks, even as wooden as he was here, is still good. Ian was great. I thought Bethany was frightening but underused by the screenwriter (his face being the antithesis of humanistic Renaissance art). The Sophie character was like Hanks' character - nothing special. 2 1/2 hours is not long if the film moves briskly and keeps your interest. Gladiator was close to three hours but felt 90 minutes long. It is all in the writing. Maybe big shot directors will have greater appreciation in the future for the craft of screen writing. Without a good script, even the best actors, and best stories, will suffer"
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","5","1","5","22 May 2006"," plain and simple: not entertaining. has it's moments, but it's too long and not well directed
","First off, I am ashamed that this movie did not turn out as I had expected. The acting of Tom Hanks and the direction of Ron Howard always grabs my attention, but neither of these two entertainment giants do well in their jobs of keeping the audience interested. The film also is way too long at just under 2.5 hours. While the film does get strong performances from Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany, the film does not do a good job of keeping the audience entertained, and it is also very predictable, even if you haven't read the book, which I haven't.<br/><br/>The plot of 'The Da Vinci Code' is as follows: A murder in the Louvre leaves mysterious clues in the works of artist Leonardo Da Vinci, clues that when investigated by symbol interpreter, Robert Langdon (Hanks), and a French police officer (Audrey Tatou), could possibly change the world's view of Christianity with its groundbreaking discoveries.<br/><br/>The movie does have moments where the audience will be sickly disgusted, such as the beginning, moments of some intense action, and some dramatic moments, but one of the main problems circling the film is the fact that Howard fails to establish a true genre for the movie. Sometimes, it feels like an action/thriller, then to a suspenseful drama, then a mystery, then totally shifting gears and becoming a fantasy. This is not the fault of the writing or acting, as one of a director's many jobs is to establish a mood and feel for the film, which Howard fails to do, as much as it pains me to say this about such a wonderful director.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks seems miscast in the role of Robert Langdon, and I feel that an actor such as Ralph Fiennes or Liam Neeson would have made the role ten times better. Hanks doesn't perform to his abilities in the film, as shown when he never really seems to take control of the movie, because the whole movie circles around his investigation and findings of the mysterious clues possibly left behind by Leonardo Da Vinci. Hanks is constantly thrown around, and from what I've heard from friends, that's not what Robert is like in the book.<br/><br/>The primary supporting role is that of Audrey Tatou's character, and I must say that her character often seems expressionless and flat, which is sad, because the writing for her character is very well done. She has her opportunities to shine, but simply doesn't.<br/><br/>Now, it's time to give some good things about the film. Paul Bettany's Albino character Silas is just plain creepy, yet you can't help but be in awe of how real Paul Bettany plays the character, because he barely speaks English in the film (Silas speaks mostly French throughout the film). I really felt that Silas was in control of every scene he appears in, while Bettany still provides a good human realism to the character. Ian McKellen shines as always as Leigh, Robert's old friend and fellow clueseeker. He provides a certain amount of mystery about his character, while still keeping him charming and likable (Ian provides most of the films comedic moments). McKellen proves that he can survive any genre with class and style again, and I think that had the film been better, he could scrap an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>There are two other name actors in supporting roles, but they feel forced into the film, and the movie could have done without them. The characters played by Jean Reno and Alfred Molina are both characters that could have been divided into smaller characters. I'm not knocking Reno and Molina, as they both perform admirably, but there is really no point to their characters, especially Molina's bishop.<br/><br/>When push comes to shove, Ron Howard's direction and the acting of Tom Hanks are not up to snuff, thus being two of the elements that sink 'The Da Vinci Code'. The film gets decent supporting performances and B class writing, but other than that, this film seems lost in its own skin. The movie seems to drag on forever, and you'll find yourself sleepy after the resolution, as the denouement takes too much time. I felt severely let down.<br/><br/>5/10 --spy"

","I am tired of reading these so called ""critics reviews"", what do they know anyway?! Probably half of the ""critics"" have not even read the novel ""The Da Vinci Code"", that is my feeling anyway. I felt the movie followed the book almost to exactness, of course they had to eliminate a few parts for time sake, (the library scene etc.). I want to give a big thumbs up to Ron Howard, I felt he did a great job! The movie captivated my attention for the full 2 1/2 hrs, (not very many movies can do that). My husband enjoyed the movie and he hasn't even read the novel. Maybe personal beliefs got in the way of the ""critics reviews"" or maybe it was too complex for some critics to follow, who knows? If you are looking for a movie that makes you think and mentally follow the plot this is the movie for you! I was on the edge of my seat."
"13124293-1","6","1","5","22 May 2006"," Great Disappointment
","I could not wait for this movie to come out. I was so psyched up to see it that I had sleepless nights because of the anticipation! Imagine how I must have felt to finally take my seat in the cinema and having the lights dim...<br/><br/>I became so caught up in the thought of the movie that I completely forgot my criticism about the book! When I first read it, I thought ""WOW, what an interesting story! Pity about the predictable ""Goosebumps""-type plot, though."" I had read somewhere that Dan Brown said the film sticks very close to the novel, and boy does it ever! All the people who criticized Chris Columbus for sticking too close to the page for the first two Harry Potter movies have to be very thankful that Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman Didi't have a shot at it. For the most part, The Da Vinci code literally translates the novel from page to screen. That is, they translate the STORYLINE, in my opinion the weakest aspect of the book. The thing that kept me reading late into the night was the interesting codes being cracked and the wonderful intellectual treasure hunts around art and history.<br/><br/>Instead, we get the boring, predictable storyline that skips over the code cracking in a ""Bee Season"" type of way. Added to this, we jump so suddenly from location to location that it all just becomes a blur. Don't get me wrong, the pacing could have been quicker, but at least tell us where we are, won't you! The characters were so shallow, even though Akiva Goldsman tried (and failed) fleshing them out a bit. Quite frankly I Didi't care about one of them, except maybe Sophie, but only because I love Audrey Tautou. Tom Hanks was terribly miscast and his funny hairstyle was just plain distracting.<br/><br/>I suppose my main quibble with the film is that it was done in a very unimaginative way. This is the sort of novel that needs to be reinvented when being adapted for the big screen. Purists may want to kill me now, but honestly, why watch a movie if you don't get anything new you couldn't get in the book? Other than this, it was quite an enjoyable night out. I Didi't feel I wasted my money, but I really did expect more from (Academy Award Winner) Ron Howard. Although, I would give him another Oscar for managing to make a movie feel RUSHED and SLOW at the same time!!! That takes some doing.<br/><br/>And finally, would it have killed the cinematographer to shed a little more light on the wonderful location, the Louvre? I couldn't see any of the paintings, it was so dark! (Yes, I know it was supposed to be dark, but come on! How many people get the opportunity to shoot a $125 million movie in the Louvre?)"
"GrantKanigan","Null","1","5","21 May 2006"," Tom Hanks' Worst Film
","Let me first state that i am unbiased when i comes to religion. I also loved the amazing novel THE DA VINCI CODE by Dan Brown. What happened Ron Howard? This movie is constantly laced with dry, boring subject matter, over and under explained events, and horrible acting. Throughout the whole two and a half hours, Tom Hanks manages to crank out two expressions. Mad, in most of the film, and surprised, when he cuts himself shaving. The only saving grace in this film is the fact Ian McKellan, (unsure of spelling), lends talent and manages to juice up the boring plot and pace in this film. I think there were many things wrong with this film. Acting, directing, cinematography... overall i think the film was rushed, and maybe THE DA VINCI CODE wasn't really meant to be discovered on screen. My recommendation, spend your 10.95 on the book."

I understand that they would have to leave stuff out but they left to much out to much to write down. But not only did they leave stuff out they added a lot they added stuff like they mad it seem like Sophie was stupid or just slow not fast enough to figure things out like on the plan when see figures out Da Vinci's back words script Langdon figured it out in seconds, or that Sophie's Grand father Jacques Sauniere might not be her grand father and when she was younger he yelled at her, If Akiva Goldsman had read the book he would have known that her grandfather would never have yelled at her or that Captain Fache was highly abusive and that Bishop Aringarosa told him to find Langdon and said it was a mission from god. Or the part at the end of the book where Sophie and Langdon kiss yeah you guess it they left that out too. I'm sorry I went into this movie with a very open mind and left very disappointed this movie fails to impress anyone who has ever read the book if you have read the book please do not see this movie it sucks oh and tom hanks was not even a kinda of good Langdon"
"oceandark1184-1","10","1","5","21 May 2006"," Well done, Well thought out! Great pace!
","I wasn't too sure if I wanted to see the film. I've been sick of every film being adapted by a book or something, having no original ideas. And I was a bit surprised that it starred Tom Hanks, don't get me wrong I love him! Well I saw the film just last night and I was engaged the whole entire time. The 2+ hours flew by and it was well made. From the film stock to the editing to the effects and of course the story I loved it! I can understand why a lot of people hate it from the whole flashback sequences and of course the new thought to Christianity. But people do forget that its a story and an imitation. It's not necessary true nor false. I feel that it was an outstanding film. It was a great adventure watching these characters trying to solve a mystery. And how it just never end! of course a lot of people would hate that but I loved it. I personally did not want this film to end! I thought it was extremely well done. I feel that Tom Hanks did a great job. And I think that Ron Howard is starting to step up. The pacing was a lot better than his previous films. When I saw the reviews after seeing the film I was in complete shock. I really feel that this film is a B+/A-. You should definitely see it in the theaters! And I would buy the DVD! Give this film a try!"
"wahoowadad","10","1","5","21 May 2006"," Why do we have film critics?
","I found this movie to be outstanding. Maybe it was because my expectations were very low - but I was so pleasantly surprised. I thought Hanks pulled off Robert Langdon - even if it wasn't one of his most memorable roles. I thought the supporting cast was outstanding, and the movie was surprisingly true to the book.<br/><br/>My wife, who had never read the book, thought it was great as well. She was very intrigued by the story line, and like most people who read the book, she came home and started researching some of the basis of the movie to see how much was factual and how much was just entertainment. <br/><br/>I read an article that talked about the term ""Faction"" - a mixture of facts and fiction that make a novel more appealing. I think Mr. Brown has discovered the magic recipe for faction and will continue to thrill readers for many years.<br/><br/>Film critics do not seem to represent the American public in any way and therefor serve no purpose."

"nick_mcdougall","3","1","5","21 May 2006"," Disappointing to say the least
","I'll say right off, I haven't read the book. i tried, but found Dan Browns style of ""Langdon drove past a monument, heres a 20 page history on it"" very difficult to get into.<br/><br/>As such i went into this movie not sure what to expect. I had liked previous films done by Ron Howard, but i have hated everything written by Akiva Goldsman. the cast looked great, but the story didn't interest me. All the same i did end up seeing it the day it came out, because all the controversy and huge amount of advertising for this film had certainly been effective in building hype.<br/><br/>Unfortunately its hype that really isn't deserved. There ends up being very little to get excited over in this movie, and maybe it plays well on page, where millions of readers got hooked to this modern day holy grail quest, but translate to screen it does not.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is the characters. there aren't any. instead the film makers have given us merely a bunch of people able to recite exposition. The convoluted plot demands so much explanation, the religious mythology and art history so complicated and difficult to explain to an audience, that there's really no time left for dialog about anything else. We know Langdon is meant to be the hero, but i cant for the life of me figure out why. He doesn't really do anything heroic. he doesn't really give us any insight into his character, apart from the fact he happens to be claustrophobic, which never has any relevancy towards anything.<br/><br/>The murder from which the whole story begins seems utterly ludicrous. An old man who is part of a secret society gets shot in the stomach, and then with his final moments to live, goes all around the giant museum that is the Louvre, painting over famous art works, hiding keys, and eventually stripping off, painting a circle with his own blood and laying in the middle of it in order to recreate another famous art work. Did it not cross his mind, while he had all this ample time to... oh i don't know... call an ambulance? or even better, ring Langdon directly and just tell him the frigging mystery? it just seems ridiculous for Pete's sake.<br/><br/>In spite of this insipid plot, the cast are all pretty good. Hanks does an OK job with a non existent character. Audrey Tautou is so beautiful you will ignore the fact that she doesn't get to do anything except every now and then say ""what does this mean"" and ""what's going on?"" thus allowing the other characters to go on a giant ramble to explain the historical relevancy of just about every tiny religious detail in order for the plot to make a lick of sense. Ian McKellan is just as fantastic as everyone says, as is to be expected, and manages to have fun with each and every syllable of his clunky dialog. Jean Reno and Alfred Molina really don't get anything to do, which is unfortunate for two such excellent actors.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, there's not much going on with this film, a pulp novel adaptation that takes itself far too seriously. I found myself drifting off towards the end, because they seem to want to end the movie at at least three separate points. i wont spoil the twist but you'll understand if you see it. a disappointing effort I'm sad to say."
"Headxxhunter","10","1","5","20 May 2006"," A brilliant portrayal of a novel book!
","First, let me begin by addressing some of the negative comments made by certain critics. We must remember that, in reality, this is still a predominantly Christian country. Although the Da Vinci Code is indeed listed as FICTION, the mere fact that it undermines the church will no doubt cause a stir among the religious - and even some who aren't. That said, it is human nature to take something we don't like, and then find every possible flaw therein that we can. I believe this is why the movie has gotten so many bad reviews. People don't like the message, in fact, some hate it, so they feel the need to find fault wherevere they can, be it with the actors, the producers, or the movie as a whole. Many even go so far as to use reverse psychology on the public, making statements such as, ""I don't see how any intelligent person can find this film entertaining."" This, of course, is nothing but a meager attempt to condition the public to their beliefs simply by attacking the intelligence of the general public. In that, they create bias in people even before those people enter the theater. In my opinion, anyone interested in this movie should put aside everything they've heard from the critics, and enter the theater with an open mind. You might just be surprised! But enough of that. On to the movie!<br/><br/>Brilliant! I loved the book and, to be honest, I feared that the movie would not, or maybe could not, live up to the true ideals that Dan Brown set forth in the book. Never in my life have I been so pleased to be wrong! The movie stayed true to the book, with only a few minor details left out. The portrayal of the characters was indeed magnificent, chilling even, and I sat breathless as I watched Dan Brown's visions play out on the big screen. Not for the faint of heart, as there are some very graphic scenes, but then in order to stay true to the book, there have to be. With a wonderful cast and breath taking imagery, I have no doubt that the Da Vinci Code will remain at the top of the box office for many, MANY months! I give this movie two thumbs up. Really, I wish I had more thumbs."

It's possible that some church members may not agree with some parts in the movie. And maybe that's why the reviews were not as good as they could have been.

Nevertheless, the characters are just like i imagined when i read the book (Silas is really scary) and despite the critics that a lot of people made about the ending...that's the way the book ended, i think that Ron Howard did a great job taking this best seller to the big screen. When i heard that Tom Hanks was going to be Robert Langdon, at first i thought it would be awful, but i was wrong. He is a very talented actor, and so is Ian McKellen in the role of Sir Leigh Teabing. To conclude with this ""review"" i must say that it's worth seeing the film and you won't regret it. I'll be a hit."

","I saw the Da Vinci Code last night. The theater was completely sold out. I have to admit that I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews, but then I remembered the book got pretty much the same reviews and the book was excellent. As soon as the movie starts it brings you in, and makes you forget the people around you. I forgot that it was Tom Hanks; he became Robert Langdon to me. Some of the more controversial theories about The Virgin Mary, and the Grail story being everywhere, (even in the Little Mermaid) were left out. Some of the puzzles were also left out. None of that made a difference. The movie was exactly as I had pictured the book when I read it, and yet it was still surprising and enthralling. I didn't understand how the book could have gotten bad reviews, and I really don't understand them for the movie. It was not boring, or a snooze fest in any way. For the people who are worried the movie was derogatory to the Catholic Church or Opus Dei, I didn't see that at all. The Bishop and Silas were portrayed as fanatics, not as your everyday member. Bazu Fache was supposed to be your average member and he was an upstanding, moral and religious guy. When it came down to it, he wouldn't lie just because the Bishop asked him to, he did the right thing. I think it was at that moment that the fanaticism of Silas and Bishop Aringoza was the most obvious. The media and the Catholic Church obviously want people to believe that this movie is evil. It's really just a good movie, with a lot of interesting theories, some which can be backed up by fact, and some just supposition. I agree with Sir Ian McKellen. If their faith is so strong, why are they so afraid of this movie?"
"aharmas","7","1","5","19 May 2006"," Flawed but Not Boring At All
","After having read some of the early publicity on this film, I headed out to a screening of the film with a bit of hesitation since I expected a big, boring, convoluted mess. Add to that, the unexciting and hesitant direction of Howard in both ""Cinderella Man"" and ""The Missing"", I was ready for the worst possible experience. I was surprised when I became engrossed by a film that moved very nicely and was very faithful to its written source.<br/><br/>Most of the film is in fact, very entertaining, and it is enough of a minefield to make a few people quite nervous along the road. It keeps its central premise, which will keep people arguing over the possibilities of historical cover-up for quite a while. In fact, seeing some of the arguments, presented visually will probably have a much stronger impact than some of the prose in Brown's novel. There are some handsome flashbacks depicting some of the elements of the cover-up, and the fact that now we see the road to discovery that our leading couple must take to ""uncover"" the truth makes the experience more believable; the power of cinema is indeed great.<br/><br/>So, why does the entire experience feels a bit like we've been cheated? It's not Hanks (or his hairdo's) fault. He plays his role very well, and his co-stars are delightful because their characters are for a change well developed. Another positive aspect of the film is the fact that Howard's direction is this time more on target, allowing us to relish the moments where witty, intellectual exchanges are happening. Academics can be proud that their depiction in the film makes them look like real people who seem to know their subject matter. McKellen's character is memorable because there he is fully dimensional, not the collaboration of a research group who is trying to appeal to as many possible teenagers in an opening night. It was truly refreshing to see a film where scenes were framed and the camera-work wasn't the result of an appeal to an ADD-afflicted audience or filmmaker. Watching a thriller where we see what is ""happening"" on the screen is more effective that quick cuts that are trying to give us an illusion of action and poorly executed attempts at being clever.<br/><br/>There are some problems in the last third of the film, where we are witnesses to some rather upsetting liberties taken by Mr. Goldman who couldn't leave its good source material alone. It is distressing to see how some of the ends were ""quickly"" tied at the end, an some of the resolution has taken a turn that was apparently tacked on to push more buttons but look more superfluous than anything else. Goldman was either experiencing a lack of confidence in the strength of Brown's subtle ending, or maybe he was looking to showcase his talents as an adapter who can't leave the integrity of the source alone. Do we really need to see more of ""followers"" there at the Chapel? Wasn't her performance strong enough? Also, what in the world is going with the dynamics of the relationship of the members of the radical order? It is especially in this section where we question the integrity of a filmmaker who can't handle controversy...<br/><br/>The film works mostly because it does serve an intelligent thriller with a premise that might open up interest in looking back at history and ourselves for sign of sorely missed intelligence in contemporary films that ironically seem of to be of anything else but intellligence. ""The Da Vinci Code"" gives us proof that there is still some true talent in Hollywood, that it believes good acting can still make a film a success. It is time we go back and revisit good, old fashioned screen writing, competent use of technical effects in both visual and computerized craftmanship to serve the whole, instead of just overpadding the film with flashy visual and sound effects, that end up becoming the center of attention. Here technology serves a purpose, other than numbing our common sense, our brains, and our abilities to enjoy intellectual questions.<br/><br/>The film has a tough road because it needs to appeal to those who read the novel, and those didn't but wonder what the hoopla is all about. Maybe there will be a succession of related theme projects, and let's welcome them if they induce a little thinking from our side, and hopefully it prods the so called Hollywood crowd to move away from pure marketing to what is required from those who want to be recognized as true artists in the medium."

"yourbigpalal83","7","1","5","19 May 2006"," A Mixed bag.
","After seeing a early screening of the DA Vince code, i was left with mixed feelings.<br/><br/>After reading only the beginning of the book (due to my library demanding it back because of its popularity) i only knew the story up to the point of the ex cape from ""The Bull"".<br/><br/>The film, on the other hand, although faithful to the book, is a mixed bag. In parts it excels and really gets you thinking about THE POSABILITY, in other parts, it fails to convince me, even just for story wise, of the main plot line.<br/><br/>Having only read part of the book, its hard to compare the too.<br/><br/>But i did find it very predictable. SPOILERS AHEAD: DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO REMAIN SPOILER FREE About 20 minuets into the movie, i knew that Sophie was the decedent of Christ and that Teabring was the teacher. The moment they arrived at his home, i automatically knew, simply from his obsession. Also, the confrontation on the plane between Sophie and Silas cemented my suspicion that Sophie was not the protector of the secrete, but the secrete herself with the words ""Every breath you take is a sin"".<br/><br/>END SPOILER Overall, the film, although entertaining, is long, and drags on in a lot of places. i simply loved the history visual effect, of how when they went to the church in London, they had the past mixed with the future, an image i saw in my minds eye many a time when i went to a historical place. It was almost odd seeing something for real that had only been in my minds eye, and it actually living up to the image of the mind But, overall, the plot itself, the whole Christ is married, etc, didn't really sell it to me. Sure, there is theories, and its not completely imposable, but, i just don't understand to this day, what the big deal is if he did have a child. Why cant he be the son of god and still be a man? Idk, i guess people need to believe only what they want to, and feel threaten if they might be wrong.<br/><br/>Overall, its a odd film, mealing its great in parts, and lame in others. I guess its worth checking out, but i don't know for sure if it will receive a home on my DVD shelf of honor (as i like to call it) when it hits DVD."

"Danusha_Goska","1","1","6","26 May 2006"," Paging Dante: A New Circle of Hell, Please, for Cinematic Sin
","Did Ron Howard direct this movie with the aid of a seeing-eye dog? ""The Da Vinci Code"" is set in stunning locales in France, England, and Scotland. It may as well have been set in a closet. How could a director spend so much time in Gothic cathedrals and make them appear visually dull? Stained glass windows, flying buttresses, vaulted ceilings - did Howard even register these? Howard doesn't just drop the ball with Christian art. The Nike of Samothrace, perhaps the single most thrilling sculpture ever to emerge under the hands of an artist, serves as backdrop for one scene. Howard does absolutely nothing with it.<br/><br/>The bad reviews for Ron Howard's ""The Da Vinci Code"" are not the result of a Vatican conspiracy. ""The Da Vinci Code"" presents its audience with a timeless, diabolical mystery. How do you take one of the most riveting, page turning novels of all time, jam packed with controversial propositions, and turn it into a bore? As a Catholic, I was prepared to be offended; as a scholar, I was prepared to scoff at cheap, pop, historical revisionism. Instead, I am outraged that this movie paralyzed me with boredom.<br/><br/>Reviews criticized the film as talky. I don't have a problem with talky films; I do have a problem with ineptitude. For all the guns and plots and threats on screen, the movie lacks a single moment of real thrill.<br/><br/>I kept thinking of Stanley Donen's 1963 Cary Grant - Audrey Hepburn film ""Charade."" Like ""The Da Vinci Code,"" ""Charade"" is set in Paris, it involves a mystery hiding in plane sight that people kill over, and a suave man and a beautiful woman thrown together in a perilous effort to solve the mystery, before they are killed. ""Charade"" makes you feel as if you are actually in Paris. It wrings that setting as if it were a dishcloth. The chemistry between Grant and Hepburn snaps, crackles, and pops. ""The Da Vinci Code"" doesn't present a single moment with ""Charade's"" magic.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" also never manages to convey the deadly menace the protagonists face. Its hairbreadth escapes and creaky plot points strain credulity. There is a scene where a woman confronts the masochist, albino, monk assassin - you know the type - who has murdered her grandfather. The scene is meant to be heavy; it is just plain silly.<br/><br/>So much for ""The Da Vinci Code"" as a movie. How about as a sociological artifact? This much is clear: the movie hates Catholics. Catholics, here, are masochistic self flagellators, spooky, world manipulating conspirators, and are, as said in so many words, responsible for all human strife everywhere and throughout time. One has to ask, Why was such a weirdly bigoted movie made? Why devote so much time and energy to calumniating Catholicism? Could a similar mainstream American movie be made stating just as baldly that a conspiracy of Jews are responsible for all strife, or a conspiracy of Muslims? The answer, clearly, is no.<br/><br/>One thing that is not going on is what the movie claims it is all about. ""The Da Vinci Code"" presents itself as a defense of women who have been under assault by the Catholic Church. Virtually all of the main and minor characters of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" though, are, as is standard in Hollywood blockbusters, male. Again, as is standard, there is one female, she is young, she is attractive, she is tiny, she wears a short skirt and high heels while running away from bad guys who menace her, into the arms of good guys who rescue her. If this is Dan Brown's or Ron Howard's idea of how to rescue Catholic women, I'm ready to become a nun.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" tells some very big lies about church history. Read Rodney Stark and Anne Jensen on women in the early Christian church, read Lyndal Roper on the truth of the witch hunts, read Cynthia Eller on the pure nonsense that this film sells about women's status in pre-Christian Paganism. There will be a quiz. Don't worry. Taking the quiz will be more fun than watching ""The Da Vinci Code."""
"flyingsoap","9","1","6","20 May 2006"," Superior to it's source material.
","Having heard about this book constantly for more than three years, and seeing that a film version was in production with a slew of my favorite actors, I finally decided to read it about a month ago. While it was a decent way to spend a boring afternoon, it was nothing beyond that. I found all the characters (with the exception Lieutenant Collet) trite and shallow, most especially Silas and Bishop Aringanosa. What annoyed me most about the book is a problem I see with a large number of thrillers; while the plots are usually decent, no thriller writer can write worth a penny. Dan Brown is better than most, but his character development and ear for words are about as good as a Special Ed high schoolers. The movie, while flawed, rose quite a bit above it's source novel. <br/><br/>As far as the lead goes, Robert Langdon may be Tom Hanks' weakest bit of acting since ""Joe vs. the Volcano,"" but even a lackluster performance from Hanks is a cut above most of what you'll see for until Oscar season. It was a horribly flat role, and Hanks managed to put at least a bit of life into it.<br/><br/>As for Audrey Tatou, a decent job, but I had trouble adjusting to seeing her in a thriller, having gotten used to her in films such as ""Amelie."" Still, she was a believable Sophie, though that role could have gone to almost any young women that could have faked a french accent (or had a real one, as the case is here.) Mms. Nouveau was not quite as an empty character in the book as Langdon, but very close. <br/><br/>Sir Ian McKellan, however, was brilliant, as he was clearly having the time of his life playing the eccentric Grail historian, Sir Leigh Teabing; clever, crafty, witty, Brown seemed to have written the character with Sir Ian in mind. One of the better characters in the novel, McKellan almost steals the movie.<br/><br/>However, that distinction goes to Paul Bettany, as the fanatical albino monk Silas. In the novel, Silas comes off as sort of a rampaging bull, or something of that nature; Bettany seems more like a great white cat, tense, coiled, ready to attack and kill at any given moment.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is decent, at worst (Jean Reno was especially notable,) and the directing is about what I've come to expect form Howard; over-dramatic, but decent over-all. As far as the plot goes, well, we all know what it's about.<br/><br/>While not the best or most intelligent movie of the year so far, much of the flak this film is receiving seems undeserved, probably coming from people who were hoping that Brown's glorified scavenger-hunt could become a Best Picture contender. Of course they were disappointed. But it is a well-paced thriller, with a (to some) fascinating conjectural background of ""what ifs"" and ""whys"" throughout history."
"CAFoxAgt","9","1","6","20 May 2006"," Boring? I think not!
","I do read what critics have to say, I just don't give their reviews much credence. Thank goodness for my bullheadedness! The early reports from the Cannes Film Festival was that this brilliant film was boring and Tom Hanks miscast. My question to those critics: what film did you see??? I have not read the book...one of the few out here who hasn't, I suppose. I'm a novelist myself and working on two books, so reading Dan Brown's novel just didn't fit in. I did, however, fit in the film on opening day. I'm glad I did. ""The Davinci Code"" was certainly not boring, nor did any of the cast seem out of place in their actors' skins. I found the pacing quite adequate, perhaps a little rushed in a couple of places, but felt comfortable on the whole. Tom Hanks was a brilliant choice for Langdon, as were the rest. I love mysteries and this one was wonderful. Ron Howard is one of our best directors today; I'd like to get him to produce and direct an adaptation of my book! Who wouldn't?? I don't like to give too much away, but I guess most people already know at least the premise of this story. I will say, people's faith in what they believe will not be shattered. If it is, I suspect their faith wasn't much to begin with. I, myself, believe in spiritual things, not religion. I do profess to believe in Jesus...by the way, his last name is not Christ; Christ means King from the Greek...as divine and totally deserving of my belief in Him. And if He did marry Magdelagne...her name was not Mary and she was not a prostitute...and had a child, more power to them. What's wrong with that? Why should that knowledge diminish His impact on the world? Religion gets in the way. One can believe without interference from the church. I have friends who are Catholic, and others who are recovering Catholics. I am not, nor have I ever been. However, I did attend cathecism with a friend one summer because she had to go. I found it stimulating but I had lots of questions. The teachers, nuns, were not intimidating,probably because I wasn't Catholic! The experience did start me questioning a lot, but I never stopped believing in my own spirituality. To anyone reading this, my humble opinion, I urge you to go see this movie. See it with an open heart and open mind. <br/><br/>Thanks!"
"carter-62","8","1","6","20 May 2006"," Entertaining and politically meaningful
","I'm something of a fan of Howard's films. Even though he is not a brilliant auteur, he rarely disappoints, and always achieves a high level of visual interest and coherence of story line. I figured that the Da Vinci Code would pose little difficulty because as many have pointed out, the book was written as a screenplay.<br/><br/>The showing room was empty when we arrived, ten minutes before the showing, and it didn't fill up very much. The opening weekend may be a Guinness record setter for low opening weekend revenues if last night was any indication. People in the audience were commenting that they had seen few viewers exiting from the 6:45 showing, either.<br/><br/>Well, I am just dim and gullible enough to write a defense of this film, which did not disappoint me. First, it is really an exciting story, packed with surprises even for one who read the book. As one who hopes to spend more time there in years to come, I was excited to see Paris as an implicit character, via the portrayals of the local constabulary (Jean Reno), the ambient sounds of Paris at night, and some wonderful photography of the Louvre. Reno, Paul Bettany, Alfred Molina, and Ian McKellen are perfectly cast, and I thoroughly enjoyed their performances. I am not an especially big fan of Tom Hanks, but his presence enhanced my appreciation of him. Audrey Tatou is magical.<br/><br/>Had there never been an issue raised about blasphemy; had the film been made from a screenplay and not from a book everybody had read; it might be seen as a triumph of the genre. None of those conditions obtain, however, and this film does make a profound statement about Christianity. No doubt about it. Even though many critics have commented that the message is muted, it is not. The film is unmistakably blasphemous in the eyes of many self-respecting Christians. Which is why I liked it as much as I did. It deals with the issues in such a forthright manner that wider exposure to the ideas would be of great benefit.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen's description if Da Vinci's Last Supper is marvelously convincing, and as myth, his account has the virtue that it explains the historical and corrosive anti-feminism of the Roman Church in a way that requires little further explanation. It is a myth that I can and do embrace."
"missmascotto","9","1","6","20 May 2006"," Why The Poor Reviews?
","Perhaps the movie critics did not read through or enjoy the novel The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. Perhaps they disagreed with its controversial ideas and their closed-mindedness resulted in a total lack of appreciation. However, I believe that as ""It's A Wonderful Life"" received poor reviews and later became a masterpiece, so too will The Da Vinci Code capture the hearts of anyone who is truly a fan of the book.<br/><br/>Critics are commenting that this film is lacking in action. I beg to differ. The Da Vinci Code offers almost as much excitement as the novel. Its action lies not only in the main plot but in the discussions between the characters. Although there were some parts of the novel that I thoroughly enjoyed that were either left out or cut short, Ron Howard cannot possibly be expected to provide his viewers with the same amount of information that was presented by Brown. This is, after all, a movie that lasts only two and a half hours.<br/><br/>As for Tom Hanks being ""miscast"" in the role of Robert Langdon, perhaps this is partially true. Although I am a great fan of Hanks' work, he stands out as one of the true Hollywood celebrities whose lives many know and read about in the daily tabloids. Most of the other characters, with a few exceptions (Ian McClellan and Paul Bettany) are faces we have seen before but in much less significant or well-known roles. Hanks stands out to the viewer as the A actor and we naturally place higher expectations on his shoulders. It was initially difficult for me to view him as Robert Langdon but I left the theater a thrilled customer.<br/><br/>I challenge anyone who is contemplating about whether or not to see this film to be his or her own critic. Do not rely on movie reviewers. Instead, be open-minded and judge for yourself. If you are truly a fan of Brown's work, you will likely walk away with a feeling of true satisfaction."

","The trouble with making a movie out of book so wildly popular as The Da Vinci Code is that we all knew (just knew!) it'd have problems. Detractors will lambaste it for the pages of the novel that had to be cast aside for the sake of film time (the movie is still 2 hours and 29 minutes, though) and any changes to characters or plots (all of which have happened.) But when you transfer a book to film, a certain amount of trust has to go to the screenwriters; a level of trust that basically says, ""Please don't screw this up! But give us a good story that'll engage film audiences!"" I've read The Da Vinci Code and I must say that the book was interesting, but I felt it didn't live up to the hype surrounding it. I was continually astounded to see it on the best seller list month after month after month. I kept asking myself, ""Did I miss something? Was it really THAT good?"" Maybe. Either way, however, I approached this film with a fairly high level of trepidation. ""Will the movie be over-hyped, too?"" I'm happy to say that this is an adequate film (thus my thumbs up rating.) But I don't believe it'll stay in theaters as long as the book stayed on the best seller lists.<br/><br/>The film DOES follow the book surprisingly well. Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He's in Paris autographing his latest book when a police officer approaches and asks him to come to the Louvre. Once there, Mr. Hanks discovers that a murder has taken place. A curator that Mr. Langdon was supposed to meet that night was murdered and his body desecrated. But it appears the dead curator desecrated his own body. But why? Sophie Neveu, a young detective played by Audrey Tautou, arrives at the scene and soon Mr. Langdon's life begins to unravel. Trapped by the French police, a murder investigation in which he is the prime suspect, a secret society of ultra-worshippers known as the Opus Dei, and a group of Templar Knights in hiding, Robert Langdon is quickly whisked into a life of puzzle solving in order to find a secret that could unravel Christianity as we know it.<br/><br/>Much controversy surrounded the film before its release. The main controversy was from albinos. Amazingly I heard nothing from this group while the book was out, but now that the film is here, they've emerged from the woodwork. Why? I'll let you all think about that one on your own.<br/><br/>There have been complaints, too, that the film is ""too slow to get going"" or that Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou gave wooden performances. I didn't see that.<br/><br/>I will complain about Tom Hanks in this role, however. I'm sure Ron Howard and he work together comfortably after their previous collaborations from SPLASH to APOLLO 13. But I just couldn't swallow Mr. Hanks as the prime character. There was zero chemistry between him and Mrs. Tautou, and his long hair was well nasty looking (like it needed a good washing.) He's getting up there in age and I think Clive Owen or some other up-and-coming actor would've been a wiser choice. My two-cents"
"rickfly-1","6","1","6","19 May 2006"," No Suspense
","Did you read the movie? Well, now you can see the book!! There's only one problem: Reading the book is just one giant spoiler for the movie now isn't it? It was for myself anyhow. But, then again, I guess I didn't let that matter, I threw down my eight and a half bucks anyway, so I can't really complain.<br/><br/>I'm with a lot of people in agreement over the casting (or miscasting of the film). I've always enjoyed Tom Hanks' work, and have no impartiality to him whatsoever. He's just not right for Robert Langdon, long hair or no. Same goes for Ian McKellen, another outstanding actor, again though, not quite right. Heads up though for Audrey Tautou. I'll watch her in anything.<br/><br/>In the end, was it worth it? Hmmmmmm....... Maybe I'll read the movie, uh, book, again and see."

","I must admit, before walking in to see The Da Vinci Code, I was a little nervous. After checking up on other reviews they were nothing but bad reviews.<br/><br/>Tonight My girlfriend and I went to watch the film and after reading the book, I was hoping that the film could live up to the expectations of the fantastic book by Dan Brown. Now a lot of people have been highly critical of the film and I think that they have got it all wrong right from the beginning. The book itself has come under unnecessary criticism. Hanks and McKellen were great together in their scenes, and their conversations of the grail were fantastic and great to watch.<br/><br/>The film is a good mystery but it does lack in a few areas, but after watching the film both my girlfriend and I agreed that the film was brilliant.<br/><br/>8/10 - Not as good as the book, but it's a great film."

","The Da Vinci Code reminded me that cinema audience's today there have the intelligence of gnats. This is a good movie, despite what the critics say - I haven't read the book but I do know the basics and to my knowledge was an intelligent and thought provoking outing at the cinemas, for once. It's a clever film that raises a lot of questions. It was epic adventure and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was.<br/><br/>Whether or not any of it is true is really irrelevant. This is fiction, it's a film and the controversy that surrounds it is ridiculous. For anybody to turn their backs on their faith after viewing this film means one thing. Obviously their faith wasn't that strong to begin with.<br/><br/>This was not the greatest story ever told, nor did it claim to be yet the expectations for this film were out of the ballpark and it was destined to disappoint after the success of Dan Brown's best-selling novel. Keep in mind everybody has an opinion and in this film's case, everybody has his or her own agenda because the subject matter is deemed so ""controversial"".<br/><br/>See it for yourself and decide for yourself. Whether you believe or you don't, neither version of the ""truth"" can truly be approved or disproved and that's the beauty of this film, it's got everyone talking."
"ryan-c","9","1","7","20 May 2006"," Faithful to Novel
","I saw the movie today expecting to be disappointed. I had read many negative comments from reviewers and individuals who posted on movie sites and was curious how I would feel after seeing it.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was very faithful to the story. (Yes, I read the book....three times). There are a few minor changes in the storyline but none that changed the quality of the story. Overall, I thought it was an excellent movie and, judging by the comments I heard from many that were around me, they felt the same.<br/><br/>I wanted to address some of the negative comments I've read. One of the comments I've read often is how awful Tom Hanks was with the dialog. I'm not sure what people were expecting but Hank's character of Robert Langdon is not some James Bond-ish type of character. He is an innocent drawn into the plot and that is the way Hanks played him. Very matter of fact and little emotion. Another comment I read was the poor chemistry between Hank's character and Audry Tautou's character Sophie Neveu. There was no chemistry between the characters in the novel until the end and at no time was it an overwhelming romantic interest. Oh, it may have been hinted at in the book but nothing obvious. Another gripe was that the dialog was poor all the way around. I know there was a lot of dialog about the meaning of the Grail, etc. but that had to be in there. People that have not read the book would have no idea what was going on if the premise of the book was not discussed. Yes, there were stupid lines like at the end with Hanks saying ""Godspeed"" but gimme a break, it didn't detract from the entire movie. Long movie? Yes...it was. But Brown was not just writing an action novel. He was writing about something that has been debated for 2,000 years and which most people are totally ignorant of (i.e., what the Holy Grail may really be). So if the movie was going to be faithful to the story, there's not a lot that could be cut out and still have the story make sense.<br/><br/>So, that's my two cents. If you want to see it, go see it. I think that people who are open-minded will enjoy it. Those who can't imagine a Christianity in any other way that what the Church has taught for 1,600 years might as well skip it. You'll hate it. Ignore the negative comments....take a look for yourself."

","After seeing the Da Vinci Code on opening night and waiting for an hour for tickets, i had a preconceived notion it would be your typical Hollywood drama. Yet, it left me alone in the theater (my friend walked out) pondering over the answers to the Code. The bad reviews are based on critics' emotional cry for a more fulfilling movie. I say do not be fooled. Don't get me wrong, there were clear places where the movie lacked what the book had, but for a full length motion picture, Da Vinci Code was spectacularly done. If you read the book, you may or may not be disappointed, look for the cinematic touches to Dan Brown's work. Great movie, better book."
"keefmoons","10","1","7","20 May 2006"," What movie were the critics reviewing?
","After reading the critics' less-than-stellar reviews for ""The DaVinci Code"", I found myself troubled. I'd been waiting for this movie from the moment I heard it was being casted, and if it turned out to be, well, crap, I knew I'd never quite get over the blow. So I saw the movie, opening night, expecting...not much.<br/><br/>And boy, were the critics ever wrong.<br/><br/>""The DaVinci Code"" was awesome on every level of awesomeness (I'm sixteen, hence the use of words like ""awesomeness""). The movie clocked in at about 2 hours, 30 minutes, but I've never had a quicker two hours go by. I have read the original novel about 6 times (having a lot of time on my hands) and must say that, overall, the film was quite true to the book. Several things have been changed (including the ending), but none of those changes are major and none of them change the overall plot and resolution.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book yet, do yourself a favor and first read Dan Brown's novel. You can't properly enjoy the movie until you have the story in your head. Then treat yourself to a wonderful movie, and don't listen to the naysayers! ""The DaVinci Code"" is well on its way to being one of the great movies of the summer of '06."
"kerryellen","10","1","7","20 May 2006"," True to the book
","After reading the book, which was excellent..I could not put it down..I was wondering what the movie would be like, whether it deviated from the original story and changed characters etc like a lot of ""made into a movie"" movies. I was absolutely thrilled to see that Ron Howard stuck to the original plot and made an excellent piece of 'fiction' come alive. The locations were fantastic, the acting was great, especially Silas, although to me Paul Bettaby made his first mark in another Howard movie ""A beautiful Mind"". Howard's choice of cast is extraordinary as I can now, after seeing the movie, remember the book and can see all the actors from the movie.On every entrance of each character I knew immediately who they were. As for the content, it is a thriller, a piece of fiction surrounded by real events and locations.And being raised as a catholic myself I am sure the great religion can withstand such a movie. It has survived more damaging threats over the eons, I am sure Dan Brown does not have them shaking in their 'holy' boots. I don't know what these other critics expect from a movie. Some critique like they reviewing the ten commandments or the constitution. For goodness sake, it is just a movie to entertain us and a lot of people worked very hard to present it to us, that's how they earn their living, so lets keep everything relative. Once again congratulations to Ron Howard, his cast and crew, you all did a great job."
"Gypsybelle","10","1","7","19 May 2006"," Superb Film! Don't listen to the Brain Dead Critics!
","I'm really surprised at some of the ratings for this wonderful film! The Da Vinci Code is long, but it kept my attention the entire time. It is a thought provoking journey into aspects of our religious 'history' that I had already had visions of my own about. Could be just fiction - but the revelations in the book and film could be more...I have no doubt in my mind that the Catholic Church (indeed ALL organized religious sects) have kept many secrets from us over the generations; whatever it takes to control the masses. I'm not saying that what Dan Brown wrote is true, but it sure makes an interesting premise! I saw the C+ ratings, I didn't bother to see where those film critics and users got that breakdown, because they are all way off target. This film is one that the viewer has to really sit and think about - and pay attention to. It's not a wham bam bang em up action adventure flick. It forces you to really watch and listen. It is certainly not boring. I had not read the book before seeing the movie, but I do intend to go buy it and read it now. The filmography is deliberate and beautiful, the music fits the scenes. The cast was well chosen for their parts. Maybe watching this film was just too much work for some of the critics and other viewers? We've gotten so lazy with the mindless junk that many film makers and television networks throw at us most of the time. Dan Brown definitely did his homework in order to put together this masterpiece! Ron Howard did a fabulous job directing and the acting was superb! Just keep an open mind and don't see this film expecting a whole lot of non-stop action. There is enough action and suspense to make you flinch occasionally, but mostly, it's a story being told so you do have to put your mind and imagination to work. Is that too hard for you to do?"
"Rabit31082","10","1","7","19 May 2006"," Captivating and very mysterious
","Out of all of the movies I've ever seen, plot aside, this was one of the most well written. The plot is like a very complicated knot at first, which is very skillfully unraveled throughout the movie. Although you may have figured out towards the beginning, you never are really sure you've figured it out because the movie has a seemingly endless series of twists, turns, and loops that leave you surprised after each. A murder turns into a rush to solve a code, which turns into a quest where the end result could reveal the biggest cover-up ever. The code itself is extremely clever, in Da Vinci fashion its a true oxymoron, its so simply complex.<br/><br/>The movie itself also did not skimp on earing its PG-13 rating, especially parts such as the monk chastising himself with the chain and the whip. Although such parts may have been disturbing to a certain degree, they really helped to set the tone of the movie. I mean, who would doubt that a man who flogged himself daily in the name of God would kill to get a holy artifact. It made it much more believable and added to the sombre and mysterious atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>The only possible fault with the movie was the somewhat cliché ending. We find out that the Holy Grail is actually a woman... so naturally the main character who is female turns out to be a descendant of Jesus and Mary Magdelene (original Holy Grail) and thus a Holy Grail herself. However, this cliché ending is saved by the movie overall. In the beginning, I had my suspicions but the many twists in the plot had me seriously doubting, and in some cases believing I was all wrong, until the very end.<br/><br/>In order to really enjoy this movie, especially Christians, you must have an open mind about such things. If you go in thinking ""Nope, such and such is what happened and nothing else can possibly be true"" then the point of the movie is lost on you. You have to admit, many of the consequences pointed out are eerily plausible. Not to say that Mary Magdelene is buried under the Louvre museum, but such things as the ancient symbols for male and female and the painting of The Last Supper by Da Vinci could be entirely true. However It makes you wonder exactly how far people would go to keep a secret which would ensure their continued power.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was a top shelf choice for the open minded intellectual, but for many teenagers who are simply looking for a comedy or a good gore fest, the Da Vinci Code is neither comical nor gory. However, it's sequel (should there be one) could indeed be gory, because the implications of such an upset in Christianity would no doubt lead to much violence, as past upsets in the Catholic Church have seen."
"allstar52389","9","1","7","19 May 2006"," I loved it!
","I personally loved the movie! I don't understand why it's getting so much negativity. Sure its long, but people who say its boring must have ADD. They took the time to fully explain the religious symbology and history behind it all. They didn't throw in some quick two-minute summary without offering the viewer and depth to it. The only thing that bugged is that with any controversial claim made, there was always someone there to make a rebuttal. I guess that appeals to those who disprove of the movie and its proposed theories.<br/><br/>The acting was very good. Ian McKellen played his part perfectly, and then some. He lite up the screen with his part. Audrey Tautou was also amazing, playing her part perfectly. Jean Reno played Fache extremely well. Many have said that Hanks as Langdon was a bad choice, but I thought he pulled it off just fine. I saw the trailer before reading the book, so I had Hanks in my mind already. I think he's a great Langdon.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie was, I thought, really good. They switch away to other events happening, yet do it at perfect times. Everyone gets enough screen time, and the plot is layed out for everyone to understand. Overall, this movie was amazing. Sure, not as good as the book, but a great movie. Don't listen to critics, don't let reviews stop you from seeing this. I encourage everyone to see it, especially if you liked the book."

What is wrong with What if? I very much was against the passion movie because I felt it was too bloody and insulting and trash from Mel Gibson. This is a movie from a book that has sold 45,000,000 copies and if you are looking to be entertained for 2 1/2 hours, that is what you will get. The talk after the movie by all of the people in the theater was extremely interesting as the most common thought I heard was. What is the controversy that is so upsetting to the church? It is a movie based on what if? How many people out there have ever wondered if Jesus had a child? How is anyone to know the answer. There is nothing written about Jesus until 70 years after his death. Not one eyewitness took the time to write, draw, scribble or anything about his life. It is all stories made up just as the bible was. The Romans sat and made up rules and regulations and it was just like a senate hearing. So go and have a great time and have an open mind. It is only a movie."

","i just had the chance to watch the movie at the Cannes opening, and being in the company of the crew in such an amazing room usually puts you in a positive mood. I was interested, also, because I think i'm one of the few ones that have not read the book! Hey, I do like reading, but tried a few pages and it's really not my style. I thought this little introduction was necessary.<br/><br/>So, what about the movie, now? Cinematography is quite stunning - camera movements and sceneries are just beautiful. Editing is slightly conventional, but feeds a good rhythms. Acting is not overwhelming, with the exception of maybe of Bettany - but that's because of the nature itself of the story - a running puzzle-solving thriller. Surprises are frequent (at least if you have not read the book, i guess), only sometimes easy to anticipate. So far, quite good.<br/><br/>What really did not impress me, then? Well, the plot is slightly weak - the ""codes"" are not very amazing (actually i found the ""code"" part very disappointing). The history about Opus Day and Priory of Sion (not going to reveal anything about that) is interesting, but the film does not manage to pin it down to its real value, as the action is taking away too much of the attention. The characters are onlt OK, missing some deepness, lacking moments of weakness, ambiguity; really not all-round.<br/><br/>All in all, a couple of hours of entertainment, a theory about Church which is worth listening (but please, it's only a movie, don't make too much noise out of it!!!), deceiving enigmas which are more of an excuse to show different nice locations, good actors a little underexploited by only OK characters."

Didn't feel the film was too long, in the sense that it had no unnecessary or indulgent bits. I think those who haven't read the book will enjoy it even more, and will be inspired to read the book.

It stayed very true to the events in the book, bar a few things, but it's always hard to stay true to books. Every time a clue came that I already knew about, my heart would go racing again, although I already knew what was going to happen. The locations were exactly as I pictured them while reading the book. Tom Hanks is a wonderful Langdon, he acted the part very well. The lovely Audrey Tatou made an absolutely stunning Sophie, and I can't wait to see her in more movies. I believe she's sure to be a star after The DaVinci Code. Ian McKellen, I can never have enough praise for this wonderful man. At first, I didn't think he fit the part, but after a while it grew on me. Jean Reno, another great actor, was also fantastic. The book started the controversy, and now the movie will truly bring it out into the world, so that all will know the two sides, and will be able to decide for themselves what they truly believe.

I can't see why anyone would not enjoy the movie, especially if one has read the book. Ron Howard did an excellent job and the movie was not too talkative as was said continuously. It was suspenseful, intellectual, provocative and excellent. Tom Hanks was not at his best, but he was very good. The book and movie are both fiction. That has never been refuted by Dan Brown or anyone. It is meant to be fiction. It's obvious that many right-wing Christians are going to be in upheaval over this movie, even though at the end of the movie that even if it were true, all the events, it would not make Christianity false. When Mel Gibson, who is an extremely prejudice person and an extreme Christian made The Passion of the Christ, not many people were up in arms about it. Jewish people were not staging protests. Plus, that movie was supposed to be Nonfiction. The only reason this movie is taking so much heat is because of who it could offend, even though a fiction piece should not offend everyone. Somebody always has to complain? See the movie, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or not, you'll appreciate what a story it is, and that's all it is, a story."

","Far too many people are feeling insulted by this book/movie. I am a Roman Catholic, but am not in the least bit offended by The Da Vinci Code.

This is not true. If people would only open their eyes and look on the spine of the book, they would see the word ""FICTION"" clearly printed on it. I think Dan Brown explains it best: ""The Da Vinci Code is a novel and therefore a work of fiction. While the book's characters and their actions are obviously not real, the artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals depicted in this novel all exist (for example, Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings, the Gnostic Gospels, Hieros Gamos, etc.). These real elements are interpreted and debated by fictional characters. While it is my belief that some of the theories discussed by these characters may have merit, each individual reader must explore these characters' viewpoints and come to his or her own interpretations. My hope in writing this novel was that the story would serve as a catalyst and a springboard for people to discuss the important topics of faith, religion, and history."" So basically, if you don't like the book/movie because you think it preaches facts that disrespect your religion, then I suggest you lighten up and learn to be more open minded to other perspectives and interpretations. And again, it's fiction. Once more to clarify, fiction means NOT TRUE! Read the book, see the film. Both are spectacular."

","I have just returned from the cinema after watching Ron Howard's ""Da Vinci Code"" and would like to say that a lot of the criticisms of the film aren't actually aimed at the film they seemed instead to be aimed at the adaptation from book to movie. Having read the book on a number of occasions I was well aware of the story and had already built up an idea of what the story might look like, feel like sound like etc through my imagination whilst reading the story. Now what has happened with The Da Vinci Code is something that is quite rare in the film world... and this is it, everyone from film journalists to my little sister are a critic! Because this film is based on one of the most widely read and talked about books of our time it means that the story, characters etc. already hold a part in our lives. And so when a movie comes out about a book which has fascinated and intrigued so many people then it is only natural that a lot of people aren't going to be able to go and watch this film without pre conceived ideas and emotions. As a film I thought it was very good. I go to the cinema to be entertained, to be questioned and to look at films aesthetics. And on that basis I found this film (not book) to be very entertaining, very interesting (it got me and my friends talking about things other than the football etc!) and I felt that on the most part the film had a very nice feel and look about it. Unfortunately as I have mentioned this film will never and to a lot of people should never be seen as just a film. It is a story that is obviously linked to an existing story- Dan Browns ""The Da Vinci Code"" A book that touched millions of people, and is of course linked to another great story- Christianity. And a lot of people won't accept the film without also thinking of the book. And another thing that a lot of these people won't understand (and I included those single minded journalists who were at the Cannes Premier) is that you cannot possibly include the amount of detail that a book like ""The Da Vinci Code"" does into a two and a half hour film... it can't be done. But with the build up and hype that surrounded this film I can just imagine the so called Film journalists/critics sharpening their knives and licking their lips in anticipation for the release of this film so that they could find ways of tearing it apart. And for those people who were put off after seeing the movie because of its ""lack of"" detail then I'm sure there will be an extended DVD edition released. As a lover and student of film I have always made the point and taken the stance that I will not listen and believe in film reviews... unfortunately for one they are a persons opinion (personal to that person) and two they always carry some sort of agenda and bias... this is another occasion in which people should go and see this film for themselves, then make your own mind up... Andrew Hiscoke"
"jtorresm","6","1","8","18 May 2006"," I was expecting more
","I am still thinking about this movie. I truly believe that Ron Howard tried his best to stick to Dan Brown's story, but this cut out his own creativity. Let's start with the acting. Tom Hanks does a decent job (it goes better as the story develops), but he did not have a good partner: in my humble opinion, Audrey Tautou did not do a good job at all. She said in a interview that she was not too excited about the movie when her name appeared on the list of likely actresses to perform Sophie. Well, you can see that in the film. She looks out the picture, saying his words without conviction and with a thick French accent that makes her hard to understand sometimes. She had already done DIRTY PRETTY THINGS (Stephen Frears' film, in English) with good results. The kind of production that DAVINCI was deserved a better training in her English skills, I believe. Maybe Ron Howard is not that good at directing actors, it is the only explanation I can think of, regarding the couple Hanks-Tautou. Tom Hanks tries to do his best. Ian McKellen, wonderful as sir Leigh Teabing. Impressive, Paul Bettany as Silas. Jean Reno is OK, quite natural as a tough French police officer. I loved the flashbacks in the movie. They are definitely an added value. I imagine that Mr. Howard did not have too much freedom to create something of his own based on Dan Brown's book. On one hand, he might have risked of disappointing fans, but also it is true that all the elements (riddles, phrases, signs, symbols, etc.) are intrinsically and intimately related that it would have been a huge mistake to scramble the whole just to change a few details in order to be ""original"". The suspense is good (I had read the book) and you are caught by the intrigue of the story. Anyway, I prefer a literal adaptation to the screen that the disaster that was THE NAME OF THE ROSE. At the end, I imagine that the tissue relating all characters become a little bit confusing for those who have not read the book. I give the film 6 out 10. I also was expecting more. Perhaps a more aggressive direction and going beyond Dan Brown's lines: what about (a scene that I imagined when I read the book) Jesus putting his hand on Marie Magdalene's womb during the Last Supper and saying: ""This is my body... This is my blood...""?"
"ashkparsa","1","1","9","20 May 2006"," total disaster
","The director has done a great job making a junk movie out of a great best seller novel. The screen play is awful, the story is changed terribly. If you haven't read the book, movie is so confusing and makes no sense to you, and if you have read the book then it is so disappointingly shocking as how they have changed the story, It's not ""The Da Vinici Code"" . I guess they thought like ""Whatever we make people come to watch it, because it's based on a best seller"". Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time and money, even if somebody offers it to you for free say no and save your time. I read the book and I liked the it very much, but the movie was a huge disaster."

","What in heaven's name could director Ron Howard have been smoking when he made this turkey. Akiva Goldsman should be banned from ever writing another screenplay. What a joke it is, and how unutterably dull and uninteresting this whole movie is. Howard has not only ruined whatever there was in the book which made it one of the best sellers of all time, he has even managed to ruin scenes of Paris and London! That's almost impossible to do, but Howard has pulled it off. How bad was this movie? Well, at one point I was laughing out loud at the serious parts, that's how bad. At another point it struck that Howard was stealing scenes from ""Sean of the Living Dead"", a movie that is far better than Howard's Turkey.<br/><br/>As for the actors, Tom Hanks was extraordinarily dull. Jean Reno was, if anything, even worse - and I'm a Jean Reno fan! He brings new meaning to the word ""boring."" I can only fault Ian McKellen for not having taken one of his walking stick props and beating Hanks, Reno, and especially Howard half to death. Audrey Tatou was an inoffensive cipher. She needs to return to France and leave Hollywood as far behind as possible. Paul Bettany's career is on the inevitable artistic downhill now that he's involved with Hollywood. It's bizarre, but like many Brits he insists on blowing off any attempt at artistry the second he get a whiff of Uncle Sam's greenbacks. Enjoy the cash, Paul.<br/><br/>Hey, buy the book. It's not great, but it's not a totally bad read. But avoid the movie like the plague. If the Christian protesters ever find out how bad this movie is they'll be encouraging people to see it!

","The Vatican 1966 My Maternal Grandparents went on a world wind tour of Europe via the prized fleet luxury vessel "" The Queen Mary"". Quite a reward for their lifetime of Marriage raising 4 successful children. My Grandparents went on a tour of the Vatican City when my Grandfather felt ill. He told the guide that he felt dizzy and nauseous. The guide told my grandparents to sit in a church and rest . Out of nowhere a Cardinal showed up and asked my Grandparents if they needed some assistance. The Cardinal in his broken English detected a Polish accent by my Grandfather. The Red Clad man of the clothe put his hand on my Grandfather's shoulder as he asked in Polish ""Mowisz po polsku?"" ""Do you speak Polish?"" My Grandfathers' blue eye lite up as he responded, ""Tak, urodzitem sie tam!"" Yes I was born there!"" Which town? asked the Cardinal. My Grandfather said Lodz and the Cardinal's eye also went aglow. The Cardinal went on, ""I gave my first mass at Holy Name of Jesus Church on Sienkiewicza Street."" My Grandfather knew the area of that city well and they broke into conversation in their primary tongues. The Da Vinci Code was a wonderfully written book by Daniel Brown. A great mystery thriller involving the Catholic Church. The book opened my eyes about the origins of Christianity. From the bloodline of Jesus himself to current descendants caused a mass controversy among Christian readers. That being stated, I wondered how Director Ron Howard would cram those many pages into a two and half hour film? On surface the cinematography was superb with location shots around Paris. Our story on the out set grabs your attention with Murder and a chase for the Holy grail. Our two main characters are Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) work well together but strictly business here as romance takes a back seat to religious answers dodging authorities. The most recognizable character in all of this the Albino Silas played by Paul Bettany. The Louve curator is found dead lying in a position of a Vitruvian man. Harvard Professor of religious studies (Langdon) is summed to the site. The police Captain Fache (Jean Reno) tells Langdon about the cryptic message left by the body for decoding. To make matters worse The police tie Sophie to the murder of her grandfather the curator and Langdon and Sophie ditch the police and the chase is on which ends up in London. I personally would have preferred a mini series on television but Hollywood has a way of straying, once again, from the narrative switching characters intentions to shorten a screenplay to accommodate time restrictions. Other players to watch for. The versatile Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa and a pivotal player in our story veteran actor Ian McKellan as Sir Leigh Teabing. As for my Maternal Grandparents and their visit to the Vatican, My Grandfather told the Polish Cardinal that he felt queasy so the Cardinal blessed my Grandfather with the sign of the Cross against his far head and short prayer in Latin. My Grandfather apologized and said it wouldn't work, I'm of the Jewish faith. The Cardinal replied, "" Where all G-d's Children!"" The Cardinal left and all of a sudden My Grandfather felt better. In-fact no complaints of nausea the rest of the trip."

The film's two big ""surprises"" are telegraphed early, and the ease with which they can be guessed (using the ""conservation of characters"" process) leeches the movie of a large measure of its suspense.

"Bababooe","1","0","4","16 November 2017"," Garbage! Boring, sleep inducing performances, laughable. Worst Tom Hanks performance.
","OK, I only saw the last 45 minutes of this borefest, from the scene where Tom, Audrey Tautou, and Ian McKellen are in some church where tom throws the vile and Ian leaps for it. Best thing to shut the movie off after Ian falls to the ground. That leap was worth it. What follows is utter boredom, except for the part when Ian is thrown into the cop car and he's seen yelling out the window, embarrassing for Ian, but may find some laughs. I was laughing.<br/><br/>I have not read the book, and I do not plan to watch the whole movie. I've read the Wikipedia and the user reviews for Best, Hated It, Loved It, and Chronological – about 10 each. I have nothing against rewriting accepted religious beliefs or conspiracy theories in movies. I just don't want them in real life. I believe all religion is a tool to control people, as in ""give me your worldly possessions and you will have everlasting happiness after you die"", or ""Give me a hamburger today, and I'll pay you on Tuesday"", or ""I'll give you bigger better health insurance for a fraction of the price"", or Well you get the point. It's a freaking con job. ""We'll give the rich tax cuts, so that they will build bigger and better factories for you poor slobs to work"" – Con job.<br/><br/>Getting back to the The Da Vinci Bore. First Tom Hanks looks like he has his eyes shut, and someone painted eyes where he's closed eyelids are. Now, I respect Tom as an actor, because I've seen enough of his work to call him a good actor, not great, not that, but a good actor. So, first the acting sucks in this movie. Audrey Tautou, and Ian McKellen were also garbage.<br/><br/>The story, from what I gathered from the reviews and Wikipedia is garbage. Some kind of mystery and that Jesus had children and descendants. I don't doubt that he did. Most kings and powerful people had kids. But, then we get a multi city tour of looking for clues, action, murder, mystery, (similar to James Bond, or Jayson Borne, or Star Wars, or Star Trek, or Avengers, or any other big budget spectacular nonsense). Only to find out that Audrey is the last of Jesus's descendants. OK! Take a look at the last scene with Tom after he realizes where Jesus's wife is buried. Wood comes to mind? Some user reviewer in the Loved It category with 10 stars vote, stated that the music was incredible. Well, no. Not incredible, only filler. For the money they spent on this crap they could have brought back Beethoven from the grave. Or just use Beethoven.<br/><br/>This movie is garbage. It's filler. And that opinion has nothing to do with the religious implications. I've heard about this movie for years, of how great it was. And when I saw it was playing on HBO, I thought OK, I'll catch it. I'm glad I only saw the last 45 minutes. But I did spend time reading the reviews. Hated It (1 star) category has the best views with details of why they hate it. Loved It (10 star) category users love it, because they love it, to them it's just fantastic, but no substance.<br/><br/>The name of the game is brainwash. Build it and they will come. But it must be promoted. Yes, they promoted this movie and people came. Propaganda. Tell the people it's great enough times and they will believe you. Tell the people up is down enough times and they will eventually believe you. A perfect example of this is the ""movie"" Star Wars VII, The Force Awakens. A cheap copy brainless excuse for the Disney film studios to put a product out that will make a profit. So what we have here is not art. Not thinking. They are telling you what and how to think. Freedom has a price. It's called thinking."

"stormhawk2020","7","0","1","25 May 2017"," OK mystery movie
","When it comes to mysteries, it really does boil down to how interesting your film is. While The DaVinci Code is the definition of a film that you either choose to buy into or you will probably hate it, I still find that its intentions are in the right place and holds onto its audience from beginning to end. Viewing this film ten years ago upon its initial release and just now revisiting it for the first time since, I still acquired most of my sentiments. This is an overly religious film and although some may admire its acts, most of those who are not of the Catholic religion may just find it pretentious or uninteresting. Personally, I believe the film has a little for everyone. That being said, although I think The DaVinci Code tries very hard to be intriguing, it definitely is not without its major flaws. While I have not read the source material that this film bases its premise around, I never choose to compare. A film needs to work as a film first and foremost and if it happens to be a faithful adaptation on top of that, then it just pleases more people, plain and simple. For me, even if I have read a novel, I hardly ever draw comparisons. Following a murder at the Louvre, novelist/symbologist Robert Langdon and the victim's granddaughter Sophie Neveu must uncover the clues to secrets he left behind. From secrets locked away since the birth of Christ to uncovering the lies of their past, this film sends viewers on a roller-coaster ride of intense puzzles. That being said, the film as a whole does not live up its exciting premise. While many people may not quite fully understand what I mean by this, I can't help but call this film calming and nice to watch. There is a fine line between boring and calm, but I feel that this film walks in between those perfectly. The pacing of this film, along with the very enjoyable performances from Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, and Ian McKellan, are really something to admire here. Sadly, there are moments when these aspects tarnish themselves by focusing too much on the surreal, quickly making this film feel a little less believable than it should be. The big reveal in the final act will either have you chuckling or simply accepting it. Without getting into spoilers, there is a build-up as to who or what something is and if it even still exists. When it is revealed, it felt a little forced and the film lost me. Again, the pacing saves those aspects, due to the fact that it takes itself very seriously and the performances are believable. Ten years ago I would have strongly advised against seeing this film in theaters, but having time pass and revisiting this film after knowing what to expect and not enjoying it very much the first time around, I have come to respect this adaptation of The DaVinci Code. It is by no means a great film in any way, but it maintains its interesting elements throughout, masking the annoying side characters, the sometimes ridiculous plot, and the over- abundance of religion. I did admire some of the clever inclusions of the Catholic religion in order to make certain scenes more interesting, but when your entire film relies on a reveal that requires its audience to have certain beliefs, the film will definitely not please all audiences, and that aspect still remains to this day. All of that said, I do feel that this film gets better on multiple viewings The DaVinci Code still offers a generous amount of thrills and its mysterious aspects are still very enjoyable to watch. The film does get a little too self-indulgent with its beliefs, but if you are able to accept the fact that this film will not hold back, you may just find yourself enjoying it quite a bit. At 150 minutes, the film does feel its length due to its slow burn, but that is the aspect I admired most about this film. Its soothing performance from Tom Hanks, meshed with very intriguing dialogue throughout each scene when something is about to be revealed made me feel relaxed. For a specific audience, this film could possibly be the best film they have ever seen, but The DaVinci Code relies too much on that to carry the overall film. I did buy into the conclusion, but it was pretty silly. Overall, although I enjoy the film more upon each viewing, it really is nothing special in the end. It tries very hard to be great, and while certain aspects are exceptional, the film as a whole is fine. I find new things to like about this picture each time, so I may give it an even higher grade in the future."

Once such example is an elevated shot of a castle which should look great but the lighting makes it appear to be very murky and it drastically obscures your vision. There are so many twists and turns which would normally be great and interesting but, for the most part and excluding the grand twist, they just seem to be there to add drama. It is also needlessly long and could be cut back a bit by about 30 minutes or so. There are a lot of scenes just dedicated to exposition and explaining every little fine detail about something. These are annoying and shows lack of directed storytelling. The monk, Silas, is just stupid as a character.they try to make us feel sympathy for him but he is clearly delusional.

You buy him as a professor and he is easily the most interesting character and sometimes is the voice of the audience. Audrey tautou plays sophie and she has great chemistry with hanks in this film, she was a pretty strong female character and worked well alongside hanks. Sir ian mckellen is really good in this film, he is great alongside hanks and tautou and seems to have fun in this film. However, there are quite a few boring characters who are very bland. Paul bettany plays silas the monk after hanks and at first he showed promise but then becomes a generic bad guy that is forgotten about for the majority of the film. Alfred molina is a great actor but in this film he wasn't even needed and actually really slows the film down. The story has some interesting intrigue involved as the film develops. However, there is just too much going on in this film story arc wise which really bogs the film down with some pretty predictable plot twists. The script is very bland with allot of history exposition that could have probably been explained in a better way. The style of the film has some interesting developments in it.

"sharky_55","6","0","1","7 July 2016"," But first, a test of honor.
","I'm actually impressed by how effective this schmaltzy blockbuster is. The original novel by Dan Brown had an immediate impact and popularity, partly because of its controversial premise that made people flock to find out the truth for themselves. Brown semi-convincingly weaves enough historical truth and reference into it that the more gullible reader takes at face value. I remember myself being momentarily amazed after looking closely at The Last Supper for the first time and seeing the feminine figure hand in hand with Jesus Christ himself. That was a page turner - doctor waiting room material, for light reading on public transport, and so on. The film takes on the same qualities. It starts essentially as a detective mystery, which is a genre which has worked for centuries because we as an audience like being told that final, baffling yet brilliant solution and then rifling back through the pages and picking up on the clues that have been subtly inserted. The film, like the novel, is effective because it builds on our assumed knowledge and weedles its way past our doubts. We know the Mona Lisa, we know the Last Supper, we know the legend of the Holy Grail, but did we know these little secrets beyond them? How many knew of the Opus Dei before The Da-Vinci Code?<br/><br/>What the detective mystery also relies on is dumping loads of information and then re-assembling the bits into a solution that the audience would recognise but not have the expertise to solve themselves. The film takes the laziest route here, relying on the authoritative prowess and aura of veterans like Hanks and McKellen to continually be fountains of knowledge, to know the answer to every question from the clueless vessel of Tautou, who doubles as the viewer. Everyone knows Hanks and McKellen, so we don't doubt what they say, and when they are confronted with a seemingly baffling puzzle to solve, their historical and intellectual know-how isn't questioned. This is of course film-making at the lowest level; there are scenes where the two are basically narrating straight from the novel, talking directly at Tautou and therefore the viewer, making sure they are up to speed. Everything serves to move the film along. There is remarkably zero fat for something almost three hours long. Part of this is nonsensical padding; Sauniere's final cryptic message scrawled in blood is an anagram which leads to the Mona Lisa, which contains another anagram to another artwork, which leads to a key with another puzzle...and so on. If you take a step back all this mystery seems tedious and convoluted, and a few of the steps are unnecessary. But because the film is so brisk, never giving any breathing room but rushing from puzzle to puzzle, it doesn't ever feel like dragging. Our curiosity is swiftly and efficiently replaced by another, and there is never any time to really think or reflect. <br/><br/>The film format is visual, so Howard has gone above and beyond the book, gifted with a generous budget, to further add to the faux historical authenticity of the premise. The lavish flashbacks are clearly colour coded, with a slight wash to contrast so we know exactly what timeline we are experiencing. The characters narrate over them with the air of authority as if they were providing the voice-over for a historical documentary. Langdon's opening presentation is directed not only at his chirpy lecture audience, but also at the viewer, overturning all their preconceptions with a flashy barrage of symbols and their secondary meanings. Every mystery is given immediate priority; the novel presented a puzzle and solved it almost immediately, to the reader's satisfaction. When they do the little bait and switch on the plane, seconds later we see the washed out flashback explaining exactly what happened. This is low culture entertainment, but it certainly is effective."
"filipemanuelneto","9","0","1","26 June 2016"," An adaptation faithful to the original book.
","Based on the homonyms best seller by Dan Brown, this film begins in the Louvre, where a crime and several clues hidden in Da Vinci's works takes the symbologist Robert Langdon in an unexpected treasure hunt. Directed by Ron Howard, the film has a screenplay by Akiva Goldsman, and a cast headed by Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou.<br/><br/>The cinema has always had difficulty in please the public when it decides to make the adaptation of a best-known literary work. For me, an avid reader, a film can rarely be better than the original book. There are always chapters that are cutted or adapted in a less well accomplished way. But that doesn't mean that the film is bad (well, sometimes it is). In this case, the adaptation isn't bad, following the book very faithfully. And that is essential.<br/><br/>The actors are excellent and were quite good in their roles. Despite some minor flaws, they all shone and gave credibility to their characters. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou managed to give soul, ingenuity and charm to Langdon and Neveu, managing to soften the audience in some scenes without, however, never assert themselves as a romantic couple because, in fact, they weren't. Ian McKellen, as expected, was impeccable in the role of the academic Sir Leigh, and gave a great liveliness to the film with his British manners and careful diction. Paul Bettany surprised in the role of the monk Silas, a religious fanatic. He was truly unrecognizable. Finally a word of recognition for Jean Reno, who returned to make a detective (he already had a similar role in ""Les Rivières Pourpres""), again with great clearance. The special, visual and sound effects were excellent but unobtrusive; the photography, a bit dark and nebulous sometimes, contributed to thicken the mysterious environment in which the film unfolds. The soundtrack, done by Hans Zimmer, was perfect.<br/><br/>In conclusion: the film is very good and is faithful to the original book but, to properly appreciate it, we have to resist to make many comparisons. The book is so good that, usually, too much increases our expectations for the film."
"davispittman","3","0","1","17 December 2015"," Very dull film
","2005's The Da Vinci code movie is a very dull and just flat out boring movie that's not worth the time to watch it. The storyline is lacking and the idea is an interesting idea but the execution of the plot falls flat. The actors really do try their best to save the movie, but they cannot save it from the dull script and the lackluster execution. Tom Hanks is just OK in the film I felt like he could've been better though. And the other main actress along with Ian McKellen do all right in the film, not great. At first I was really excited to see this movie because I thought that it was going to be an exciting controversial film about the foundation of religion and it being toppled, but it just turned out to be a boring dumb movie about this discovery rocking the foundations of Christianity. It's true that there were one or two scenes that kind of peaked my interest, but it was only one or two scenes out of over 100. So the da Vinci code unfortunately will only receive a 3 on a scale of ten."

","I won't bother addressing the nonsense about religion. For me, the book, itself was very entertaining. Unfortunately, the movie failed on every level. In the hands of Ron Howard, an exciting story became a dull Hardy Boys mystery, and even the cinematography was poorly thought out by Salvatore Totino. One might have been able to overlook those problems had it not been for the dreadful casting by casting directors Janet Hirshenson and Jane Jenkins. Audrey Tautou, in the role of Sophie, almost single-handedly ruined the movie with her unintelligible English and Tom Hanks was terribly miscast, in my opinion, in the role of Robert Langdon. The lesser characters were reasonably well cast, Ian McKellen especially. Sadly, they weren't the ones responsible for carrying the movie."

"Theo Robertson","5","0","7","2 March 2013"," Much Ado About Nothing
","Dan Brown wrote a book called THE DA VINCI CODE which had a premise that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene had a child and the Centuries of Christian teaching is one big conspiracy to hide this fact . The book itself featured much controversy from the religious leaders and became subject to court cases alleging plagiarism . The novel itself went on to become a big hit with the public but not with the critics who considered it popcorn trash for the masses but literary wotrhless . The same could be said of THE GODFATHER and JAWS two classic examples of trash becoming immortal films . Certainly THE DA VINCI CODE has all the makings of a fast paced high concept blockbuster. Stick in some well regarded names like Hanks , Reno , Molina and McKellen , an Oscar winning director and an Oscar winning screenwriter and you should have a massive hit on your hands . This film can't fail can it ? <br/><br/>As someone who has never read any Dan Brown I'm afraid the film version does to a large extent . The problem with the film is that assumes that no one is aware of the hype involving the book . I've never read the book but I know what the plot involves - an albino monk working for an internal sect of the Vatican bumping off people who know too much . It's a bonkers idea and in the context of a trashy blockbuster it's a good one . The thing is the story structure that assumes that the audience know nothing has to by necessity create an air of mystery to the proceedings . This means that the first half is taken up by some painfully obvious exposition . Everyone on the planet must know where all this is heading and even if they didn't it'd still be badly done and unnecessary exposition <br/><br/>Things do pick up in the second half but that's not saying much and for a film featuring an albino monk bumping off people too clever for their own good THE DA VINCI CODE doesn't feel like it reaches its maximum potential as the storyline descends in to a runaround with the good guys getting crossed and double crossed by the bad guys which makes for an unengaging because the audience are one step ahead of good guy Robert Langdon and good girl Sophie Neveu . One thing is assured whilst watching this film and that is neither Dan Brown or screenwriter Akiva Goldman are going to be bumped off by an albino monk or anyone else for being too clever for their own good"
"JamesHitchcock","5","0","2","23 September 2011"," Impossible to take seriously
","Which of the following statements are true? <br/><br/> Rosslyn Chapel in Midlothian, Scotland, was built by the Knights Templar <br/><br/> The name ""Rosslyn"" is a corruption of the phrase ""Rose Line"" <br/><br/> ""Rose Line"" is another term for a meridian or line of longitude <br/><br/> Rosslyn Chapel lies on the same meridian as Paris <br/><br/> The organisation known as Opus Dei is an order of monks <br/><br/> The organisation known as the Priory of Sion is the modern successor to the Knights Templar.<br/><br/> Leonardo da Vinci and Sir Isaac Newton were both members of this organisation <br/><br/> Alexander Pope presided over Newton's funeral <br/><br/> Leonardo's famous painting of the Last Supper shows Mary Magdalene sitting on Christ's right <br/><br/> Christ and Mary Magdalene were married and had a daughter, Sarah, from whom the French Royal Family are descended.<br/><br/>The answer is that all these statements are demonstrably false, apart from the last which, while unsupported by any evidence, cannot be definitively disproved. Rosslyn Chapel was built in 1456, more than a century after the suppression of the Templars. ""Ross"" (headland) and ""lyn"" (waterfall) are both common elements in Celtic place-names. Nobody except Dan Brown ever refers to a meridian as a ""rose line"". Rosslyn Chapel lies more than five degrees to the west of the Paris meridian. Opus Dei is not a monastic order but a Catholic organisation of lay people and secular priests. The Priory of Sion has no connection to the Templars and was not founded until 1956, so Leonardo and Newton could not possibly have been members. Pope, as a Catholic layman, could not have officiated at an Anglican funeral service. The figure sitting to Christ's right in ""The Last Supper"" is St John the Evangelist, traditionally shown in Christian art as a fair-haired beardless youth.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"", however, is a film which assumes that all the above statements, especially the last one, are true. In form, it is a Hitchcock-style thriller, based around a man and woman accused of a crime they did not commit. An elderly Frenchman named Jacques Saunière is found murdered in the Louvre. We learn that the real culprit is an ""Opus Dei monk"" named Silas, but (for reasons too complex to set out here) suspicion falls upon a visiting Harvard University academic named Robert Langdon and the dead man's granddaughter Sophie Neveu. Langdon and Sophie go on the run across France, England and Scotland, following various clues in search of the information which will establish their innocence. They are well equipped to decipher complex clues as he is a ""symbologist"" (one who makes a study of symbols and symbolism) and she is by profession a police cryptographer.<br/><br/>The McGuffin which they are seeking is the Holy Grail. In the Arthurian legends and films such as ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" this is depicted as a cup or chalice, but Dan Brown inclines to the theory that the Old French for ""Holy Grail"", ""San Greal"", is really a corruption of ""Sang Real"", or ""Royal Blood"". The Holy Grail is therefore the royal bloodline deriving from Christ's supposed marriage to Mary Magdalene. According to the film, the Catholic Church has throughout history sought to destroy all evidence of this marriage, believing that such a revelation would destroy Christianity, while the Knights Templar and their successors the Priory of Sion have sought to preserve this forbidden knowledge. It turns out that Sauniere was killed because he was a member of the Priory and that Langdon and Sophie are in danger not only from the police but also from fanatical elements within the Church.<br/><br/>There are some good things about the film- there is, for example, an entertaining performance from Ian McKellen as the historian Sir Leigh Teabing- but overall, I found it dull. Ron Howard has made some decent films in a number of genres, but thrillers like this are not really his forte, and I found the action too slow-moving and the plot over-complex. This is not one of Tom Hanks's better films, and, as in ""Dirty Pretty Things"", Audrey Tautou shows that she is not as accomplished an actress in English as she is in her native language.<br/><br/>I had, however, two other, more important, reasons for disliking the film. The first is that a conspiracy thriller has to have some connection with reality if the alleged conspiracy is to remain plausible, and ""The Da Vinci Code"" is so riddled with factual errors that I found it impossible to take seriously anything it has to say. (I listed a few, but by no means all, of these errors at the beginning of this review). The second is that Dan Brown seems not to realise that his main thesis could, if true, actually have led to a more reactionary form of Christianity, not to the more liberal one which he claims would have been the result. If the Kings of France (and other European countries) had indeed been direct descendents of Christ and Mary Magdalene they would most assuredly not have kept this fact a secret. They and their servants in the Church would loudly have proclaimed their holy bloodline- and their consequent superiority to ordinary mortals- to the world.<br/><br/>I am not a Catholic, and unlike many of those Catholics and other Christians who denounced the film as ""blasphemous"" I am personally sympathetic towards those interpretations of Christianity which place more stress on Christ's humanity than on His supposed divinity. I doubt, however, if many of us- regardless of our religious views- would want to live in a society ruled by quasi-divine monarchs claiming direct descent from God himself. 5/10"

","""He forgot everything we've learned. Everything we teach. It's why we study history.

The movie has a very controversial subject, told by a great cast.<br/><br/>The subject is quite unbelievable. So unbelievable, in fact, that if it were ever revealed to the world it would destroy the foundations of Christianity itself. And so, it was kept secret. A select few kept it hidden from the curious eyes of the world, while a select - other - few tried to eliminate the threat by eliminating the secret itself. By any means necessary. Until one day, when the two factions, like two fighters almost out of breath, are finally too weak to control the secret any longer. Will it get out? Will it destroy the world?<br/><br/>The script tends to minimize everything except the subject, and that is why it is so predictable. It is acted out by a fantastic cast, and I can think of no one better to tell the story. Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen do a great job of explaining events and symbols long forgotten. Audrey Tautou has the innocence needed for the part. Paul Bettany the intensity. And Alfred Molina is perfect as the powerful elite working in the shadows.<br/><br/>The music is great, a little over the top maybe, but very much fitting the magnitude of the story. The special effects are few but very well done.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code. A very intriguing story, for those who care enough to listen. 9/10."

Like (in order of occurrence): - Musée du Louvre (Didn't know much about it except for being called Louvre and that it is in Paris) - Vitruvian Man (Well, of course I knew this one, but I was still intrigued to know little bit more bout this nd it's origin) - Fibonaci Sequence (I forgot this one, I knew it once since I'm a programmer) - Eidetic Memory (Didn't know what that was, and now I know it means photographic memory, which I'm familiar with, and that the <br/><br/>word ""eidetic"" comes from the Greek word ""eidos"") - Spatial frequency (didn't know about it) - Mona Lisa (Interesting to know the facts) - Virgin of the Rocks (I have seen it, but didn't know it is called that way, now I'll never forget it) - French King conquered Jerusalem (I suppose I should know this from assassin's creed but I don't remember, so looking it up on <br/><br/>wiki as well) - Friday the 13th (good to know) - The Holy Grail (I know it by name but not its history) - Holy Blood, Holy Grail (which inspired this movie) - Rudimentary Phallus (now what's that? Do note: I'm not from the states and English isn't my native language) - Opus Dei (So many things to learn) - Zealots (What is this? Starcraft?)<br/><br/>The second scene where he talks about symbols gave me goose bumps, and I actually wanted to see the whole lecture (hence the <br/><br/>rest of this movie).<br/><br/>I think it is mind blowing how much this movie has to offer. Aside from it being a great mystery thriller (I mean, this hollywoodian movie is one of it's genres best), it is focused on a subject so basic to some people, JC, and brings so much light on to this subject... it's.. ahhh... amazing.

Far from it! We both thoroughly enjoyed the movie - with me going on to purchase the book. The movie did its best to stay true to the novel from what I can tell, and I fail to see why so many religious people went up in arms over a FICTIONAL movie!

Now, Robert is a Professor at Harvard University who specialises in religious iconology and symbology and Jacques had intended for Robert to be able to work out the clues (which were various puzzles amongst 'religious' portraits) leading up to his slow and painful death, only for him to be considered the murderer by the police.<br/><br/>One of the members of the police is revealed to be Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), Jacque's granddaughter, who wants to know the truth behind the murder.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses they come into contact with Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) and it is from then on the movie begins to twist, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>It's a brilliant movie and the script was wonderfully done - if not for Robert Langdon's inhuman speed at the end of the movie where he suddenly appears at one place than the next as he follows the Rose Line to his final destination.<br/><br/>I give this a definite 10, and remember - one should watch the movie for what it is and not get worked up when they fail to see the word 'FICTIONAL'."

I believe this was done to hasten the pace of the film, but what it did for me was make scenes that were too short to fully absorb what had just happened. As for the film lighting and picture quality, they did a great job; the dark scenes were comfortably to view and no overly bright spots. The soundtrack on the other hand was horrible, with the exception of some appropriate angelic music with the scenes involving Silas. The other scenes were polluted with this annoying low base; I thought it was my TV so I switched to another set, same result.<br/><br/>I used the patented family rating system of ""how many out of ten,"" I would give the film a five and that is being generous.

The Da Vinci code, based on the bestselling book by Dan Brown, follows suit by taking symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), into a fast paced pursuit to find the true meaning behind a suspicious murder. The dead body has significance because it has a symbol on it, which opens up a religious conspiracy long forgotten but no less dangerous. <br/><br/>The film takes true thriller form with a truly complicated plot which will leave you thinking about the film long after it has finished. Instead of the conventional agencies used in thrillers, he is chased around Europe by a religious cult, Opus Dei; therefore creating a fresh take on thriller films. At this point a comparison would be necessary however there are no films like this, so this opens a up a new sub genre of thriller which captivated the audience.

The movie seems to piddle along.<br/><br/>Another problem that I have with the movie is that, in some annoying scenes, the characters only speak in French, and you have no clue what is happening.<br/><br/>Also, and I don't know if this is a problem with the movie or with the book, since I haven't read the book, but it seems that the plot to this movie and to Angels and Demons is an almost aimless drifting. Robert Langdon will discover an almost arbitrary thing, and then, through some very random string of arguments on esoteric history and signs, will come to a conclusion that is too absurd to believe, and yet is almost always correct.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I don't consider this a bad movie. I didn't pay close attention to every detail - I was multi-tasking on the computer - and so I wasn't bored. Honestly, I don't see how you can watch this movie without multi-tasking. It is interesting to see how the plot unfolds, and to learn about history and conspiracy. Things do happen, and while the plot can be a little unreal it still has the consistent flow, with a number of breaks, that you would expect in a mystery. It is not exactly a thriller in the sense that you are at the edge of your seat, although it does have those moments. I would not say that it is exactly a cerebral movie, but it is still interesting to think about. <br/><br/>Overlooking the plot, I think that everything else about the movie was well-done. The musical composition, the camera work, the scenery."

When compared to book, Cuts away lot of fun. But I don't think they could've done it any slower, that would have killed the movie. So basically you've to be a book reader 1st, to enjoy the movie, you've to take movie just as 'visual extension' of the book. Scenes like Swiss bank vault, Rob Langdon coming to Louvre murder scene from hotel room across the Paris, Leigh Teabings' flight from Paris & particularly London arrival are so much enjoyable in book but have made no mark in movie.<br/><br/>When it comes to character & actors, Sophie Nevou is perfect, I think character should match our imagination we make while reading, & it fits. For Robert Langdon there's no other replacement for Tom Hanks, his expression, intelligent look on face it feels like Prof. Langdon rising out of book. But I personally feel he looks bit older.....In book he's 42 right? Looks 53here :) (We've seen him in You've Got Mail, that same tom hanks would've suited perfectly) Teabing perfect, Bezu Fache I had imagined more massive n sharp. Sounier, Silas right ones.<br/><br/>one point, in book he wins a date promise from Sophie after a week right? (Or Am I confusing it with A&D end, no I'm not) Why have they cut the concept from movie? They just part caressing!! That's it? Possible Reasons - Tom Hanks looks too old to date young Sophie? lol! I think they want to show there is more important, different path for Sophie as last descendant of Jesus than just leading normal life now on.(???) I didn't really understand d reason for this change from book.Whatever..<br/><br/>My pick from movie & according to me only scene which is more enjoyable than in book, is last one when he realizes the secret.

","This is a critique not a synopsis. I'm a huge fan of the books and of course I will be critical of the delivery on film, but this movie made the book seem bad. Which is not the case, the book is superb and delivered badly on film.<br/><br/>I've read both Dan Brown's books Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code a number of years ago. Upon reading both books, I remember thinking Angels&Demons was much better suited for the big screen before Da Vinci Code. The theatricals were all built into the story... but anyways, I digress...<br/><br/>The book The Da Vinci Code is very very good. It is intelligent enough to form questions, action packed to keep moving, filled with crime, mystery, international intrigue taking place around the famous landmarks and locations around Europe. The story involves a colorful array of characters and is in fact set as an International thriller. The book inquires and stimulates the mind and spirit as the reader follows Robert Langdon's quest for truth. This is really the universal tender that makes the book so good.<br/><br/>The film, directed by Ron Howard. Starring Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon follows the book chapter by chapter, step by step in its execution. To those who read the book, the movie is not bad. Unfortunately, even liking the book, the film becomes tedious and confusing. I found it annoying that they felt they had to over intellectualize the significance of every symbol and pattern in the film. The film is too politically correct when the book was not and challenged what is known as the truth and not a story created by the powers that be.<br/><br/>The film had plenty of funding, plenty of time and some of the most talented to make a really good book into an really good movie but what we got was overly delivered and had little significance. That's my one criticism, it's the one biggest complaint that viewers had who never read the book. They had no idea what was going on and was even more confused at the end. I guess to say in a nice way, the book was so good, it made the film didn't seem as good. But that is not the case with the Angels&Demons."

","I have to admit here that i adored the novel. Despite being full of some offensive facts about Christianity (which have been refuted by church afterward), it remains from the most entertaining books i have ever read. For the film, i got disappointed. The fact here is that a good successful novel is not necessary to be a good successful film. The secret word here is the SCRIPT. In this film i felt that the script writer just did his best to transform the novel words, page by page, to successive cinematic scenes. As a result, a very boring dull film has been created. This was not a novel adaptation, this was rather a novel 'translation' if you know what i mean. Thus the film had very long speeches, unclear characters development (unlike the novel), waxy faces actors. Cinema sense is not felt during the coarse of the film. Tom Hanks was not in mood completely. I didn't feel he is Robert Langdon at all. I give this film THREE only for its fine technical quality (despite everything it has a good cinematography). A better script was badly needed to save this film."

"fimimix","10","0","1","11 November 2008"," .saw it twice, need to see it again..
","I've read 28-of-89 pages of comments posted here. I totally agree the book AND THE MOVIE are FICTIONAL. The film (directed by Ron Howard, scripted by Akiva Goldman) is very educationally entertaining, if you don't know too much about what the factual story is. Few users seem to know this; they did no research about the ""facts"" presented by author Dan Brown. One user wrote, ""Dan Brown believes the documentation is fact; Ron Howard does not"".<br/><br/>Dumb me, I had no idea ""The Da Vinci Code"" was causing such an uproar when the book was published (work-schedule). Therefore, IF I knew the book were being made into a film - and people all over the world were protesting it - I don't remember. I learned of it from a conversation I had with a fellow-worker.<br/><br/>I am a Christian and totally believe in the scriptures of The New Testament, and the holiness of Jesus. That is called ""faith"".<br/><br/>There is nothing to convince me otherwise. ""Jesus of Nazareth"" is my favorite movie of all time; it too, was not chronologically faithful to The New Testament. The difference between ""Code"" and ""Nazareth"" is, ""Code"" was filmed to be seen in a single viewing - ""Nazareth"" was a multi-series for British TV. Therefore, there was no concern about wasting time for character-development, nor re-arranging and discarding parts of the book's plot.<br/><br/>I feel Ron Howard should have made the movie much longer - in order to explain all the mysteries of the story presented through dialog - with an intermission to let the audience discuss what they had seen in the first half, so the second half would demand more attention and deep thought.<br/><br/>All of the actors/actresses were excellent in their roles, with the exception of diction; with the exception of ""Silas"" (Paul Bettany); ""Sir Leigh Teabing"" (Ian McKellan); and ""Sister Sandrine"" (Marie-Francoise Audollent), who were stellar in their roles. Although the actors who played the French police may be big stars, their elocution left something to be desired. That includes Tom Hanks (""Robert Langdon"") and Audrey Tautou (""Sophie Neveu""). Movies depend upon dialog to tell the story, Ron Howard was just a bit careless not to be certain every word would be audible and understood.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" is a griping, fast-moving film, with the exception of character-development. People appeared instantaneously without any explanation of their importance to the story, yet we see archbishops playing pool. I found it ironic that ""the last survivor (on Earth) of Jesus' bloodline"" would be a police-woman, also one attempting to break the code.....also the grand-daughter of the curator of le Louvre.......he just happened to know the entire secret and the whereabouts of ""The Holy Grail"". How convenient. I also found it a stretch for ""Sauniere"" (Jean-Pierre Marielle) to painfully disfigure himself as he was dying, and to leave messages around his body to solve his murder and protect the resting-place of ""The Grail"". However, that made for great sleuthing for the rest of the cast, down to an archbishop of The Catholic Church.<br/><br/>A little research would have shown OPUS DEI (""God's Work"") was not a secret faction of the church exclusively for bigwigs - it includes many ordinary people, all around the world, who are STILL radical with their self-flagellation, some of them even willing to be crucified to show their love of Jesus. They hear ""take-up your cross and follow me"" seriously. Paul Bettany's character exemplified that desire passionately, and his role made the entire movie meaningful.<br/><br/>None of the comments presented on IMDb.com mentioned that popes were not always religious people. ""The Vatican"" (the nation of ""The Holy See"") is a tiny, independent nation ruled autocratically by The Pope. He is not sent down from Heaven to be Jesus' vicar on Earth (Simon Peter), as some believe The Dali Lama is a divine being. The Pope is elected by other very ambitious, political archbishops. History certainly documents how they used the kings and queens of Europe to do their dirty work, to control the world....The Holy Roman Empire: the de Medicis, the Borgias? The Knights Exmplar were (and still may be) factual. In our present day, there is much debate whether Pope Pius XII connived with Hitler and Mussolini to save The Vatican, although he saved many Jews.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed ""The Da Vinci Code,"" and am anxious to view the DVD......a director's cut, I hope. Whether any of Da Vinci's paintings had hidden clues doesn't matter much to me. One user wrote, ""Mona Lisa smiles because she knows The Holy Grail is missing and Jesus is still a bachelor."" Another, ""Fear men who can justify doing evil in God's name."" Sounds like ""Aringarosa"" and ""Silas"" ? - does to me ! The action-scenes and the cathedrals in all those gorgeous places made-up for the few holes in the plot. I didn't find anything to laugh-at; this is a serious drama about a serious theory. As a Christian, I don't believe much of it. As for His marriage to Mary Magdalene, ""google: 'The Bloodline of The Holy Grail'"".<br/><br/>He was not divine ? Please......<br/><br/>I did far too much research on subjects of which I am familiar. I found ""The Gospel of Mary"" and read it. Now, I hope my next viewing of ""Code"" will be one for pure enjoyment and enrichment, WITHOUT commercials. I recommend this film for all, Christian or of any other religion. The theory that all religions have one god - Jesus and The Holy Spirit - is widely accepted. A couple of hours to lose oneself in a fascinating tale for the opportunity to further understand a topic about which one may not know too much, surely is not wasted time. I disagree with all of those who think this movie will not become a classic - it is, already. Bravo to all who had any part in its production."

","""Seek The Truth"" <br/><br/>Dan Brown's controversial best-selling novel about a powerful secret that's been kept under wraps for thousands of years comes to the screen in this suspense thriller from director Ron Howard. The stately silence of Paris' Louvre museum is broken when one of the gallery's leading curators is found dead on the grounds, with strange symbols carved into his body and left around the spot where he died. Hoping to learn the significance of the symbols, police bring in Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a gifted cryptographer who is also the victim's granddaughter. Needing help, Sophie calls on Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a leading symbologist from the United States. As Sophie and Robert dig deeper into the case, they discover the victim's involvement in the Priory of Sion, a secret society whose members have been privy to forbidden knowledge dating back to the birth of Christianity. In their search, Sophie and Robert happen upon evidence that could lead to the final resting place of the Holy Grail, while members of the priory and an underground Catholic society known as Opus Dei give chase, determined to prevent them from sharing their greatest secrets with the world. Also starring Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, and Alfred Molina, The Da Vinci Code was shot on location in France and the United Kingdom; the Louvre allowed the producers to film at the famous museum, but scenes taking place at Westminster Abbey had to filmed elsewhere when church officials declined permission.<br/><br/>I remember reading the book a long time ago and as soon as news broke out that a film was in the works, I was so pumped. The book was a good read so I was eager to see how they'll interpret the novel to the big screen. I went nuts over this movie when Ron Howard was on board to direct and he's leading an all-star cast so my anticipation meter reached sky high.<br/><br/>While I can say that I was entertained, it was a bit disappointing in some points. They edited out a lot of crucial and important key scenes that was present in the novel, I know they had to consider time constraints but they should have just wiped out some minor less-important parts in the movie. I guess that's what you get when your anticipation reaches sky high.<br/><br/>Ron Howard does the job of entertaining us for almost two hours and the pace never slows down. The acting was great although I'm still having a hard time with Tom Hanks' killer mullet. Audrey Tautou, one of my favorite actresses, handles her English diction very well and she matches up with Hanks' on screen charisma. Ian McKellen is an effective villain and so is white albino monk Silas portrayed by Paul Bettany."

The film it's self is probably to long at two and a half hours and it seemed to really drag towards the end. However it was reasonably well directed without being anything special.

Da Vinci's was not portrayed in a respectful manner, instead the movie portrayed De Vinci as a vile sinner and the mother of this ball of hate, deceit and Halocaust denying fire, and sent it hurling down a mountain running over the glorious holy lord our Saviour(Jesus Christ). It is also to be noted that there were no African American creature-servants to guide Jesus to release the daemon within, his Glutious maxi mus. his mud monkey, would have then made a valuable contribution to relieve Christ of His pain. I also noted a foul stench of homosexuality that had spawn from the evil directors themselves, may there souls be ever tortured in hell(new Jersy) for eternity +1.<br/><br/>Your faithful humble servant of your lord Optimus Prime, Reviewer"

","The movie version of THE DA VINCI CODE is an OK action thriller, but nothing special. Tom Hanks is miscast as hero Robert Langdon, but Ian McKellan, Paul Bettany and Jean Reno all acquit themselves quite nicely as various supporting characters. Audrey Tattoo as Langdon's unexpected companion makes for nice eye candy. The plot involves tracking down the Holy Grail, among other things, and is not a bad adaptation of the book, which itself is a hokey mishmash of conspiracy theories and alternate takes on the lives of Jesus and Mary Magdeline, with lots of international derring-do thrown in for good measure. Director Ron Howard perhaps bit off more than he could chew here, but he does keep things moving at a decent pace, right up to the unnerving climax. I just wish someone other than Hanks had played Langdon. When they get around to filming ANGELS AND DEMONS, an earlier and far superior Langdon adventure involving murder at the Vatican, I'd love to see someone like Christian Bale (astutely suggested by my youngest kid) take on the role. Or Harrison Ford, if he could somehow shed 30 years."
"nephsam","5","0","4","6 August 2007"," 3 things regarding this film
","1) The cast. Often using a great cast can be a huge mistake, and among that some of them miscast! Tom Hanks is still in Forrest, Audrey Tautou is too ""petite"", Ian McKellen is too tall to think of him as a weak cripple, and Jean Reno is far too energetic to play a religious cop. Don't get me wrong, they all have proved being GREAT actors... it's just the movie didn't suit them. Irène Jacob would have done a great Sophie Neveu (perhaps a bit 'old') and Robson Green a magnificent Robert Langdon (excepting the FACT that he's English, maybe), probably Peter O'Toole would have done a more gloomy Leigh Teabing...<br/><br/>2) The film itself. I'm one of those who read the book first, so guess I'm pretty disappointed. The film begins so slow, focusing on non-important issues (Silas' whipping over Fibonacci's Sequence?? Silas' past over the Spring Rite of Sophie's grandpa??), where it should go slow goes fast, and where it should go fast goes tremendously slow. No rhetoric, plain voices all over the movie, and for music Libera would have been better. It's not that the score is bad, no, but they chose a star cast, why not a star boy-choir band? One point in favor: the flashbacks and reminiscences in time while the characters speak or think, pretty good move!<br/><br/>3) Beliefs. I'm raised a Christian Catholic, I know my religion in deep, this is a NOVEL; please, unless you're a living Silas, don't watch it over a historical, facts or religious basis: you'll be disappointed and enraged. Enjoy it for what it is, 'fiction'. I have an open mind, so I quote Mr. Langdon: IT CAN BE POSSIBLE. Let the mystery sensation, the what-if feeling assault you, having in mind it's a drama-suspense story. You'd be longing to be in the Louvre or in Paris, chasing the Rose Line...<br/><br/>So, 5 stars out of 10 in my personal opinion. My recommendation: if you read the book, don't watch it; if you HAVEN'T read the book, watch it, THEN read the book... Your mind will be more vivid in recreating scenarios and faces..."

","What made me smile was this comment about Rosslyn Chapel on this entry '...The chapel is noted for its many internal carvings, including what appears to be a depiction of American maize -- but the chapel was completed before 1492.' More propaganda from Christopher Columbus! I suspect another Catholic plot here. Read Gavin Menzies book '1421: The Year China Discovered the World' recounts that maize originated in Central America, that Magellan loaded it in the Philippines and that the Chinese transported Maize around the world. Maize is incapable of self-propagation, it needs mans help. It's now well known that the Chinese navigated around the world well before Columbus. The book says the Portuguese had a colony in Central America and that there caravels were making journeys across the Atlantic BEFORE Columbus. So why can't the Rosslyn Chapel have maize carvings <br/><br/>Continuity: When Langdon and Sophie approach Westminster Abbey, there is no scaffolding around the right tower in the first shot. Then, when they cross the street to enter the church, suddenly scaffolding surrounds the tower. No, look again, as Langdon and Sophie approach Westminster Abbey he is talking and the scene has 'ghostly' images of the past with people from the middle ages(?) walking past, the scaffolding is made of wood, its part of Langdon's recounting, NOT a continuity error.<br/><br/>Alexander Pope wrote the epitaph for Sir Isaac Newton: ""Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said 'Let Newton be' and all was light."""

If you find it hard to understand the story of a film, you are going to have a rough time with this one. There are certain parts of the film, in which you do feel lost and confused, but once the film finished, you could fully realise and understand the main story which was going on. There are some interesting on characters, especially Silas and some beautiful music played throughout.

You can tell that its sole purpose is to try and prove the basis of Christianity wrong. Why I ask? The purpose of a film is to entertain and shouldn't be an attempt to sway viewers from their religious beliefs. I assure everyone reading this that no movie ever made could have that kind of impact on me. It's ridiculous that the makers of this film were concentrating more on proving a romantic relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdeline existed rather than focusing on the core elements that it clearly lacked such as the wooden dialogue and unimpressive cinematography.<br/><br/>From the terribly bland history lessons Tom Hanks mumbles to the shaky dialogue of the leading actress, this is one turkey you will want to leave in the oven.

"SheniquaFurr","8","0","1","13 July 2007"," Better than the reviewers led to believe.
","I am not at all a fan of Tom Hanks or Opie. I always skip their movies, I never liked either. I skipped this in the theater because of these two and the dreadful reviews.<br/><br/>However, I rented the DVD and I was more than surprised at this movie. Having read the book, there is no way the film could ever manage to achieve the delicious and unbreakable grasp on the reader from start to finish.<br/><br/>If you have neither read the book nor seen the movie, by all means read the book first. Sure the book and movie are complete works of fiction. But the book is infinitely more exciting and satisfying. Like almost all of Dan Browns books, this isn't classical literature. But it is by no means dumb. The book dangles such enormous, tantalizing hooks that you should set aside an entire rainy day to read it, because it is much too engrossing to read in more than one sitting. It is rare that a book completely obliterates any sense of disbelief, and this does it. Make no doubt, its literate fluff, but it is still fluff. Instead of cotton candy, it is a delicious Godiva truffle. Not a classic book, but a great book, and one hell of a breathless page turner that makes just enough sense to completely suck you in for the day and even make you ask what if? <br/><br/>The movie is similar. While some of the book was changed for cinema conventions, the movie rolls along at a frantic pace, and is still engrossing. There are more spine tingling gee whiz what if moments than I would have ever expected. Opie did a good job mixing these mystery moments with car chases to keep up the action and tension and suspense. Not much is truly overdone, and not much is undercooked. He unfolds the story at a deliberate pace that doesn't ever get boring or slow. There is less character development, but hey, this is a big blockbuster Hollywood movie. The character development is more than one would normally see from a summer tent-pole, and the characters are fleshed out enough to root for them. Opie cuts the chase scenes before they get too long and stop serving the story, they are never outrageous and showy but actually suspenseful. And he cuts the mysticism and revelations before they are given the clobber treatment where things are spelled out to you. The movie, even though it is a popcorn movie, is a smart one, and expects more from the average viewer than the vast majority of Hollywood garbage. It is by no means perfect, it doesn't really deserve my 8 for quality, but it does deserve the 8 for entertainment value. I would like to think of myself as a film snob, but I greatly appreciate any movie that causes me to buy in to the story and characters, and get lost in the film and its twists and turns and suspense and gee-whiz moments. The DaVinci Code managed to do that for me. It was entertaining without being (for the most part) condescending. And I don't understand the b.s. about Tom Hanks hair nor his casting. Im not a fan of his, but he performed aptly and believably. Still, he cannot hold a candle to French legend Jean Reno, nor can he keep up with Audrey Tatou. Thank God the filmmakers did not add in any sense of sexual tension or romance between Hanks and Tatou. There is just not time in a 24 hour span of saving the world for a budding romance or even a quickie.<br/><br/>Not the best movie ever made, but it manages the rare feat of being compulsively watchable multiple times on DVD, something I couldn't say for many Best Picture winners. In my book its along the line of a Fifth Element or a Underworld. Its actually worth buying on DVD and watching over and over."

","Tom Hanks was not believable as a professor (I pictured Russell Crowe as an excellent choice, and he has played a professor successfully). Audrey Tautou left me flat; she was so wimpy/passive that I think they did not want her competing with Tom Hanks. I felt that a stronger woman should have been portrayed. She is suppose to be an extremely smart woman that works for the police department. As far as the story goes, I believe that the story would have been much better if they had stayed more closely with the book. For a book with lots of suspense and action, this movie misses a lot of that.<br/><br/>It is really too bad the movie fails because the original story and the supporting cast are excellent. The supporting cast is the only reason I give this movie 4 stars. Hopefully they will never use Tom Hanks to portray Dr. Robert Langdon again."

","I have read the book before seeing the movie with family members who haven't. Thanks Heavens we watched it on DVD because after every 10 minutes we had to stop for me to explain what was going on.<br/><br/>It seems that director Ron Howard and his script-writers have left out just about everything that would have added some depth or meaning to an otherwise not bad, but far-from-great novel.<br/><br/>The cast is an enigma to me. Audrey Tatou in all of her roles is always herself, and I think few are extraordinarily fond of her (she is somewhat creepy) and Tom Hanks, otherwise good as he may be, here with a humiliating toupee or bob, whichever)is not fit for the role of an adventurous beau professor, either.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany excels as Silas (okay, he is always great), he is outstanding in an otherwise extremely poor movie. Ian McKellen is miscast. Alfred Molina tries his best but the role he has has been twisted been emptied by the movie makers. Even Jean Reno has such a poor role that I completely forgot he had anything to do with the flick and just got reminded as I went through the cast.<br/><br/>This all adds up to a movie where - as our private screen testing revealed- nobody gets anything who hasn't read the book, and the ones who have feel they have to apologize.<br/><br/>The others didn't get that Silas is a victim of fanaticism and is betrayed. They saw a freak and serial killer in him.<br/><br/>Nobody understood what the catholic Church was doing with Bishop Aringarosa.<br/><br/>Nobody seriously believed that Audrey Tatou's character understands even part of what she is talking about (as it could not be understood by anyone who has not read the novel).<br/><br/>The novel has something of the Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose- some thinking, some theories, some religious sacrileges, to give you a spooky and enjoyable medieval feeling. The movie completely fails to transfer this. Instead, the characters do an awful lot of talking- which is really annoying, as the characters portrayed by the badly picked actors are, other than in the book- and from their lengthy and cheesy dialogs is the complicated story to unfold. Well, it doesn't.<br/><br/>If there is anything good to be credited to the novel of Dan Brown, it is the atmosphere and tension related to mysticism, fanaticism and religion in general, as well as the secretiveness of the sects involved that hook you and make you read the novel in one night. Nothing of that atmosphere was cast in the movie adaptation. Less talking (or even a dark, male narrator's voice) and a little more tension could have done most of the job. <br/><br/>If there ever was a movie deserving a 1 out of 10, this surely does."

He does a fine, though rather unimpressive job in the role. Hanks is good in everything he does, but while he could have shone here as he has in other films, there just doesn't seem to be that extra spark. Audrey Tautou is actually my pick for a better actor in the film. She delivers a conviction to her role. I also really got a kick out of Sir Ian McKellen. I was actually surprised at the sheer amount of familiar faces in the film. Its rare to see this many talented actors in one place. Its just too bad that they were not put to better use.

Audrey Tatou (being one of my favorite actress) is perfect as Sophie Neveau (also one of my favorite fictional characters off all time). Paul Bettany (another of my favorites) played Silas (another fave F.C.) flawlessly (not to mention I got to see him stark naked ::PervertMeTalking:). Sir Ian McKellen (yup, another of my veteran favorites) is greatly convincing as Sir Leigh Teabing (another fave F.C.) and, as always, Tom Hanks plays his character Robert Langdon almost to perfection. Kudos also to Jean Reno for an amazing job playing Fache.<br/><br/>I guess my only complaints are that, if you weren't able to read the book, the plot would confuse you (but I guess that's not much of a problem guessing as almost everybody on this planet HAVE read the book). Plus, it's such a shame that the movie didn't show the reunion between Sophie and her brother.

I literally was planning on smashing and breaking the rented disc, but decided against it.<br/><br/>Like COME ON! Jacques Sauniere IS her grandfather!! It's not that hard Mr. Director to put that part in the movie! Sure it makes a better ending but COME ON! You already screwed up half the movie. At least get something RIGHT! I have also researched that the history of the movie is extremely far-fetched and do-sen't fit at all, and for someone who hasn't read the book I would believe to be confused while watching the movie. Im my opinion you should'nt watch this movie until you read the book.

","It doesn't happen often, but in this case, the movie is better than the book. What the author didn't execute well in print the screenwriter and director *greatly* improve upon in this film adaptation. Gone is the cliché-ridden dialogue and, in its place, a fast-paced, well-executed thriller. It's not a great film, but certainly much better than most reviews would lead one to believe: the cast is solid and make the characters much more believable than the book, the flash backs and overlays representing historical events make events much more compelling than the book did, and the intrigues and red herrings just keep coming. As usual, Ron Howard delivers a visually-stunning film. A movie that will more than hold your attention until the final credits roll."

It was one of the better movies i have watch in this year (and that list is long). All the idiotic and boringness of the book was gone and there was great movie left! Actors fit to the characters pretty good, storyline was interesting and kept me watching all the way to the end. No pause anytime!

"raypdaley182","6","0","2","11 February 2007"," Some HUGE howling mistakes
","OK, I watched this on DVD last night and tried to have as open a mind as I possibly could.<br/><br/>It's very obvious that Tom Hanks was never the 1st choice for the lead role in this film. Not even 2nd, 3rd, 4th 5th or 6th choice I would have said. And reading the trivia for the film I was gratified to discover my feelings were correct.<br/><br/>I totally didn't recognise Audrey Tatou but she was excellent in her role and out performed Hanks in every scene they were both in. Jean Reno was excellent as the Opus Dei police inspector but he was a bit clichéd in certain sections of the film.<br/><br/>Sir Ian McKellern was brilliant and his unexpected heel-turn totally threw a spanner into the smooth running plot of the film.<br/><br/>The locations and sets of the film all look wonderfully, some of the characters are a tad annoying, Silas the albino monk especially so.<br/><br/>I noticed a couple of huge mistakes. The British Police vehicles, namely the grey BMW's with orange stripes. No Uk police forces use BMW's and all police car markings are yellow, not orange.<br/><br/>Also in the sequence where Silas has shot the armed police, they would have no need to issue him a verbal challenge to open fire. Under the armed rules of engagement he could have shot and killed Silas with no problems at all.<br/><br/>When he was shouting at Silas to drop his weapon, the gun Silas was holding was clearly empty - with the working parts fully forward meaning there were no rounds in the pistol and he was no longer a risk.<br/><br/>The officer who opened fire therefore committed an act of murder.<br/><br/>Once Ian McKellern told us the Holy Grail was a living person I worked out it was Audrey Tatou right away. That outcome was totally predictable.<br/><br/>The films ending is very weak, where they show where the tomb actually is. Right back where the story 1st started for Tom Hanks, in The Louvre.<br/><br/>This film was way over hyped and no-where near as good as the hysteria over the book and the stories behind it led us to believe.<br/><br/>Watch with an open mind and enjoy the visuals."
"roger-395","8","0","2","4 February 2007"," Great movie
","I'm picky about historical or even quasi historical movies but I am happy to report that this is a marvelously entertaining movie. A word of caution for anyone who has read extensively on the subject of the Holy Grail, Rennes Le' Château, the Priory of Sion, the St. Clair (or Sinclair) family, and early church history: There are a number of very obvious inaccuracies that could be annoying to a perfectionist! I won't say what they are but in my view they do not detract from the film in any significant way.<br/><br/>The movie incorporates some of the locations and figures associated with Priory myth and even the generally understood significance of the Rose Line is incorporated effectively (this line doesn't just pass through Paris!). Tom Hanks turns in his usual accomplished performance. Audrey Tautou easily holds her own against heavy weight Hanks and further she is in a word gorgeous. Paul Bettany almost steals the movie and offers yet another astonishing performance. This man's acting range is incredible. Jean Reno, Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina also provide strong performances in very important supporting rolls. I almost hesitate to call McKellen's roll supporting since he is integral to the plot but he doesn't make an appearance until the movie is almost half over.<br/><br/>Ron Howard has done it again. This movie is a near perfect blend of complex plot, great characters we come to care about, a nice blend of action and drama, and for once no silly romantic subplot although the attraction between the female and male leads is palpable by the end of the movie and one wonders why they didn't fall into each others arms. The music and cinematography are also wonderful. I recommend it highly."

","Review: Other than the fact that I found the book so mind-numbingly boring and horribly written (grammar for starters) I had to put it down, the movie wasn't too awful. Dan Brown should have stuck with the theories and concepts and nixed the stupid ""thriller"" stuff or just gone with the thriller stuff alone. Actually, he would have failed miserably at the theories. Actually, the ""thriller"" part wasn't that good either. The movie was tolerable up until they started running from Château Villete.<br/><br/>Other: The ideas aren't new. From actual ancient documents, it is clear things are not nearly so cut-and-dried as the Catholic/Christian religion would like. But Dan Brown munged a lot of facts and theories. It is very possible Mary Magdelene could have been Jesus Christ's wife. A definite was there was no consensus on whether Jesus was divine or human, or some strange combo of the two. The idea of that the Council declared Jesus being divine actually lasted for the first 300 years or so of Christianity. The Nicene Council was called because one faction wanted to assert its view as canon law (truth or lie has no relevance at these things) and declare the rest heretics."

There is one important aspect: Mind you, I accept and understand only peaceful humanistic religions and beliefs. No aggression, no violence. Was Jesus kind human, paragon of sanctity OR divine or God? Maybe, he was just fairly convincing? I mean for those people who got his help by Gospel. If your faith helps you to get out of life troubles, to live fairly, honestly, generously,BLESS YOU! Dan Brown's research is quite interesting. Why not?

","I have just spent the entire evening watching this movie and couldn't help realize how sick Tom Hanks sounds in it. Did he have a cold or the flu? If that was the case why couldn't he wait until he was better to make the movie. The entire movie was quite intense and well acted out. The brutal violent scenes were a bit overwhelming to watch, especially Silas and his nude body covered in scars and wounds of all kinds.

I would recommend this movie to any one who does not believe in god or who is not a practicing Christian. I myself have not went into the house of god until Christmas. I always believed in something much higher and until now i wondered if there even was a real God or Jesus.

","Seriously Reading the book it seems that such a thrilling tale should make a great movie, especially one starring Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou. But things don't always work out. With loads of details and frequent plot twists the story becomes cumbersome to translate into a feature film. This saturation instead produces a talking-heads routine where the picture depends on constant dialogue to relay the necessary information, and really without enough pay-off.

","Although I absolutely adore this film the book and everything to do with it I think that Sir Ian McKellen was too nice as Teabing. He was always a sort of Jekyll and Hyde character in my imagination. Maybe thats just my imagination going wild but you know. While Paul Bettany (Silas) excelled at his part. I jumped many times and his image haunted me well after the film had finished. The chemistry between Sophie (Tautou) and Robert (Hanks) was only apparent in certain scenes, but in the book it is clear they are attracted to one another. Tautou made the character of Sophie believable and also made you want to protect her - perhaps explaining the brother/sister relationship I thought they portrayed. In total, I absolutely ADORED the film."
"MoviePopcornCostsTooMuch","Null","0","2","14 January 2007"," A lot better than I thought. ENDING IS ANALYZED HERE.
","I had a very low expectation of this movie given the blandness of many of Howard's films and was pleasantly surprised. I guess being forced into making an action oriented film because of the nature of the book made Howard actually give some drive to this. Despite a weak opening sequence in which Hanks sends the entire French police force into the streets while he deciphers the meaning of the dead body in the museum, the movie moves quite quickly and has a different ending than the book.<br/><br/>The ending at first seems intriguing but then you think about it and its laugh out loud re-god-damn-diculous. Hanks and the chick from Amelie run around escaping death, being pursued by the cops because she's 'the last living link to Jesus', then A HUNDRED FRIGGING PEOPLE SHOW UP AT THIS SUPER SECRET PLACE THAT WAS ENCODED IN TEN DIFFERENT IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK CODES. Which renders the entire movie pointless. If all these people knew where the final location was, then why the hell didn't they just tell her? They all knew who she was yet forced her to go through hell to find it? Retarded. Stupid. Annoying. But a good movie."
"camelot2302","7","0","2","13 January 2007"," It's as good as any director could do it
","A lot of criticism has been leveled at this movie, almost as much criticism as the book itself. But I'm of the firm belief that this is the kind of story that doesn't adapt easily to the big screen and Ron Howard has done the best he was able to do with the material he was given.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the casting choices. I agree with Sir Ian McKellan and Paul Bettany - they were the right choices (perhaps the only choices) but I think Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou were the wrong choices to play Langdon and Neveu. Hanks is just not the Langdon type (if you've read the book, you'll know what I mean) and Tatou just looks to me like some kind of wilting lily, not the tough assertive woman portrayed in the book. I would have much preferred something along the lines of Harrison Ford and Sophie Marceau.<br/><br/>Jean Reno did a decent enough job as Bezu Fache. When it comes to playing French policemen, Reno basically monopolizes those roles! <br/><br/>The movie does do a fairly good job of following the book plot. There's a few minor changes in the movie but nothing worth mentioning. The ""extended version"" of the movie, now out on DVD, adds an approximate extra half hour to the running time and the extra scenes concentrate mainly on Bishop Aringarosa's dealings with the secret Vatican council.<br/><br/>By the way, look out for a cameo appearance in the movie from Dan Brown himself! He appears at the beginning when Hanks is doing his symbology conference. When Hanks is signing books, Brown is in the crowd talking to someone. Just look out for the Harris Tweed jacket and the blond moppy hair! <br/><br/>All in all, quite a good movie and surprisingly quite faithful to the book."
"hchalfant","9","0","1","12 January 2007"," Excellent movie
","I had read the book sometime back and plan to read it again. This movie was very fast paced and Tom Hanks did an outstanding job and was a great match for the part. The plot was like a repeat of a church history class and made you think back to what you were taught. By helping you to think about what was happening, it helped me to think about my thoughts as a Christian. There now is plenty of research to do on some of the ideas brought up.<br/><br/>I don't mean this as a spoiler but this is how i feel. Unfortunately this movie got a lot of bad press from the church because they seemed to be threatened by it. I enjoyed being challenged by new ideas and thoughts and the plot was excellent at doing this. Supposedly controversial films serve a purpose for they help us examine our present ideas and then ask questions.<br/><br/>Most of all this movie was based on a book of fiction which was right away apparent to me. The many twists and turns in the action and the characters developing into who they were, kept me focused at all times on this movie. There was plenty of human interest too for the grand daughter was very down to earth and really cared for the other characters.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the moving action and the shifting scenes toward the end. This film was hard to figure out which kept me fascinated. Ron Howard films are always great to watch. I would recommend seeing this movie and I am considering buying a copy. The movie ending was a surprise which was great to see. Unpredictable movies keep us wanting to watch more and more of them."

McClellan and butler turns to be bad guys...NOOOOO, chick turns to be the heir of Christ...NOOOOOOOOOI hadn't see those coming ( for the morons among us this is Ironic)like many other things in this movie :predictable escapes(of course)the one a bit more realistic than the other; the heroic death of the monk;the betrayal...really the whole movie.though I was a bit amused by some conversations about the secret society and the history of the Grail. accidentally I read a lot about the Grail when I was a child and all the fancy stories of the templar knights and its secrets. I read them many ,many years before I watched this film so I was already totally up to date :-)<br/><br/>but my final conclusion is that it was totally predictable and a bit lame,I think the actors agreed with me, because everyone sucked big time ( Mcclallen was OK, but the rest should be ashamed of themselves) and at a certain moment I even didn't care about how it should end... the chick dies, fine! the chick doesn't die also fine!she marries tom hanks and make the next heir with him, be my pleasure;where are Magdalena's remains, who gives a f*ck... I really didn't care during the end of the film.honestly this not the worst film i've ever seen, but its definitely totally not worth the hype, the story isn't really that brilliant, maybe the book is better I don't know, but i believe it will have a lot more of suspense... the good: Ian Mc clellan,Silas, the Hans zimmer soundtrack; the bad: the acting of all the rest; the ugly : the story<br/><br/>don't spoil your money and time on this hype, you can also live a nice peaceful and happy life without seeing this overrated hype thing I rest my case"
"Bandit1974","9","0","2","4 January 2007"," An Unusual Review
","If I ever have the pleasure of meeting Tom Hanks I probably owe him an apology. Often times a movie will be released and receives so much hype from critics and movie goers that if I don't see it within the first 48 hours of its release I won't see it for quite some time. I'm not sure there is any logical explanation for this. Perhaps I get tired of people quoting and/or talking about the movie. Perhaps I fear that the hype surrounding the movie will only spell disappointment for me as I sit in the theater. For this reason I didn't see Rain Man for at least 10 years after it was released in the theaters. For this reason I will probably never see any of the Austin Powers movies.<br/><br/>This has happened to me twice with Tom Hanks and I now own 9 of his movies. I didn't see Forrest Gump for the first time until a year or two ago. The second was The Da Vinci Code which I just finished watching for the first time. Now, this movie is still pretty recent and is actually still considered a new release on DVD. This is one movie I should have seen in the theater for the set pieces alone! I guess this is as good a time as any to mention that I have never read the book and probably never will (sorry Dan Brown). I don't read fiction, which is not to say I don't read. I know that much of the criticism this movie has received is based on how closely it follows the novel.<br/><br/>This is an argument that will never end and it's one I don't quite understand. We're talking about two completely different mediums that satisfy and stimulate two completely different parts of our brains. People that whine and complain about how much better a book was than the movie that followed are totally unrealistic. Books have an unlimited amount of time (pages) to discuss the smallest of details. The same people that bemoan movies for not being true to the book from which they were adapted would no more enjoy sitting in a movie theater for 4 hours watching the sincere version of the story that they were hoping to see.<br/><br/>All that being said, I think The Da Vinci Code is a superb movie. If you've read the book and seen the movie yet feel the movie was ""lacking"" ask yourself this. If you'd never read the book, how would you feel about the movie? How can you not enjoy this movie. I suppose that is the challenge a director like Ron Howard and an actor like Tom Hanks face when making a movie from a book that was so widely read as The Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>There really isn't enough room here to discuss plot points and most of you reading this probably already know the gist anyway. Just know that this is a fantastic thriller. I'm not terribly religious so I had no personal objections to the content. The twists and turns keep you guessing until the very end as quality movies of this kind should.<br/><br/>As I said the set pieces are gorgeous. The directing is top notch (the ever reliable Ron Howard rarely disappoints) and the acting is everything you'd hope for and expect from one of our greatest actors, Tom Hanks. I firmly agree with those who compare Hanks to Jimmy Stewart as today's version of the ""every day hero"". Audrey Tautao stands toe to toe with Hanks in the role of Agent Sophie Neveu. <br/><br/>This movie is one that I am sure to view several times over the course of the next month trying to soak up all the clues and details that I missed during the first viewing. I'd also read several reviews that stated the movie was too confusing to follow. Not so at all. I had no problems following the movie or understanding what was going on. That being said, there is a lot to take in.<br/><br/>I think what confuses me the most about those who are fans of cinema yet did not like this movie is that The Da Vinci Code is a movie fan's movie. It's a thrill ride from start to finish that relies very little on special effects and when they are used they are used very tastefully to help further the advancement of the plot.<br/><br/>If you're expecting to be satisfied in the same way you were when you read The Da Vinci Code my advice is to wait for Dan Brown's next novel. If you are in the mood to enjoy a thrilling movie that excites on every level a movie should than The Da Vinci Code is sure to please."

","I have read the book and then I just was compelled to see the movie. The adaptation from book to film is very good. And I mean Veeeeeery good. I was amazed at the way the plot was developed in the screen. Even though I'm no film maker, I think it was quite a difficult book to turn into a movie. Probably the presence of Dan Brown helped and the directorial talent of Ron Howard was no small thing either. Hanks and Tautou deliver the strength of their characters and Reno's role is simply delightful to watch. All in all, a very tight production, deserving (I think), some nominations for the BIG Academy Awards. <br/><br/>On another side, I've read a lot of reviews posted here by people that seem to have lost the real meaning of what they are criticizing. This is just a work of fiction (both the movie and the book, of course), and as such, a SUPERB work of fiction. Who cares if Phillip's gospel was written in Arameic, Copt, or English, for that matter?. It is just a literary license, useful to tell a story. Who cares if the Nicea Council was held to determine Jesus' divinity, to unify concepts between ancient christians or whatever?. Again, it's just a literary ""trick"" to tell a story. And Brown uses these (as well as others) brilliantly. The way that he combines symbology, bigotry and criminal investigation is simply great. <br/><br/>I think that if someone is too dogmatic and narrow minded, you should not get close to something that, even being fiction, could threaten your closely held beliefs. After all, the role of education is to take an empty mind and turn it into an open mind."

The only real threat is the inability to question and to think independently.

"BrandtSponseller","6","0","2","3 January 2007"," More Blank than Frank
","The Da Vinci Code is a decent film that could have been a great one, but it has some problems. In what follows, I'm going to focus on the problems, as a bit of constructive criticism.<br/><br/>Unlike many viewers, I don't believe that the problems are related to the film's subject matter or ""thesis"". I also don't believe that the problems lie with the book-to-film ""translation"". I don't take this film as anything other than fiction, and I like my fiction to have strong fantastical elements. For me, there is no taboo subject matter, and there are no taboo ways of fictionalizing the actual world to create interesting artworks. As for book-to-film translations, in my view it is a mistake amounting to a category error to try to compare books and films--they're two very different mediums. It's not only fine for films to be very different from their corresponding books and vice versa, it's unavoidable.<br/><br/>Rather, the problems with The Da Vinci Code all stem from one fact that requires much caution when storytelling--it's plot-heavy. The story here (and keep in mind in what follows that I'm talking about this as fiction, relative to the film's world) is a very complex one that necessitates explaining and then tying together a wide variety of historical and other ""academic"" material. The main character, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), has to solve something of a puzzle, and another character, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) accompanies him. At one point they're assisted by yet another character, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen). They each know things that the others need to know in order for the puzzle to be solved, and the entire film involves them explaining and to some extent figuring out these things as they go along--which functions to also explain the ""thesis"" to the audience. Of course this requires a lot of dialogue, and because of the subject matter, it tends to involve ""telling"" rather than ""showing"".<br/><br/>Now, the kind of film explained above isn't inherently problematic. It can be done with finesse in a very exciting way--a prime example is National Treasure (2004). Director Jon Turtletaub made that film work as a suspenseful action-adventure flick as well as any James Bond or Mission: Impossible film, while still retaining an intriguingly complex mythology along with the intellectual pleasures of puzzle solving. For The Da Vinci Code, helmer Ron Howard doesn't completely abandon action and adventure, but he too often forgets about it, and it's rare that it becomes very suspenseful. It's a shame, because when Howard remembers to keep those elements present, The Da Vinci Code shows how great it could have been. At a couple points, Howard takes another angle--making the film play like more of a fictional documentary. That approach worked, too, but it's also left by the wayside much of the time, and the end result is inconsistent. There are too many stretches where it's just Langdon or Neveu or Teabing explaining and helping each other figure out the story, and everything else--all of the mise en scène--functions just as decoration.<br/><br/>There are other aspects of the film hurt by this approach, especially characterization. For example, there are villains in this story, and the villains seem to be involved in complex (somewhat) conspiratorial relationships with one another. But only one villain is developed as a character, with a few others functioning more like movable props. And those others are meant to be the primary source of suspense. We just don't know them well enough--what they're capable of and why they're doing what they are--for the suspense scenes to work; they're more faceless than suspenseful.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the storytelling mechanics are too transparent. I'm usually awful at guessing plot twists. Here, I guessed them all almost immediately (without reading the book first, although I knew the gist of the ""thesis"", as probably everyone at this point does). At the same time, too much is left a bit vague--again especially when it comes to the villains. For example, I never did quite understand what Captain Bezu Fache's (Jean Reno) position and role in the events was, especially with respect to his relationship with Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (Alfred Molina). I suspect that was better explained in the book, but films shouldn't have prerequisites. <br/><br/>(And another problem suggesting that maybe prerequisites were suggested was given in the DVD extras--there are references to the ""thesis"" worked into the film symbolically--for example, references to supposed members of the Priory of Sion. The only way to catch the significance is to be versed in the mythology already. While some references for ""insiders"" can be fun, how much more interesting would it have been for the film as an artwork to create more robust internal, self-contained puzzles and references on this level instead? There is a bit of that--for example, the ""forest for the trees"" reconceptualization theme, and that's one of the film's highlights, but most of the subtextual puzzle-like references are to outside information from the relevant mythology.) <br/><br/>So that's focusing on the problems. But The Da Vinci Code isn't exactly a horrible film. I enjoyed watching it enough to watch it again in the future. Although the tone of the film is a bit inconsistent, most other aspects of Howard's direction are good, the performances are fine, and the technical aspects are very good. It's definitely worth a watch if you're interested in the relevant genres, and if you're intrigued by the relation of the ""thesis"" to the actual world--as many folks are, both pro and con--then you just may love it . . . or love to hate it."

","I had read the book long before I saw the movie. Usually what happens with me is that I don't like the movies if I have read the book before. I expected to be this way with this movie too. I was even hesitant to see the movie, as I had read many not so good reviews. But when I saw it I liked it. The actors are great. the interpretation is superb and the director has done a very good job. Congratulation to the all the members of the staff. But when it comes to suggesting to others to see the movie or the to read the book, I am always rooting for the book. I would suggest to buy the book, to read it, to read the reviews and to really understand the point of the whole story. I once heard Dan Brown say that he was worried that people liked the book not because of the good writing but because of what it writes about. I am sorry I cannot rephrase exactly what he said, but it was something like this. And I think the reviews about the movie are generated mostly for the same reason. I cannot see it anymore, but in the beginning I was also worried about the content. Now I get it. The more I read the book the more I get what Dan wants me to see. But not everybody likes the books, or even is able to fit the time to read this book into their schedules. If this is your case, then I would recommend you go and see the movie. All the actors are at their best. I am sorry that because of what it tries to tell about, it wont receive the real appreciation for the art work, but what can I say. At the end, it is a good spent time that will raise questions for you, and, why not, even make you start your own little internet quest."

","It was simply the most interesting book I have ever read. Since then, I have read at least ten more related books (to better understand the history of Christianity, religion, and where the bible actually came from). The issue of whether Jesus was actually married or not is not the biggest revelation to me. I am more interested in the role of Constantine and how they decided on the 27 books of the new testament. The fact that other gospels do exist and reveal that there was a diversity of thought in early Christianity is interesting and worthy of research. Hopefully, there will be a sequel and significance of the finds at Nag Hammadi will be addressed. Even still, the movie was an almost perfect translation to the big screen. The cast was excellent and they played their roles perfectly. The only changes I might have made would be to use Harrison Ford as Langdon and not showing the face of the hooded monk at the beginning. Overall, it was truly an excellent movie!"
"oggy-3","4","0","1","1 January 2007"," I loved the book, but I was disappointed by the movie ...
","I think the movie was too long - the material could have been contained in a picture with length of under two hours in my opinion. The movie was following the book too closely, which didn't work out very well. The retrospective sequences were short and fast and didn't create the effect they created in the book. Also, the scenes were mostly not well lit, which exhausted the viewers.<br/><br/>I would have expected more action sequences - at least that was the feeling the book left me with. The time-span of the story is very short yet the movie was as long as movies, that cover lifetimes.<br/><br/>Another disappointment for me were the changes in pace between the three story levels in the movie. The three levels were the current events, the retrospective material, and the historical explanations in the form of dry conversations. Those were irregularly dispersed throughout the film and introduced drastic changes in pace.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the French characters spoke in French. I thought Hanks was a perfect cast for the part and I was most impressed by Paul Bettany."

","After all the criticism this movie received in the press I was pleasantly surprised with the effort. The casting, cinematography, locations, editing, music and acting were all very strong. If anything could be considered less than excellent perhaps it was the screenplay. The story's complex plot and controversial nature didn't easily lend itself to adaptation for the silver screen. There were times I found myself thinking that if a viewer hadn't read the book they might get lost in the movies plot. However, other times I found the movie exceeded the book in representing the story through the use of its excellent visuals.<br/><br/>The lukewarm response to the movie was predictable I suppose. The public simply expected too much after the books stupendous success. I also wonder if there wasn't a bit of snobbishness directed at Ron Howard by some film critics who refuse to see him as a top notch talent, undeserving of such an enviable opportunity. <br/><br/>I found the movie totally enjoyable and very accurate to the book."

This particular movie, though, had nothing extra to offer apart from what is already in the the book: no great acting, no chemistry between the main characters, no stunning action or settings, no moving visuals, gripping pace or wise lines. Nothing, zero. Moreover, I felt that half the magic of the book was gone, with all the detailed explanations and historical curiosities left out. The movie is barely a skeleton of a gripping and rich book.<br/><br/>On the other hand, having read all the reviews beforehand, I felt that the movie wasn't that bad as it was portrayed, after all.

"Mario64","3","0","2","26 December 2006"," Dull experience
","I read the book beforehand, and it's by no means a great book, but I think certain things work better for literature than they do on film, and this is one of those cases. Without spoiling anything the whole back storyline about the Knights and the Grail and the bloodline and whatever else is pretty absurd in both the book and film, but in the film the plot line in the present is greater exposed. For instance in the book the constant chase sequences were pretty exciting, but in the film it becomes more clear that the cat and mouse game lacks imagination and more or less is an elaborate version of peek-a-boo. And the changes they make in the movie version, while I understand some had to be done for time constraints, for the most part do not seem to help it, and only make it a lesser experience. One last thing about the movie book comparison: the weak character development in the book is also greater exposed in the movie. That last one is this movie's greatest failure.<br/><br/>Now judging the movie by itself it just comes off as dull: dull dialog, dull characters, and for the most part dull action sequences if one even wants to call them that. Tom Hank's performance as Dr. Robert Langdon, the main character of the story, is one of the most underwhelming and dry I've ever seen him do, and Audrey Tautou as Agent Sophie Neveu falls flat right from her weak introduction, with her motivations hardly ever being clear. What one is left with are some nice plot twists, and Ian McCellen's worthy performance of historian Leigh Teabling.<br/><br/>I have to admit stories like this just aren't my thing. I just don't get enticed by these silly treasure hunt stories, as would be clear from me disliking the movie National Treasure as well. But I think I like this movie even less because Nation Treasure knew it was being silly, while this film tries to take itself a little more seriously and the results are less entertaining. I can understand how one could come to saying this is a passable experience. However I would recommend this to no one. Like I said at the beginning of this review it works better as a book. As a film the story flaws are exposed more clearly, and it's unfortunate a great director like Ron Howard couldn't have done more with it."

I'm not saying that it was one of the worst flicks we had ever seen but it was certainly not what we expected. The never ending chase of our two heroes contained a fair share of poor and downright silly scenes! Are we glad we didn't spend a dime to watch it? It wasn't even suspenseful! That guy Silas who looked and acted like a chap who should have been locked up for his own safety was beginning to get on my nerves after the first drops of blood.

Anyone who read the book probably agrees at how boring the movie was. What should have been a great thrill ride on the screen almost put me to sleep. The screenplay was ridiculous at how far from the book's dialog it drifted. The music was boring background noise that did nothing for the mood of the film. Tom Hanks was all wrong and I don't think he read the book. The monk was reasonably creepy but I think they missed who he was as character by a long shot - albino's usually have pink eyes and I thought Silas did in the book (I may be wrong here). The opening scene sucked and it goes down hill from there. I could go on and on about how awful it was, but I suppose if you've never read the book it might be an alright movie. I just hope somebody else directs Angels and Demons because that was a great book also. I'm just relieved that I didn't pay to see this movie or the DVD.

","I picked up the book by Dan Brown about 2 months before the film came out and entered into the world of secrets, mysteries and murder. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and was rather worried about how it would translate to screen. But it was done rather well.<br/><br/>Plot: Robert Langdon a Harvard professor of iconography and religious art is called in when a famous curator, Jacques is found dead in a historical museum. Jacques left behind a series of codes and clues for Langdon and his granddaughter Sophie Neveu, a French cryptologist, to unravel and discover the truth about many things to do with the past and the present. As Robert and Sophie begin breaking the codes, many secrets are revealed that delve into the works of Leonardo da Vinci and the clues that he might have left behind in his paintings. They go on an adventure to discover the true meanings behind the famous works of Leonardo da Vinci. The film reveals a lot about historical times and the Holy Grail. Many twists result.<br/><br/>What's right with it? The cast is great, although Tom Hanks didn't do such a great job at playing Robert Langdon. The story is clever and imaginative and the sets and scenery add to the film's fine details. Most things in the book were included in the film but plenty was shortened. All in all the film is quite entertaining and it makes you wonder.<br/><br/>What's Wrong With It? The film does start off quite slow in the first 10 minutes or so and you may find that you are bored but don't fret, the film quickly picks up pace later on. I was upset by one particular thing that was left out at the end of the film. It would've only taken the filmmakers less than a minute to include it in the movie but unfortunately it disappeared completely. If you are clever, though, you may figure it out for yourself.<br/><br/>Verdict The Da Vinci Code won't please all, especially religious Christians but it was well done and deserves credit. But all in all, the story is better in the form of a book than in the form of a film."

","Having never read the book, I cannot comment one way or the other on whether or not ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a faithful adaptation of Dan Browne's tremendously successful story. So I am left to comment on the story as film screenplay. Well, it must have been one hell of a good book, but it is a mess of a movie.<br/><br/>The central theme is very interesting. Was Jesus Christ the son of God, or an ordinary man who did many good deeds, who married Mary Magdalene, and produced heirs? As a theory or history lesson, this is really quite remarkable to contemplate. As a film however, it leaves way too much of the story being told to us, and not enough of it unfolds for us to discover. This is a dreadful mistake to make in a murder mystery. As such, I kept hearing interesting theories, but I did not see anything take place on the screen.<br/><br/>And that includes the acting. With the wonderful cast that appears, you would think that there would be several good performances. But that is not the case. In my opinion, Tom Hanks is badly miscast here. I felt that he was a little too old for the part. He was not the least bit interesting to watch, often appeared wooden, and trying not to ""act"". The always reliable Jean Reno was for the most part wasted.<br/><br/>In the end, this was a story that probably should not have been adapted to the movies.

"jpschapira","7","0","1","22 December 2006"," Entertainment at all costs...
","Should I say it or not? Well, I will: ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a film made for two kinds of people; the ones who have read the book and the ones who haven't. Being a part of the first group, I could be a little subjective, but I'll do my best and just review the movie as what it is: non- stop quality entertainment (I think I said that about ""House of Wax"", without the quality part).<br/><br/>Why do I say this? Because as a reader of the book, I find myself in a position many may have encounteredThe movie and the book are not the same thing: the book is an entertainment literature piece, with very accurate descriptions of important places of the world and a not very complex vocabulary or technique, but a very detailed view of the facts; the picture is a gift to the interested viewer and a clearly modified version of Dan Brown's novel, however done with the eye for entertainment, which becomes the only thing in common between both elements.<br/><br/>You see, Ron Howard is a truly gifted director and Akiva Goldsman is a truly gifted writer, but ""Da Vinci"" as a film was, above all things, a marketing project to them, and to Dreamworks of course. If Dan Brown had adapted the screenplay it would have probably been the longest this year; he couldn't have taken anything of, so that's what Goldsman did. <br/><br/>And that's also why the movie moves so fast. The viewer senses this too, but he doesn't mind because, just like in the novel, when ""The Da Vinci Code"" begins, you can't stop until you get to the end of it. This said, Howard is also very loyal to the viewer, giving him what he wants to get; showing him what he wants to see, the way he wants to see it. So basically, if the spectator hasn't read the book, he'll be amazed; with the accomplished frames and shots of places from all around Europe, as the book exposes. <br/><br/>Because of the same reasons I've been explaining, the cast is not given a chance to shine And it is an all-star cast! Tom Hanks in the main role of Robert Langdon is extremely measured and calm, but you can see clearly that it is not his fault and that he enjoyed playing the part. Audrey Tatou portrays a calm character in some way, so her performance just fits. <br/><br/>Jean Reno is also inside the ride, speaking his very best French and stealing every scene he is in. Alfred Molina participates a little bit as the Spanish Opus Dei member Manuel Aringarosa, who built his first church with the albino Silas, played fearlessly by the unique Paul Bettany. And do I have to mention Sir Ian McKellen's gracious presence as 'Sir' Leigh Teabing? Yes, a Sir playing a 'Sir', having a lot of fun.<br/><br/>That's what everybody had in ""The Da Vinci Code's"" set: fun. That's what the movie is and that's the feeling you get when looking at the audience trying to find out if they're buying the story or not; specially if you've read the novel. By the way, Hans Zimmer 's score is remarkable, perfect: the man is a genius."

","Dan Brown faced many weeks in court for plagiarism over this book, and somehow escaped, although it seemed to me that Holy Blood, Holy Grail, written by two TV producers in the early 1980s, certainly WAS the story behind it. Brown dodged the suit by having added all the daft puzzles that punctuate the so-called action. I visited a village on the Camargue coast called Les Trois Saintes Maries, where the tradition goes that the three Marys of the Holy Story landed and lived on, thus many people in the South of France would find nothing surprising about the basic proposal behind the balderdash that Brown trowels on top of it, replete with cod-codes in doggerel English verse --- a language that started to be used some thirteen hundred years after the Holy Story was invented. But it's fair enough that Brown published this rubbish: it's the millions of readers who lapped it up who need their heads read. They poured in to this movie in their millions, too, and the participants must be laughing all the way to the bank. The whole thing is preposterous, never believable for more than one minute, lousily written, appallingly acted and utterly gauche from start to finish. The mad monk, Silas, belongs in a horror film, his Opus Dei mentor in a farce, and the English Milord in a mental hospital. Even the requisite romance between the leading lady and the protagonist never occurs. When Hanks pulls it all out and announces: ""You are the closest living descendant of Jesus Christ"" our house rocked with wild laughter --- so thanks for that, at least, Mr Hanks."

","This movie received lots of 'hype' before its introduction, and that often signals 'mediocre.' Although it has an all-star cast and a competent director, the controversy surrounding it turns out to be more interesting than the movie itself.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is Dr. Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor specializing in symbols. In Paris a murder is committed in the Louvre, and his name is scribbled in blood by the victim. So that puts him directly on the suspect list, even though we know someone else is responsible.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou (of Amelie) shows up quickly as Agent Sophie Neveu. Their chief pursuer is Frenchman Jean Reno as Captain Bezu Fache. The trouble is many of these characters belong to a fictitious secret society to protect the faith. At issue is whether an old code left by da Vinci leads to the location of the Holy Grail. The movie is done in a style where the protagonists are being chased by the cops and each time they barely escape via a ruse right before getting caught. Plus, there are many slow-moving parts where characters talk and explain what is going on. Often it reminded me of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' in the way arcane clues are pieced together to lead them to the next set of clues in a different city or country.<br/><br/>Other key characters are Paul Bettany as the ghostly Silas and Alfred Molina as Bishop Manuel Aringarosa. My wife and I watched it on DVD, free from the library. She had read the book and said it was a faithful adaptation. Both of us thought it interesting, neither of us thought it was a particularly good thriller.<br/><br/>SPOILERS.

"general-melchett","9","0","1","17 December 2006"," Enjoyable, yet silly, the Da Vinci Code is another great film of 2006!
","The Da Vinci Code may have received far less than full universal acclaim, but it certainly didn't bomb at the box office (with overall takings of over $700 million worldwide) and was the financial success that all the producers were hoping for. It was a better book-to-film adaptation than Stormbreaker (and certainly a more profitable one), but it is easy to see why it flopped critically - some parts were really silly, and parts in which you were meant to gasp with shock, you burst out laughing. But while there's no denying it's just silly, it is also quite gripping in parts - the constant darkness in the Louvre and the blood all over the professor's body keep an appropriately haunting atmosphere throughout the start. And it stays true to its Christian roots, and doesn't leave out anything vital in the story. It would be better to read the book before watching the film to get a better understanding of what exactly is happening, but you can still vaguely keep along with the plot as it continues and there is a clear beginning, middle and end. It won't have you on the edge of your seat, it won't have you gasping in shock, but it will entertain - and I think that is why it did so well. Some of the photography was neat, and though the budget wasn't exactly tiny, it didn't exactly show off with massive epic sets and kept a rather small-scale atmosphere, like it was in the book. The ending is satisfying, and at the end, you realise the film stayed loyal to the book all along, and it managed to show off that fact with neat photography and a rather epic feel. But one person saved this film from total disaster - Ian McKellen. He managed to keep the film enjoyable and ham it up to restore faith - especially in the scenes at his mansion in which he revealed to Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu the truth about the ""Da Vinci Code"". There is only one bit in this film that will make you jump out of your seat (let's just say, it is a flashback (and it may not even frighten you)), and there isn't any high-octane action or explosions, but this is meant to be something that challenges the roots of Christian history. Though the film doesn't exactly do that, it does engage in the aspect of being a thriller and a big-budget book adaptation. Dan Brown can stay optimistic in the fact that his book has received a worthy adaptation and that both the book and the film have bought much more success than anybody could have anticipated. The Da Vinci Code is fun and quite fast-paced, but if you want something gripping and suspenseful, you'd be better off looking somewhere else. But then again, which kind of person doesn't enjoy a laugh? 9/10"
"moviefreakgirl","Null","0","2","17 December 2006"," Really Bad
","The DaVinci Code, the bestseller that sold as much as possible. This movie works...as a comedy. (Almost) everything is wrong on this, with the exception of Ian McKellen and some of the supporting cast. Come on, the book was a fun, exciting, light read, with a good sense of pace and a lot of interesting puzzles to solve. Not perfection or anything, but nice.<br/><br/>The movie just sucks. The screenplay has no sense of pace and it fails to keep you interested or making you feel anything by the characters. It just provokes a total detachment , and you can't avoid to feel all the story is ridiculous. The dialogs are clichéd and even if I didn't read the book (I didn't remember it very well, anyway) I would have been able to guess what was gonna happen next. All the flashbacks are useless and badly written, the emotional scenes lack any sort of meaning and all in all, this movie can't even entertain decently.<br/><br/>The direction is really, really awful. Ron Howard uses all the clichéd shots on the most clichéd order. He seems to think he's doing a brilliant job, with all the flashbacks done in a progressive way, so very kitsch, melodramatic and funny (that was not the objective). He fails to make this movie consistent or interesting, he isn't even OK.<br/><br/>The acting was the best thing about the movie, even if not too good. Tom Hanks is automatic and severely underused, you'd never say this is the same guy that delivered such an amazing performance in Forrest Gump and The Terminal. The same can be said for Audrey Tautou who was so amazing in Amélie. Paul Bettany, Alfred Molina and Jean Reno are underused and can't even develop their characters. Ian McKellen is the standout. He uses such a funny irony, witticism and cynicism in this character that he just becomes a joy to watch and the only thing worthy on this.<br/><br/>The music is very annoying, It's always trying to make scenes exciting, but it doesn't. It just manages to sound overplayed and too loud. The editing is terrible; the movie lacks a decent pace and the scenes come and go in a meaningless, boring order and the transitions are amateur. The cinematography is sappy, with the color used in an obvious way. It's meant to be very touching and beautiful, but it isn't. Overall, a movie that should be avoided by everyone. Recommend this to your worst enemies. I pity them."

","The Da Vinci Code was one of my favorite fiction books of the last few years so I was extremely apprehensive about the movie version. Akiva Goldsman who adapted the novel has had ups and downs with screenplays over the years, but when he's good, he's good. His adaptations of two Grisham novels (another of my favorite authors) fell into that category and, luckily, he's good here too.<br/><br/>Though the film lacks some of the suspense of the book, and has sequences of the entertaining treasure hunt omitted for time's sake, it retains enough of the original charm to carry it along for its long 149 minute running time. Ron Howard knows how to direct a big exciting film and this is apparent in the Da Vinci Code. Every scene is beautifully lit and framed and manages to retain the viewer's interest despite a lot of historical exposition. Unfortunately, there is a LOT of historical exposition that simply works better in printed form than on the screen. Still, Howard gives it his best shot and largely succeeds.<br/><br/>One criticism I have is with the finale. It doesn't feel important or exciting enough for what it reveals. The book did it so much better.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks would not have been my first (or even fourth) choice for Robert Langdon, but he is a terrific actor and pulls it off fairly well. The supporting cast is wonderful, especially Paul Bettany as the creepy and tragic Silas, and the ever dependable Sir Ian McKellan attacks his part with relish. They, as much as the leads and director, make the film a worthwhile, if not great, view."
"magic-89","3","0","2","7 December 2006"," A dark and disappointing adaptation
","Let me state at the outset that I am not going to debate the merits or otherwise of the storyline. Dan Brown himself has gone to great pains to point out that ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a work of fiction, and it even so says on on the book's cover. The truth or otherwise of the story has been debated to death, suffice to say that I treated the book and the movie alike as fiction.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, I have to say that I am no doubt in the minority here, but I found it highly disappointing and one of the worst big screen adaptations of a blockbuster novel ever, the putrid ""Raise The Titanic!"" aside.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, had I not already read the book, I would have had virtually no idea of what on earth was going on. One problem is immediately identifiable. The way the book is written, with so much reliance on codes and clever word games (anagrams) simply does not lend itself to a smooth transition to film. Although I read the book in one weekend, there were several passages that I would reread or stop and ponder upon for a few moments, before continuing. This obviously doesn't work with a film, where you have to follow the story at the film's pace and not your own.<br/><br/>Secondly, too much of the movie is set at night and/or in dark environments, where I found it difficult to see what was happening while still trying to follow the often heavily-accented dialogue. Admittedly I watched the movie on DVD and it may have come across better on the big screen, but I somehow doubt it.<br/><br/>Thirdly, there is too much detail in the novel to make a movie of acceptable length. Thus the film, while trying to say as faithful to Brown's tale as possible, rushes through many scenes in a desperate bid to get everything in without going on all night as it does so. It could be argued that the scriptwriters and everyone involved with the project took the view that almost everybody who watched the movie would have already read the book anyway. It certainly comes across that way, but that isn't the purpose of filming a book, is it? On top of everything else, I though the acting was largely weak. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, but he is seriously miscast as professor-turned reluctant action hero Dr Robert Langdon. Harrison Ford, for instance, would have been a much more effective choice. Audrey Tautou's accent may be charming, but it made it extremely hard to understand what she was saying, a serious flaw for so central a character. And although I enjoy Jean Reno's acting, is he really the only French actor who can speak English? He seems to turn up in every movie that requires a French male character these days. Having said that, he is just about the only person in this entire movie who is believable in the role he or she is playing.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie, read the book first. Read the book anyway, and draw your own conclusions, if you haven't already done so. The film version, however, is strictly superfluous."
"little_socrates1","6","0","2","4 December 2006"," Good ideas, dull story.
","This book should've stayed a book, but moving it to screens will spread the interesting ideas.<br/><br/>If the DaVinci Code had not had the muddled story of Tom Hanks and the woman whose name I do not remember, the movie would have been much clearer. And Ian McEllan's appearance was weaker than it was in X-Men III, which was his most recent work to DaVinci, as in maybe a month or two: guess which he liked more? All that was gained, in my humble opinion (IMHO), out of the characters was the speech by Tom Hanks at the beginning of the movie; that was an awesome speech that blew me away. It made very, very good points, and would have been interesting to have been at in reality.<br/><br/>DaVinci Code has interesting ideas about Mary Magdelene and the Bible Pals, but it's really just a big conspiracy theory that's interesting when you think about it, even though you know it's not true. But the characters muddle it a bunch more than is enjoyable, when the movie (and book that I have not read) should really just be a presentation of the ideas.<br/><br/>Big-name actors act a little down and ideas get muddled, but if you catch anything, it'll make you think for a few days. A 6 out of 10. If you're smart enough to get the ideas, though, just read the book if you have the time."
"Antagonisten","4","0","2","4 December 2006"," Long-winding
","I could start out by stating the obvious here, that the movie wasn't as good as the book. But that would imply that i found the book to be good, which i didn't really. Don't get me wrong, it was OK and i didn't fall asleep reading it nearly as often as i fell asleep watching this movie.<br/><br/>The thing with ""The Da Vinci Code"" is that the story isn't that interesting to me. Maybe it's because i've never been a religious person, never been in a family that goes regularly to church and all that. But the subject of the virgin Mary and the Holy Grail is just not that mind-boggling to me. For people who have more of a personal relationship with the Christian mythology it must be something else completely. The book was a pretty smart spin on the whole story though, i have to admit that although i'm no fan of Dan Brown's writing style.<br/><br/>This, however, is a review of a movie so let's get down to business. There are three major faults in this movie in my opinion. The one you notice first is Tom Hanks. He's just not good as the Robert Langdon i remembered from the book. Hanks is all wrong and everybody seems to realize it except himself. I admire Tom Hanks for his ability to be at least decent in almost every movie he does, but here it's just wrong. He's not bad, but it would have been so much better with someone else. The second thing is that the whole point of the book, the riddles and mysteries, is almost wasted here. Sure we get some special effects showing us how Langdon sees patterns and deciphers code in his head, but it's never exciting nor intelligent like it was (at least occasionally) in the book. Third and last is the length and pace of the movie. It's far too long-winded with endless scenes and a very slow pace that isn't very inspiring. Since the riddles didn't work very well one could have thought that they would go for the more fast-paced thriller style (which could have worked well with the content in my opinion). Instead it's a slow and methodical iteration of almost every scene in the book. And it's not exciting at all.<br/><br/>It's always hard to film a literary success like ""The Da Vinci Code"". People have read the book, liked it, and their expectations are astronomical. These expectations are made to disappoint, and i guess most people didn't really like this movie either (even though they might cut it some slack because at least it looks nice). My expectations on the other hand were quite mellow and i was still somewhat disappointed. Sure, Ron Howard is perhaps the most boring director of his generation, and sure Tom Hanks is not someone who lifts a production all by himself. But still, there was enough cinematic style and content in the book to make a very decent movie. But i can't call this anything other than a failure. And not only that, it's a boring and very long-winding failure, which is even worse.<br/><br/>I rate it 4/10."

","Given previous great performances by Tom Hanks (for example, in ""Apollo 13"" or even ""The Burbs"") I had high expectations for this film. The plot, at least if the original source is considered, had more than enough in its favour -- after all, there have been blockbusters and hit films with much worse to work from, and the supporting cast also looked very promising. The locations in the story would also make for great scenes in a movie -- or so I thought...<br/><br/>The best part of the film are the supporting cast. Jean Reno in particular was very good, and everyone else put in an honest day's work or better. However, the director did not take advantage of the great locations as much as he could have, with dark and/or short scenes where next to nothing is visible, the actors mutter a few lines, none of the actually simplistic but ostensibly intricate aspects of the Jesus mythology are explained, and the next scene comes on too quickly despite the fact that the entire film has a ""slow"" pace about it. Along the same lines, not enough (mock) art history is presented in the dialogue to allow someone that has not read the book to follow what the characters are thinking and why. <br/><br/>Hanks did an adequate job looking out of place and socially semi-inept, however, he still did not approach the overall ""feel"" of a genuine academic. Perhaps attending more wine-and- cheese events after seminars would have helped him get a better feel for his character. <br/><br/>There are good moments nonetheless. Silas is done well and his scenes tend to steal the show. Also, the last scene is IMO the best in the film, and one of the view scenes where Howard uses the surroundings to his advantage in order to bring the viewer into the action. <br/><br/>Not bad, but not as good as it could have been."

","I liked Dan Brown's novel - a good yarn. I was sad to see how boring the film was (I watched the extended version on DVD). There was so little of the suspense of the book and even the ""baddies"" were really not so bad. The assassin was a creepy character in the book - approaching a Michael Myers - in the film one felt rather sorry for him, he was more like a BBC producer's catamite from a deprived background! There was no sense of urgency or menace at all.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a good actor but miscast here, perhaps, and Audrey Tautou was very wooden. Jean Reno and Ian McKellen are very talented so I do think the blame had to rest with the director. Having said that, watch it by all means, but have some strong coffee on the go."

","Reading the ""professional"" reviewers opinions of The Da Vinci Code reinforces my own opinion that the stronger the negativity of the critics the better the movie actually is. It slays me that some of the so-called expert critics lambasted this movie while admitting in their reviews that they didn't even bother to read the book (suggesting a reason underlying their unsophisticated reviews and lack of insight). Pleasing the dim-witted reviewers was far down the list of aims of the director, cast, screenwriters, and the other artists who created this film. Rather they aimed for, and achieved, the impressive goals of faithfully portraying Dan Brown's novel and creating an outstanding movie that is intense and intelligent. My hope is that people who missed this film on the big screen will ignore the biased and unimaginative reviewers and see this film on DVD. It is provocative and, even if implausible, shows wonderful imagination along with a different historical perspective that shouldn't be so easily dismissed."

Well worth waiting for. And of course, Sir Ian McKellen, you've got to like him, he's Gandalf! This role was a little different for him, but I still liked it. The visuals, and of course, the acting was great. The storyline, like I said, was great.

","The book was a great combination of history and mystery that turn into a whirlwind of twists and turns. The movie is a faithful adaptation, at least as faithful one can be with a 2 1/2 hour long time slot.<br/><br/>As a whole Ron Howard goes through the story with style and class. Moments in the book where Lagdon explains moment in history or figures things out are shown in the movie as great flashback sequences or numbers rearranging themselves in air. It is used to great effect here.<br/><br/>The ambiance is spot on giving you a feeling of foreboding and dread along with the sense that you are a part of something far greater than yourself.<br/><br/>The casting in this film seems perfect on paper. But not all of them are spot on. Tom Hanks particularly felt a bit flat in his portrayal of Robert Langdon. When he would get into history his tone would veer immediately into pretentiousness that became annoying. Not only till after Teaping shows up does Hanks really step up and become Robert Langdon.<br/><br/>The other disappointment here is Alfred Molina who does little to set Aringarosa apart from the other character. He seems unimportant and simply a distraction from the actual plot.<br/><br/>On the other hand Paul Battany and Audrey Tautou shine brightly as Silas the Albino and Sophie Neveu respectively. They bring their character's pain to life in haunting realism. Silas feels he has to mutilate himself just so he can get to heaven, and the first time Sophie sees her grandfather in ten years is at the scene of his murder. Both bring emotion to the film, which would've been awful if the wrong actors were cast.<br/><br/>The true star however is Ian McKellen as Leigh Teaping. But then again, Ian McKellen brings life to every character he portrays.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is anything but subtle. Hans Zimmer does his usual style of composure where the music takes on a life of it's own in the scene. The tracks are haunting and beautiful making each scene what it is. Whether it be exciting, exploratory, or gruesome in nature, Hans constructs a song to match in tone.<br/><br/>The ending, which should've been explosive, was reduced to nothing more than a passing event, that is followed by twenty more minutes of history and back story. It wouldn't have been so bad only you end up feeling the movie had ended long before it actually does.<br/><br/>I had hoped for a good adaptation and that is exactly what I got. If only it was a bit shorter and Tom Hanks filled out his role a bit better then this could've been an easy ten."

Having read the book 3 times, I know about most of the (sometimes) intentional faults and mistakes the book contains (just one of them being that the number of glass-parts in the Louvre-pyramid is not 666, some people say it is 637 instead which I doubt as well, because 637 is not dividable by 4 without a rest (as is the case with 666).<br/><br/>But knowing all the faults and flaws of the book, it is still a masterpiece in what it intended to be, a nailbiter as a thriller, conspiracy theory, fictional and mystic, a good base for discussions as many things COULD be as the book describes them, even though some are most unlikely while others are not.<br/><br/>However, I was eager to see the film even though I feared possible disappointment. And how disappointed I was (and still am). Tom Hanks is a total miscast and acts throughout the whole film as if he hadn't to do ANYTHING with the stat or the plot, he just acts as if he wouldn't belong there. Audrey Tautou is no better. No question she is a beautiful girl with beautiful eyes, but that's not enough for the role of Sophie Neveu. Sophie is a clever young woman driving the story forward actively in the book, not so in the film. She too seems to belong somewhere else, to another story, but not to this film.<br/><br/>I wonder if all this comes from bad and poor directing alone, since Sir Ian is doing a great job as Sir Leigh Teabing as does Paul Bettany as Silas. But that's all. Even Jean Reno as Bezu Fache is performing at his worst, I have to say, even though I normally like Jean Reno a lot, but not in this film.<br/><br/>It can only be bad directing (and a bad script most likely too) that has turned this great and thrilling book into a less than mediocre and disappointing movie. Films rarely are as good as their books, but did it have to be THAT bad?<br/><br/>Not to talk about the disappointment that stems from the script: even though this is a 2:47 hours film, they have really made it to have some important things missing, like e.g. that in the book there are 2 crypts (a smaller one in the big one), the code for the bigger one being ""sofia"" and when they open the first cryptex in the book, you believe that finally ... ""ahhhh, at last they have unveiled the secret, they finally made it"", just to find out that nothing was won with this victory, since just another cryptex comes to light and suspension continues. Not so in the film. And this is not the only thing left out, not the only aberration from the book. Even though the have 2:47 hours time to deal with all that, Ron Howard and a miscast of crew have made a total disappointment of what could have been a great movie otherwise.<br/><br/>However, for all those who have not read the book yet, it could be worthwhile to watch the movie, so they can be pleasantly surprised later on when the read the book later. Was it my mistake to chose the other order?<br/><br/>One good thing at least is, that when you buy the Limited Edition of the DVD, you get a really nicely done copy of a real cryptex in the box (even though the price is horrifying).<br/><br/>For the general public my recommendation is: read the book, read it twice or as often as you like, but leave out the movie. Better you make your own movie in your own mind, it will most likely be much better than the film by Ron Howard.<br/><br/>Sad, very sad and a great disappointment!"

","I have been a fan of Dan Brown for some years and have read all his novels, The Da Vinci Code being the first. The book is extraordinary. If you allow the story line to be 'believable' then this is a thrilling ride(in words that is). Then the film comes out, clearly commissioned on the very high crest of popularity and controversy. This in effect is both the film's success and downfall. It is clear that when a book excels from the dialogue it generates, it cannot be completely recaptured on film without making it unwieldy and over long. It therefore must be seen as a film in its own right. Any attempt to compare it to the book is misleading as both media have their own strengths and limitations. Before you see the film therefore, do not presume that it is going to instill the same sense of awe and wonder (afterall you already know what message the film is trying to convey if you have read the book !) part of the success in the book is the newness of the ideas. Assuming the film will have the same impact as the book is a bit like opening the same Christmas present twice expecting it to have the same feel. <br/><br/>The film itself is good, the storyline is faithful to the book and the set scenes are handled with some panache (Ron Howard's experience in these scenes come through well). I agree with some critics that the dialogue at times is weak and the chemistry with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatu is woefully thin, but these are offset by the wonderful Paul Bettany and the ever reliable Ian McKellern.<br/><br/>If you have read the book then enjoy the film as a fair representation of the key ideas, if you haven't read the book, then be prepared to be thrilled by a film with a stunning message, watch with an open mind and an open sense of what you want in a film and you may well be surprised at just how much you enjoyed this controversial film."

Audrey Tautou does a good job as Sophie Neveu, and Paul Bettany is excellent as Silas. The direction by Ron Howard is excellent. He manages to keep the atmosphere of the book. The cinematography and the special effects are very nice, and the scenes at The Louvre (the glass pyramid) are beautifully done.

On the bad side the two main actors do not really deliver, or even seem to be too interested in the roles. Yes, it is a performance to make Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou look un-interested and un-interesting, but director Ron Howard succeeds to do it, even for the great fan of the two actors that I happen to be. In this case I will probably remember better some of the supporting roles.<br/><br/>Nothing or not too much of the mystery of the subject makes it to the screen.

When i saw it at the cinema there were periodical ripples of laughter sweeping across everyone in the screen I was in, and indeed the bits that stick out in my mind were the unintentionally funny bits, such as when someone dramatically exclaims ""Let's go to the library!"". Asides from that, totally forgettable."

","The Da Vinci Crap is one of the worst books ever written and Dan Brown is a lousy writer. Besides from creating a conspiracy theory that is so far fetched that its laughable, the actual story itself, is so simple it could have been written by a 12 year old kid. The characters are vaguely described and boring and I for one don't care what happens to them.<br/><br/>As for the movie, they have done everything wrong.First of all Tom Hanks, my god, the man couldn't be a worse Robert Langdon even if he tried. In the book he is described as a tall, handsome, middle aged goodlooking man. Tom Hanks is too old, he looks like a dork and he is ugly. David Duchovny from The X-files would have been perfect as Langdon. He is goodlooking, a better actor and not a pain in the ass like Hanks. But he is not a star like Hanks and I bet Howard never even considered anyone else besides his old friend Hanks for that part. Then they cast Audrey Tautou as Sophie. Sure she is pretty but probably the worst acting I have ever seen. And there is no chemistry between her and Hanks what so ever. Paul Bettany is excellent however as Silas, the only interesting character in the book/movie and Ian McKellen and Jean Reno are also good.<br/><br/>Then, Ron Howard, for reasons unknown decided to change things from the book and add new scenes. Like the scene on the plane where Sophie confronts Silas. what is the point of that scene?? And the way Silas dies, probably Howard thought it should be more dramatized. And then there is the ending which sucks!!! The real ending at least worked in the book. But I guess Howasrd must have thought to himself: I've already cast the wrong actor for the lead, so Im gonna ruin the ending as well.<br/><br/>They should have made a movie out of Angels and Demons instead. It has a better story, more action and more interesting characters. Still bad because Dan Brown is the author, but much better than The Da vinci Crap."

","Some people who have seen this movie think it is nothing compared to the book. But I think it is hard for the director to make it up to the standard that the book is because some people think that it is one of the best book ever written. I think it is not a bad movie but I don't think Tom Hanks is the right actor for the part, he is a good actor but not right for the part. Maybe David Duchovny or Sean Bean. Some people might not agree with me though. This movie is good and full of action it is a movie definitely worth watching even if you don't particularly like it. I think Ian Mckellen acted extremely well, same with Paul Bettany. This movie will keep you at the edge of you seat at all times."

","Of the many hyped-up films of recent times this is perhaps the most disappointing. It could have been a great film but as it's finally presented it is not. Within about twenty minutes of the start, we become disinterested in the numerous revelations along the way because they are thrust at us like a huge sword at every opportunity and then only to keep us awake during the often tedious journey ahead. I'm of the opinion that most of the faults of this film are attributable to Ron Howard's directing. Apart from Apollo 13, his films are drawn out and he has trouble getting the actors to do their stuff. Audrey Tautou as the French agent would have been credible had she not been paired with Tom Hanks for most of the film. Ian McKellen, Jean Reno and Paul Bettany were great in their roles, but Tom Hanks looks very out of place and frequently resorts to a ""what am I doing here?"" look on his face. He looks totally lost. <br/><br/>Overall, The Da Vinci Code is around an hour too long. There is just far too much repetitive dialogue, as if to make points obvious to the dullest of audience members, and far too little actual story telling. However, the film is far from a total loss as it does pose some interesting questions and the car being driven through busy Paris traffic in reverse was OK but as far as plot twists go most are predictable. Perhaps the marketing hype just worked too well on me and I set my expectations too high, but I think not."

I have read the ""Holy Bood and the Holy Grail"" and Dan Brown has reinforced my findings that Jesus was as is described in the two books.<br/><br/>I consider this movie just about perfect; the standard expected from Ron Howard. I note the list of Goofs, mainly continuity errors, so what. How many famous directors have turned out a movie with no continuity errors. Hitchcock had many and he was a perfectionist.

I did go back and tried to look at the movie as something separate from the book and I came up with the following conclusions: The cinematography is visually stunning, and the movie is quite fast paced for its running-time which makes it more enjoyable. I loved the bits showing the precedent history Â– the goddess statues and roman-like buildings. I wanted so much more of that! Sir Ian McKellan truly becomes his character and delivers a terrific performance; he's a brilliant actor. Tom Hanks has to win a razzie award for his role as Robert Langdon, he was dead. The script should be burned, and the scene where Sophie puts her foot on the pond's surface should be banned for its sheer embarrassment. 'The Da Vinci Code' is a cowardly film with no bones, just flesh & skin and completely fails to open up the door of discussion that it should have. Would also recommend National Treasure"

","I finished the book last night, I know its taken me forever to read the book but I was reading it while on a tour of Europe and got to the Louvre before finishing it and also saw the Mona Lisa because it was part of the book.<br/><br/>I must say that after just watching the movie, I was a bit disappointed that there are major chunks left out.<br/><br/>For example, Sophies role was significantly smaller in the movie. She is an integral part of the book and should have had a bigger part in the movie, Audrey Tautou was perfect for this role which justifies my point.<br/><br/>The fact that Dan Brown was an Executive Producer is not evident after watching the movie, I understand that certain things must be changed when adapting a book for the big screen but the fact that the end was different to the book causes it to lose what could have been a very touching ending. I feel that as a producer of the movie, and because he wrote the book, he should have made sure that as much from the book was kept in the movie.<br/><br/>Then there is the glaring lack of the double security with the keystone, it was meant to have 2 cryptexs (spelling) and not just the one. Sophie did not recognise the writing on the back of the rose from the box.<br/><br/>So for me, there were too many thing missing.<br/><br/>Part of what made the book so great was the fact that it was more of a treasure hunt, with all the riddles and the thinking behind it, the detail that Dan Brown goes into about each and every single different facet of the various groups is lost.<br/><br/>I guess that things had to be changed for the movie, if you have not read the book, the first hour is a mystery. I watched the movie with a friend and I just said that in time things will (hopefully) fall into place. In some ways they did, in some ways they didn't.<br/><br/>Good movie, outstanding book.

","Well, this movie was quite anti-catholic. But if this is the best anti-catholics can do, the catholics have nothing to worry about. Despite of, or perhaps because of, it's chase pace, this movie is rather sedate and unbewitching. It's like a bad episode of X-files or perhaps even an elaborate Riddler ruse from 60's Batman. Allow me to surmise the plot: Tom Hanks: Did you know, sexy inspector, that Christ may have had webbed feet? Look at the holy ghost: three parts? You see? It's so obvious. Oh no, let's go to England for no reason, cops are after us! Cop: Err, I'm not going to make a roadblock, damnit! I'm french! Overrated Gandalf: I'm just an old man, mumble mumble subtle feminism mumble conspiracy theory mumble JFK..."" Corrupt Evil Preists: We're corrupt evil priests. Muhahah... Etc. The part with the evil priests was perhaps the most depressing part of this film, considering how long it probably took to film and how completely inconsequential it was to the movie's plot. The first time the bishop runs into anyone else featured in the actual plot, he gets himself killed. The main characters are mere ciphers, brought to life by the scourge of filmdom, the flashback. And yet these flashbacks are so opaque and lifeless that they don't do much to further the character's inner lives. Well, okay, that's fair. So it's not a drama. Alright. But what about these brilliant clues, the thrill of the chase, etc.? Well, if you're idea of a puzzle ends at an anagram, then alright. But most of the puzzles were of the outlandish kind, yet worked at such a way you didn't really have time to see if the solutions were accurate. They were all markedly unremarkable, forgettable. I'm not even sure if ""The Davinci Code"" of the title was ever explained. And the chase by police is merely, of course, to lift the suspense. But it's handled so casually it barely lifted my eyelids. Well, all this can be fun and games, but not when it's 2 1/2 hours long... and probably not when it makes dodos feel intelequal (sic) and paints an institution that's been around for 2000 years as cardboard villains. The Davinci code won't mesmerize you, and I hope it won't brainwash you either. It also just reeks of that smarmish Hollywood feel. I am Hollywood, thy god. I shalt make cinema masterpieces reflecting the shadow of genius but never actually creating it. Thou shall worship me as clever, as art, and as law. They say Hollywood is godless, and thank god. When it tries to curry some heavy topics, it just ends up flat."

","Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou star in long-awaited big-screen adaptation of Dan Brown's famous novel.<br/><br/>Dan Brown's novels have become rather legendary in their own right, and thanks to the stunning success of his 3rd novel, The Da Vinci Code, have made their author a multi-millionaire.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci code was set in France, and featured a Harvard scholar, Robert Langdon, and a French policewoman, Sophie Neveu, and its principle subject was that of the Catholic religion and its secrets and history.<br/><br/>Hanks is Langdon, and Tautou is Neveu. The story starts out with Langdon being interrupted at an engagement by the police, who wish his help solving a crime. However, events take an unexpected turn and before he knows it he is battling Gendarmes, the Catholic church, and unseen forces of apparent evil.<br/><br/>The great strength of the novel was its electric pace and popcorn action - it was thrilling stuff, and gripped the reader from the first line onwards. Truth is the big screen version captures this surprisingly well. The pace is just as quick, and while plenty of aspects of the novel didn't make it, the adaptation is overall surprisingly faithful.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the novel had plenty of major characters, and they all make it to the big screen intact - Ian McKellen's Leigh Teabing, Alfred Molina's Biship Arangosa, Paul Bettany's brilliant Silas, and Jean Reno's Fache. The cast for this one was definitely heavyweight.<br/><br/>That said, the acting wasn't particularly good in this. McKellen was decent enough, and Jean Reno did a good job of a cop on the edge, but the 2 main protagonists Hanks and Tautou were frankly average - in places Hanks visibly struggles with the dialogue, and seems to be looking elsewhere for inspiration.<br/><br/>But the strength of the novel was the plot, and that makes it into translation pretty well - the one word which describes this movie is 'entertaining' - it's a fast rip roaring yarn which may take itself a bit seriously but manages to engage well for its duration.<br/><br/>The direction helps hugely - it's non-stop and never slows down to ponder - there are no boring sequences in evidence.<br/><br/>And if you overlook the staple acting, and the fact there are apparently occasional leaps of bizarre logic (Which the movie couldn't explain in the way the novel could) then it's a really engaging movie which should grab your attention."

As for the acting, Tom Hanks is always convincing and real, but Paul Bettany made me feel pity on the deceived and used character of Silas, he was perfect.

I was thinking that if the same book was written with the same ending of the movie, and later, a motion-picture, it would have been the most work ever to be so out-spoken to such extent.

"buttfedge","8","0","1","24 August 2006"," Da Vinci suffered from book to film.. but barely
","right.. everyone saw it.. it was the biggest deal for a while.. religion, always a big draw for the wings of average movie-goers. but, for those of you waiting for the delux-super-remixed-director's-cut DVD to come out before you waste your time watching it, i've got a couple words to say about the DaVinci Code (no spoilers). i'm not going to go into an in depth book review, but it was at the very least a very decent book. easy reading, characters that really captured your interest, action that blended well into non-action sequences. the only flaw i might pick at excessively is that it reads very very much like a movie script. i could practically see the camera zooms and the back-lit sets dropping into place, and the dialogue often reads like a series of close-ups. i don't know exactly HOW it came off so effortlessly like someone (Dan Brown) had seen the movie National Treasure and thought ""man, i could write a movie like that, but make it way more 'adult' by including cult-stuff!"", but it did. now, the movie based off the book (DaVinci Code, remember), came out pretty well.. fine performances, nice police-thriller feel, good direction, etc.. probably one of Paul Bettany's most outstanding performances, that being said, he was absolutely not the ideal actor for the role.. the book has the albino as a very distinct physical presence.. Bettany ALMOST makes up for it with his overwhelming attitude and facial acting, but a key element of Silas for me was that when he enters a situation (like the church, with the nun), other characters automatically see this huge hulking beast of a man, and then Silas speaks, and is very soft-spoken, and the initial rush of fear becomes one of slightly confused/off-kilter pity and ease.. which makes for a much more dynamic villain! and I'm afraid Bettany just doesn't have the automatic fear reaction.. simply being all white does not a scary-man make.. i couldn't go picking a better actor for the part, but Silas NEEDED to be bigger.. Tom Hanks, with the fakest looking hair i've ever seen, does an adequate job in his role, but he IS an extremely accomplished actor, and would've done that anyway.. i feel he does his character justice, as does Audrey Tautou, while not as cute and innocent as the Amelie we all know and love, Agent Nevue wasn't meant to be, so it came off well. the supporting cast was extra-fine, the french police played both 'dumb cop' and 'smart/sharp-eyed detective' very well in ever instance they were meant to, and made the characters believable enough for any and all transitions between the two extremes..<br/><br/>one thing i was depressed with was the casting of Ian McKellen in the role of Sir Teabing.. in the book, when we first meet Teabing, he's simply another tertiary character, humorous and helpful, but casting McKellen makes it obvious that we've just gotten our third main character. i far prefer the book's presentation of him as an expanding background character, not much more important than his driver, and then the humorous french-hating brit grows on us and becomes a part of the group in a much more natural feeling way.. in order to accomplish the same end result, we would've needed a much less known actor cast here.. but then, where are we going to find older British actors who aren't well known?!?.. honestly, i think John Cleese as played enough cameos, he could've pulled it off, and he's well suited to the growth of the character later on.. the book is full of characters who grow and become more and less than they were, and the movie for the most part matches them up.. Alfred Molina is a prime example. casting perfection. if the characters of Silas and Teabing had been chosen differently, to try to stick to the feeling of the book more appropriately (although, admittedly my distaste for McKellen is based on a much more surreal objection.. and i love ian mckellen, don't get me wrong, he does a great job, and always does.. he just brought too big a name to a character that in the book really benefited from being under-lit.. ), this movie would've been absolutely a Must-See.. as it is, it's only barely 'worth-watching'..<br/><br/>(oh, and in response to the previous review, yes, Tom Hanks' character was supposed to be a very unwilling protagonist, and he succeeded admirably)"

","I had not read the best selling novel of all time (next to the Bible of course) before seeing this film, and still have not finished it. The book gives much more information and adds a more believable structure to the plot of Jesus Christ having a child. But the film does well enough and is quite enjoyable adventure romp much like Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. Why people are so angry at the thought of Jesus being a MAN, of being married and having a child. It was not written in the Bible and therefore people do not find the idea of the Bible being as much a book as The DaVinci Code is acceptable. I look not to anger people, but the result of a simple film (aptly labeled fiction) boggles my mind. <br/><br/>Acting: 9/10<br/><br/>Almost every actor in this film does a scrumptious job with the roles they are given. If I were Ron Howard (which I am not), I wouldn't have thought of Tom Hanks. Yet Howard did and Hanks gives a fulfilling performance. Audrey Tautou is an actress I didn't even know existed. But someone did and props to them, for without them Tautou's lovely performance wouldn't be. Alfred Molina, whom is a great actor, does decently, but really serves as more of a distraction in such a small role. Sir Ian McKellen gives a very fun performance. Be it a wizard, Shakespeare, or big magnetic villain, McKellen does what McKellen does: He does well. Paul Bettany (reuniting with A Beautiful Mind director Howard) does an incredible job. Again, I don't look at Bettany and immediately snap my fingers and say ""Yep! He should play an albino!"" but he pulls it all off well. Jean Reno is the go to guy for French characters. And any charm he had has worn off. I am tired of always seeing Jean Reno play Jean Reno in EVERY French role. He isn't an Oscar winner, and the typecast leaves no originality to his characters. With so much fun and unexpected casting, I expected Ron Howard and Co. to pick a better choice. At least everyone else does well.<br/><br/>Writing: 8/10<br/><br/>The books endless stream of information is quite shortened to fit the 2 and a half hour limit of the film, and there is still a large amount of information to behold, and deciphering it in but 150 minutes is fun, challenging, and enjoyable. With so little competition this year, I sense a 'Best Adapted Screenplay' Oscar nomination around the corner. <br/><br/>Directing: 8/10<br/><br/>There is a tad too much cheese in some scenes, here and there a scene is overdone or undercooked. Yet overall we have delicious visuals, action, and intrigue. Sorry Ronny, but no Oscar is a-coming this year, but well done to you for a fine job. <br/><br/>Visual Effects: Not too much is done CGI in this one, but there are several scenes that include and they are all very realistic. Nothing revolutionary, but they pull an ""oooohh"" and ""awwww"" here and there. 8/10<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10/10<br/><br/>The film is simply scrumptiously shot. The lighting, the color palette, the locations, the hand-held. All bloody well done. An Oscar nomination (and possibly win) is here waiting. <br/><br/>Score: 9/10<br/><br/>Fantastic. I could have used a little more power to the music in this one, but it catches the thriller and adventure feel perfect. This is definitely one of 2006's best scores (along with Hans Zimmer's stunning score for Pirates Of The Caribbean). Yet another Oscar nom is here. Though in the end I think Mr. Zimmer will either lose it to another, or possibly to himself for Pirates. <br/><br/>This film is quite flawed, but seriously entertaining.

","This movie is an amazing thriller that actually makes you stop and think about things we have been taught our entire life. And moreover, it makes us talk. Not to ourselves, but to each other. It's an amazing concept and you can make fun of Mr. Hanks hair until the sun comes up, but the movie is amazing. I understand that this is supposedly a ""fictional"" account, but there are lots of articles and books on the subject going back many years. Being Wiccan and a feminist, I think it's worth looking into. It raises questions about reading books or watching movies that you normally wouldn't be entertained by. Give this one a chance, it's an astounding mix of historical fact and well written fiction."

","I'm a writer; I spend most of my leisure time either reading or writing. Frequently when I compare an original literary work with a successive motion picture, I often fall into the purist view that the book is better. There have been some exceptions to this rule: Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" direction is better than Tolkien's writing skills (and I'm a Tolkien fan, if you can believe that) and Polanski's ""The Ninth Gate"" is somewhat better than Reverte's The Club Dumas.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Dan Brown is a mediocre writer who discovered pay-dirt with an innovative, controversial story. His writing skills are not literary, but close to dime store level. He's passable, yes, but definitely not in the league of moving and profound writers as Norman Mailer, K Vonnegut, or Thomas Mann. The novel, The Da Vinci Code, and it's prequel, Angels and Demons, are fast reads and fun. They deliver an escape while you are sitting on a subway on rush hour.<br/><br/>With the over-hype of the novel, we suddenly have the inevitable attempt at a motion picture. Usually these revisions are mediocre (at best) or fall by the wayside. Yet, in the motion picture ""The DA Vinci Code"", we have a visual depth that the literary relative of it falls completely short of.<br/><br/>I watched the motion picture, enthralled by the visual artwork and the intricacies of plot. It was soberly done, even with the controversial casting of Tom Hanks in the lead role. Hanks is usually (to me) overbearing and self-important in his later roles, and he doesn't stop here, however, he is believable - more believable than the Robert Langdon from the books. Tom Hank's Langdon is smart, reserved, and appears to be exactly an intellectual in reality; the Langdon in the novels comes off more as a McGuffin to move the story along, rather than experience it.<br/><br/>I'm a big Gandalf fan, but I'm not a Mysterio fan, so my reception of Ian McKellen's performance in this movie is neutral. I think he's interesting here, but somehow more aloof and somewhat more of the X-Man villain than the wise wizard type. Therefore, his performance at least comes off somewhat wooden.<br/><br/>The cinematography is enough to enhance the shots, but are somewhat lacking (in a minor consideration). The exotic locales are hard not to keep a deep aesthetic luster, even if they'd been shot with a VHS camcorder and sent in to ""America's Funniest Home Videos"". But I think you get my point.<br/><br/>The movie is cerebral and smart, the book a puzzle with gimmicks. Don't go into the theater as the novel fan, but as someone who enjoys a movie to stand on it's own. You'll find this motion picture stronger and more satisfying."

","Finally I can cross The Da Vinci Code off my list of movies to see. While I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, I was on the fence when the prospect of going to the movie came up. In the end, I realized it needed to be seen on the big screen, and I'm glad that was the decision. It, of course, paled in comparison to the book, but all in all was still a successful adaptation, staying true for its entirety. Unfortunately, because it stayed so true is why it wasn't a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I give full credit to the actors, each did their role justiceeven Tom Hanks as our hero Robert Langdon, the one character I went in not thinking was perfectly cast. Jean Reno and Ian McKellen were brilliant as Captain Fache and Sir Teabing respectively, Audrey Tautou and Alfred Molina brought credibility to their parts, and Paul Bettany encompassed the albino Silas perfectly. Bettany truly stole the show and it's a shame many of his scenes were cut in the adapting process, leading him to just be a villain with only small shades of the misguided, lost soul he really was. I am also thankful that the filmmakers made the Hanks/ Tautou dynamic more of a friendship then budding love affair as it was in the book. The age gap of the actors was just too much for it to work and by thinning that relationship; it made the characters more believable in the scope of things. Ron Howard made a good directorial choice in guiding his cast this way; it's too bad he didn't alter anything else.<br/><br/>Howard fell into the Chris Columbus rut with The Da Vinci Code. As Columbus showed with his first two installments in the Harry Potter saga, staying word for word to the source material does not a great movie make. Text and film are two separate mediums that must be molded unto themselves for complete success. Howard seems to have been so preoccupied with pleasing the Dan Brown fanatics with a faithful adaptation that he forgot this movie was his baby to do with as he pleased. Yes, the direction has some very nice visual flair evidenced with the fading of current action to past happenings, beautifully done on the crossing of the street towards the end where buses are going through swarms of walking pedestriansbut overall the text from the book has been lifted to the screen, more as a book on film then a piece of cinema. What this movie needed was a shot in the arm like the resurrection Alfonso Cuarón created with his Potter rendition. While still true to the Prisoner of Azkaban's essence, Cuarón was able to put his stamp on the film by adding atmosphere and a sense of foreboding visually rather than falling back to what worked on the page.<br/><br/>Critics complained upon release that The Da Vinci Code preached rather than revealed, which I must agree with in part. It's not that there is more exposition in the movie than was in the novel, in fact there is less. Because of the need to shorten the text to allow for a two-hour movie, scenes must be sacrificed. However, here they were too afraid to do any cutting, instead the filmmakers condensed. Whereas while reading we are brought into the hunt, listening to each character's ruminations spanning chapters as they slowly crack the newest puzzle, on screen we are given solutions practically in the next breath as the question itself. This lack of methodical pacing makes it seem as though we are being taught because we don't get to be a part of the unraveling. So, this isn't a bad adaptation at all, it is actually near perfect. The real truth ends up being that the novel just was not a good candidate for the cinematic conversion. Sometimes engrossing prose works because of its medium and unless a director comes in to capture the essence and create a film out of it, rather than of it, we are left unsatisfied with a result that never truly takes form to stand by itself as a movie."

","That says it all really. I speak as only a half-hearted Catholic, but even for my liberal tendencies this is full of historical bumpf. I tried to separate 'fact' from fiction and consider it as a film in its own right, but the film is - unfortunately - rather faithful to its source material, so it's hard to differentiate between the two. If you loved the book, you'll probably love the film, and the same if you hated it.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen provide some credibility, up to a point. Paul Bettany reminds me an awful lot of Rutger Hauer in 'Blade Runner'. Indeed, the whole film looks like a much more pompous self-regarding version of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.<br/><br/>In short, a mediocre film has been made out of a terrible book. Both have become inexplicably successful, let's face it, because of their controversy."

","I came with only one expectation to The Da Vinci Code movie. I expected a mediocre performance. I knew this movie wont blow me away. It wont change my aspect of things and I wont find myself days after the movie searching for cool history myths and secrets on the net, trying to be Robert Langdon. I knew all this because I have read the book, and to sum it up in a sentence - The book was all about facts that will make you OOH and AHH, a little plot to patch the facts up and poof, book ends. So the book was the ground i based this expectation on.<br/><br/>Well, for you who want to go see the movie, heres a little plot summary - Robert Langdon, An expert of symbols, Is summoned by French police to a murder scene, which is placed in the louver museum. From there on he gets pulled in, along with french police code decrypting expert, Sophie Neve, a treasure hunt which, some say, would end God's power on earth.<br/><br/>I saw the movie with a friend who didn't read the book. And I have to say my expectations were answered, and more.<br/><br/>First of all, acting was pretty good, including a really good surprise, seeing Ian McKellen (Gandalf for LOTR) in a big role as Sir Lee Tibing. Tom Hanks, as usually, gave a pretty great performance, and also Audrey Tautou and Paul Bettany never slipped into the over acting zone, and they had quite the opportunities. The Shooting compensated on the lack of story, some really great scenery and really good angles and camera effects on the entire movie. The editing and directing part was great. The script was a bit dumber than the book, but still time goes by you as you find out more and more cover ups of human history. In fact, the basic thing that can annoy you about this movie, is the plot. So, yes. The general plot is kinda cool and everyone loves a good treasure hunt movie filled with cool facts. But the way it was told was in lack of depth and character building on most of the characters.<br/><br/>In short end, This is a mainstream movie, based on a mainstream novel. You'll get your ooh's and ah's, thats for sure.

She did well in this movie but we had to watch 'Amelie Poulain' a few years ago and then make a test and I think I got some sort of trauma about her :-). I read the book, so I saw that some parts weren't exactly the same as in the novel. But so what? Harry Potter movies are also not also the same and the audience still enjoys it.

","I personally never managed to get past the few pages of the hugely successful source novel and now I no longer feel the need to. After watching this bland and cinematically challenged 2 1/2 hour regurgitation, I feel I've done enough time on the cross.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, this is a B movie with an A-list budget. You'd be forgiven, however, for wondering where all that money went after the world famous locations were secured. Flashbacks are told with an amateurish acid-wash Digital Video look (easily achievable with a camcorder and a good software program), chase scenes are poorly shot and badly montaged, while the atmosphere is nil as each setting is quickly established and then followed by exposition. Then talk. Then more exposition. And then more talk. You can imagine what this does for the pacing. Only the leads appear tireless as they scramble around from location to location without ever seeming run down at any point. Rather impressive when you consider that the time frame of the story only stretches from night to the following day, during which they've covered numerous landmarks in Paris and London. As for the performances, Tom Hanks sleeps walks his way to another multi-million dollar paycheck, Audrey Tatou does herself no favours by showcasing her heavily accented and sometimes unintelligible English, while the others ham it up like Pantomime baddies.<br/><br/>This movie will be hard going for anyone unfamiliar with the book and will probably incense those who are familiar with it. If you do feel a burning need to see this, then rent (preferably borrow) the DVD - at least you'll have the comfort of falling asleep in your own home."
"Harried Howie","4","0","1","16 July 2006"," An expected disappointment
","A few weeks before seeing the film I started reading the book. I had read about one third of it when I misplaced it between hotels but had no urge to replace it. The movie gave me the same feeling. I had no problem sitting through it (although it was rather long), but had some emergency forced me to leave it would not have bothered me. The plotting seemed mechanical, as if a computer told the screenwriter to ""insert a plot element here, insert a plot element there,"" etc.<br/><br/>I felt that Tom Hanks was miscast in the lead role. The audience would have been better served if Langdon had been portrayed by an actor who can drive events, rather than be driven by them. And Audrey Tautou was the wrong actress to play Sophie. There was no chemistry between her and Hanks, and it would have been a better movie had the chemistry been there. Hanks is 20 years older than Tautou, but that happens all the time in movies. I think Tautou's problem is that she has had very little experience in English-language films.<br/><br/>Two supporting actors stand out. Sir Ian McKellen's scenery chewing was entertaining, but it could have been used in any movie, or as a one-man stage performance. The only actor who might be considered for an Academy Award nomination is Paul Bettany for his sympathetic portrayal of a deranged killer.<br/><br/>Overall, the film left little impression on me. As I left the theater I felt that I should check the box stating that I had seen the movie, and then file and forget."

But then after seeing it again it seems that the movie is very good and not a boring, melodramatic movie. With wonderful performances from Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany (in what should be award-winning roles) and a good performance from Hanks the movie is a great adaptation of the book.

I guess that I had high expectations because when I found out that they would turn the fabulous book in a movie, I really thought it would depict what I had imagined. There's no need to praise the actors because they were all sublime and thats 10/10 but the storyline and the screenplay was not the same. If you did not read the book, you would have a different interpretation on the movie and some of the scenes were not given emphasis on. One example I was expecting that on the last scene as well that Audrey would find out that the people in the church were his family but I don't think that it was shown on the level that I thought it would be. I don't know if its the direction but I just felt that it was a ""commercial"" movie and it was not an ""art"" like the painting included in the film."

Most of the people that have both seen the movie and read the book are somewhat disappointed, siting that shorter scenes in the book were lengthened and other scenes were slightly altered for dramatic, visual effect.<br/><br/>The performances in the movie were excellent. I always love Audrey Tatou. Paul Bettany as Silas, the murderous, albino monk (how many times will I get to use that phrase in live?) was the stand out character. Every time he appeared on screen, I felt pity for him as a man believing passionately in a work that will end in despair. And Ian McKellen, what more can I say? His portrayal of Leigh left me loving and loathing him all at once.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the film was in the choice of Tom Hanks as Langdon. Although he does a fine job, I couldn't help but feel that anyone could have played this role. It wasn't that his performance was lack luster; after all, he is Tom Hanks. He was not the person that I left the theater thinking about, and I have not gushed about his character at all. An unknown could have played the part and done just as well.<br/><br/>Despite the controversy and lawsuits that have surrounded both book and movie, I could recommend that everyone see ""The DaVinci Code"" for the sheer joy of seeing a mesmerizing Paul Bettany and an extremely entertaining Ian McKellen."

","With this film Ron Howard has achieved the impossible. He has taken the ultimate cinematic novel, a pulpy treasure hunt that ends every chapter on a cliffhanger; a book that with its shoddy writing and one-dimensional characters reads like a movie, exciting, fast-paced and gripping and turned it into one of the most boring films i have seen.<br/><br/>Its padded out with endless exposition but no development, fine actors like Hanks and Reno just stand around looking puzzled without giving us any insight into their characters. Silas, the best character in the film, is the most interesting character but he is pretty much sidelined throughout. Even Ian McKellan seems hammy as historian Leigh Teabing, less David Starkey and more Christopher Biggins.<br/><br/>Another problem is that while the book can bombard us with facts and make a relatively convincing conspiracy theory, on a widescreen coupled with dumbed down dialogue, the historical, theological and scientific fallacies in the argument become painfully apparent, and without this strong narrative link between actions and locations, the film feels episodic and repetitive.<br/><br/>It would probably be a better idea just to read the book, which is an exciting pulp fiction page turner, than watch this tedious nonsense which plays out as across between a coach tour of Europe and a KS3 history lesson.

Unfortunately the film is let down by the fact that Tom Hanks is unforgivably miscast (remember I haven't read the book) but it is clear that the role isn't right for him. Some of my friends have said that Sophie (Audrey Tatou) is nothing like she is portrayed in the book, but I think she played, what is essentially a very silly part, well. Hanks though is no Harrison Ford/Indiana Jones, whom I believe Robert Langdon to be based on and that combined with some dull direction makes the film suffer. On the plus side, every moment that Ian McKellen is on screen is a joy. Now to the religious aspect of the film. Why anybody got upset is a mystery to me. The final 'twist' in the film was obvious from the moment the film began and the whole 'Da Vinci Code' is ridiculous. This film wants to be 'Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade' but isn't. I have heard that 'Angels and Demons' (the superior predecessor to 'Da Vinci') is to be made. Let's just hope that Howard/Hanks do a better job with that film than they have done with this. 5/10."

"MelissaSue79","Null","0","2","26 June 2006"," A Major Disappointment
","I finished reading the book, ran to my computer, looked up a movie time, and was in the theater 30 minutes after finishing the last page. That's how much I liked the book, and was sure the movie was going to be great, considering the amazing story and impressive cast the director had to work with. I was horribly disappointed, however, with both the acting and the script.<br/><br/>Despite the amazing cast, I found the characters weak. Langdon lacked the intensity, depth, and quirky-handsomeness (where were the tweed jacket and low professorial voice!?) that he had in the book, Sophie's role in discovering and decoding the clues was greatly diminished, and some of Sir Teabing's wittiest lines were removed or replaced. Also, although I love Jean Reno, I did not agree with his casting/performance of ""The Bull"" (Captain Bezu Fache)--I felt his physical appearance and demeanor were wrong for the part. The only great casting/acting job in the movie is Paul Bettany as Silas.<br/><br/>Additionally, the script veered from the book far more than it needed to, and left a very weak plot that lacked the intensity and cleverness of the book and its characters. The movie rushed through the clues (some of which were completely deleted from the movie) in the first part of the movie, causing the clues to seem all too easy to find and decipher, and then slowed drastically at the end, once all of the action was over. The movie also watered down the more controversial points of the book, which served as its backbone, such as the the histories of the sacred feminine, pagan sex rituals, and Sophie and her grandfather. Most disappointingly, the movie has a completely different ending, for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>I was so frustrated throughout the movie, that had I not been sitting in the far corner of a one-exit theater, I would have left way before it was over."

","First off, one must remember that this is FICTION, MADE-UP STUFF, NOT BASED IN FACT!!! Rant over. I think that the best way to describe this movie, and the book for that matter, is for the creation of a new category called SPECTION, short for Speculative Fiction. Hey, we already have Science Fiction, Historical Fiction, Romantic Fiction, etc, etc, etc, so why not SPECTION? I have read the book, and had my own ideas of what each character should be. The casting was almost perfect in every way, although I don't think that Tom Hanks would have been my first choice for the Robert Langdon role. What you take out of this movie has a lot to do with your personality going into it. Are you going to change your mind about Faith, The Church, or History because you saw this movie, I highly doubt it. The book, and this movie caused quite a stir amongst Catholic Church officials, and readers/moviegoers around the country and the world. I, for one, do not see what all the fuss is about. Could it be possible that Jesus Christ was a mortal man and not the Son of God? Sure it is. It is just as likely that He was the Son of God and is/was(?) immortal and all-powerful. No one can ever be sure. You have your beliefs, I have mine. It is impossible for me to understand your beliefs, you to understand mine. I will not attempt to change your beliefs, and I do not want you to try to change mine. Anyway,back to the movie. The sets were spectacular. I do not know if they were filmed at the Louvre, I think that they were, but I now feel like I have been there. The Paris scenes were some of the most breathtaking I have had the pleasure of seeing in a movie in quite some time. The movie was a well made adaptation of the book, true to form in almost every aspect. I highly recommend this movie, not because of the ""controversial"" content, but because it is an ""intelligent"" movie, a welcome change from the mindless ""popcorn"" fare that usually inhabits the theater at this time of year."

","I read the book some time ago and couldn't put it down. My son (who just turned 13) read it a month or so ago and felt the same way. The book has a lot of tension and suspense.<br/><br/>My family just got back from the movie. We were actually disappointed in it - it was a little slow. There was too much talking - which works very well in the book but not the movie. The other thing that was very disappointing was the amount of violence in the movie. Silas' discipline is covered well but subtly in the book. However, in the movie, there are graphic scenes of him with his cilice (sp?) and the whip as well. It is totally unnecessary and just makes the movie much more gory than it needs to be.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to skip the movie and read the book. There's a reason it's been on the bestseller list for years."

","I found the movie fascinating and completely riveting from beginning until the end! Everyone was excellent in it! Bravo!!! Tom Hanks was a pleasure as always to watch...My friend said at the end of the movie: ""I didn't get it..."" so I explained the simple but moving premise of the movie to him. For as long as I can remember, I've always believed that Jesus was nothing more than an extraordinary human being--by no means immortal. We are all of God's children, and he created us men and women, so it's stands to reason that Jesus was being human too and could have had a sexual relationship with Mary Magdalen and produced children with her. I think that the Catholic Church has forgotten what the true meaning of being a Christian is and is purely money driven. And that's all I have to say about that! Go see the movie! You'll love it!!!"
"wordweb-1","3","0","2","25 June 2006"," What The Gnostics Again?
","I think most viewers already know much of the unannounced theme behind the movie before they even go see it. Those who had a hand in making this movie no doubt had that in mind with how much money it would earn, simply by knowing many Christians are going to see it too, just to find out what ideas are portrayed in it without having to buy Dan Brown's book.<br/><br/>But the obvious bias it contains is not surprising to anyone who truly knows their religious history about the 2nd century Gnostics who believed Jesus Christ didn't really die on the cross, but that he was just a highly developed spiritual human being like Krishna, Buddah, etc. So the movie must be delegated as a mock false historical triad fiction, based on an equally fictional doctrine going back to 2nd century Gnosticism. Thus anyone taking ideas in this movie as serious factual events are probably living in a fictional fantasy land also."

","I've only just been to see this because the book irritated me so I'd blacklisted it. But my son wanted to go, so off I went.<br/><br/>We were both gripped, I kept sneaking looks at my son (12) to see if he'd fallen asleep; there were plenty yawns (we went to a 8.10 showing) but he watched it all and enjoyed it. He especially liked the history bits when they were putting the pieces together. I was impressed.<br/><br/>I was very pleasantly surprised. The acting was great. It was lovely watching a movie where intelligent men are discussing women reverently. I remember reading about the bleak days of the witch-hunts when many women were slaughtered, and the world lost immeasurable knowledge because it was the witches (healers, users of herbs) who were killed and other wise, and therefore threatening women who were butchered. It felt affirming to have that noted.<br/><br/>The Robert Langdon character was very attractive; intelligent, self effacing, strong and gentle.

I was glad that I finally got my butt into the movie theater this weekend to see this movie, because it was an intriguing, thought-provoking flick. (Interestingly, though this movie had been out for a month by the time I saw it, the theater sold out well before showtime, so I'm also glad that I got there early!) The sheer quantity of ""information"" (I know - historical purists will take issue with this term) presented in this movie, combined with a roller coaster of a plot, led me and my movie-going companion to agree that we'll have to see it again. It's a great date flick, because you'll have plenty to discuss afterward.<br/><br/>I have no idea why the reviews have been so poor; perhaps this is due to the influence of the religious right? Then you have the Dan Brown fans, who on the one hand insist that the movie isn't good because it's NOT true enough to the book, and on the other hand, some saying that it's not worth watching if you've already seen the book because there's nothing NEW in the movie.

","While the cinematography is quite impressive and the acting of high caliber, the story itself is unremarkable. And in the end no matter how well a film is executed, it needs to resonate with the audience. Partly due to over hyping and partly due to an incoherent plot, the impact of the ""The DaVinci Code"" falls short. It's simply ""National Treasure"" on a international scale. Full of sound of fury, signifying nothing.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's inevitable when such a wildly popular novel is converted to celluloid. Popular dramatic novels, by their very nature of appealing to a broad-based audience, have operatic plots -- there are archetypal heroes and villains and a pretense of suspense with a nod to higher themes. The last aspect is the genesis of Dan Brown's appeal. The themes of religion, the origin of God, and the power of the Church are as enduring, universal and grandiose as one can imagine. Brown uses these unflinchingly to grab the Church by the neck with iconoclastic fervor and wring out every last drop of sacrilegious heresy. The absurdity of lines such as""you're the last living descendant of Jesus Christ"" are mitigated only by the supposed importance of the statements.<br/><br/>As can be expected, the acting by world renowned cast is solid, albeit somewhat lacking in inspiration. Ian McKellan, Tom Hanks and Jean Reno are all at the top of their craft. And McKellan is one of the few actors who could pull off the convoluted role of Leigh Teabing without allowing it succumbing to farce. Audrey Tautou has solidified her reputation with mass audiences in her first mainstream film after a very promising debut in ""Amelie"". The scenes with her and Mckellen are the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>The film would have greatly benefited from a shortened run time, a tightened storyline, and the removal of several awkward lines (""Quick, I need to get to a library""). Of course in the end the movie's faults lie with Dan Brown -- and while his writing is imaginative and well researched, it lacks the literary style and character empathy of truly great writers. In the end ""Sophie Neveu"" and ""Robert Langdon"" are easily forgettable characters in a film that will be remembered more for the religious controversy than great story telling."
"I_Ailurophile","7","0","2","23 June 2006"," Good, but sloppy
","Let me say first of all that, having read Dan Brown's 'Angels and Demons' as well as 'The Da Vinci Code' - 'Code' is inferior child's play in comparison. Mystery, story, character development, intrigue, suspense, general strength of the writing - all at the superlative level in 'A&D.' That having been said, I enjoyed DVC the Book.<br/><br/>THAT having been said, I knew ahead of time that I would most likely be disappointed by the film. I had heard mostly negative things about it, and while I wondered how much of the negative press was simply bias of those nutty conservatives against a film that *gasp!* proposes an ""unconventional"" idea, I also had heard on more than one occasion that the film tears the book apart.<br/><br/>My opinion? Speaking in broad generalities, DVC the Film is a good movie. However, even disregarding the fact that the screenplay really does tear the book apart, the best word with which to describe this enterprise is ""sloppy."" The quick pace makes the whole affair feel dreadfully rushed; this is going to be a problem when one tries to cram a 500-some-page book into a film less than three hours in length. Still - rushed. And sloppy.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, while a great actor, is NOT the right performer to portray Robert Langdon.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany, also a good actor, was an outright horrible choice for Silas.<br/><br/>Sir Ian McKellan... While reading DVC the Book, I noticed that even though Brown's description of Leigh Teabing did not even remotely resemble McKellan, the character's mannerisms, in my mind, instantly conjured an image of McKellan as Teabing. If the screenplay left the novel intact, McKellan would have been perfect. As it is, his performance is limited by the parameters of the role and the screenplay. A tragedy. Still, of all the performers involved, McKellan was the best casting choice, second to...<br/><br/>Jean Reno, as Bezu Fache - brilliant.<br/><br/>My only other major gripe - aside from various plot points in the book being altered, as I know is the unfortunate ""norm"" for Hollywood - is the way the final scene was executed, which was, like the rest of the film, sloppy.<br/><br/>COULD have been much more, IS a vaguely entertaining film.<br/><br/>If you have not read the book and want to see it, be my guest - but please read the book afterwards because this film does no justice to Brown's work or, more importantly, to the theories stated within.<br/><br/>If you have read the book - don't bother seeing it unless doing so involves (a) no exchange of money into the hands of a cashier, and (b) the concession that you have nothing better to do during the time that you would be watching this film.<br/><br/>Real rating: 6.5 / 10"

I really tried to see the whole thing but I just could'nt spend a minute longer watching this junk. So what was so disappointing with the movie?

Tom Hanks makes Prof. Langdon seem as interesting as watching a flower grow.<br/><br/>The only character who I'm happy with is Ian McKellens character, Teabing who he plays very well and captures his charm and wit from the book.<br/><br/>Another disappointing, and very very annoying thing is that the scenes are over very quickly and you miss out on the interesting ""facts"" about, well everything really. An example is when they're all on the plane and try to figure out what the password is to the kryptex, and it is written in a language they've never seen before...In the book you read several pages about it and how the try to figure it out.

The book plot was tweaked just a tiny bit to give the viewers a fast paced, action packed, intellectual thriller. But the fast pace may come at the expense of those who haven't read the book, who will find the plot difficult to understand, since it is so fast that it lacks organization to a certain extent. The acting was good too, with Hanks and Tautou filling in their roles pretty well. Although I feel that their faces and looks don't quite match up to those of Langdon and Neveu. <br/><br/>I felt that it was insensible to have a DCPJ inspector confront Langdon during a book signing in front of an audience.

","Okay, here's my beef with the book: Dan Brown is not a sophisticated writer. He gives you everything and leaves no clues. Every chapter ends in a bad cliffhanger. He absolutely cannot write romance. But the story? Fantastic. It's a great work of fiction. The only thing wrong with it is the author (which might generally be considered bad, but trust me on this one).<br/><br/>Now, that being said, the movie is fairly good. The direction, the cinematography, the acting... even Tom Hanks pulled off Robert Langdon, which I really did not think he could do well. Paul Bettany was fantastic, as usual. His heartfelt portrayal of Silas made me learn to love the character despite everything, which Dan Brown did not do successfully in the novel. Jean Reno was great as Fache. Ian McKellan made me believe every word he said, even when I knew what was going to happen.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's direction was absolutely marvelous. Everything flowed beautifully. It's definitely worth a viewing just to see how gorgeous it is.<br/><br/>I have problems with the book, but why didn't I give the movie a 10-star rating? Well, you can't really do much with a badly-written novel, can you? Akiva Goldsman certainly couldn't -- the screenplay is awful. Don't go in expecting A Beautiful Mind or LA Confidential.

I do believe both the book and the movie should make people think about what ""truths"" have been told to us over the years, and not to take anything at face value. ""Don't believe what you hear"" would be a very good phrase.

So after graduation I decided to find out for myself, since the book seemed to be right up my ally, and I actually read it entirely in the course of a single day finding myself enthralled by its mystery, suspense and moderate accuracy for a piece of fiction....I absolutely love it, although not to the point of fanaticism...It brings up some good points, gets people thinking and talking, and although there are some historical errors that made me cringe it wasn't bad.<br/><br/>So naturally the next step was to see the film...and it left me filled with disappointment. I realize that there are many restrictions placed on films; time, money, sets, and the buildings and artwork found in the Da Vinci Code are not easily accessed. So I understand leaving out certain things like flashbacks, conversations and thoughts that are found in the book. However, what I cannot comprehend is why fundamental details of the book were changed for the movie. <br/><br/>To me the characters were underdeveloped, they made them look far less intelligent than they appeared in book, and yet they solved the clues so easily, also in the movie it seemed that Sophie resented code breaking where in the book it appeared to be her passion. The dynamic between characters felt unnatural and what was the need to not just leave out but blatantly change parts of the book for the movie. <br/><br/>Basically I don't like the principle of taking a recent best seller and changing fundamental details like the end,the middle, the beginning and the characters relationships.

So, this movie survived strong impact from Christian communities, but i don't see why? Nobody said in this movie that church is frod, just brought some things that may be true... and if the statements in movie are valid, somebody started with pranks a long time ago and made some false statements about Jesus and whole Christian teaching. I can understand if you are ""nerdy"" Christian you'll be offended with statements from this movie (famous one is: ""Maria was Jesus wife, not mother"").<br/><br/>OK, so second thing about movie is his enigmatic part.

","I read the book and thought that the central idea was very clever, but the writing left a whole lot to be desired. To put my reaction into context, I'm not Roman Catholic, or religious in any organized sense. I can see why some practicing Catholics might find this central idea offensive. Considering the movie solely as entertainment, I thought it was a pretty good, if slightly slow and ponderous entertainment. Tom Hanks is an actor I almost always admire; here he seemed to express his seriousness as a character and the gravity of the story by wearing a perpetual frown that wrinkled up his face. No, there's no chemistry between Hanks and the female lead--but under the circumstances, even a suggestion of libido might be inappropriate. Ian McKellan is his usual wonderful self and I didn't think anyone in the cast was less than competent. I figure those people who regard the suggestion that Christ was a man and subject to manly impulses ought to stay away and not expose themselves to this outrage. That's what happened in the case of Mel Gibson's ""Passion"" film: a lot of people simply avoided it lest their sensibilities be bruised. As for those organizations who have fulminated against the movie and urged that it be embargoed--they've almost certainly done the Box Office a huge favor. Although, what with all the ancillary Da Vinci stuff on the market (the Da Vinci Code DIET??? really!) the Box Office probably needed no outside stimulation.

"cwrdlylyn","3","0","1","20 June 2006"," THE DAVINCI CODE : Ron Howard's Numerous Mistakes Make For A Big Disappointment
","THE DAVINCI CODE <br/><br/>It took me a while to get out to the theaters to see this one because I wanted to be sure I'd finished reading the book first. From the very first previews for this film, I had faith it was going to be good. I'd yet to even read one page of the best-selling novel and yet Ron Howard's trailers had me enticed from day one. I was able to put aside my disappointment for Ron Howard's past film-work and believe he might have finally created a great film. And after reading the book, there was no doubt in my mind the source material was wonderful. Unfortunately, Ron Howard failed in all the same ways he has in the past... and his adaptation of THE DAVINCI CODE is one big, clunky disappointment.<br/><br/>Granted, to adapt a book with so many complications and so many different characters would have been a challenge for anyone... however, the results could have been much better. The film tells the story of Robert Langdon (played by a miscast Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (played by a miscast Audrey Tatou) as they scramble to unearth the secret of the Holy Grail following the murder of Neveu's grandfather. In the moments before his death, Neveu's grandfather left numerous clues which would lead his granddaughter towards a family secret that would shock the world.<br/><br/>It's impossible to review THE DAVINCI CODE without comparing it to the superior book. Perhaps that's unfair, but if the book was such a daunting thing to be compared to... why did Howard stick so close to it? I felt throughout the entire film that Howard and the production team weren't quite sure what to do with the movie. Should they make a faithful adaptation even though it would be difficult, or should they re-arrange the story a bit to make it more cinematic...? It appears they never made a decision and just straddled that line throughout the entire development process.<br/><br/>Sadly, it appears things were off from the very start. Though Tom Hanks can usually handle any type of role, he is radically out of place in this film. He appears to be too old... and not so much in age, but in body. I never got the sense that finding the Holy Grail filled Langdon/Hanks with a wild curiosity and intense desire like it should have. Instead, Hanks just seemed to be going through the motions. And the same can be said for Tatou's performance as Sophie Neveu. Firstly, she is too young for the role. Secondly, Neveu needed to be the emotional centerpiece for the film when you consider how Howard chose to end things, and yet Tatou's performance didn't have a single extra layer to it. She seemed to be a beautiful shell of a Cryptologist who knows she must figure out the mystery... yet she appears to have no passionate need to know the truth. Without Langdon and Neveu's desperation, none of this mystery is exciting.<br/><br/>The other major casting mistake was Paul Bettany as Silas. While Silas does not necessarily need to look like a monstrosity, he definitely should not be attractive. Yet, nothing is done to downplay Bettany's natural good looks. Sure there are scratches all over his body and he's white as a sheet, but his body is sculpted beautifully and his face normal. And why may I ask did an Albino have blue eyes? All albinos have no pigmentation in their eyes leaving them a red-ish color... so why did Bettany keep blue eyes which only added to the physical attractiveness? Aside from the casting however, Howard's input does nothing to save the film. Instead, Ron Howard uses identical gimmicks as he has in the past (the code breaking in this film is stylized exactly the same as it was in A BEAUTIFUL MIND). In general the film just feels like its spread out too evenly without any significant dips or lulls in the action. In the book, the race between Langdon and the French Police seemed to be an ever shifting game of cat & mouse. In Dan Brown's novel, the police would get closer and closer only to fall back moments later... but in Howard's film, the police seem to be 10 minutes behind our heroes right up until the very end.<br/><br/>Finally, I don't think Ron Howard or Brian Grazer ever sat down at the very beginning of things and firmly decided exactly what perspective they were going to tell this story from. Is he simply telling the story of an interesting mystery? Is he offering an emotional tale of an abandoned child who yearns to know where they came from? Is he telling the story of man's obsession with knowing the truth? I think Howard tried to tell them all... and as a result he has an unfocused film on his hands.<br/><br/>It's hard to pin-point specific things that went wrong with the film... b/c in the end it isn't one specific element that ruined what could have been one of Cinema's most thrilling mysteries ever. It is the entire mixture. The casting is wrong, the direction poorly paced, the story too impersonal, and the mystery too unclear. While THE DAVINCI CODE has a few redeeming factors, such as Ian McKellen's engaging turn as Lee Teabing and some wonderful scenery, it is far too much of a disappointment when you consider the potential. In the end, although it's not the most boring 2 1/2 hours of my life by any means... I could never get past the fact that nothing in it is as good as it could have been.

","There are so many knives out for this film. Lots will watch it for the controversy and then bag it for the same reason. This is not a bad film. The plot is significant and interesting. The action is lively. The only area where it falls down is in theology, but then only the marketers and Axe grinders of religion place any claims on this film for THAT.<br/><br/>If the claims of religious historicity were put aside, the leads would be viewed as being good for their roles. The girl is pretty and doesn't need to remove her clothes to prove it. The male lead doesn't use excessive profanity to show emotion. Already supporters of licentiousness have it in for the film on those counts ..<br/><br/>The bad guys are inhumanly weird, which reinforces core values. <br/><br/>The storyline is taken from the book, which I haven't read, but know in minute detail. I'm a committed Christian and am not troubled or enlightened by the story. I can see where history has been inflated and adjusted to suit the story .. and it works. This will disappoint atheists keen to find a new weapon, but it will also distract religious leaders keen to have a opinion on something modern.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Mr Howard. This isn't ""The Paper"" but it is a solid film if you allow yourself to see beyond the hype and suspend your disbelief ;)"
"james-1780","3","0","2","19 June 2006"," A thriller with no real thrill
","Da Vinci Code:<br/><br/>Bad! From beginning to end this thriller lacked any real thrill. The characters are paper thin leading us to have no real emotional attachment to them, thus not really caring whether they prevail over their adversaries of the cloth or not. The film seems to rest all of its weight on the shoulders of controversy and conspiracy, but neither have the back for it. The theory was definitely intriguing, but not nearly plausible enough to make us believe it for the duration of the film. Certain character relationships weren't clearly defined, they seemed to defy the clutches of the clergy and the French police all too easily; and the self-mutilating, psychopathic, albino 'Angel of Death' wasn't really that scary at all. The ending presented a foreseeable anticlimax to which both actors played with a lack of enthusiasm that was apparent throughout. <br/><br/>Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a religious symbology expert, is suspected of the murder of a well know historian murdered in the Louvre. Langdon is innocent but is being set up to take the fall for the murder. A team from the French version of the FBI, led by hard core Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno), are sent to arrest him. But With the help of Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tattoo), who's the granddaughter of the Historian, they escape and set out to discover the true identity of her grandfather's murderer. Amidst the hail of bullets, car chases and double crossers, their investigation leads them into a mystery of a code encrypted by Da Vinci which reveals a Secret Society within Catholicism who have held a two thousand year old secret; that if discovered would bring the world's largest religion and all its followers to their knees. To piece together this intricate puzzle they travel throughout France, and with the help of Sir Leigh Teabing, they escape the French police and a Catholic assassin to flee to London where they not only discover the murderer of Sophie's Grandfather, they break the Da Vinci Code itself. <br/><br/>Overall, very disappointing. The only saving grace was Ian McKellen's portrayal of Sir Leigh Teabing, an ageing English cripple, obsessed with Da Vinci's supposed conspiracy and all of its secret societies and who drinks his earl grey with lemon; of course. <br/><br/>Best scene: When Sir Leigh Teabing passionately divulges his knowledge of Da Vinci's hidden code and the Secrete Society who have maintained its mystery."
"charchuk","4","0","2","19 June 2006"," Inconsistent, albeit good, adaptation
","After having read the novel twice, I had confidence that a film adaptation could be quite good - the book was suited for it. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The movie was good, yes, but not as fantastic as it could have been. In fact, I would go so far as to say the book was better than the movie - I simply found it more entertaining. Still, this movie is a (fairly) faithful adaptation of the novel, with a few changes that don't really affect the overall story or theme.<br/><br/>Of the changes, the ones I found the most noteworthy were the added character development of Langdon - falling down a well? really? - and the missing puzzle, and of course the end. The end was where the film really dropped the ball - it is far too long, and the revelation could have been done much smoother and more effective. The beginning also could have been compacted - the scenes in the Louvre should have been longer, but the other scenes (Aringarosa & Silas) could have been significantly trimmed. The pace was quite uneven at the start, the cutting back and forth between the separate stories was far too jarring. Even the scene in the bank felt rushed; I couldn't help but feel that these scenes could have been much better realized. The movie didn't really find its groove until they get to Teabing's, where it took off. The scene where they are revealing the true nature of the grail was the best scene of the book, and it's even better in the movie with the accompanying flashbacks and the arguments between Langdon and Teabing (which are not present in the book but are welcome here). After that, the pace really picks up and the movie flies by until the climax - which, unfortunately, is a good 30 minutes before the end of the movie. Talk about a premature ending. I felt the villain reveal was kind of botched, also - it wasn't nearly shocking enough. The scenes at Roslin are needed but were boring, until the final conversation between Langdon and Neveu, where their chemistry finally showed itself. And the final scene was superbly done - much more effective than the novel. A very uneven product results.<br/><br/>The performances were all over the place. Hanks seems to be phoning it in until the scene in Teabing's mansion, where he holds his own against McKellan. I still think he was miscast. Tatou didn't really impress me, she felt kinda flat at times. McKellan was the star of the show, I even felt his performance was Oscar-worthy. It's a mark of his incredible performance that the movie immediately picked up once he entered. Reno was terribly inconsistent - considering the character was written for him, I felt he could have done a much better job. Bettany is sufficiently creepy as Silas - the first scene of him chastising himself went on a bit long, though. And Molina is wasted - I think the entire subplot with him getting money from the Church could have been dropped altogether, actually. No one else makes a decent impression.<br/><br/>Technically, this film is, again, all over the place. The production design was fantastic, but the lighting was off sometimes, and I felt that some of the art & architecture could have been highlighted better. The cinematography was appropriately sweeping at times, and not even noticeable at others. Same with the music - I didn't even notice it until the incredible final scene. The only aspect at which the film really excelled was, surprisingly, the visual effects - the historical flashbacks were very well done, and the visual style they incorporated was very effective. Howard does a decent, if not noteworthy, job directing - pretty much like all his other works. All this makes for an uneven result.<br/><br/>So, overall, this film is probably best described as 'inconsistant'. Story, performances, pace, technicalities - all were all over the place. Considering the book flows very well, this is the fault of the filmmakers. Still, it's a good film, but not the great one I was expecting."

"matt-ja","7","0","1","17 June 2006"," Suspenseful and True to the novel
","As was the case with anticipated films like the Harry Potter series, the books outweigh the film simply because the film makes too many cuts on the plot and character build up. The Da Vinci Code does not suffer from this shortfall, either in book form (which is beyond excellent in my opinion) or as a film, Ron Howard does a fantastic job of creating the right atmosphere that suits the suspenseful plot. To be fair, Dan Browns plot is complicated enough to prevent much cutting, and all for the health of the film too. I was rather expecting to be bored, condsidering I was very familiar with the twists in the plot, but was kept pleasantly rapt by the excellent directing and strength of acting. Tom Hanks is critised, and his performance is nothing on the marvellous Sir Ian McKellen, who steals the screen, but It certainly doesn't detract from the solidarity overall. I was most gratified to find that the final part to the film was in fact clearer than the ending to the novel, which I perceived as a trifle abrupt and ambiguous. Howard clearly had this in mind and does a good job directing it. It was nice to see that the legacy from fantastic book has been continued onto the big screen, I didn't think it a disappointment at all. Well worth viewing IMDBers, if you haven't already!"
"chandanc22-1","5","0","3","17 June 2006"," What a let down!
","There are those movies that far surpass the novel on which they are based. Think French Leutenant's woman or Bridges of Madison County! And, then there are those that let the viewer down badly. Da Vinci code is the latest to join the latter category. Captain Corelli's Mandolin is another memorable one of this variety. I remember looking forward to both these movies after thoroughly enjoying the books. What prose and imagery that the authors manage to conjure through words.<br/><br/>John Fowles'(author of the French Leutenant's woman) account of the process of initiating and going through the filming is also noteworthy. He makes it a point to articulate that once the director and script-writer has been selected, as per the desire of the author (with a massive wait for getting the chosen pair on board) the author decides to let go of the reins then on.<br/><br/>Or, is it the choice of the leading actors? Meryl Streep (in both movies) and Clint Eastwood in the latter made a significant impact. However, I found it difficult to visualize Tom Hanks or Nicholas Cage in the manner in and orientation in which they are portrayed in the original books.<br/><br/>Lastly, I enjoyed the illustrated version of the Da Vinci Code was far more than the movie. If you have not seen this edition do give the book a browse! <br/><br/>By the way, ever wondered what could have happened with a more cerebral ( as opposed to action) actor like Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects or LA Confidential) or Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption or Mystic River) in that role of Langdon in Da Vinci Code??"
"evilangel10","6","0","1","17 June 2006"," Howard VS Brown
","For many this film has been long awaited, and sadly for many, a disappointing adaptation from Dan Browns novel. This has been the first novel that I have managed to read before being tempted too much by the gossip and triumph of cinema-goers and reviews. As we all know, the world we create in our minds is far superior to world created by someone else, and i believe there is a lack of realism and depth to both the lead roles of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu in comparison to the book, subsequently Sir Ian Mckellen and Paul Betteny certainly stole the lime light away from the central characters. What was significantly disappointing from the film was the lack continuity of time surrounding the lead roles. The book began with Langdon being woken from his hotel room in the middle of the night shortly after the discovery of Sauniere's death. This put the reader in a clear position of the situation of its characters, and how the events unfold during the long night to follow. Not only did Ron Howard choose an alternative introduction, in my mind he failed to portray the saga that each character had towards the search for the grail, again with the relationship and depth that the book did. However, it is common to say that the time allowed for the film was not sufficient to fully portray the books depth and structure. I would like to also point out that the alleged teamwork between Langdon and Neveu was also significantly diluted in the film, only allowing room for absurd calculations and almost scripted and formulaic findings. The connections they made towards finding certain answers such as the Zurich account number were consistently weakened as if Howard was pushed for time, in my eyes there are other weaknesses the film brought were Howard added personal 'amusing 'attributes to the dialogue, such as Neveu's reference to the blood line and attempt to walk on water, yet more importantly I found that Neveu's introduction to the reality of her family was far more disappointing than any other part of the film, shadowed with the members of the Priory of Sion, Howard should have taken the opportunity to realise the authenticity and realism behind Browns introduction of truth around Neveu's family tragedy and revealed it far less dramatic and ritualistic. Overall I found the film to represent and portray a fairly good thriller but once reading the book, there are finer qualities that Howard unfortunately failed to represent and yet as with any film everybody interprets differently."

","I have to say, I was pretty disappointed with the movie - after all the grand hype, it turned out to be pretty dull. I usually love Tom Hanks, but this time he might as well of not even showed up. His character was lifeless at best. Audry Tautou was also a bad choice of actress for this role. She certainly didn't capture the spirit of the character. It doesn't bode well when you have a film with the two main characters that are boring and devoid of chemistry.<br/><br/>The standouts are Ian McKellen who was great as always and Paul Bettany who was chilling as Silas.<br/><br/>As for the story - I saw the movie before I read the book and found the story to be quite interesting. After reading the book I will say that the movie faithfully follows, with a few exceptions, the book. As for it being fictional - no doubt as most of the references to Da Vinci's paintings, Templer history and the Priory of Sion was lacking in any reality. Interestingly, Dan Brown wants us to think that all the art and architecture was based on fact - this is quite laughable when he mistakenly (most certainly for effect) says the pyramid in front of the Louve has 666 panes of glass when in fact it has 673. I guess the real number just doesn't have that Hollywood appeal! All that aside, the movie had a lot of potential to be good. To bad some bad casting ruined that."
"Artistic_Differences","5","0","2","16 June 2006"," Not worth the fuss
","I have to admit not being a fan of the book. In fact, I hated it. It can't deny it was entertaining to read, and you could clearly recognize it was made to be a best seller for its fast-paced formula of mystery, action and vague eroticism, but the only I can give to Dan Brown is that he is a genius of publicity  not a good storyteller, not even a good writer. It looked like this guy had just typed symbology and DaVinci in Google and stuffed all the results in the novel. Yet however, it has its fans, and I respect their opinions, but don't ask me to like it. I don't.<br/><br/>The DaVinci Code is a bad book, and though I enjoyed the movie a little more, I can't call it good either. With bad yet commercial source material, my expectations were subzero, and I wasn't surprised or anything. It's simply the novel, with a few tweaks here and there (more on that later because it's one of the few things I loved). The start is okay: it builds up some tension and shows off how good Ron Howard can be as a filmmaker, with these brilliant, story-of-the-character-in-15-seconds style flashbacks, which I found an excellent technique to shove aside all the unnecessary melodrama and annoying angst which riddled the book. The problem, though: after some downright boring bits, you just find yourself wondering when will it recuperate. It doesn't.<br/><br/>This movie takes itself too seriously. It's in serious need of a little sense of humour about itself and so do the two main actors about their characters. But once again, the standard 'you can't make a good movie out of a pile of rubbish' applies; so much cliché, after all, will never possess or deserve a third dimension.<br/><br/>Hanks kept looking confused all the way through, although I can't blame him  it's how I've always imagined Robert Langdon anyway , and Tautou (no matter how much I'm biased in her favour) plays her typical curious, cool & cute, but her character sometimes is just there, with not much to do or say. I guess the novel gave her more protagonism, but can you really call that something good?<br/><br/>Fortunately, the secondary actors are a lot more entertaining to watch. As always, Ian McKellen is brilliant, taking delight in playing flamboyant and eccentric sir Leigh Teabing in a great opportunity to make the audience smile, steal every scene from the boring protagonists and give the plot an okay turn. Jean Reno is always himself, and although I swear I can hear the question of 'what am I doing in this movie', the role of Fache didn't belong to anyone else. Alfred Molina gives an oddly refreshing performance and plays perfectly with that sneaky poker smile, although I just so wish we got to see more of him; and Paul Bettany is without a doubt my favourite: for he's the only character to truly display passion, emotional charge. He makes Silas so expressive and tortured and adds in that soft, sweet, slimy, intentionally unfocused tone which is not based on anything, nor does he owe it to nobody - not even Dan Brown. It's all his.<br/><br/>The movie _did_ accomplish something the novel didn't, for the book was indecisive when it came to who exactly was to be blamed for all the mess. 'Cause you know, the evil character just thought they were saving the Church, and evil albino assassins army aside the Opus Dei is cool. The movie made its message a little less blurry - while for example, the character of Aringarosa did come across as more greedy, twisted and manipulative, the police chief was a member of Opus without being the EBOL and Silas, in reality, was a victim of circumstance  and quite an insane one at that.<br/><br/>It's too bad that it was at least 30 minutes too long, and you couldn't really scratch them off anywhere. Wish the ending had been more agile or entertaining, 'cause after giving a not entirely satisfying cut to the main plot, I just wanted the movie to end."

","I must admit that I haven't read Dan Brown's book and so I wasn't looking forward to watching this film at the first place. Maybe all the fuss in the media and the excessive publicity that forwarded the opening of this film, worked negatively on me. Or, maybe, I've had enough of Hollywood mainstream, commercial movies. I'm not exactly a fan of Ron Howard's work. He makes decent movies that, unfortunately, fail to touch me. "" The Da Vinci Code"" wasn't an exception. From what I've read so far, it appears that the film was faithful to the book.That's a good sign for a start but IMO it's not enough. A good story offers a nice background for a movie, but it needs more than that for the story to work on the screen. It's the director's skill that sets the pace and the tone, and makes the story interesting to the viewer.That's what separates a great master like Hitchcock from a league of just adequate directors . All that said, I must admit that I wasn't bored while watching this film.There was enough mystery in the actual story to keep me interested.Interested but not thrilled.I enjoyed the takes in the Louvre's interior and the beautiful landscapes, as a tourist would have done. Not for once, though, did I find myself sitting at the edge of my seat , wondering what will happen next. The actors didn't help either.Maybe they weren't given a chance to do so. Tom Hanks, who managed to break my heart in ""Philadelphia"", was a pale reflection of himself. Audrey Tautou, the ever engaging Amelie, failed to offer more than a pretty face.

"kmm1128","9","0","1","14 June 2006"," Thought-provoking story that keeps you guessing until the end
","Ron Howard seems to have a Midas touch. I have never seen a movie directed by him that I didn't like, and this one is definitely a plus.<br/><br/>I believe that Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou did an excellent job portraying their characters and the relationship between them. I've heard complaints about how there was little chemistry between their characters, but I actually think that's pretty true to life. Tom Hanks was portraying a Harvard college professor, and as a college student, I can tell you that the smartest, the most scholarly, and the most pragmatic college professors like to keep things professional. There's no room in the personality of Tom Hanks' character to start any chemistry. Audrey Tautou was also great as the cryptologist struggling to face her past and uncover her grandfather's darkest secrets. Hers was an unspoken strength that I found refreshing for a female lead. I appreciate the reserved, professional-style relationship between Hanks and Tautou. Just because the two main characters are a male and a female doesn't mean that they automatically have to fall in love and embrace in a passionate kiss in every movie. Their closeness was intangible. It was shown through their gestures and their facial expressions, not their words. It was a silent acknoledgement and appreciation of the other's profession and personality, and I don't even think the dialogue between them was wooden at all. These were two characters who were just thrown into extraordinary circumstances, and I think they handled it pretty well.<br/><br/>Hats also should go off to Paul Bettany (Silas), Jean Reno, and Ian McKellen. Bettany's performance gave me chills throughout the entire movie, but what was even more creepy was at times, I actually found myself pitying his character. Jean Reno's performance was above average as the dignified but vicious police officer pursuing Hanks and Tautou. Like many of the characters, he portrayed his emotions mainly through facial expressions and actions rather than words, and he was excellent at it. You could feel the coldness in his eyes as he watched Tom Hanks in the murder investigation sequence. You could tell he suspected Tom Hanks right from the get go, and he wasn't going to stop until he had both Hanks and Tautou behind bars. Ian McKellen is always wonderful in anything he does, and he provided the perfect witty comic relief for this movie. The argument he has with Hanks while Hanks and Tautou are hiding out in his home was great and true to life. It reminded me of my English professors in my college class during a lecture. I could see any two scholars having the same debate over the historical accuracy of the story of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdelene. Where he falls short is a scene he tries to grab the dial that Hanks tosses up in the air. He's supposed to be playing a crippled man, but when he's running to catch the dial before it hits the ground, he barely even uses his crutches. Other than that, his performance was very convincing, but don't get too attached to his character. That's all I'm going to say.<br/><br/>But where this movie shines the most is its cinematography and its plot development. The locations in this film are beautiful, and there is a beautiful scene of Mary Magdelene's coffin in front of a single red rose in a vase with a gleam of sunlight touching the sculpture of her body. It is breathtaking. The plot development is awesome. Just when you think you've figured out a character, something happens or they do something that you never expected. Even when I thought I had figured something out plot-wise, another twist would put me right back to square one. However, when you finally do reach the ending, it all makes sense, and that makes for a great plot. This really is a treasure hunt-style movie.<br/><br/>I must finally acknowledge Hans Zimmer for the amazing original score that shines its best at the very last scene.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is wonderful. With intelligent characters, beautiful backdrops, an uplifting score, a plot full of twists and turns, and thought-provoking questions on religion, The Da Vinci Code will leave you guessing throughout the film and talking when it's all over.<br/><br/>I give it an A. Great job all around."

","Those who watch this after reading the book will think it's just fine, but that's because there's a fair bit of information that is in the book, not in the film, that gives readers an overview that helps to understand the film. Those who haven't read the book will find many of the plot twists confusing, and will have a hard time discerning between the protectors of the Holy Grail, and those out to destroy it. There several plot contrivances that are plainly illogical.<br/><br/>For example, we are supposed to believe that, in the very short time between the initial murder and the arrival of the investigators, the lead investigator was contacted by his bishop and told, falsely, that the murderer had confessed to the bishop and who the murderer was.<br/><br/>BUT...this information had to come from somebody who'd seen the murder scene BEFORE the police did, and then passed this scene info on to the bishop WITH the intent of creating a cover-up, all done because the victim had written the falsely accused killer's name on the floor before he died.<br/><br/>EXCEPT...that what the victim wrote was to contact this person (for help), NOT that this person 'is my killer'!<br/><br/>Come on now! This is almost as illogical as the people in horror films who go ahead and investigate a noise the basement when they know for a fact that a psycho is on the loose in the area. And this is only one of several inconsistencies! Plus there are at least 4 separate climactic moments in the last 30 minutes. If this hadn't come from Ron Howard and the big Hollywood movie machine, it would have been panned terribly rather than getting mostly mediocre reviews on average. However it does have great art direction and cinematography, and very good performances in general."
"davidgardiner","6","0","1","14 June 2006"," Uneven, see it for good acting and interesting ideas
","I agree with many of the reviewers here that the movie is uneven. There are excellent performances from Ian McKellen, Audrey Tautou and Paul Bettany, and, in fairness, no weak links whatever on the acting side. Tom Hanks had perhaps the highest hill to climb because the character given to Langdon in the film is a bit nondescript, but he did as well as anyone could have with the material he was given. The writing I thought varied from acceptable to very poor. Hanks/Langdon and McKellen/Teabing were frequently given long explanatory speeches that came close to voice-overs; lectures to the audience about the ideas underlying the plot. Maybe there was no other way to do this but I think with a little more ingenuity it could have emerged more naturally from slightly more convincing screen conversations. In fact the underlying ideas about cynical manipulation by the Roman Catholic Church of its followers to protect its power was the real centre of interest of the film, but probably by now too familiar to most cinema-goers and people who have followed the debate about the book and the film to come as very much of a surprise in this context. The ""action"" tended to be the familiar Hollywood over-the-top gunfights and car chases and hidden tracker devices that are so much the stock and trade of Bond films, with occasional flashes of something darker and more character-driven when Bettany/Silas was on the screen. As a straight thriller, without the religious/intellectual dimension, I think the film would go almost unnoticed, but the intrigue surrounding the Church and its history, origins and motives will certainly keep you awake if it isn't by now all too familiar."

","I have read the book and watched the movie. Before i watched it i had my opinion of Tom Hanks playing Langdon. I questioned as to why Hanks was chosen as i would have picked other actors that would have fit the Langdon character better.I somehow pictured Langdon to be taller. Before watching the movie I thought that the character Silas was done brilliantly and from the trailer, i saw that Paul bettany was the perfect actor to play silas. he was everything i imagined him to be. When i watched the movie, i found that Tom Hanks was good. He played Langdon very well and Paul Bettany was brilliant as Silas. Most of the things i imaged it to be was magically transformed into life like the cryptext. Exactly how i imagined it!Somehow i feel that Alfred Molina was not the right actor for Aringarosa. Aringarosa was suppose to be more down to earth and friendlier. Does it makes sense? Anyway i was quite happy with the movie. There were some parts in the book that wasn't featured in the movie but they captured the gist of it. I like the idea that those who haven't read the book can also understand it. I love the part when Tom hanks was solving the anagrams, that was brilliantly done without having to explain what an anagrams mean. The session with Teabing and when they were explaining the Last supper. That was done really well.I was a bit disappointed when Sophie's character in the movie was not dominantly displayed as compared to the book where she has more say in things. Overall it was a good movie and a great book!"
"jk_larson","6","0","2","14 June 2006"," Too much like Nancy Drew
","I liked the book better than the movie -- I was disappointed with Tom Hanks' performance for the first time. I think it was as much the fault of the director and the script as anything -- his lines were limited, his stricken expression unyielding.<br/><br/>Perhaps the problem lies in the effort to take a convoluted novel and condense it -- something had to go, and it was Langdon's personality and how he processed his dilemmas.<br/><br/>In an effort to keep the sweeping feel as the movie moved from one locale to another -- the Louvre, the Bois de Boulogne, Teabing's country cottage, London -- the movie ends up feeling like a string of ham-fisted clues, all wrapped in a neat little package in a grown-up Nancy Drew mystery. ""Oh, look Bess, here's another anagram!"" <br/><br/>An example of a movie that does a better job of sweeping to many locations, in my opinion, is the Pelican Brief (based on John Grisham's book) but it had longer to move more gracefully around the continent.<br/><br/>To his credit, I think Ron Howard trimmed some things for good reason -- what seemed somewhat engaging on paper may have come across as goofy and un-credible on the big screen."

","I've given this a 4 because I don't want to be entirely evil, but I really just didn't like this movie. I read the book about 3 years ago, and the main points that I remembered from the plot were neglected from the movie (last supper emphasis). I'm a fan of the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings movies, so I am not just pulling the ""book will always be better"" mentality. I found many points that could have been better executed as well, in terms of clarifying certain points and making it truer to the book and thus more comprehensible to the viewers.<br/><br/>*spoilers* From the very beginning of the movie when Langdon first set foot in the museum, they made no mention of why Sophie was there- how she was an intellectual. Well in this movie, her ""grandfather's"" secret code that he left for her was not mentioned and didn't give her any reason to be there or a reason for Langdon to trust her and her opinions.<br/><br/>I also felt that whatever Langdon discovered something or solved a riddle, we were watching him figure it out and not figuring it out with him, very similar to a college lecture or, as stated in my title of this review, a television documentary. Hilighting the letters of the ""secret code""? Really Ron Howard? I've suddenly moved from the History Channel to PBS Kids: Let's Read!.<br/><br/>Oh and the ending??? Seriously. Come on now. There was no reason for that. The book is excellent, why not take SOME advice from it? *spoilers over* The flashbacks I found ridiculously corny and just seemed like an easy way out of explaining the plot through other cinematography aspects and an alteration of dialogue.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the dialogue. Dan Brown may write amazing novels, but he ain't no script writer.<br/><br/>The leads I found had no chemistry at all, and while they may have been independently good, that's not what movies are about.<br/><br/>This movie did not hold my attention and I will say that I did find myself nodding off through many parts though, upon questioning friends each time I awoke, I was told I didn't miss much.<br/><br/>Some scenes were much too long. Other scenes that needed to be longer were way too short.<br/><br/>Other people I notice worship this movie, so no offense to you. I just found this film a terrible waste of time and money, and a disappointment after all of the anticipation I felt. I really was watching through rose colored glasses and I still came out with this opinion."
"jeev7882","5","0","3","13 June 2006"," Boring, but much better than the book
","Grade: C The best way to sum The DaVinci Code up is: boring. The movie plots along with our characters rushing from point to point, much like the book. The only difference is that director Ron Howard and his crew are much better filmmakers than Dan Brown is a writer. Unfortunately, the source material is so bland that the resulting film has a climax that is about as jarring as finding out whether a flipped coin landed heads or tails.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie stays relatively close to the book. Few changes are made, and none of them are significant enough to mention. Robert Langdon is invited to the Louvre by French Police Captain Fache to help solve the murder of the curator. He soon learns that he is the main suspect for the murder. French cryptographer Sophie Neveu rescues him and together they go on a long, long, long journey with many, many, many clues that leads to a discovery that contradicts major Christian beliefs. <br/><br/>As you may have already guessed, the movie was too long. The pacing for the 149 minutes is painfully slow. Even the beginning, which was the only reason I read the book in the first place, turns out to be passive. It's as if Howard wants to skip the initial event and jump right into the mystery. Not a bad idea, but it's not executed well. <br/><br/>Howard does a good job of translating the scholarly historical information (remember, it's fiction, a.k.a. fake, a.k.a. made up) into eye popping visuals. In the same manner Howard showed us the way Nash saw the world in A Beautiful Mind, he shows us how Robert Langdon solves puzzles by just looking at them. Sadly, Langdon isn't Nash. Langdon is a character without flaws, except maybe for sporting the always fashionable mullet. Once one of the great actors of his generation, Tom Hanks has apparently taken to the one-dimensional main characters (remember Viktor Navorski from The Terminal?). There is a ton of talent wasted here from the adorable Audrey Tautou to the always incredible Jean Reno. Why did all these famous and talented actors waste their time on a movie like this?<br/><br/>Luckily, Sir Ian McKellen saves the day as usual. His upbeat and complex portrayal of Sir Leigh Teabing gives the movie the swift kick in the ass it needs before falling flat on its face. Before Teabing, our characters plot along from location to location, clue to clue. A good mystery shows the audience the finish line so the audience can give a damn about what is going on. If it doesn't do that, it gives us characters we should care about along each step of the way. The DaVinci Code does neither. Teabing leads Robert and Sophie on a quest that has an end in sight, even if we don't know exactly what it is. He gives the movie a much needed structure and his short lecture really sets up the mystery (even if it is about half-way into the movie). <br/><br/>Now, what about the big controversy about what the movie is about? Quite frankly if you're somewhat educated and you think that this movie is anything but fiction, you're probably going to die tripping over your own feet sometime very soon. I understand the controversy because the controversial ""facts"" are presented as just that: facts. I don't want to spoil anything by getting too into the specifics, but it deals with Jesus and whether or not he had a wife. Those who are poorly educated (which is a large part of the worldwide movie going population) can mistake what the movie presents as actual fact. Thus the movie has been banned in countries like India and China and edited beyond recognition in others. <br/><br/>At the end of the day the movie will be successful because the book was successful. Millions of people gobbled it up because it was ""entertaining."" I ask for a little more from entertainment than a fake history lesson. Heck, it would have helped to at least be a good fake history lesson."

Audrey Tautou is lovely to look at although her character seemed much smarter in the book. Paul Bettany as Silas was disturbing and exciting. Tom Hanks pretty much nailed his part. I don't think the characters of Teabing and Fache could have been better cast, perfection there. The movie strayed from the book too much to explain the story as well as the written version.

","I don't know why people hate this film, whether for religious or actually film related reasons, the film is great, not an epic spectacular but still great. It isn't gonna sweep the Oscars or anything.<br/><br/>Da Vinci's main strengths lie in it's supportive roles Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellan and especially Paul Bettany as Silas. Tautou was amazing and very believable as Sophie Neveu, Ian McKellan as per usual was both entertaining and very into his character of Leigh Teabing. But as great as Ian was Paul Bettany was just that little bit better, making Silas (as he is) violent yet very real and human with real feelings and emotions (I felt sorry when he died). All three deserve Oscar Nominations, Oscar wins for Bettany and Tautou.<br/><br/>A lot of people bash Tom Hanks for this, but I think it's only because everyone has their on image of who Robert Langdon was. It isn't the usual stellar Tom Hanks performance, but he is still good.<br/><br/>The cinematography of Da Vinci's flashbacks are also incredible.Oscar Nomination.<br/><br/>There are only three faults:Not enough of Jean Reno. It lacked a spark that I think falls under Ron Howards fault. He's a great director but I think wrong for this movie.

But, I found myself looking at my watch four times throughout the movie, and the man next to us kept yawning. Was it over hyped? Did we expect too much? Or was it just not suspenseful, which oddly enough draws me again to the conclusion of ""no comic element, no suspense."" Hitchcock made the opening of wine bottles in ""Notorious"" suspenseful. This movie failed to draw any feelings of ""a-hah"" or ""whoa"", even with the blood and death and flogging and knights of Temple and priority of scion and orgies and car wrecks, etc. Just no ummph.<br/><br/>The conclusion from my wife and I is: It would have been a better movie if Jay and Silent Bob would have done it.

","The Da Vinci Code is a missed opportunity, it has a fine cast, a potential good plot, great locations, but it is really not more then a moving powerpoint presentation of the main episodes from the book.<br/><br/>The director, Ron Howard, should be sent to a permanent vacation and should only concern himself with making slide presentations of a book, but never ever be allowed to make a movie again. The guy is an insult to the intellect. <br/><br/>For instance, there is a scene where the main characters are fleeing from France to England. They are waited upon by the police in England and face the problem of escaping from the plane. The plane has landed, Sir Teabing and his driver steps out of the plane, but Langdon, Neveu and Silas are not there. Later, when Sir Teabing drives away, they happened to be hidden in the back of the car. So far so good. However, and this is really insulting of that Ron Howard, then a flashback occurs. In this flashback it is explained how they got away. You see the plane landing, while the plane taxis, the door opens, Langdon and so jump out, run to the car and hide there. A whole stupid and intellect insulting scene during a minute or so. Really, they should fire that Ron Howard!<br/><br/>Other example. The film is shot on location, in the Louvre! An excellent opportunity to provide some nice shots and close ups of some art and the environment. But, nothing of that. Only the absolute bare essentials are brought into picture with respect to the art and the Louvre architecture. But when Langdon arrives at the Swiss bank to obtain the secret box, there is a scene where the access code is tried. This scene is meant to build up tension, intended to be in awe whether the key is correct or not. They punch in the number and a whole freaking minute is wasted with a close up on an ugly green, semi-futuristic display showing the punched in key and displaying a message that it is accepted. A whole minute wasted with an ugly way to build in tension, while all that beautiful art in the Louvre didn't get one minute of extra time.<br/><br/>Good, my conclusion. If you haven't read the book, it is a nice youth thriller. If the reli-conspiracy genre fits you, you might appreciate it even more. However, if you have read the book, you come to the conclusion that it has nothing extra to offer over the book. It follows the story line like a slave, and adds nothing to it, doesn't take advantage of the fact that is a movie, not a powerpoint slide. Furthermore, the atmosphere in the movie doesn't come out, like it does in the book. The movie doesn't give you that reli conspiracy feeling, like it should. Finally, there is no chemistry at all between the two main characters, Sophie and Robert, despite the fact that Tom Hanks is playing Robert Langdon. Clearly you cannot blame Tom Hanks. So please, do not see this movie, and boycott that amateur of a Ron Howard, that isn't able to mix all the fine ingredients in something that tastes good."
"kukiweed","5","0","1","11 June 2006"," At times entertaining, at times dumb and boring, a strange movie
","I just saw the movie last night, and, as a first impression it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, based on the critics opinions. Sone parts were actually entertaining (mostly the action parts), and although it got boring and even comically stupid at times, the 2 1/2 hours passed quite fast.<br/><br/>Now the bad parts: The scene that ruined the movie for me early on was the lecture that Hanks had in Paris at the beginning. I don't claim to be very intelligent or educated (I'm just a poor Romanian Engineering student), but even I know that the Svastika is an ancient Indian symbol for the sun, or that the Spanish catholics have a ritual which involves KKK like sheets, and so on.. that scene was so unbelievable because at that kind of lectures, the attendance is usually made up of intelligent people that are interested in that kind of discussion.. well, that wasn't the case in the movie, the audience seemed to be made up of idiots (or Americans) who had no idea of basic European symbols.. I guess the scene was a plot device designed to let everybody know that the Hanks character (don't remember his name, Lon.. something) was a genius, and so on, but for me it was a clear indication that the movie is aimed at the ""mentally challenged"" (or American) audiences, not at the people who actually know something about European history. And actually it was funny how there was a guy with a fake french accent ready to give the perfect wrong answer, so that Hanks can correct them with an arrogant answer.<br/><br/>One thing that shocked me was the way the movie took myths and pure speculations and presented them as facts. For example, the Merovingian family is presented as part of Jesus' bloodline. As somebody quite familiar with french history, I found that part ludicrous and laughable. And the painting by Da Vinci was presented like it was a firsthand representation of The Last Supper. I found myself wondering if I'm the only one who gets the fact that it was JUST A PAINTING made CENTURIES after the real event took place. How can a sane person base a theory like that on a PAINTING?? Leonardo Da Vinci was indeed a genius, but that doesn't mean he knew what really happened during The Last Supper. He probably did believe that Jesus got married with Maria-Magdalena, but his beliefs are quite irrelevant in a historical context. There were other parts of the movie I found laughable, but I have to see the movie again to make a list..<br/><br/>But the thing I hated most about ""The Da Vinci Code"" is that the plot was so dumbed-down, that any moron could understand it. I really hate movies like that (unless it has Jessica Alba or some serious T&A), and I couldn't help comparing DVC with another movie I saw recently (Syriana) which, although had some flaws, really made you think, and required at least half-a-brain to understand...<br/><br/>And another thing: I'we been to Paris once, and the biggest impression I had was of cultural diversity: there were like millions of Africans (Blacks and north African Arabs) in Paris, not to mention the many Portuguese, Italians and other Europeans, and scores of Japanese tourists (which were like everywhere). You don't see that in the Da Vinci Code: they're all white stereotypical french. I found that really unrealistic."

All in all I don't think it was worth the money, I'm sure many would contest that statement, and I myself never thought I'd say that about a film remake of such a good book but I stand by my opinion. With such a high calibre crew I figured they would've been able to pull it off nicely, or maybe my high opinion of the book tainted my review of the film, whatever the case, 5 out of 10 I'd say.

"leadbelly27","3","0","1","10 June 2006"," Harmless (albeit, predictable) popcorn film
","I was interested in seeing this film based on the controversy and hoopla surrounding the story. I had not read the novel, so I entered the movie with only the basic themes and plot points. What I was not expecting was that the film would give itself away within the first twenty minutes. I mean the whole film. Everything. After that I actually rather enjoyed the film in a kind of ironic way. Ron Howard presents the drama and suspense so seriously and awkwardly that it becomes rather funny at times. (The only suspense the film offered was whether or not it was really an elaborate SNL skit.) You know your film is in trouble when your action hero exclaims urgently, ""We have to get to a library, fast!"" I wasn't the only one who laughed. I guess the main problem is Ron Howard. He is like the Chistopher Cross of filmmakers. Lots of hits and awards, but in the long run, who will remember him (without laughing or wincing)? He is a utilitarian director who's biggest flaw is that he doesn't seem to understand that it is better to show and not tell. I get it already Ron! I got it a while ago! Tom Hanks is another problem. His acting is wooden, almost imperceptible. (Of course he is the only actor I can think of that has been upstaged by a volley ball). Don't even get me started on the brilliant Ian McKellen who wretchedly embarrasses himself in Da Vinci Code as an excitable Jesus scholar. If you don't believe me, pay close attention to the last twenty minutes where he seems to think that suddenly he needs to project as if he were on stage. The moody and atmospheric cinematography is the only bright spot in the film, and outside of the unintentional humor, the only nice thing I can say. Ultimately, I am not quite sure why everyone is getting all worked up about this film. The conspiracy aspect is interesting and with a better script and director it could have been something of quality. As it is the film is predictable popcorn fare; perhaps a bit better than your average summer mind-drain but all in all...""meh"". Not having read the novel I can only speculate on the source material, but I can imagine that Dan Brown spends a lot more time than Ron Howard showing and not telling with his fiction.

","It's another fine professional film directing job by Ron Howard - however, because the story is dense with history, exposition and details - the film plays much, much better if you have read the book.<br/><br/>In particular, if you're a fan of the book - you can compare your imagination of who you've casted, how you would've unfolded the script and how you would have directed the story cinematically. The story, plot and action unfolds at breakneck speed as they race to solve the riddle - however, there are parts of the film which bog down for exposition - but for those who've read the book (and who liked the book), the scenes play out much better because we know what's the gist but for those who have not read the book, some pertinent or important info might elude them as some scenes just fire info/details at you.<br/><br/>There seem to be some overly harsh negative reviews of the film, including Tom Hanks & Audrey Tautou performance which I frankly don't understand. Everyone is fine in this film and I wonder if it's just Catholic reviewers (whether they openly come out and disclose that or not) who loath even the mention of the subject matter that they cannot see anything beyond that.<br/><br/>DaVinci Code is not a great movie but it's a nice summer popcorn movie. Tom Hanks, as usual is solid - I was surprised at not only how gorgeous Audrey Tautou was but what a fine acting range she shows in her SECOND LAMNGUAGE - having only seen her in ""mousy"" roles, she was great. Of course, Ian McKellan really hams it up but that's what his role required and he seems to have great fun (as usual).<br/><br/>Again, don't be scared off by reviewers who might feel it's an affront to their religion. If they really watched the film, they'd see the issues are dealt with in a reasonably and complex manner. Certainly, it's your faith and you can be offended and that's your right - but at least be upfront and tell us that and not couch it by claiming it's the directing or the acting ... because that aspect is all just fine."
"schappe1","7","0","1","10 June 2006"," 50% of the people will agree with this review
","I say that because 50% of the people seem to agree with every review on the board. The film is that divisive and so the reviews are necessarily divided as well, along with people's reaction to them. I don't usually read novels but I read this one and I'm kind of sorry I did because it meant I knew everything that was going to happen ahead of time, just as with ""King Kong"". You wind up dissecting the film rather than experiencing it. If you are one of the few remaining cavemen who haven't read this book, I'd suggest seeing the movie first, then reading the book. It's easier to dissect a book and more fun to experience a movie.<br/><br/>The big problem in both mediums for this material is the tremendous amount of exposition required to have some idea of what is going on. There is conversation after conversation giving a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of history, at least the history Dan Brown decided to mix in with his dramatic speculations. The film at least cuts down on those to keep the action moving. It might have been a better idea to get all or most of that out of the way with Langdon's opening lecture, rather that jump-cutting to a book signing after his introduction. The filmmakers might have even had him dream about these events before he is awakened by the call from the police.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is a more experienced storyteller than Dan Brown and the movie shows it. It's much more streamlined than the book and handles things like the attitude of Teabing's butler much better. Tom Hanks is adequate as Langdon, (emphasizing his claustrophobia at the beginning is a master-stroke as it seems to confirm Feche's suspicions). Audrey Tautou is OK as Sophie, although the character is not very well defined in either the book or the film. Ian McKellen plays Teabing not merely as the closest thing to a ""bad guy"" in the story but something of a pathetically obsessed nut, also an improvement from the book.<br/><br/>Although the history in the story ranges from speculative to simply wrong, (the film also cleverly deals with this: Langdon noting that the Priory of Scion is ""thought to be a hoax"" but isn't), the basic idea of it: that it was intended that we be governed by traits both male and female, that our male dominated churches and governments have produced too much rivalry and violence and that we need more female nurturing, is a good one and well worth thinking about after seeing this film. But I'm still left with the basic question: If your group is opposed to the established church and possesses something that will ""destroy"" it, (surely an overstatement), why would you keep it a secret for 2000 years? Wouldn't this make more sense if the Church held ""the Grail"" and the Priory were trying to obtain it?"

","Dumbed down, softened for the movie-going public, lacked what it ought not, added what it ought not... Like diluted orange-juice, it left me wanting. If you read and enjoyed the book you'll react one of two ways to the movie: You'll either be disappointed as I was, or you may enjoy it (as I know people who did in that category). Having not read the book you will likely enjoy it. Certain comments I have read seem to suggest the movie closely follows the book. This could not be further from the truth. There were some critical differences as have been pointed out in other commentaries (I will not spoil anything here). These differences bothered me to the point of disliking the movie. Make up your own mind as to how severe these divergencies are. I still suggest seeing the movie as it can open your mind up to some very interesting ideas, namely that true history may not be depicted in our flawed accounts of it. The movie does only half the job of the book in conveying Dan Brown's message."

","WONDERFUL!!! INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!! I saw it 3 times so far and each time it has affected me more. Read the book twice. The casting was perfect and the script was amazing! The shortcuts they took were excellent; in fact, my nephew, who never read the book, got the movie immediately. Tom Hanks had the right combination of gravity, wit and understatement -his reading of the pivotal lines brought tears to my eyes and the final shot - oh my, how beautiful! What difficult lines they were and how easy to make them maudlin! And Audrey Tautou - she WAS Sophie and such a joy to watch. I'm going to have to start viewing her other movies. The critics are crazy - boring; rushed? I don't think so. Ron Howard and his production staff should be given many Oscars for the way they put this together (one can only IMAGINE how much film was shot and edited to pull this off and how brave they were to tackle it!) but I'm sure that will never happen, as the critics rule everything and fact that the basic premise and subject matter make everyone ballistic will unfortunately override what a terrific movie this is and how much praise it deserves. And hurray to Hans Zimmer for ANOTHER perfect score!And getting back to that subject matter - anything that sparks this much discussion on all sides can only be a GOOD thing!

"bakshijs470","6","0","2","10 June 2006"," Ron Howard didn't quite crack it
","Ron Howard's much hyped and rather unnecessarily over-marketed The Da Vinci Code had most critics carping after its Cannes premiere. Who cares? The excitement is at an all time high, there is controversy, the Da Vinci craze is in fever pitch mode, there are huge promotional events, posters are strewn all across the globe, the promos look fantastic- what more could one ask for? Critics? Who cares about them, that sore bunch of losers? The problem here is, they aren't very wrong in their assessment of the film.<br/><br/>Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is surely no classic. It is, however- despite the flaws and certain inaccuracies- one helluva entertaining and riveting ride. Sadly, director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman don't quite manage to crack the code. What they achieve, nevertheless, is nothing short of stupendous- it's an absolute movie-making miracle. For they have actually managed to rob the thrilling novel of almost every bit of thrill, pace and punch it has.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The Da Vinci Code is certainly not a bad film. It is eminently watchable, and I admit it does have some good moments. But when it's an adaptation of a book as explosive as The Da Vinci Code, one expects nothing less than total blockbuster perfection. The film falls way too short of that.<br/><br/>Okay, the good bit first- the monuments and locations look absolutely gorgeous and magnificent on screen, the cinematography is glorious- quite dark and moody, the camera angles are awesome.<br/><br/>The actors are wonderfully cast and play their parts rather well. Though the book likens Langdon's appearance to that of Harrison Ford, I somehow always pictured Tom Hanks in this role. Whether it be Forrest Gump, the AIDS affected lawyer in Philadelphia, or Viktor Navorski in The Terminal- there is this warm, humane quality that Hanks brings to all his characters. Hanks has a purity, an almost childlike innocence that is so vital to Langdon's character. I can't think of an actor who could play Langdon better- his presence illuminates the film.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou is perfectly cast as Sophie Neveu- she pitches in a good act, complimenting Hanks perfectly with her demure, yet dynamic presence. The other actors' roles are understandably not too fleshed out- with maybe the sole exception of Ian Mckellen who gives a wicked performance as the witty and eccentric Sir Leigh Teabing. However, the other actors- Alfred Molina, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany- are suitably competent in the limited scope that they get.<br/><br/>Now for the quirks- and believe me, they are many. Howard turns Code- which is essentially a fast paced thriller- into profound, serious drama, utterly boring and ultimately pretentious. It's his scholarly, austere, even almost religious approach to the story that pulls it down. This is a film that takes itself a bit too seriously. I mean- all those flashback sequences, the long sepia-toned historical explanations- were they really so necessary? The first one hour is fair enough, moving on pretty smoothly. It's the remainder of the film in which things begin to get really dreary- the excitement and pace is all missing.I can't say if Code begins with a bang, but it does end with a whimper.<br/><br/>Goldsman's script lets the book down terribly- there are hardly any clever, inventive touches- instead, he robs the book of some of its best moments. Much of Teabing's best lines are lost- I especially missed one in which he threatens the police that unless they'd let him go, he'd have his lawyers 'scramble their testicles for breakfast.' Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch is missing- I know it's trivial, but then these are those little touches that make any book or film special. Much of the film is spent in boring conversation and silly, juvenile arguments between Langdon and Teabing. By the time the 'climax' appears, you're too bored to even care. And then Goldsman delivers the worst blow of all- just when you thought that there was some romance brewing between Langdon and Neveu, he has Hanks plant a true-blue Bollywood style fatherly kiss on Tautou's forehead. Ouch, and ugh.<br/><br/>One last grouse- the whole mystique of the Holy Grail lies in its ambiguous form and nature- in the book, we never know how it exactly is, except that it consists of the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene and some documents. Howard, in the end, actually zooms down into the depths of the earth to show us the remains- as if to tell us- look, it's here! We know, Mr Howard, we know.<br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code, I repeat, is not a bad film at all. Fact is, it could have been explosive on celluloid. After watching Code, the thought that hurts most is that of what it could have been."

","I was initially afraid after reading some reviews and response at Cannes but I have learned reviews do not usually predict my own reactions to movies. I read the book and I thought Ron Howard did well adapting this to the screen. This sharpened some parts of the book and brought some of the ideas and scenes more into focus. Although the pacing was a little slow at times, after I got into the movie it fit. Overall it worked as a thriller, and it also worked as deeper exploration of the religious ideas. The scenery was gorgeous; I know a few people who've gone on 'Da Vinci' tours and it certainly inspires you to see these locales. The acting was wonderful and the actors were very appropriate for their parts. This is an adult movie, with philosophical and religious themes so maybe that's why it seems to stick out, ; so many movies now have the target of teens and are all animation or slick scifi."

Ian Mckellen(Gandalf himself!! or shall i say Eric MAGNETO Lensherr), Jean Reno(LEON !???), Alfred Molina(i just love the guy), Paul Bettany(believe me, SILAS was GREEAAAT) and even Audry Tautou(i didn't see Amelie but all that hype for nothing' ??) then when i read all those names i said that's gotta be something.<br/><br/>Then months later i heard about the novel from one of my relatives that had read it and she said it was great but very striking and for sure opposing Christianity as we know it and sure when adapted to the big screen and watched by millions will cause a very huge stir worldwide. So i borrowed it and read in about 16 Hours(on the course of 4 days) and WOW, i loved it very much.<br/><br/>Dan Brown is not Michael Chrichton, i mean he is not writing a Sci-Fi idea which is blended with reality and elements from our life so that we eventually believe it and take it for granted, but he has intrigued me to finish the last half of the book in 7 consecutive hours without stopping to do anything. I mean the rhythm is great and the events take place in just one day and one night and i love this very much, it makes me feel i'm with those guys and i'm actually feeling what they are doing and suffering and dealing with.<br/><br/>I loved the book, it is real and captivating and without entering religious disputes i thought after i read it the movie will be just PERFECT if they didn't mess with anything.<br/><br/>Then it all started, the refusal, the banning and the movie till this very day i write this comment didn't show in Egypt, so i frankly couldn't wait and downloaded it in just two days and just watched it this afternoon and i'll tell you what i think.<br/><br/>I think it is a very perfect movie especially for my taste of movies, the cast is all great-my highlights are especially Ian Mckellen and Paul Bettany-All critics said there is ZERO CHEMISTRY between Tom Hanks and Audry Tautou, I say they work together very fine.<br/><br/>Directing is great and cinematography is great and the Score IS great(Hans Zimmer after all gentlemen!) and the minor changes to the novel are good and they didn't mess with anything according to my own standards..... THIS IS A VERY PERFECT MOVIE.<br/><br/>So what is the problem ?, I'm writing it in these lines: every living Human Being on this very earth has his or her Religious beliefs, when someone in somewhere comes and try to test my faith and belief in my religion i have only 3 limited options: 01.I am not ready enough for discussion and debate because i really didn't read or know about my religion enough to argue.<br/><br/>02.I am totally aware of any aspect of my religion and the base of my belief so i am very ready for any question or discussion or dispute or argument and i will answer because I BELIEVE.<br/><br/>03.Iam not a believer, and any simple question or offense or even a hint to my belief will either confuse me or enrage me WITHOUT THINKING or just make me dump what i believe in and start looking anywhere else for a Religion.<br/><br/>So, why don't we let every man and woman in the world watch this movie and any other religious themed movie and let them decide for themselves and know WHO THEY REALLY ARE? BELIEVERS OR JUST PRETENDERS?."

","I just returned from seeing this film; I had previously read the book. As I often do, I read IMDb viewpoints afterward. In short, this is a rather tedious film that has taken great liberties with the novel. Were it not for a very sinister Paul Bettany and a consummate pro like Ian McKellen my rating would be lower. However, my biggest complaint is Howard's attempt to have it both ways when it comes to the central issue of whether or not Jesus is(was) mortal or divine. That historical dilemma was addressed, as the film informed, at the Council of Nicea. Howard, unlike those who attended that council, cannot decide which side he is on. Perhaps, he was too worried about selling tickets in the Bible Belt. In summation, a few worthy performances but they are overshadowed by a lack of directorial conviction. My caveat, don't pay full price, go to a matinée."

I really liked how they solved the puzzles in the movie, that was easier in the game, but in the movie they did that really well. And I don't understand why people are so upset by this movie, it was first a book, which also got bad reviews and complaints, but was sold over 30 million copies world wide. But when they make a movie of it, then more people have complaints, why all the fuss ? I know it's not respectful for people who are believers, but who says the movie is based on Facts ? Over 90 percent of the movies are not based on facts. If you don't like it, don't see it, but don't boycott the movie in Countries because most of the people don't like it, there is something called free opinion. But enough about this, back to the movie: The actors were great, The music from Hans Zimmer was excellent (as Ussual ;-) Thnx TriTri). I almost forgot, the two best actors of the movie were : Paul Bettany, I really needed to look twice to see it was him, and Jürgen Prochnow was also very good in this movie.<br/><br/>At the end, this is a very entertaining movie, and i've seen worse movies this year, so this movie isn't in my bottom top 10 for this year.

","The movie is just fine. It has a well- suited cast and awesome cinematography. Compared to the book though it is rather harmless, as in Tom Hanks' character's reverting back to faith in the second to last scene where the general message is it's important to have faith, no matter what in, be it in Jesus, in a woman, in anything divine or be it Buddhism. That rounds up the story in a nice way and especially in a peaceful way. Maybe that's Sony's compromise to soothe the upset fundamentalist crowds. Therefore the book was way more critical of the whole church/ Catholic apparatus. The movie's good and entertaining and as I said harmless and certainly no one who considers themselves devout has lost his faith over it!!! After all I didn't go hide in a bunker because of Independence Day!!!! To all fundamentalists: shame on you! Why didn't you even blink over movies such as The Hills have Eyes or Hostel, where the premise is just how fun it is to torture/ rape humans!!! Why didn't you go bomb the producers of those evil movies? You are such bigots! That is why I as a Christian have totally lost respect of you bigots and your man- made religion. No devout Catholic has ever gone to protest a porn movie or a brainless Schwarzenegger brutalo movie. THAT is where you should go and protest. The Da Vinci Code- mainly the book- is right, Catholicism is a sect made of men for men and for repressing of anything that these brainless dicks can't deal with: women, homosexuals, abortion, human rights, animal rights, .... you name it."

Howard's portrayal of each character made me wish that I had read the book, sheerly for the thrill of the ride. I could feel Hanks' fear of enclosed spaces. I felt the pain Tautou felt when telling her past with grandfather. The pain of her memories of the car accident that took her famalies' lives.

In fairness, there is no way the director could have fully captured the atmosphere of the book. The book was exceptional because of the detail and dedication to building up key moments in the plot. The movie although not dire, was a disappointment, compounded I am sure by the expectation from having read the novel. Hanks as Langdon was just a ridiculous choice. Having Hanks draws your attention to him rather than his character. His role should have been played by an unknown. The actor playing Sophie was better- more realistically fit the role. The rest of the cast was OK. The director although largely sticking to the plot, did not capture the drama and intensity of the novel. So many key moments were quickly skipped over. Some absolutely bizarre changes to the story were also made. To please fans of the novel, the filmmakers really needed to do a better job with details, and needed to generate the tension and anticipation of the book.

Now I understand why movie adaptations cut certain things, and add others for more drama, suspense, or romance. However the book had all of those and the movie cut a lot of it to add scenes that didn't even come close to matching up. Sophie and Langdon's characters are dumbed down, not really knowing how to figure anything out on their own, relying on Teabing for just about everything. I knew the movie wouldn't be as good as the book, but the entire main story line of the book is changed. Sophie's grandmother and brother weren't supposed to be alive. The entire Priory show up at the end, they never say Sophie's brother is alive....... basically they took the biggest twist of all, that made for a great ending, and omitted it from the movie. I didn't think the acting was that wonderful, and barely noticed the directing.

","As an avid reader of all things fiction and mystery, I'm no stranger to Dan Brown's works and have found them all to be very exciting, realistic, and have page-turning plots. The DaVinci Code (the 2nd book covering the exploits of Robert Langdon) was by most readers, the worse of the two by a narrow margin. Angels and Demons got better reviews overall. DaVinci Code was chosen for a movie though, because it translated better into movie format, and discussed topics that were both well known (Christ, The Church, Mary Magdalene, etc) as well as inflammatory in nature. Overall, the translation from book to movie was as good as it can be. There are simply too many facts and details presented in literature to cram it into 2.5 hours of acting, no matter how talented a screenwriter is. But DaVinci stays true to the key plot points presented in the book, provides enough key information without losing the thriller/dramatic style to keep the audience interested.<br/><br/>I get really fed up with reviews based on the subject matter of the movie rather than it's artistic merit. All I can say is you knew the storyline before you saw the movie, that's no excuse to bad mouth it later. Whether or not you believe that the Priory of Sion exists or not, the Knights Templar are hiding something that momentous or not, it makes no difference. This is, and has always been, a work of fiction created by one man, and designed to spark intelligent conversation about the life of Christ. Take it as it was meant to be taken, and you will enjoy this movie."

"UlisesGirl","5","0","1","8 June 2006"," So-so...
","When I began reading the DaVinci Code, I thought to myself, ""Hmmm... This could possibly be a great movie!"" As I read further into the book, I began to change my mind. There is too much information based on historical speculation contained in the book to accurately translate Dan Brown's writing into a visual medium. I would not say, however, that this is an awful movie. It's just ""okay."" A good job was done on making visual cues in the book become real on film, such as Landon's deciphering of clues given to him by the murdered professor. But as I stated previously, there is just simply too much information! The movie would have been even more unbearably long than it already was. While the visuals in this movie were excellent, I would have to say the story was far from action-packed. The difference between suspense in print and suspense in the movies is a gap wider than an ocean. What works well in text rarely works well in film! That was definitely the case in this movie. While reading the book, the reader is often caught up in the page-turning suspense... what's coming next, what is the next clue, etc. But in a movie, the action has to be much more tightly laced in order to keep the viewers attention. Such was not the case in the DaVinci Code. Momentary spurts of action are interrupted by lulls which are then interrupted by mediocre action scenes. This movie is not one I would encourage someone to spend 9 bucks on to see in the theatre. Rent it when it comes out - trust me, you can wait."

","The Da Vinci Code is, in my humble opinion, a very good movie. Admittadly, like all movies, the book is a hundred times better, but it was a good, faithful adaption (unlike The Lost World by Crichton - give me the book any day!).<br/><br/>Many people seem to feel threatened by the film - many Indian countries, and now China, have banned the film. Certainly, the storyline is controversial, and bound to upset people who are staunchly against this kind of idea. However, to quote Dan Brown himself, ""It's fictional - it's called a novel""(!). The Da Vinci Code is a fictional book - it is not trying to put forward the idea of Mary Magdalene as true or false, but simply, as other novels, providing an entertaining read - and by the same lines, the film also does not attempt to prove/disprove it, simply trying to entertain us.<br/><br/>Once you have put all previous beliefs aside, and accepted that what you are about to see is fictional entertainment, then the Da Vinci Code is a very good film. Silas and Teabing spring to mind instantly as exceptionally good actors - McKellen provides a very good character, injecting humour as well as seriousness into the film. By the same token, Bettany plays Silas fantastically - his self-flagellation and attacks are often quite unsettling. The music and cinematography used throughout is very good - one thinks especially of the shot where the viewer only realises that the dark figure standing out of focus is Silas once the camera suddenly focuses on him. The film is very true to the novel; while many parts are condensed or left out, and flashbacks added in different places, I (having read (and loved) the novel first) still found the film immensely enjoyable.<br/><br/>10/10"
"DonFishies","7","0","2","7 June 2006"," Has it's moments, but not totally rewarding
","Is there really anyone who has not read The Da Vinci Code? Dan Brown's behemoth best seller was a definite page-turner, and clearly had the makings for a film. So when it was finally announced, there was obvious skepticism over whether it would work as well as the book did. Casting decisions were brought with heavy criticisms, but the hype machine persevered anyway (if anyone had doubts about that, I am certain they did not last). So despite reading the book and not being overly impressed by it (and seeing the film have key moments practically ruined by the trailer), I still decided to give it a shot.<br/><br/>The curator has been murdered in the Louvre, and the French Police decide that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), an American symbologist, is the best man to go to in order to find out why. Of course, when Langdon arrives, he finds out that he is totally over his head, and that his symbology skills will become more than handy. What follows is a totally political story, which questions our faith in the knowledge we have, and brings on a whole flurry of new questions for us.<br/><br/>Brown's page-turner was fast-paced, and practically flies right through its four hundred plus pages. But as any film fan should know, a good book does not always make for a good film. Ron Howard's film attempts to fly through its one hundred fifty minute runtime, but hits the roadblock of the immense historical elements of the book, and just slows down entirely about halfway through the film. And as it tries to recover, you realize that it just does not have the same charm as the book did. The book had flashbacks, it had motivations, it had emotions, it had everything you could expect from a good writer. It was practically written like a screenplay. So then, why did Akiva Goldsman find the influence to cut those things out, and allow the film to only make total sense to the book readers (while changing other things around, taking things out and adding in comic relief)? It totally takes away from the overall impact that the book had, and the film suffers as a result. When the interesting parts come, they just do not have the same thrill, or just come off as totally uninteresting.<br/><br/>Howard does make a valiant attempt at staying true to the book though, even with the changes. The editing in of Langdon's puzzle solving work helps the audience better understand his thinking, and the footage used to show off the historical events is pretty well done as well (except for when they try to seamlessly edit it over the modern day, with Hanks and Audrey Tautou walking through it). But while that may work sparingly, the entirety of the soundtrack quite simply, does not. The songs seem out of sync, as if someone edited them into the film at the wrong frames. The volume loudens at the wrong moments, and goes quiet at the even more wrong moments. It seems totally misplaced throughout the film, and lessens the film even more so.<br/><br/>Hanks was the wrong choice from the start, and he shows it with his lackluster performance. It is nowhere near as good as the majority of his work, and he just does not seem to be enjoying himself. Tautou, the female lead, does not fare much better, but at least she puts some work into her performance. Unfortunately, like in the book, these two characters are the most seen, so excellent supporting character work from Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and Paul Bettany falls to the wayside. In fact, Bettany's role as Silas is the most underrated here, because he has nowhere near as much to work with as he would have if his character was adapted a whole lot better. On the other hand, Ian McKellan is fabulous in his role, and shows up anyone he's on-screen with at all times. The passion he has in this role almost makes me want to forgive Howard for even bothering to give Hanks a shot at this.<br/><br/>The film has it's moments, but is ultimately unrewarding to book fans. Some things work, but many do not. The film feels rushed, and feels like it needed much more time to be developed. Brown's book was not disappearing off the best seller list, so why the need to rush out the movie? With time, and a few choice changes, this film could have met the same raving success that the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter films met. But unfortunately, it falls short of any expectations. Even without reading the book, you may find some enjoyment out of it. Just don't expect it to feel totally complete.<br/><br/>7/10."

I like Hanks a lot in his lighter, comedic roles. He is charming and engaging. He just didn't have the edge needed for this role, and his lines were sometimes wooden.

Instead, I found an endless repetition of Keystone Cops police car chases (of course escaping in the nick of time), boring boring lecturing on this that and the other bit of history and background (is this a movie or a lecture?), and downright silly scenes (the Bishop and Silas lying side-by-side like a scene from a grammar school play, or replaying the way they escaped from the private jet, in case we might not have thought that they'd get away). I could hardly keep from laughing at some scenes as I was reminded of the Monty Python skit of ""Nobody Expects the Spanish Inquisition"". Finally, as far as the great climax to the mystery of the movie, that Sophie was the last descendant of Mary Magdalene was the obvious conclusion about half way through the movie.<br/><br/>As regards the great religious controversy, since it is fiction, the film didn't bother me much except for the scene where Sophie makes fun of Jesus' walking on water, somehow implying that he didn't do it either. The film reiterates that Jesus was divine, having risen from the dead, since they don't seek His grave, which would obviously be of higher importance than Mary Magdalene's grave to believers or detractors.<br/><br/>To sum it up, the film was much ado about nothing (did I mention it was boring?)"

Through it, there are moments where I thought things like: 'Wait a minute, isn't he supposed to be on their side?' and 'Why is he suddenly pointing a gun at him?'. And the plot line is just ludicrous. So did Jesus engage in sexual activities with Mary Maglidine? However, the film does have a few good bits, such as Hanks's character doing a presentation about symbols. Even though it's crap, I think you should still see it.

His one liners also brought the much needed humour into this movie.<br/><br/>However the scene when the three protagonists sit in Sir Ian's mansion and discuss the evidence about the grail which was clearly the most important part of the movie could have been much better. The evidence provided in the book was far more conclusive and here it only looked like a well publicised conspiracy theory which can be summed up in the movies dialogue only (The Eyes See Only What They Want To See). This scene could have also been used to help a lot of the other questions in the movie (such as why did the bank manager attack the duo?).<br/><br/>This movie could have done with at least one more reveal all, or explanatory scene summing up the movies events.<br/><br/>The technically the movie was as good as any but I felt it could have done with some good background score or a theme or something.<br/><br/>The movie offered no excitement a person who has read the book and I'm sure hardly any for one who has not.<br/><br/>Most People who have read the book will not enjoy this movie and those that have not will not understand this movie.<br/><br/>A strictly OK movie which is entertaining and more than anything satisfies your curiosity without leaving you bored (cant say the same about some of the remakes and sequels which have been watched out of curiosity).<br/><br/>Don't expect too much and you wont be disappointed."

Whatever the reason was for the negative reviews I felt like all of the actors did an excellent job and the story was unfolded in the correct ""pace"", most of the reviews talked about how the timing and pace of the movie were off. I didn't even notice how long the movie was. I also wanted to comment on the religious controversy that the film has sparked. I am a Christian and I went into the theater understanding that the story behind the movie was was just that, a story. I left the theater appreciating how original Dan Brown's story is, not upset.

"sgt_pepper89","7","0","2","6 June 2006"," Excellent Adaption of the Book
","""The Da Vinci Code"" is highly entertaining due to its substance. There have been many negative reviews about its length and tedious pace, but I think that Ron Howard took the right approach when he converted the book to cinema. It's not a Hollywood blockbuster - action-packed, thrilling, or suspenseful as the book ever was. It's smarter than that.<br/><br/>The movie delves deep into a secret that could shake the foundations of the Catholic community, and it emphasizes this aspect of the book more than the pacing. Sure, at times I felt like sleeping, but it was rewarding to see that they really explained the story that has been getting so much controversy lately.<br/><br/>In other words, although the movie was stripped of its excitement, the fundamental part of what made the book intriguing and remarkable remains intact.<br/><br/>The acting won't get any academy awards, but Tom Hanks makes a good Robert Langdon and so does the actress who plays Sophie. Ian McKellen is the perfect Teabing too.<br/><br/>In the end, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody who doesn't have the patience to hear about Catholocism (maybe you have to be Catholic to truly appreciate the message?) At any rate, it's that part of the movie - the plot that Dan Brown made so famous - that is the movie's highlight. If you've read the book, I think you'll genuinely enjoy it.<br/><br/>I did. =)"
"michael-dixon2","7","0","1","6 June 2006"," Great support acting saves the film-just.
","I spent most of this film wondering who would have been better in the role of Robert Langdon other than Tom Hanks. Little doubt the late William Holden for one, amongst many of that era, but in practical terms I kept coming back to Harrison Ford. I thought that Hanks spent his time sleepwalking through the film and there was no chemistry whatsoever between him and his talented leading lady, claimed to be, in a ridiculous ending, the last descendant of Jesus Christ no less. Harrison Ford, along the lines of his excellent interpretation of a very worried husband in the film ""Frantic"", when his wife was mistakenly kidnapped, ( and also filmed in Paris), would have been far superior to the lacklustre Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>So I say well done to the supporting actors who were basically excellent and literally rescued this film, notably Paul Bettany who was very scary, Sir Ian McKellen of course and the talented Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa. But my personal favourite was Jean Reno as the French Captain whom I thought was first-rate as a somewhat confused but sinister policeman. Therefore despite best efforts from all the actors mentioned, in addition to those with small roles who themselves were very effective, when the leading man is wooden, the whole film inevitably suffers.<br/><br/>The story itself is interesting enough and people can decide for themselves if they accept some of the claims made about the Christian faith. As a regular churchgoer I think that the Roman Catholic Church has over-reacted in its condemnation, as anybody with half a brain could see that it was a film based on a theory, nothing more. In any event the Catholic Church could surely see quite clearly that the Ian McKellen character, who believed it all, was eventually portrayed as half-mad and soon for the funny farm. Indeed by the end Sir Ian was playing it a bit like a pantomime, presumably deliberately. The film was so obviously presented as a piece of fiction. interesting but hardly conclusive. People are intelligent enough to work that out for themselves without the Church telling them what to believe. Anyway there were only 7 people for the Catholic Church to worry about in the cinema where I saw the film!!! <br/><br/>I have not followed the career of Tom Hanks so presumably he is a very talented film star. This performance must have been just a one-off or else he would not have gone so far in his career. But I thought he did not come up to expectations here and was barely adequate. As such a potentially very good film was, for me,just satisfactory, thanks to the other performers and some decent location scenes in France. A chance missed I am afraid and I would seriously suggest a remake in about 10 years time. <br/><br/>Michael Dixon,Sunderland, England."

","Why is Tom Hanks always playing the good guy? Love to see him in a nasty role for once. <br/><br/>The movie itself has so much religion and philosophy mixed in, it's easy to start losing interest. Unless you are deeply into religion, then it might be okay. Far too much, hushed conversations behind closed doors, robed figures, religious principles and ideology just rolling off the tongue, most of which the average Joe would have no idea about, or be able to visualise. Confusing, boring in places, and too much specialised knowledge needed to understand what on earth this movie is trying to say.

","Well, I finally went and watched this film just to see what all the fuss was about in the media. As a Christian, I figured that this must be some mind-blowing doctrinal thing, but it turned out that it was just something that the Mormon doctrine has been saying for years ... that Christ was married and had offspring. If this movie wins any big awards, it will have to be for the controversy it stirred up, much like ""Brokeback Mountain"" did last year, and not because of the film's concept. Overall though, I enjoyed the film as it made for a good story. It seemed that it took them forever to just get to the point in some places, but the action scenes were put in at just the right times to keep you interested in the film. I hadn't read the book, but it was pretty easy to figure out that Ian McKellan's character was The Teacher and that Sophie was supposed to be offspring of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. I assumed this halfway through the film, but I sat there for the last hour anyway. Ron Howard pulled off a good show despite what critics with their personal religious agendas may be saying. But I was a little disappointed with Tom Hanks' performance. Tom is such a great actor and one of my all-time favorites. But in this film, he seemed a little wooden in areas. Certainly not ""Forrest Gump"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" material. When he was in the museum, it seemed that, at some points, he was simply reading off of the cue cards with very little emotion. But to take back an earlier point I made, I think that this film is worthy of one Oscar nod, and that would be the nominating of Ian McKellan for Best Supporting Actor. He is always entertaining, and he fit his role in this film very well. He was the bright spot of the film and did not disappoint."

I did not read the book, so I don't know if the director was forced to display so many absurd situations by the original story, or it was his own idea. <br/><br/>The story begin when mortally shot man wrote riddles and anagrams on the paintings and floor of the museum. Commissar investigating the case is bringing his main suspect into this site instead of arresting him (and he will delete the main evidence from the floor before). Then the suspect will miraculously escape. Escapes in this movie are really funny. Like when the man with the gun was attacked by pigeon inside the cathedral, or escape in the backseat of the car from the hangar surrounded by police. Story is quite boring and linear. The basic idea of creating the chain of riddles all around the Europe to acquire the password for the casket is unrealistic. <br/><br/>Acting was fairly good. Except for Audrey Tautou, who seemed little affected in some scenes. Surely this was not the best performance of Tom Hanks and Jean Reno, but it was acceptable. <br/><br/>I cannot remember of any music from the movie. I guess there was some, but it was very fading and forgettable. It is a pity, because for mystery movies, the music is quite important to emphasize the atmosphere. <br/><br/>The movie is quite controversial, and I think it is the only reason for its popularity.

This movie is pretentious, poorly acted, and attempts to convey a muddled message on a complicated subject that is meant for serious scholarly consideration and not to be grist for another half-baked Hollywood potboiler. The movie attempts to use a theological controversy as the basis for a convoluted ""who-done-it"" story and in the process makes assertions that even for a work of fiction demands credible evidence. Now the producers of this movie have the absolute right to make a movie with a theological content, but along with that right comes the responsibility of providing hard evidence to back up the movie's fantastic and completely speculative assertions. Further, the characters in this movie are so utterly superficial, uninspiring, uninteresting and comic-bookish that it seemed that even the actors themselves knew that this movie is one big turkey.

If you've read the book you'll find the movie even more commercial, never in the book Robert Langdon finds out Sophie Neveu is in the line of the blood of Christ, and it never assures that the holy grail is in fact the tomb of Mary Magdalene, but adding those things to the movie is just a way to make the movie more controversial, cause all Ron Howard cares is to make as much money as possible.<br/><br/>I'll say it is a very entertaining movie for those who haven't read the book yet, but if I would have to see a blockbuster popcorn movie (because that's what it is) i'd pick a better one like the amazing X3."

Why hasn't film yet tried to break free from it's artistically inferior position and stopped slaving behind The Novel. Film is a visual medium. The Novel is, most of the time, not. THE DA VINCI CODE is another example of a bad film that had every potential to be good.<br/><br/>Of course, I couldn't read the book. I found it to be a case of ridiculously poor writing with silly cliffhangers at the end of literary every chapter. I threw it away after four chapters with a feeling of being humiliated as a reader. I had, to say the least, low expectations of the film. Then again, a good opportunity to be open minded.<br/><br/>But the film *was* bad. The main reason is the bad craftsmanship, something that I was truly surprised about. I figured Ron Howard was competent enough to make a Hollywood thriller (RANSOM is underrated) but here we have a Tom Hanks for five minutes, suddenly accused for murder, then an Audrey Tatou hops on the bandwagon - everybody is acting very excited; but the excitement has not been built up, nor has the characters. The result: I don't care about them or their situation. I don't even buy it. And then follows 2.5 hours of not caring or buying, in a plot that constantly is fairly predictable and filled with used tricks. Some defenders have called this a ""thinking man's movie"". How difficult is it to follow a film that is explanatory beyond the ridiculous; - Unless the letters aren't in it's right place... - An ANAGRAM! - An anagram! Come on...<br/><br/>And then of course, the whole ""respect for the book""-idea kills off the film even more. The film is EXTREMELY talky and UNBEARABLY long. That could be good book material. Can we all agree that it is not good film material? Where is the suspense? Where is the excitement? Nowhere of course, since the filmmakers have been too busy reading the book to be thinking of making a good film. This could have been a tight, sweaty two hour cat-and-mouse-film. It could have been anything. It's a filmed book, with the book's ""fill the characters up with your imagination""-characters, filler sequences that give coherence to the novel's story (but is dragging the FILM along) and it's ""take your time""-ending.

In hindsight, there is nothing repulsive shown in this movie and don't know why there is such a fuss.<br/><br/>ACTING : Ian Mckellen, as always, is a class of his own as Sir Leigh Teabing. He pumps in the requisite energy for that role. Tom Hanks, with all due respect, is merely acceptable at best and fails to capture the magnitude of Langdon's character. Audrey Tautou, as Sophie Neveu, is unfortunately pathetic. Her heavy French accent is a pain to the ears and her childish looks somehow fail to mingle with the film's setup - a clear case of character mismatch.

With so many religious battle and debate, finally they released the movie with many scenes were already delete, which I believe were very much essential to the movie and understanding of the Christian history I believe that being a Christian needs a person to be deeply rooted to His faith but In my opinion, history is made by man and altered through time so not all things written in the bible were exactly the same as what really happened in the past.<br/><br/>Probably one thing that a person needs put in mind is to have faith in His God and not to question things that are speculative and unanswerable. People are only human to commit mistakes, and Jesus Christ himself was born human, given to us by the God the Father to save us to our sins but it doesn't mean that he is perfect."

","The film is like watching one of those text based PC adventure games from the 80's. I can see it now: ""You are Robert Langdon accused of murder; the French Police are trying to catch you; you must solve the riddles and find the real culprit, while discovering the real bloodline from Jesus that could shake the whole catholic church before your energy runs out"". The protagonist, who is lecturing to students at the start of the film, in an Indiana Jones type manner, is called upon by the French Police to help solve a strange murder. There then follows two and hour hours of puzzle solving and distracting flashbacks. The film, despite it s subject matter, is watchable but suffers from being overly long. In fact, the best use of time, is the telling of silas' past in 30 seconds - just like a Tony Scott TV commerical. The Lead role isn't really demanding for Tom Hanks who puts in a delivery that wouldn't be out of place in the 'Keanu Reeves' school of acting. Audrey Tautou seems miscast in the role. You may as well have put in Rachel Weiz (more fun then!). The only reasons worth seeing the film is for Ian McKellen who really steals the show. Paul Bettany proves he can play a nasty villain, too. There is a twist at the end, if you stay awake that long."

","Slow, boring, incomprehensible, silly in its premise, and no movement at all. By half-way through (about 5 hours), I no longer cared for any single character or plot trait. What a waste of time. Absolutely no character development, an incomprehensible plot, duologue which was stilted and unintelligible to a large part, and filmatography through a mud puddle. What's there to like? Locations in France? I did not at all enjoy the book, finding the ridiculous plot twist at the end of each chapter to be tiring. Naturally, I viewed the movie in a similar vein. But the movie was visually unappealing, slow in every aspect, and made no real sense. Sophie is the only, last, direct descendant of Christ? In 2000 years, the family tree comes down to one person? That can't be. It would have branched hundreds of times. So, the main plot twist is a virtual impossibility."

","I have not read Dan Brown's book on which this movie was based. His book has become a huge bestseller and has created a lot of fuss and interest, almost to the point of hysteria. After seeing this very disappointing movie, I just can't see why.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is an excellent director, but he was totally the wrong choice for this movie. I am thinking what someone like Roman Polanski on song would have done which would have been to create an intriguing atmosphere fulled with suspense, unease, darkness with the necessary compelling complexity. This movie is difficult to follow (perhaps I should read the book but why should I to follow a movie??, boring to the point that I fell asleep watching it, in a few places, extremely badly lit( the whole movie was set in the dark which added absolutely nothing to the story or supposedly what was meant to be a foreboding atmosphere). The performances are totally lacking with everyone seemingly just going through the motions. The conclusion offers nothing startling and I feel right now - so what is all the fuss???As for the direction- it creates a poorly paced, stodgy film lacking in any intrigue and does not make me feel compelled to carry on watching, while now and then nodding off. I actually feel I am being generous giving this one a 4. Ron Howard you have done much better in the past and no doubt will again. Perhaps you were began with a poor script. You always see to work with Akiva Goldsman. Why not someone else for a change? This movie is at the end of the day a wasted opportunity."

However, in this movie, with this role, he has elevated himself to a new degree of scrumtralescence. I wish he had just slightly more screen time, but he is a principle character throughout most of the film, and whenever he's on screen, it's an absolute treat. Go see Ian McKellen. Go Now."

","A best seller thriller book, with his own writer as an executive producer,and closely checking the scripts, i suppose. A widely known and Oscar winner director, and at least three actors that are iconic in their home countries. One could imagine one of those films made for history, those which make us go into theaters, at least a couple or three times in order to taste them well and capture all those little issues that made us fall in love with them. Unfortunately a story, which starts with a large background built on controversy, often causes great expectations, not reached in this time. From the technical issues, it's a good work. The sound, the music, the set design were excellent choices and properly developed. A great advertising campaign (of course deserved) for Paris, and it's iconic Louvre. It's a shame that a well-known director, who is recognized for excellent works in actor direction,as those made on A Beautiful Mind, do not exploit also well-recognized acting talents such as Tom Hanks, Jean Reno and even Audrey Tatou. Only remarkable, Sir Ian McKellen, as usual, and Paul Bettany who always achieves his potential in a very, very theatrical but credible way. Also the story is not enough developed, and a book which could became a masterpiece of thrillers, only reaches the level for keeping someone amused for two hours and a half. Very little to talk about after the film. It looks like it was made only for profits and as it has became a big box office hit, i bet they are already planning a film for Angels and Demons. Wish them better luck for the next, not for their pockets as for their artistic conscience"

","For me this film was the equivalent to a visual dose of Vallium, it almost put me to sleep. You know a movie is bad when you keep looking at your watch. Indeed, this is one of those films. <br/><br/>One would think the novel is a perfect candidate for a summer blockbuster with its mix of religious controversy, conspiracy theories and romantic European settings but something got very lost in translation to the big screen. And coming from Ron Howard, of all people, that this film is such a big failure is somewhat puzzling.<br/><br/>I think one of the biggest errors came down to the casting of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. He simply is not believable in this role and appears to be merely sleep walking his way through it. His acting seems to set the tone for the entire movie - droll and lifeless. Audrey Tatou's beauty, Ian McKellen's fine acting and Paul Bettany's albino menace are just not enough to overcome this tone that permeates the final product.<br/><br/>Not all is bad. There is some very nice cinematography to be seen; the Louvre, Paris, the cathedrals all look stunning. I also thought the ending scene, Tom Hank's visit to the Louvre was wonderfully done and it really was the only time during the entire move that I actually felt something and was, dare I say it, moved. <br/><br/>One star for the cinematography, and one each for Tatou, McKellen and Bettany.<br/><br/>In the end, nothing I say will change anybody's mind from seeing this film! Having read the book you will feel absolutely compelled to see it (as I was) - just don't set your expectations very high at all. It may also be that those who haven't yet read the book are going to find much more enjoyment in the film, as was the case with my friend. Lucky them."

","Having read the book, I had expectations of the movie. But after seeing it, I was utterly disappointed... Solving the puzzles was so lame, based on such unknown logic, that I was surprised; they are drawing conclusions out of nowhere, as if it is expected of the audience to have read the book in advance so that they can fill the gaps in the movie (lots of them, by the way) automatically. Many details in the book are simply omitted, perhaps in light of simplifying the movie for widest audience, but in doing so, the intricacies have also been lost. The role of Robert Langdon could have been cast better. Usually I like Ian McKellen's roles, but here he was also a bit ""off center"", as if he is pretending to be acting; it looks that the for the most part the script writer did not know what to do and how to capture the audience, to really pull them in, to let them feel the excitement of discovering the solution to the puzzles. Audrey Tautou is a good cast, however her character is also undeveloped. One good thing is the music score. It appropriately accompanies the events, and sounds good, mounting expectation. Hans Zimmer did a good job. The book is a good and gripping fiction novel, but the film is a waste of time and talent."

It would've been better if they've chosen some other actor that really fits Langdon's features, and Sophie is not that good enough in acting, which contributed to the movie's unpleasantness; her acting affected of ""how"" some scenes supposed to be they've had even changed some vistas which frustrate the people's envision...some parts won't even stir up your feelings...<br/><br/>It doesn't worth your time!!!

At least, one has the satisfaction that, all your life you have underestimated your visualization power!! Because for all that you had imagined while reading the book, are on screen. But what is the explanation for those, who have not read the book? What if there was no literary work? It seems, the film is made for people, who are more than casual audience.<br/><br/>The high points of the movie is its direction, cinematography and use of music.Paul Bettany and Ian Mckellen did complete justice to their respective characters of Silas and Sir Leigh Teabing.Robert Langdon played by Tom Hanks did his bit but more than that, he has something called 'reputation'which played its part. But there is one person in the film who was very consistent and was regularly irregular in giving a different expression. She maintained the same look on her face from beginning to end. Introducing Sophie Neveu who is giving new definitions to consistency. But her dialogue delivery and accent came in as her saving grace.<br/><br/>To bring an element of humour in a mystery is not an easy task, but the film has been able to bring what is called situational humour.<br/><br/>The unfolding of the mysteries came in a flash of second. Agreed, it may strike but the acting on the part of Langdon and Sophie while they were on Louvre was very cold.<br/><br/>There is nothing called 'bad publicity' and the controversy created, has been paid well."
"shuichi_shindosan","3","0","3","3 June 2006"," An honest review
","Dear readers,<br/><br/>I wanted to read this book on it's release date, but as most people expected it got sold out very quickly and I missed my chance. I waited about a week for my book store to get it back in, but sadly no! So I just forgot about it, and I continued to read the bible (my faith) and love the world for what it really is, A Holy Place! <br/><br/>I eventually stumbled across The Da Vinci Code book again, it was really cheap, I thought 'why not?' So I went over to the cash register and bought the book for £2. I read it and put it down all most instantly, I was appalled at what it was suggesting! I made myself think for a long while. I read more extracts from the bible, bits that said 'people may have different thoughts, but you choose what to believe' (words not officially accurate, but gets the point.)<br/><br/>So when I read more of the bible and understood that there are people that do try and unfaith religion, I read it. I in honesty found the book really boring, it was an upset in books, I am a fond reader of books and this was truly an insult to books! I said to myself 'a small work of fictional writing!' Of course I didn't believe what the book tried to put across, it's because your not meant to! It's just an interesting book to read, just read it, so be it really.<br/><br/>Then I heard of a film, and i thought 'great, now all the people who can't be bothered to get of there fat arse and read a book, can see it in screen format!' I was appalled. RON HOWARD! I was shocked that he of all people would make a movie like this! Then he put in a fantastic cast, Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian Mckellon etc. It was a surprise, did they believe what the book tried to tell us, I don't know. But what I do know is the Catholic church didn't believe it, and neither did I!<br/><br/>Now onto the movie itself. Not bad, not great either, to be honest it's pretty average, it's like one of those book adaptations that are not great, but have something good about them. I am a catholic, so as soon as the film came out, I expected to hate it! But not really hating it, liking some of it. It was an interesting tale.<br/><br/>Jesus getting married to Mary Magdalane, her being in the last supper picture.....That is really a man, look how many men there are now, that resemble women, it was the same then, most men grew long hair. Here are some things raised in the film,<br/><br/><ul><li>Not Holy Grail in the picture of The Last Supper - Mary and Jesus fell in love - Phillip, who was he? An ignored book!Mary's Gospel! - Holy Grail = Woman's womb - Sang real in translation from French to English means Royal Blood - Mary pregnant at the time of Jesus's Crucifixion - The baby was born, it was a girl called Sarah - Greatest cover up in human history - Sophie (Audrey Tautou) Grandfather, is the Grandmaster - Secret to be trusted - The Key Stone - Small facts about the Key Stone Legend hides beneath the Rose Inside a map, leads to Holy Grail Trained by Grandmaster, sang riddle songs No something and never say again</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Only worthy can unlock the Grail - 2000 years, the church has done loads things in the name of God - Jesus was a normal man - The dark can be exposed - The Prioer was meant to expose the holy grail for the new millennium - Explode the truth - A.P.P.L.E</li></ul><br/><br/>See these things bring interesting points across, but it's all up to you what you believe really, I don't believe much of this, but it certainly does raise a good few points! Here's a little more:<br/><br/>The holy grail has gone home The holy grail in Ancient Roslin The blade and challis as the Pagins wanted She rests beneath the starry sky's Mary Magdalane is the Holy Grail<br/><br/>This is the final outcome of the film, The film explains history doesn't always explain itself. You believe what you want to believe. But also it raises the point, why cant Jesus have been married and had a child, and be the son of God at the same time. <br/><br/>I honestly cant answer that, but I believe if Jesus really did have a child, it's not a cover up, it's just something that hasn't been explained to its best ability, Jesus was always the son of God.<br/><br/>Amen.

"Kaeleighs_Justice","1","0","3","2 June 2006"," Bad adaptation, really bad screen writing
","This was by far one of the worst screen writing adaptations I have ever encountered. Akiva Goldsman wrote the screenplay. He can claim fame to other scripts such as A Time to Kill, Batman Forever and The Client (among many more you'd now...and many are adaptations of novels. That would inspire some confidence that he'd do a decent job. Ha! If he didn't have such an impressive resume I'd say never let him write again. Okay that might be a bit harsh. The Da Vinci Code was never a book that could be put on screen successfully in a 2 1/2 time span, but I could have written a better screenplay.<br/><br/>Nothing's ever going to follow a book exactly, but this movie takes way too many liberties.<br/><br/>1) Fache: In the book he's stern, but he comes off as a character that you can still care for. He's strong, a bit ruthless, but has a conscious. When I learned that Jean Reno was playing the part of Fache I was excited. I could see him playing the part beautifully...that is if it had been written well. In the movie his character was portrayed as more of a mean-hearted moron than a smart yet determined man.<br/><br/>And what was the point of making Fache a member of Opus Dei. Seriously there are some things that can't follow the book...this was not one of them. They could have easily written the character of Fache to be portrayed as he was in the novel. This would not have been too difficult a stretch.<br/><br/>2) Sophie: This was by and large one of the most annoying aspects of this movie. They portrayed Sophie as a weak and 'dumb' female. In the novel she's a smart, strong, and quick thinking woman who is Langdon's equal. In the movie they barely give her a brain. All throughout. It's not just here and there a random moment or two...it's the entire movie. Bad bad screen writing.<br/><br/>3) Langdon: Just thinking about his lines make me cringe. I've never had to listen to facts delivers more dryly and uninterestingly (is that a word?) than I did here. Make the male strong the female weak? Is that was they were thinking? Langdon was a flat character. You're suppose to like him but he gives you no reason to feel one way or another about him. He was 'blah'. Uninteresting and a bit pompous at times.<br/><br/>4) Casting: Sorry, but they did an awful job of casting. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou had no chemistry. I actually really like Audrey Tautou. I thought she was (even though they wrote her part awfully) the most believable of characters. She took what she had and made the best of it. Tom Hanks...well to me I felt like he rather be else where the entire time. I felt like he had no interest in the history he was supposedly suppose to know. Worst I felt that he didn't understand what he was spouting off and it came off so stilted.<br/><br/>5) Silas: He wasn't too bad, but he wasn't developed enough. In the movie he came off as evil where in the book there was this constant battle within himself. He wasn't 'good' but he wasn't purely 'evil' either. There was no dimension to Silas in the movie.<br/><br/>6) Bishop Aringarosa: Ugh! He suffered the same fate as Silas. He was portrayed purely as evil. No depth given to him. He was very two dimensional.<br/><br/>7) Sophie's Family: Shot me now. By the time we finally made it to the end I thought not much more can be butchered. I was wrong. Her whole history and family background was totally changed and not for the better. <br/><br/>8) Ritual: They show flashes throughout the movie of a memory of Sophie's. It's from a ritual she witnessed her grandfather partaking in. They should have left it out. They never fully explain it and unless you read the book I bet you were wondering what the hell the ritual was and why it affected Sophie in anyway.<br/><br/>9) Sir Leigh Teabing: Overall he annoyed me the least. Not a great character, but portrayed decently enough.<br/><br/>To sum it up: It all started with the screen writing and went downhill from there. Bad screen writing --> the movie was doomed before it started.<br/><br/>PS: I liked DB's book. Well I liked the story telling. The writing isn't great, but he was able to pull you in to the story and that made up for it."

","This is this year's most anticipated movie, with a lot of controversy surrounding it. So I had to see it. I read the book, and didn't think much of it (Angels and Demons being the better one). The movie is even worse. There were several moments I had the urge to walk away. Because of the cheesiness of the movie. Things like: ""The letters are scrambled."" ""It's an anagram!"" Tsssss. And it's such a long movie (2 1/2 hour) that goes on and on and on. Halfway the movie, when Langdon and Neveu are at Teabing's place, the answers to so many questions are given. This is where the ideas are laid out that make or break this story. Teabing (Ian McKellen) keeps talking and talking about how Jesus had kids with Mary Magdalen, and how the Church wants to destroy the royal bloodline of Jesus. I will not repeat that here. It's so unconvincing, that it immediately drowns this movie in its own nonsense. At the end of the film, when Langdon and Neveu say goodbye, there is an over-cheesy dialogue on faith, humanity and godliness. In the end a tribute is paid to Mary of Magdalen, who is the icon of freedom for all oppressed people in the world (especially women). I asked myself how Mary Magdalen could ever be of any meaning to oppressed people, the way it is put in this movie. And even, if you are willing to believe this, how Jesus' descendants could. The acting was pretty poor. Before seeing the movie I already wondered why they had cast Tom Hanks. And after seeing it I wonder even more. In the book the ideas about ancient symbols were more or less interesting (even though it's really 'sensation-science'). But with Hanks uttering them, they are completely unconvincing. Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu is a good choice. But whereas her self-chosen naiveté in Amelie, and her blind faith in Un Long Dimanche de Fiancailles, gave her performance strength and depth, in this movie she seems to be clueless about her own identity. The quest for the holy grail is her quest in that she discovers who she is. But it seems that she herself does not really believe the story that she is a descendant of Jesus and Mary. Paul Bettany as Silas the albino monk is utterly annoying. He is self-flagellating throughout the movie, and otherwise too, he is miserable. There is no humanity in his character whatsoever, and it makes him unrealistic. Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing is alright. This movie is completely humorless. It takes itself too serious. You have to either accept it, or decline. I decline."

","What a load of tripe has been written about the book and now this film. Dan Brown has successfully pulled a fast one and he should be congratulated for that. Ha ha ha! OK, now what did I think of this movie? It was passable but deeply flawed. So, we're supposed to believe that the character Neveu is both 'in on the secret' but completely ignorant of it at the same time? Eh, what? Whose story is this? The code breaker (Langdon)ought to be the minor character but he is made the centre of this piece. As a code breaker he too is a mass of contradictions...he recognises the symbolic meanings of all kinds of things before he spots the significance of his own part in the unfolding story (duh, a bit slow there methinks). Clearly a number of the characters (Silas included) have a set of noxious beliefs that cause them to do dreadful things in the name of their 'duty' to them. Beliefs have to be expressed in words...and words can be manipulated...and facts can be manipulated...and coincidental facts can be conflated...and rhymes can be made...and stories are told...and did you know who Leonardo of Pisa was?"

","I'm not quite sure what happened but I think I accidentally entered my review without finishing it.<br/><br/>My opinion is that Ron Howard decided to do this for one of two reasons: 1. He knew that it would scrape in an ass-load of cash or 2. He wanted to look cool making a movie that the whole world has been arguing about.<br/><br/>All that aside I think he did a pretty great job. It's a great looking movie with an outstanding cast (except for Mr. Hanks and Ms. Tautou's chemistry which was horrible and poorly written by the screenwriter) and of course you can't put everything in there, because otherwise it wouldn't be marketable to the people who hadn't read the book which is a probably a majority of the people who saw the movie. I also thought it got very boring at times because the only way to present some information was to us duologue which feels too much like a lecture. The reason that it is so interesting to read is because your mind creates your own unique version of what is going on and with this book i don't think it can be conveyed suitably to film. So if you really think the whole concept of church conspiracies is interesting go pick up the book its much more worthwhile. However if you want a nice crash course I suppose I would recommend this movie as most people who did not read the book but saw the movie seemed to enjoy it."

She looked pretty dumb and not like anything i had imagined while reading the book - i actually cheered for sophie marceau to play her role, but i doubt that hanks could contribute to that chemistry attempt as well. and sadly i disliked jean reno- he was whiny and funny he didn't work at all, and hes one of the coolest actors out there so that was exceptionally sad to see.<br/><br/>2. the book was cut down massively for the running time of the movie. it was altered, made quite simple and generally censored a whole lot.<br/><br/>3. the albino guy sucked. the scenes of self-punishment were gross at times and they showed his face in the first scene of the movie - how unimaginative of the director.<br/><br/>4. the camera did a bad job. editing as well. the shots of the main characters were made so up-close that i felt like i was gonna be consumed by the presence of tom hanks' giant head and his weird up-do. somewhere along the line of these giant heads the beautiful cities of Paris and London got lost - and i regretted not seeing more of them.<br/><br/>5. the story wasn't connected properly. everything went down too fast and it was simplified as if the audience would be too simple-minded to grasp any complicated notions in this film.<br/><br/>There's more, but I'm actually too tired to write more. What I actually did like about this movie was a farely nice ending, technically i mean - the way it was shot and summoned the final idea with the final shots was done right. and also the fact that while talking in between themselves the french actually spoke french! some irritating accent was present in other scenes, but this was a mild condition compared to some other similar Hollywood produced films. so thumbs up for that, if for nothing else.<br/><br/>Cheers, Lana"

I know, crazy murderer LOL but somehow you just have to feel for a guy that is being used for his religious beliefs. He truly believes in what he is doing. Teabing was done well although my picture of him in the book was more of a fat, balding Englishmen.<br/><br/>Anyone who read the book though, had to know that it would be a hard concept to translate into movie form.

","I thought this movie was not extraordinary with one exception. Ian McKellen did a superb job. There was no chemistry with Tom Hanks. I think any talentless actor could pull of the same dull performance as he did. I went with a multicultural group of people and we all had the same opinion that it would have been better with another actor such as Jeremy Irons or even Tom Cruise instead of Tom Hanks. The rest of the cast is good the plot is ever twisting yet I felt the adventure was to dull. I'm not sure if it was because of Hanks or Ron Howard. Ron Howard has proved that he can produce extremely good films yet I don't understand how he could have settled for the averageness of this one. As for the film it is fiction and it is evident that is so. The film is not forcing any beliefs on anyone although people might be encouraged to open their minds when watching this."
"dbackbarb","5","0","2","1 June 2006"," Purposely Offbase?
","Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of the book for many reasons. Theology aside, the research of history, art and architecture was shoddy at best, which would not be so bad if Brown did not claim that so much inside was factual which turned out not to be. Also, Brown stated in a press conference that the DaVinci Code represents history as he has come to understand it, so we cannot continue under the ubiquitous ""it's meant to be FICTION, people"" guise.<br/><br/>When I first saw the movie, I was sadly disappointed at Ron Howard's spineless approach to the controversy. I mean, if you're going to take on a subject at the height of it's media frenzy, do it all the way, I say. But Howard portrayed Langdon, a Harvard professor who should exude an air of confidence and probably some conceit about his deep knowledge of his life's work, as wishy-washy and more than a little skeptical about the whole idea of secret societies. And the other ""expert,"" Sir Leigh Teabing? A raving lunatic! (Played expertly as always, by Ian McClellan) Foaming at the mouth, practically wetting himself every time he gets the chance to present false testimony.<br/><br/>I must say that Howard's version is good for the church - who in their right mind would put any stock whatsoever in Brown's rantings now? It might as well have been Dan Brown himself driving off in the police cruiser. Which leads me to believe that maybe I was wrong about Ron Howard's intentions for this movie. <br/><br/>Howard said from the beginning that the reason he accepted the project was to film in exotic locations that few have ever been given access to, such as the Louvre. He's never really proclaimed any loyalty to the story, except when he refused to add a disclaimer to the credits. Perhaps that's because he knew it wouldn't need one, being so off-base. Could it be that Howard balanced his remaining Opie-like ethics with that hint of Hollywood selfishness that told him he would never get the chance to see the Mona Lisa alone again? I'll hold on to that glimmer of hope and give the film 2 more stars than I would have without it."

While faithful (i guess) to the ""book"", it has no flow, or energy, or humor, or excitement, or...well... anything.

","""It all depends on what you believe,"" is Tom Hanks' role's own bottom line in 'The Da Vinci Code'. Ironically, it also seems appropriate to how audiences will respond to this film.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the film follows the book quite faithfully and makes good use of special effects to assist the viewer (whose average reading age will be much lower than readers of the book).<br/><br/>There are some important factual errors and missed opportunities in the book, which the film blindly regurgitates. For example, it makes no sense for a Zurich bank to offer any kind of retail banking facilities outside the jurisdiction of Switzerland - I would have resolved this by switching the château and banking scene order. Also a Geneva (instead of Zurich) bank would fit far better with the key character from that scene.<br/><br/>For me, the greatest missed opportunity in both forms of the story is to miss the inference from the underlying research material that the Catholic church has made the mother of Christ a substitute for Mary Magdalena as part of its campaign against her."
"oldworldcat","5","0","3","1 June 2006"," unbelievable !
","I watched the funniest movie for sometime, DA VINCI CODE. Impressive funny and Mind boggling. A murder happens at the Louvre and it is investigated by a Symbologist who through some anagrams, quotes, etc etc finds out a secret thing which eventually will shake the foundations of Christian Church. It's clearly defined at the start, the movie is a ""fiction"". The most idiotic of all, is the movie says the person sitting on Jesus's right in Leonardo's LAST SUPPER is Magdalene. Jesus announces to his 12 disciples in Last Supper that one among them will betray him. Exactly 12 people will be sitting along with Jesus there. If it was Magdalene sitting in that painting then who was that disciple, Leonardo ignored. ""da Vince"" literally means ""from Vince"". Vince is a place where Leonardo came from.<br/><br/>The title now means FROM VINCI CODE? Dan Brown only knows.<br/><br/>Then the cast. I would have preferred Russell Crowe ahead of Tom Hanks. Hanks and Tautou escape from Police. Everything happens in a night and too fast and nothing believable. They are everywhere. They know everything. They understand everything in a matter of seconds. They go to a place wherever they want. Finally, in Scotland they realize, Tautou is a living descendant of Jesus. Jesus, if sees this movie, will hang himself. Dan Brown became richer writing such stupid fiction. Ron Howard is popular for making it as a movie.I cannot believe the gospels. I cannot believe in the divinity of Jesus. Only Jesus knows what he is all about.<br/><br/>Dan Brown must be mesmerized by the book ""HOLY BLOOD AND HOLY GRAIL"" Picture is going with the audience but certainly it didn't impress me. Largely because of its cinematic existence. Traitors appear good in the start of a normal cinema. Happens with this as well. Indeed too many traitors. Hollywood should explore new areas and give people wide range of entertainment."
"PopRonny","4","0","3","31 May 2006"," Crap compared to the book
","The first comment I read on this movie contained a praise for being faithful to the book. I strongly disagree with that as with the movie itself. <br/><br/>What especially struck me as odd was the move from a strong female and supporting male characters in the book to a full blown male hero who solves almost all the puzzles himself. Miss Neveu, albeit being the driving force in the book, the one that only lacks the knowledge of Mr. Langdon but is not without wits herself, is transformed to a side show character that may only lend some hints, have an idea or two, but is mainly drawn into the proceedings instead of leading during the major part of the story. This is particularly interesting in the light of the story itself, that speaks of the suppressed female in Christianity, a story that culminates in revealing ages of denial of femininity. <br/><br/>There are also a lot of detail changes from the book, just take the cross Captain Fache wears: in the book it is a cross made of 13 gems, called the Crux Gemmata, in the movie it is a simple cross made of lines the same size. The same applies to the bank, described as a metal box in the middle of a nightly deserted industry district with the cross of Switzerland overhead, in the movie it is located in a bustling street, has a strange symbol and is not entered in a car. And why on earth did they change the ending? What on earth made the makers do that? <br/><br/>Changing a lot of details and the chronology of events must have been a main issue for the makers of the film, I could go on and on with examples, but there is another thing really creeped me out and that is how flat the characters got. Aringarosa got away worst of them all I think. <br/><br/>As for the movie itself, not comparing it to the book, I still have a thing or two to complain about. The characters appear far too suddenly, there is little introduction. How could the viewer be convinced that some characters are to be taken trustworthy at first? Also, for my taste, there was too much James Bond in it, the narrow escapes seem too far fetched, the superior intellect and wisdom of Langdon seem too exaggerated, but that might still be me remembering the book.<br/><br/>Sorry, as much as I love conspiracy movies, this one just doesn't cut it."

"moutonbear25","6","0","2","31 May 2006"," The Davinci Code
","THE DAVINCI CODE Written by Akiva Goldsman Directed by Ron Howard<br/><br/>Ordinarily, I would think it grossly unfair to criticize a work directly regarding its translation from book to film. The literary medium offers its readers the opportunity to imagine the events unfolding any way they would like while the cinematic medium does all the imagining for you. In the case of Ron Howard's adaptation of author Dan Brown's international phenomenon, THE DAVINCI CODE, there isn't much imagination happening on the filmmaker's part though. Avoiding comparison here would actually be the great injustice as the immense anticipation that preceded the release of this film was all to do with the ultra- wide popularity of the book. Brown's novel is easily digested. It's lead characters, Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu, are being chased by numerous parties throughout lavish and romantic European settings. The chase and threat of capture keeps people turning the pages and the international flavor makes people feel as if in the presence of culture. For likely many others, and myself, these were the least intriguing elements of the book. What kept me coming back and barreling through hundreds of pages at a time was the book's unapologetic and relentless blasphemy against the Christian faith. Brown immerses the viewer amidst characters and settings that exist to varying degrees in real life, thus blurring the lines between fiction and non. Somewhere in between the facts and the fabrications, Brown drops his theoretical bomb  that the ever-elusive Holy Grail, the cup of Jesus Christ, is in fact not a cup at all but rather a person, a woman. The woman in question is the infamous Mary Magdalene and the chalice is her womb, the carrier of the bloodline of Jesus Christ. Yes, you heard right, folks! Jesus got it on with the prostitute and she went on to have his child and their descendants are still here on earth today. I am not for attacks on Christians without purpose but this is not an attack so much as an alternate theory to the foundation their shaky religion rests upon.<br/><br/>I can understand why the Vatican is concerned about the impact this film could have. If you forget for a second, it's easy to get sucked into all this lore and accept it as fact or at least as potentially true. That being said, it is borderline insulting of the Vatican to presume the film-going public is not intelligent enough to know the difference between history and plain story. Their concern is not for the entire film-going public though, it is more so for the middle of the road viewer who just passively absorbs images without thinking. When I think of these film-goers, I think of the ideal Ron Howard fan. Howard doesn't make bad movies (OK, HOW THE GRINCH STOLE Christmas was bad) but he also doesn't make spectacular movies (and no, I don't have an example to refute that). THE DAVINCI CODE has all the elements one would expect from a large-scale Howard production, from big names to big locations. But what it attempts to mask with size is not a lack of substance but rather a lack of control over that substance. Howard coaxes performances from the cast that are inconsistent and hollow. As Langdon, Tom Hanks is sensible, curious and introspective. Ian McKellan plays Leigh Teabing, a Holy Grail expert as playful and cheeky. On the other hand, the usually deep Alfred Molina is farcical and Audrey Tautou looks lost and confused as Neveu; at times she barely seems to know where to stand. <br/><br/>One of the book's major criticisms, aside from it relying too heavily on conspiracy theories and barely bothering with style, is that it reads like a high-spirited Hollywood blockbuster. Ironically, Howard's film interpretation plays out nothing like one. It is tiring at times and stale at others. The hackneyed script by frequent Howard collaborator, Akiva Goldsman, cuts out numerous Grail factoids from the book that lend to the theory's credibility but yet still manages to get frequently bogged down in Grail history throughout the film. The result is slowed pacing during scenes that are meant to be suspenseful. Lengthy background explanations take place during car chases and moments when killers are waiting to attack in the next room but the danger never presents itself until the explaining is all done (leading me to wonder if perhaps the attacker took a bathroom break). With the action forced to wait its turn, the viewer feels the flaws and loses their patience. Howard has taken a book that seemed to have been written with a film deal in mind and made a mess of the already carefully laid plans. As cheap as it is to say this, I must. You're better off reading the book."
"gspanner-1","6","0","2","31 May 2006"," On a back foot before it started
","I believe the reason the Da Vinci code has been so poorly received was that because the book was such a massive hit everyone who went to watch it had preconceived ideas about how the story would translate onto the screen. This also relates to Tom Hanks and his portrayal of Langdon. When you read a book you form opinions and mental images about the characters and how they would act should they come to life, Hanks was already on a losing streak before he uttered one word as people knew in their minds if he didn't match the image of Robert Langdon they had, it would be a massive failure.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the film was decent by any means, I was disappointed like most cinema goers but I don't feel the blame should lie on Hanks and Howard as a whole. In my opinion this should have never been made into a film and if you haven't read the book DO NOT go and see this film as you will almost certainly be asking for your money back.<br/><br/>I have also heard they are making Angels and Demons but I hope for all Dan Browns fans sakes this is not the case."

It was mostly slow, and parts that you were supposed to figure out later on (to add the thrill of suspense) were handed to you in the first five minutes of the movie. The ending was anti -climactic at best, and left out several key elements to wrap up the story. Casting was also a bit odd. I'm sure Tom Hanks does not remind ANYONE of a young Harrison Ford, nor is Silas monstrous with red eyes. In fact, all I can think of is him walking down the road penniless and hungry in A Knights Tale. Jacques Saunière also does not fit his description, as he seemed a bit beefy to be a frail old man.

The screen play is different from the book on many key points, leading to the whole meaning of the story being distorted beyond any significance, and the tacked on Jesus speech at Roslin church is a huge cop out. Another huge disappointment was the way in which Sophie's character in the movie had all of her moments of brilliance and intelligence removed so that all she was left with was this shell of a character shadowing Tom Hanks around. The distortion of her character and her characters background changed the story from one that empowered woman, and spoke of the sacred feminine, to one in which the the only lead female character was bland and wussy with no real talents. And the changes to Robert Langdon's character took away a lot of his skill and talent, leading one to question why on earth he would have been chosen to help Sophie anyway.

It sparked discussion and brought new ideas forth. I could easily relate to the characters and was just as interested in them as i was the main story.<br/><br/>The movie however did almost none of the above. The first 5 minutes stuck to the book perfectly. But that was about the only part that did. From there on in locations, times and dialogue was changed around. The dialogue between the characters was dry and lacked any interest. The same can be said of the characters themselves. I was no longer interested in what they were like, and now just wanted to get to the end of the movie. The story itself lacked the intrigue that it had had in the book, and it presented the information like solid facts. This didn't allow me to imagine what COULD happen, what MIGHT have happened. Instead it was clear cut, this is the way it happened. <br/><br/>The final nail in the coffin for this movie was the ending. Unlike at the end of the book where we are left to wonder how Jesus's blood line continues, we are told. And it is not much of a surprise. It was somewhat of a cliché having the grand daughter be the continuation of the blood line. Once again the film leaves no room for imagination.<br/><br/>This movie does have one saving grace. The flashbacks were used very well, particularly in reference to the Conference of Mycenia. Besides that the movie was very uninteresting.

","1. If personalities like Ron Howard, Akiwa Goldsman and Tom Hanks, all of them talented, together make a movie based on a script from which the whole world has a lot of expectations, and then suddenly from somewhere these 'so-called' critics in some festival, pan the movie, then there's a lot of room to say that the critics are up to some 'conspiracy' themselves. <br/><br/>2. The story may be fictional but it has merely been used as link-up to connect various historic, proved facts of the past. <br/><br/>3. There is nothing been said/done blasphemous against the Great merciful Jesus Christ either in the book or the movie.Both of them contain just some interesting facts which can be pondered over. <br/><br/>4.Some powerful Religious institutions already have their hands full to fight against. They have no time to face Dan Brown. These institutions made a similar ridiculous attack on the master Martin Scorsese's ""Last Temptation Of the Christ"" few years back. <br/><br/>5.Gods from EVERY religion all over the world are subjected to Exaggeration every now and then all this years and so happened with the Great Jesus. But then it applies and holds true for any Religion in the world.<br/><br/>6. Whether Leonardo Da Vinci (was/was not) a Grandmaster of a Society that (does/does not) exist, he was still a pioneer of Science. He was one of the greatest anatomists, architects, painters, mechanical engineers, geologists, hydrologists of the world. His views in those days may not have been accurately correct but in those days he was looking at the future we see as modern times today.Its logical/ reasonable to put Science that feeds us today ahead of any religion in the world. So its possible that Da Vinci must have been trying to convey something significant and 'hidden'fact to the common people around. 7. The novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a great, in fact an exceptionally great thriller right at par with novels like ""The Fourth Estate"" by Jeffrey Archer, ""The Alchemist"" by Paul Coelho,""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by Sidney Shieldon and ""Angels & Demons"" by Dan Brown himself.I hope these novels fall in the hands of some talented directors, scriptwriters, actors and producers.(Universal Studios has bought the movie rights to ""Angels and Demons.""). I hope one of the directors from Howard, Steven Spielberg, Manoj Shyamalan, Jonathan Demme, David Fincher or Ridley Scott works on ""Angels & Demons"" because all of them are masters and adept at handling darker shades of life in movies. 8. Finally something about the film. A movie is only a two-hour movie and cannot cover what a novel covers mainly due to time limitations. Still Howard, Goldsman did a decent job. Tom Hanks, Audrey,Reno did the best of what was provided to them. The two guys who deserve a standing ovation are Sir Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teibing and Paul Tibbany as the masochistic albino killer. If only Goldsman had introduced more details from the novel into the movie related to the events he has put in the script, vital for the story to move forward, it would have been much better. Like Something more about Mona Lisa, Madonna Of The Rocks, etc.<br/><br/>My Ratings For- i)The Novel: 5/5 ii)The Movie: 3.5/5 <br/><br/>Now Waiting for ""Angels and Demons"" ..."

","On the plus side, the movie is generally true to the spirit of the book, if not every aspect. I read the book and felt that it was pretty hard to go wrong following the book religiously (pun intended). It also has some interesting visual effects to draw the viewer in. These effects could be considered a benefit or a hindrance, depending on your point of view, but I didn't feel that they distracted from the movie and they had to do SOMETHING to help the viewer work through Langdon's thought process without any narration.<br/><br/>Now, all this being said, why only a 6, even though it is based on a book that I highly enjoyed? Well, the problems lies with the casting and direction. I had my concerns from the moment I heard that Hanks was cast as Langdon, and I was STILL disappointed! His performance comes off as wooden and unemotional. To a lesser degree, the same can be said for Tautou. This surprised and greatly disappointed me as I am a big fan of Audrey's. Even more distressing was the utter lack of chemistry between them.<br/><br/>I find it hard to believe that Hanks and Tautou weren't up to the task, so I can only assume that their on-screen failings were in the direction & production of the film. Oddly enough, many of the other characters were well played. Teabing, Silas, Fache, etc. were all well portrayed.<br/><br/>The other disappointment in this movie was that it missed on some key elements. They completely ignored Robert Langdon's sense of sleep deprivation and, more importantly, they left out any hint of romance between the protagonists.<br/><br/>I was also annoyed at changes to the dialog that seemed to be intended to soften the blow of the message of the book. But I was even more dismayed at the horribly dumbed-down ending in the form of a complete scene rewrite with new dialog.<br/><br/>Given the budget, director and caliber of actors on this project, it should have been MUCH better. I would still recommend seeing it, but I certainly wouldn't go in with too high of expectation.<br/><br/>I only hope I get the opportunity to meet Ron Howard and ask him what the hell he was thinking."

They should have taken out the whole questioning religion scene in the garden at the end, which was probably put in so people didn't get mad. But that's my only big complaint. Many people have been saying that it is not as good as the book, but it helped me understand the story more."
"RCWjr","7","0","1","28 May 2006"," Not great, but an entertaining alternate spin on history
","Being one of the ""oppressed"", as Christians are referred to in the book, I made sure to go into this movie fully informed of the real history vs. the made up and embellished Dan Brown history. I highly recommend anyone not familiar with the history to explore it and not let the movie and/or book be your sole source of information. <br/><br/>It was disappointing that the Catholic church is once again portrayed as oppressive zealots in a story. It is getting a tad boring seeing the same old bad guys. But overall, the story does have an adventure element about it that is intriguing, too bad it takes itself so serious that it forgets to have fun.<br/><br/>The film comes across as taking itself a tad too serious. This is an adventure, pure and simple. Yet the conspiracy element is played up way too much. Anyone familiar with the long rumored and talked about supposed relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene will find all of the ""reveals"" to be yawn inducing and those not informed are not given enough to really care about it. So much talk is given to the conspiracy that you get a bit bored with the proceedings. <br/><br/>I did like how the ending of the book was changed. I just wish they would have explored the sense of adventure inherent in the story rather than try and make it a serious docudrama. The similarly themed ""National Treasure"" succeeded far better by not taking the itself too serious and this film needed the same kind of restraint."
"alexjonlin","7","0","1","28 May 2006"," Very, very toned down
","This movie has gotten tons of press and has gotten religious leaders to denounce it over and over again. But the fact is, this is a whole lot more toned down than the book. In the movie, it portrays Robert Langdon as being a religious person. The book didn't even come close to that. He was definitely an atheist in the book. So there are two reasons why I think that these religious people shouldn't be going so crazy about the movie. First of all, it is obvious that this is a work of fiction. How many times does that have to be reiterated? Second of all, this movie doesn't really have any huge religious implications. The religious parts of the movie are just minor things, and not central to the plot line. In fact, when Teabing is explaining how Mary Magdalene and Jesus were married,Langdon even says, ""It's a theory, Leigh, just a theory."" I can't imagine Dan Brown's Robert Langdon saying that. The movie's Robert Langdon is really just a creation of the director."
"rhearob","7","0","1","28 May 2006"," Good Movie but lacking the books thrills
","I read and found the DaVinci Code an entertaining, fast paced read. Like most I prefer Angels and Demons to the DaVinci code. Given that all of Brown's books are the same story with different details any of them could have made a good movie. DaVinci with its massive sales and popularity was the natural choice.<br/><br/>This movie, as directed by Ron Howard, has tense action sequences and phenomenal craft shown in the making of the movie. My favorite sequence was the last in the movie where Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon finally breaks the last code and realizes where the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene has found its resting place. Throughout the rest of the film the establishing shots for the location scenes are spectacular.<br/><br/>The failing of this movie though is basically in its scripting and character development. Robert Langdon in this movie is not the Robert Langdon of the novel. Langdon, in the novel, is the reluctant adventurer who is again dropped into a Catholic conspiracy and must use all of his knowledge of theology and symbolism to escape. In the novel Langdon is quick witted, a bit whimsical, and decisive.<br/><br/>The movies Langdon comes off as more than a bit slow. He is a college professor who relies on cheap photographic tricks to get his point across in lecture. Except for a little bit of quick work with anagrams in the Louvre sequence, he has to be practically hit over the head everyplace else. I think that this, more than anything, is what makes the movie seem like a less intellectual thriller than the book. Revelations come more by accident than through insight.<br/><br/>Sir Ian McKellan, though, plays Leigh Teabing to perfection. This character is everything he was in the novel brought to life on the screen. The wit, quiet brilliance, and fanaticism that McKellan layers into the character makes for the only real tension in the film as you slowly realize that Teabing is in fact driving everything.<br/><br/>The other characters and their relationships are downplayed quite a bit more. You get no real sense of the depth of the devotion between Aringarosa and Silas. The audience also develops no real affection for Sophie until her final scene. During the rest of the movie the audience could care less if she lives or dies, unless you have read the book and know who she really is.<br/><br/>As for Sophies revelation at the end, it was well played if different from the book. It comes across a bit darker than in the book. I do wish they had left her brother in the scene though.<br/><br/>All in all, a decent movie. If you have seen National Treasure, you have seen this movie too. A good job by Ron Howard and the cast and crew. An excellent job by McKellan. <br/><br/>Its decent entertainment but not the classic thriller it could have been."

","I'd been looking forward to seeing The Davinci Code since I learned it was being adapted from the Dan Brown novel. Unfortunately, much of what made the novel an interesting read didn't make the transition to the film.<br/><br/>However, the poor adaption of the story was only the beginning of things wrong with the movie. Going into the theater I'd wondered about the casting of Tom Hanks in the lead role. My worst fears were confirmed as true less than 10 minutes into the movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm usually a Tom Hanks fan, but he was completely wrong for this role.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou was completely unlikeable, which was a complete departure for those of us who liked her so much in Amelie.<br/><br/>I'm sure everyone will be able to make up their own minds about the movie, but I think this movie should be renamed ""A movie inspired by, but not adapted from, The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown."""
"gc123517","3","0","2","28 May 2006"," A puzzle without a purpose.
","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Well, I saw this at the theater on May 21/06 and I have never read the book (and don't intend to). I did not go into the theater with great expectations, I was merely killing time and curious. But I really thought this movie was lame, pointless, and dull. The Catholic church and other Christian groups opposed to the theology of this film have given it much publicity which it does not deserve - they would have done better to ignore this white elephant for the claptrap that it is.<br/><br/>On the characters: Tom Hanks is surprisingly dull, but he bears a striking resemblance to the Mona Lisa, and although he is the protagonist and ""hero"" he does very little to move the story along or bring it to any conclusion. Audrey Tautou is obviously a descendant of Jesus, but she doesn't make anything at all of it when the ""great truth"" is revealed to her, but she's a decent driver and fighter when the plot calls for action. Ian McKellen is a very interesting and complex character, and he relieves the boredom which permeates this unwieldy film, but his character also falls victim to a plot riddled with so many conspiracy theories that his role is eventually lost in its own sophistication. Jean Reno reprises Robert Vaughn's role in Bullitt, that of a useless but irritating antagonist. Paul Bettany plays the ""albino"" monk with blue eyes - he is more Aryan than albino - and he is certainly an interesting and dedicated villain. Alfred Molina is the Opus Dei puppet-master, but his motives are as vague as the mechanics of transubstantiation. For all we know, he could be Paul Bettany's secret gay lover...<br/><br/>As for the plot and storyline, this movie is about a Catholic Opus Dei vs Priory of Scion conspiracy which makes no sense. At the heart of this movie is the idea that the tomb of Mary Magdalene must be kept hidden from the world so that Christians would not know that Jesus had children by her - this is a deeply flawed premise as the finding of her bones would offer no evidence or proof that Jesus had jumped those bones when they were covered in flesh. What would have been a better conspiracy is if they were hiding the bones of Jesus, or even of Mary the mother of Jesus (as this would threaten the Catholic doctrines of Assumption and Perpetual Virginity). Further, since both the Priory and the Catholics want to keep this a secret, why all the fuss?<br/><br/>Some other blunders are the references in the film to Fibonacci numbers without any elucidation...it would have been better storytelling if Tom Hanks had explained the significance of these numbers to the audience, but Ron Howard can't tell a story to save his life.<br/><br/>Also, clues which are hundreds of years old inexplicably lead to modern architecture.<br/><br/>Also, there are not enough Catholics protecting ""the secret"" to really justify calling this a conspiracy...Tom Hanks should have been pursued by an army of monks made up of rank and file average Catholics, and not simply by a lone psychotic who sticks out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>Also, Mr. Hanks quickly jumps to the conclusion that Ms. Tautou is ""the last living descendant of Jesus"" without even knowing about her relatives...she may have had hundreds of aunts, uncles, cousins.... In fact, when he meets her grandmother he should have realized she would have a 1 in 4 chance of also being descended from Jesus, and any serious scholar would have immediately questioned her lineage, yet Tom simply ignores her like she was bland wallpaper. And when Audrey finds out the truth, she just grins like an idiot, and apparently loses all concern for 1)her slain relatives, 2)a worldwide deception, 3)the ongoing threat to her life, and 4)substantiating the validity of Tom's claims by finding the proof of her lineage.<br/><br/>In short, this ""conspiracy theory"" story doesn't have enough substance to be either a conspiracy or even a theory. It's just a load of bunk."

","After seeing the film and reading some of the comments on this board I just had to let a flow of anger proceed through my finger tips!!!! First of all for all the people who say how great this book is!!!! This book wan generally written for people who don't really read many books. I admit yes as a thriller it served its purpose of being fast paced and lots of things happening however....the characters were two dimensional and there was little in the way of their development. All that seemed to be happening would be they would run around from one location to the next and solve another riddle!!!! And three pages should not constitute a chapter. I am a teacher and have taught 11yr olds who have written better and longer. However this book seems to have grabbed something in a lot of people and made them read so fair play to it for that!!!!! Now onto the film and I am afraid to be frank that it is an absolutely dull affair. This was agreed by the people who I went with (who incidentally had not read the book). The characters yet again had no development and they could have quite easily died and I would not have cared less. In fact there appeared to be no chemistry between the two main characters what so ever!!!! Yet again we just seemed to be following people solving what only can be described as Crystal Maze!!! Where was Richard O'Brian??? He would have been better than Tom Hanks. Hmmm poor casting I feel!!!! Some very cheesy lines were delivered in this feel which did not help and some parts lacked any explanation between the relationships of the characters and what was happening i.e. the two main characters, the bank manager kidnapping them, teabing and butler. Many loose ends.<br/><br/>As to some other posts which mention the controversial nature of the film toward religion!!! Yes its fiction as correctly identified by others but unfortunately in todays society we have some real plebs who think its real!!! I have had many conversations with people saying ""How can you believe in Jesus after reading that?"" and I simply reply ""BECAUSE ITS BLOODY FICTION!!!!!"" Thankyou Rant over"

Yes in some parts on the book it may be very far fetched, but if you were to weight that out with the fascinating parts, you would be out weighted. So you can also imagine how excited i was when i found out the film was coming out. And the second day it was out, me and my 2 older sisters went to go and watch it. And the one thing i was very clear about was that i would be extremely annoyed if the movie did not portrayal the book in any way shape or form. And i was not disappointed. Paul Betteny, who play Opus Dei monk, was a very chilling character, and one of the best in the whole movie. But on a a unpleasant note, i do feel there was no real connection between Robert and Sophie. But despite that, it was very good. In the book, some parts are played up to much bigger than they are in the film, but then if the movie went into huge amounts of detail, if would for sure be at least a 4 hour film, so again that cannot be helped.

The overall darkness (as in lack of lighting) of the piece may have played a role, but I felt like falling asleep several times (although I did manage to stay awake for the whole thing). This movie reminded me of what they did with Dune. Without having read the book, how could anyone have followed the movie? It has a storyline that was run through a blender.

","I am a great fan of the book but wasn't able to see the movie straight away. Although I was swamped with negative comments and advice such as ""I heard it was really bad, don't bother"" I decided to judge for myself what the movie was really like. <br/><br/>First off- the Da Vinci Code has its weaknesses just like any other movie. But it also has its strengths. What the problem is that with such a popular and publicized movie is that there is more people reviewing and eventually criticizing it, and the worse the movie is made to appear. This is the case with The Da Vinci Code. <br/><br/>Its strengths. The casting, I thought, was brilliant; there couldn't have been a better ensemble of actors and actresses. Ian McKellan and Paul Bettany are the obvious ones, but Audrey Tatou and Jeno Reno did a fine job too. Tom Hanks did an okay job- especially during Langdon's claustrophobic collapses. <br/><br/>Which brings me to another-enjoyable part of the movie- the flashbacks. I thought they executed very well and, contrary too some people's opinions, not boring at all. I thought it was really smart of the screenwriters to include the reason for Langdon's claustrophobic fears- him falling down a well when he was young- which was covered in Dan Brown's other book ""Angels and Demons"" <br/><br/>But the obvious weakness in this movie is its screenplay, especially towards the end. I did not like how Sophie's brother was left out, how Jacques Sauniere was not 'really' Sophie's Grandfather, how the Priory actually 'visited' Sophie and how Bishop Aringarosa was made out to be evil. I thought the Roslin Chapel scenes were rather corny, weak and tedious...""You are the last descendant of Jesus Christ!"" Hahaha. <br/><br/>But apart from that, a pretty good movie -if you don't get too influenced by the critics- and I recommend it to all."

","'The Da Vinci Code' is an action/adventure film about a man who stumbles fatefully into a mystery surrounding the death of a man at the Louvre gallery. The mystery surrounds Jesus and his relationship with others attempting to seek out the truth and destroy it and destroy him. The film flits from scene to scene, but there is little that engages the viewer. (I expected the film to be more engaging because the book was in the best-seller charts for months.) The performances of the actors is probably the best element of the film, sadly. The plot moved a little too slowly with some elements of the plot that seem to be strange coincidences. (For example, the main character was linked to the Teacher through a friendship with him. I could understand how, based on their interests, they two were good friends, but I found it less believable for the Teacher to be the villain and the one leading the chase.) Unfortunately, the film was dull and this will be one that I won't watch again. If you plan to see it, do not expect a lot."

It's to an extent where you can combine characteristics of one character into another, thereby leaving the other lead as a stand-in or leaving out details which would give the story more body.<br/><br/>Overall, if you've read the book, prepare for at least some disappointment.

","I have read that some evangelicals are hoping to use this film to lure 'em in and then convert them once they're hooked. This is brilliant because, while this film appears to be subversive, it really buttresses the church's appeal, because the biggest threat to faith today is not radical reinterpretations, but profound indifference.<br/><br/>The interpretation presented here certainly has its attractions. I wouldn't mind if it were true, and so I can see why many want it to be true The filmmakers, though, want to imply that revealing this interpretation would change faith, while hedging their bets a bit in how they present this, but by this they just show that they don't understand faith, which does not have that much to do with kooky historical riddles.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that said riddles hold far too much resemblance to the kind of deliberately-outlandish puzzle solving found in the Adam West Batman, in which connections and conclusions are drawn out of thin air. Other problems here include the tendency to spent several scenes getting us nowhere and then give us half of the entire mystery in a big monologue, Tom Hanks' astonishing, mind-numbing flatness, the incoherence of the present-day conspiracies and betrayals, and so on."

","There comes a time where people's beliefs and perceptions come into question. There also is a moment in life where ideals are challenged and any questions of an objectionable nature are considered bad, evil and immoral. If you think I am talking about the Da Vinci code movie, you are correct. If you think I am talking about if the statements and ideals for the book are based on facts or fiction, then you SERIOUSLY NEED HELP!! I will put a disclaimer on this review, which will be, for all you religious nuts out there, Dan Brown's book is listed in the FICTION section of the library or bookstore. Now, back to my original train of thought. When I first heard about the book being made into a movie, I had seen the trouble that was to come along with it. I knew religious people would bash it, critics would hate it, and even fans of the book might rebel against it. I was glad to see that Ron Howard would be making this great book into a movie. I was disappointed to have Tom Hanks playing the lead role, because while I was watching the movie, all I kept seeing was Tom Hanks. It would have been even better if they had cast an unknown or little known actor for the role, because many people didn't actually SEE the movie, they just WATCHED the movie. So my definitive review of the movie goes as stated. As a movie to book translation, it was an: A-. The lighting was great, the music was great, the set design was great. They kept the movie just about exactly as I pictured it reading the book. (note to Alfonso Curon who did that piece of crap Harry Potter movieTHIS IS HOW you make a movie based on a popular book.) The only thing that kept it from being an A-plus, was casting a big star in the lead role. It was very hard watching this movie without saying, ""look it's Tom Hanks"" As a movie just for people to watch and enjoy, I give it a: B. it reminded me of Raiders of the lost Ark. Sure it didn't have the dramatic, unrealistic adventure scenes, but the movie REALLY grabs you when they explain about ""the holy grail"". I am TRULY glad I didn't listen to all the critics ( who never saw the movie. Honestly if you call yourself a critic or are on a committee who is voting for an award of some type GO WATCH THE MOVIE before ""reviewing"" or ""casting ballots"" ( personally I am still raving mad over the idiots who thought Brokeback Mountain was a good movie.

It was also understandable with out reading the book<br/><br/>Stuff i didn't like about the movie was that it heart my feelings a bit because I'm Christian, and in the movie the story showed that churches authorities are all murders and love money over their religion. Also the accents were a bit hard to interested sometimes.<br/><br/>i think this movie got a 7 out of 10 do you?"

","The DaVinci Code is even worse than most big budget Hollywood slop. Not only is the dialog of Ed Wood quality, the story nothing but a series of clichés, the casting way off on all counts, and the plot twists visible from the end of the block--it's also boring! I mean, lots of crappy movies are also entertaining, but this one, though technically slick, fails to be entertaining on any level. Now, I never read the novel, so I have no opinion on whether the movie was faithful to the book. But I can tell you that if it was faithful, the book must be a total piece of junk. I suspect, however, that the novel must have been fun in some way, must have taken itself less seriously, and must have been more quickly paced and adventurous than this dead-on-arrival chunk of cookie cutter Hollywood blah de blah.<br/><br/>I honestly believe this snoozer, with it's cliché-drenched plot and dumb dialog, would have played better as an intentional comedy."

If people are so uninformed about history or religion that they have to learn the truth from a Hollywood movie, then they have greater issues in their lives.

I cannot say the same for the movie. Maybe because I knew what was coming, but the movie just seemed to move along at a snail's pace and I found none of the conversations between any of the actors enjoyable. It was like everyone was going by the numbers just to get the movie made. Tom Hanks is a very good actor but I found none of the qualities that made him such a good actor in this performance. The one word that comes to mind is bland. The whole movie for me was just too bland. Paul Bettany was good, Sir Ian McKellan was OK and Audrey Tautou was adorable, but where was the fire, the passion, the levity, the chemistry? I would not have cared if they came right out and said that God is a woman, if they could have made a more entertaining movie."

","In watching this movie I was constantly reminded of similar plot devices and story lines of the two movies, ""Indiana Jones"" and ""National Treasure"". As a contemporary version of ""The Temptation of Christ"", it used the controversial subject matter to replace creative construct and concept to bolster ticket sales. To prevent bias in watching the movie and knowing the ending, I did not read the book before watching the movie. I have no interest in reading the book after the movie. I found it a boring movie in comparison to ""Indiana Jones"". The plot twists were easily identifiable and solved once the characters were introduced and the plot direction revealed. I won't spoil the movie, but it was quite obvious to me early on what the answer to the final mystery was. Even I could have constructed a better plot line. Maybe I've just watched too many movies in my lifetime. I rank this movie as an average 5 for the few suspenseful moments of mystery that were scattered throughout the movie."
"gregsrants","7","0","1","27 May 2006"," I didn't read the book
","I haven't read the book.<br/><br/>I think when reviewing The DaVinci Code, everyone should disclose whether they are influenced by Dan Browns print phenomena. Just how many of those disclosures are there? Well, it has been speculated that some 60 million copies of the book have been sold. If you take into account that people read books and pass them along to friends, it would not be stretching the limits to say that some 100 million people have read The DaVinci Code. <br/><br/>One hundred freakin' million. Let me put that into perspective. That is more than the population of the United Kingdom and Canada combined. That's more than the total number of records The Rolling Stones have sold. And that is just short of the total number of women who have rejected my ""Nice hair"" opening line.<br/><br/>I think it is important to disclose because this film came with about as high expectations as Star Wars Episode I. Office water-cooler talk was as rampant as the film neared its release date. Everything from the second guessing of the casting to talk about Tom Hanks' fro were being bantered around from cubicle to cubicle faster that the whispers of the office lushes Christmas party lap dance. <br/><br/>With everyone and their brother knowing the story and heading to the theatre with varying degrees of high expectations, the movie had a built-in bias. All director Ron Howard had to do was walk the line of keeping page turners happy while adapting characters and condensing story plot lines to keep up with film pacing. No easy task to be sure.<br/><br/>I can't spend time talking much about the plot. Most will already know what to expect, and those like me who went in oblivious, are better off just letting the story play out in front of them. The Coles Notes version is that The DaVinci Code is a mystery that can unravel everything we have been taught about some of the basic models of Christianity. Mary Magdelane, the Holy Grail and Jesus' own family tree up for debate with one clue after another leading Symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and a female cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) on a quest to solve a mystery that has been hidden for thousands of years. <br/><br/>The DaVinci Code is the third large summer film to be released this summer right on the heels of Mission Impossible III and Poseidon and does the first two releases one better by producing a slick story that is backed with strong acting and interesting action mixed in with high tense drama. Overlong  yes. Unbelievable and sometimes just plain illogical  sure. But that is what the movie is suppose to be. It is a fantasy. It's not based on fact (well, not all of it), and is meant as simple entertainment. <br/><br/>I went to see The DaVinci Code with two friends that were test subjects on the matter. One had read the book and other had not. He who read the novel was slightly disappointed and I had to listen for two hours after the showing as to what was missing from the screenplay that might have better explained a few of the plot dot connections. The second was also disappointed as he compared the film to Nicholas Cage's National Treasure and kept expecting Hanks' character to put on a cowboy hat and find the Staff of Ra to find the exact location of the Holy Grail.<br/><br/>I on the other hand was not disappointed. I thought it worked as a good movie that held my interest and kept me interested in both the characters and the next clue that would lead them down a path to which I was unknowing.<br/><br/>The DaVinci Code is one of those films that are critic-proof. Opening worldwide the movie is a license to make money and you can be sure that when the big earners at the end of the year are listed in 'Gross Order' this one will be in the top five. That makes my efforts in the space sort of redundant, but for those who have lasted to the final paragraph, I offer you a recommendation. <br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"

The screenplay is awful. I've been wanting to read the book for some time but if the movie is bad as the book... At some points the movie just gets ridiculous. I'm a Christian so i could be biased (i hope it's the correct word) on this one, but i think i was objective this time.

"bo_tsang-1","5","0","2","27 May 2006"," At the climax of the file I though ""So what?""
","Having read the book ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"", by Baigent,Leigh & Lincoln plus many related books the idea of Jesus Christ having been married to Mary Magdalene and having decedents is not new to me. The novel ""The De Vinci Code"" was an excellent thriller but the film is a bit of a damp squib. And the acting was sub-standard, especially given the past films of the main stars. No doubt the film will be a big hit at the box office as the basic plot will be a great interest to people who have not heard of it before. But I though the film did not do justice to the book or to the ""sang grail"" theme. I wonder if the untutored viewer understood all the links between the Knights Templar, The Priory of Sion (PS), and the ""Rose Line"". The idea the PS safeguarded the secret from presumably the death of Mary Magdalene to the present day and set up the Knights Templar in the 12 century, who incidentally are supposed have discovered the secret whilst excavating in the Temple Mount, tends to make the whole plot more well rather even more holy. Where was the ""holy grail"" , that is the body of Mary Magdalene between the time of her death and the building of Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland by the St Claire family in the 15th Century? The ""cryptic"" (otherwise known as the keystone) in the film surely could not have been made by Leonardo De Vinci as the clue inside refers to Sir Isaac Newton who wasn't born till after De Vinci died. I will not even comment on the Opus Die. The penultimate scene takes place is Rosslyn Chapel, southwest of Edinburgh, wherein Sophie Neveu, the heroine, is informed by Robert Langdon the hero that she is in fact the current last living descendant of Jesus Christ. It was some how an anticlimax and my reaction was basically ""so what"", which of course makes the 2000 years plus of secrecy somewhat unnecessary. Of course many people will say that the idea affects Christianity, and especially the role of women within the church, but I cannot see how. Indeed I only bother to write this review about this film as the theme is loosely connect to a far more important ""secret"" (see film The Egyptian). That secret being the creation of God by Akhenaton, now the implications of that being fully revealed would change everything! So all in all I think 5 out of ten is fair."

","If you read the book and liked it, I beg you not to go watch the movie, it's a disaster. But if you haven't watched it, it might not be a bad idea. I read and liked the book, and as all good books do, their movie counterparts are usually pretty lame; this movie was no exception.<br/><br/>First off, I would like to comment on how badly Audrey Tautou (Sophie Nevau) acted throughout this whole movie. I generally can't tell if an actor is good or bad, but this one was pretty blatant. Every time Audrey spoke, it gave a sense of falsehood and it seemed as if her dialog was extremely forced. Critics say Hanks's character and Audrey's lacked chemistry, well, I figure it's because Audrey was a horrible actress in this one and did not allow it. But I think the rest of the cast was alright.<br/><br/>Second and final point, this movie was way too long, at 2hr 32min, this movie can be a great sleeping pill substitute: for those of you who can't afford its side effects. But in all fairness, it's not only the length of this film that really sets those sedative effects, it's the fact that this movie is too talkative. This movie is supposed to be an adventurous type of movie, sort of like a National Treasure or Indiana Jones, at least that's how Dan Brown intended it to be. Therefore: too much talking + 2hr 32 minutes = a good sleep.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book, you might like it. However, be prepared to learn how to listen and think critically, as this movie might confuse you, especially if you are not familiar with Christianity.<br/><br/>So why a 6/10? I felt the director did a good job in covering Dan Brown's storyline, but how he went about recreating its plot line was below par level."

The movie has an absolute ring of truth to it. It is a very scientific film. All the truth we need to know in up on the screen. The problem is, do we really ""want"" to know?

"Robert_duder","7","0","2","26 May 2006"," Potentially interesting, but heavily flawed film
","I have not read The Da Vinci Code so this is a completely unbiased review on JUST the film, in fact I purposely avoiding reading the book so that I could see the film first. I am however half way through the prequel ""Angels and Demons"" which does give me an idea of the main character Robert Langdon. I don't believe as many do that Tom Hanks was miscast. In fact I think that the Langdon character is not a strong character and Hanks embodied it just like he was written. Ron Howard should be commended for taking on this project. To call it controversial is the under statement of the year. The Book has caused enough controversy and the ENORMOUS success of the film certainly ups the ante. Is the film truly as controversial as all the people are crying out about?? Well yes it is. In fact much of the same content that makes the book so intriguing, interesting, and horrifying to Catholics and Christians is completely in tact in the film and some of the better scenes and parts are exploring those facts and clues.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks takes the lead as Robert Langdon. A world famous Symbologist called in to take a look at a murder of the Louvre curator who appears to have pin pointed Langdon as his killer. Hanks' performance is surprisingly subtle. Hanks is one of the world's greatest actors, he can do almost anything and he can perform deep and gratifying characters but the character of Langdon is kind of vapid, and scared, and not a strong character. But Hanks does alright and he appears intelligent enough to look like a scientist of sorts. Audrey Tautou plays Sophie Neveu, the granddaughter of the murder victim who dedicates herself to helping Langdon figure out her Grandfather's murder. Tautou is quite good and far more emotional than even Hanks' performance. They have decent chemistry although their growing romance never plays a part in the film which is okay. She was a good choice for the role and does a great job. Jean Reno who I very much respect as a decent character actor plays Police Inspector in charge of the investigation. His character has no depth at all, and is quite dull so unfortunately Reno comes across as such. He's not a bad guy, he's not a good guy, and although it would appear he has heavy involvement with the cover-up it never plays out that way. He's mostly useless. Paul Bettany is getting heavy flack for playing religious fighter and albino Silas. I think his performance is excellent. He's obviously insane but deeply determined to fight for his beliefs and his higher power. Bettany is the character with the most depth and he's captivating to watch and makes the best villain in the film if he's really a villain at all?? And finally one of the great performances is by Sir Ian Mckellen. He plays lifelong searcher of the Holy Grail, Leigh Teabing. One of the absolute highlights of the film is Teabing's rather lengthy monologue discussing all the clues and signs of the hidden Grail and the cover up, ""The Con of Man."" McKellen is captivating especially when he has a good script and a strong character and several of his scenes in Da Vinci are very powerful and he also has some rather campy scenes but his performance is still very good.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that much of the film is confusing. There are so many sects fighting for different sides of the secret, it gets very confusing who is what and who wants what but then that is Dan Brown's style. You really have to watch closely or read closely and take it all in. The film has very nice scenery all shot on location in their actual spots...France, The Louvre, Germany...it definitely make it all feel very real. But the story does feel rushed at times which is amazing considering it's 2 1/2 hour time frame but the book is huge and there is a lot to process. On top that the acting and story at times feels campy and overdone and that's an odd move for this film which should be deadly serious. There isn't a lot of action which I expected more adventure maybe along the lines of Indiana Jones...I mean it is a fictional story at the heart. Langdon needed to be a stronger star and perhaps some more serious content...many even the book could have been a trilogy of sorts instead of cutting and editing the full book to a small movie by comparison.<br/><br/>It is controversial, and it is worth seeing, and it has some very interesting points but overall the acting is sub par, the characters are flawed and the plot is chock full of holes. But if you just want to see something a little more intelligent than the average thriller you might enjoy it. It won't stick around for long. 7/10"

","I'm a huge fan of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code but frankly this film didn't pull through. It strayed from Dan Brown's novel more than most people are currently stating. Ron Howard made a serious mistake when he decided to cut out some of the original depth to make the movie. Honestly, I was impressed after I saw it. That may sound odd but I don't think any other director could have done better considering the book was so amazing. It would have been hard to make it any better than this film. Nonetheless I would waste your money on this mistake, read the book instead, it was magnificent. The characters weren't exactly what I'd expected either. I was very impressed with Tom Hanks performance but I was amazed by Ron Howard's depiction of Sophie. He made her seem weak and vulnerable, which just isn't the Sophie Neveu of Dan Brown's novel.<br/><br/>Despite these issues if you ever see the film on TV when there isn't anything else on it will be a well spent 2 hours."

I personally felt that in the beginning Tom Hanks may have overacted a little bit (just because what took a 100 pages in the book to accomplish happened in about 4 minutes in the movie and therefore the story wasn't properly developing), the scenes may have been a little choppy and perhaps it was just straight forward with nothing really spectacular happening as far as props and Hollywood effects go, but eventually I began to appreciate it...<br/><br/>I read the book and personally think that while the book is better than the movie, it still is a satisfactory story in comparison with 'Angels and Demons,' which is in fact the book that I thought they should hav made into a movie FIRST, because 'Angels and Demons' is a much better story. Aside from this, I liked how Ron Howard kept real in most instances with Langdon's character and tried to develop him in this story (ie: Landon's flashback to falling in the well, his Mickey Mouse watch, etc.) Though I felt that you needed to know Langdon's character well enough to see all this...<br/><br/>overall i'd have to give the movie a 6/10, but hopefully this movie will be re-made in about twenty years with some more enthusiasm then this version possessed...<br/><br/>btw, Audrey Tautou is really cute! and Ian McKellen probably did the best acting in the movie"
"bulldawg8110","5","0","2","26 May 2006"," Holds one's interest, but disappointing
","I was extremely excited to see this movie. I mean, how can you go wrong with Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, and Ian McKellen? Unfortunately, there are a lot of flaws with this movie that made it disappointing, if not below average.<br/><br/>First of all, it is a movie trying to be a book. What I mean by that is that it is easier to follow complexity in written form than in movie form. I was able to follow it, but there are so many twists and turns that each puzzle solved seems to become ""just another one"". I mean, with so many clues, they start getting old very fast. You start to say ""just figure it out already!"" Just when you think the puzzle is about to be solved, it's not. And even after all of this, the ending is very predictable (I did not read the book). Some positive aspects are the fact that there is a lot of intensity, stunning visuals, and the violence is well done.<br/><br/>As for the performances, Tom Hanks does not deliver a powerful performance. However, I do not believe it to be his fault. His character is written so poorly that the character has no depth, very cardboard. He is a very boring character who just figures things out, and occasionally feels claustrophobic. Ian McKellen delivers a very good performance, but there is too much of his character. He should be the cool small character that shows up for a little while, steals a couple scenes, and the story moves on. Silas is a great character, but Paul Bettany is shaky. His accent falters a few times, and he displays no acting range in the role. A better actor could have made the part brilliant (imagine Ralph Fiennes in the part). Alfred Molina does a good job, but his character seems completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>With that said, most of the problems with this movie come from the writing. When you make a movie from a book, you have to make the dialogue more powerful and entertaining. This movie had horrendous dialogue, and even great actors like Tom Hanks struggled with it. With better writing, this movie could have been very good. Also, I think a few more of the clues could have been cut out, those were a bit much. It is worth seeing, but fails to live up to expectations."

It was as I imagined to be. Some aspects of the plot could have been developed more however. Scenes like the Hieros Gamos in Sauniere's house, seemed hazy and lacked explanations for the newly introduced audience. On the other hand, a suggestion to those who have not read the book is in order. Please do not read it! Not until you have seen the movie anyway.

The movie takes place in the time span of less than 24 hours - what are they supposed to do throw down and go at it? I think they share a tenderness appropriate for the circumstances under which they are in. I think the film was good and easy to watch - it's not as enjoyable as the book because there is a lot of information that needs to be disseminated and the viewer needs to absorb.

The information presented on symbology and religious interactions over various points of history is what makes the book so gripping to read, because they encourage the reader to think and, even if in just a small way, change their outlook on some very widely accepted misconceptions.<br/><br/>And this is where the movie falls down, in order to transfer the plot on to the screen, almost all of this information is left out and, In turn, is replaced by very average character interactions and dialogue. While better than I originally expected, Tom Hank's portrayal of Robert Langdon is, to be blunt, wooden, and Jean Reno's character is in no way written to allow his acting ability to shine. The only performances worth mentioning were those of Paul Bettany as Silas, and Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing. In contrast to the rest of the movie these two roles were played outstandingly and turned what could have been 2 hours of drivel into something worth watching, if only the once. In fact, those 2 performances were the only reason why I rated this movie a 5.<br/><br/>Wit the removal of most of the afore-mentioned side information, the movie becomes what the book would have been without it, a badly-written narrative with a few saving graces. With the casting of a number of big names, the film may have given itself a certain amount of prestige, but that alone does not a movie make.] If you have nothing better to do it's worth watching, but don't expect anything special."

","""Symbolism is,"" says Professor Robert Langford and pauses to survey an auditorium full of presumed idiots, ""a language."" Thus begins Tom Hanks tight-lipped portrayal of a Harvard intellectual growing increasingly aware with every turn and twist of plot that he is trapped in a very, very bad script.<br/><br/>Some reviewers found the film, like Hanks' hanks of unkempt hair, overly long. I didn't, but then I took a cigarette break when Ian McKellan as Sir Leigh Teabing began his GEE (Grand Explanation of Everything) lecture, and still got back in time for the last two paragraphs.<br/><br/>The film has all the elements of a thriller - car chases, narrow escapes, unraveling of a mystery clue by clue, plot reversals - yet somehow manages to stay flatter than a 70-mile drive across the King Ranch. Tom Hanks' final monologue, his personal struggle to resolve the mystery of a Jesus human enough to beget children yet divine enough to inspire prayers from a drowning child, might have soared - but it limps its lame way toward the million-dollar pay window.<br/><br/>With schlock ideas voiced by kitsch characters caught in a best-seller-dumb plot, the movie anesthetizes. And that's a good thing. In the closing scene, Jesus' last living descendant, Sophie (Audrey Tautou, who has spent the last two hours acting puzzled and cute) dips her foot in a pond to show that she is not going to walk on water any time soon - and the audience is too numb even to groan."

But the movie oh my god. Tom Hanks just wasn't meant for this role his character acts like he bored to be there. Audrey Tautou was so much better in Amelie and just feels like she is getting a paycheck for this. Don't get me wrong Paul Bettany as Sila's and Ian Mckellen as Lee Teabing are actually really good, and play there characters with heart.<br/><br/>Otherwise this might be the most disappointing movie I have seen in a long time. I actually really like Ron Howard I think when he's on his game, he's really on look at Apollo 13 and Beautiful Mind masterpieces in my opinion, but this movie just doesn't fit for Ron Howard or even Akiva Goldsmith who is also a pretty good writer by my standards.<br/><br/>The things I do like about the Davinci code are the fact that are some really great local's in this movie, The movie is beautifully shot which has always been Ron Howards strengths. But to basically take a book which is the biggest selling book since the bible and basically just almost plagiarize it and put it on screen, It just doesn't work. You almost have cut things out to keep pacing and keep the moving going.<br/><br/>Look at Lord of the rings. It took a book that was really long and very drawn out, and made it into one of the most well written and wonderfully amazing movies I have ever seen. It didn't follow the book forbadium hell there was a lot of stuff cut out, but it was done and actually made the movie better. That was the problem with Davinci code there was just so much that needed to get cut out that didn't.<br/><br/>Unfortuantly for a movie that I was looking forward to just doesn't deliver.

","I found the Da Vinci Code a little dull. As has been mentioned by many people, it was a definite ""The book was better"" scenario. However, unlike many of those type of films, this film stuck pretty rigidly to the book apart from a couple of things (aspects of the end and the 'library'!).<br/><br/>Acting / casting. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks - didn't think he was the right man for the role really. My image of Robert Langdon from the books was a little more 'macho'. Having said that, he played it fairly well.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou - pretty good casting. They made her a little dippier (U.S. - ditzy?) than I imagined. She didn't seem too clever for a cryptologist.<br/><br/>Jean Reno - perfect casting. Didn't feature enough though. <br/><br/>Ian McKellen - wasn't sure about this casting but it worked very well.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany - fantastically played role. Very different to previous films.<br/><br/>As a church-going Christian, although not particularly offended myself, I can see why many people are, especially members of Opus Dei (which I know nothing about). I think the reason most people are upset about this film is that viewers are so ready to accept it as fact (although Ron Howard has clearly stated it is fiction). Why is it that the general public will so readily accept a conspiracy theory that the church is in on a huge cover-up rather than the simple truth that the church are the modern-day followers of Christ who want to see his principles of forgiveness, love for God and love for fellow man continued? Dan Brown's attack on the divinity of Christ and on the integrity of the church are what has upset people so much. Also, Sophie's line - ""Your God doesn't forgive murderers"" goes completely against the whole principle of forgiveness.<br/><br/>All in all, a mediocre film but watching it MAY help you to understand the media hype around it a little. My advice would be to watch it as fiction and hope to enjoy it."

I had heard a lot of bad things about it beforehand and that made it easier to like. I felt they followed the book very well with a few exceptions.

Actually he was better in Joe VS. the Volcano. He acted the part as if the character was on heroine the entire time (which the character was not). It was just absolutely a blight on his career. Sorry Tom, I am just giving my honest opinion. The movie was good, it could have been great if they had cast Gary Oldman as Langdon.

"hall895","5","0","3","25 May 2006"," A tremendous opportunity wasted
","When reading Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code one could not wait to turn the page to see what would happen next. When watching Ron Howard's film adaptation you might very well feel that you can not wait for it to simply be over. The tremendous story of the novel was full of energy, zest and excitement. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman has taken that story and almost impossibly sucked all the life right out of it. Everyone knows that in any film adaptation of a novel things are going to be changed. It's the nature of the beast. Characters and plot points are going to be tweaked and changed somewhat. But Goldsman does not give us minor tweaks, he changes the very story itself. Why anyone would feel the need to so drastically change the most basic and important plot elements of one of the most popular stories of all time is beyond comprehension. With the absolutely engrossing story they had to work with from the novel this film should have been something truly special. It is not. Somehow Akiva Goldsman managed to make The Da Vinci Code downright boring. And for anyone who read the novel incredibly frustrating.<br/><br/>There are almost too many ridiculous changes from the novel to mention but the most obvious, and incredibly dumb, change is the fact that the central figure of the story, Harvard professor, symbologist and author Robert Langdon has been turned into a skeptic, someone who does not believe the very story on which the entire novel was based. The first time you hear Tom Hanks as Langdon describe the Holy Grail story as a ""myth"" you know this film is going to have problems. The only reason Langdon ever became involved in the story in the novel was BECAUSE he knew, certainly believed and even wrote about the Holy Grail story. That is why a dying Jacques Sauniere's last act was to ensure that Langdon would be involved in all the events that would follow. If Langdon did not believe in the Grail he would have never been involved in the story at all.<br/><br/>Turning Langdon into a skeptic makes absolutely no sense but that's only the start. Goldsman has changed the motivations behind many of the characters' actions and in doing so has changed the very essence of the characters themselves, and not for the better. Bishop Aringarosa who in the novel was horrified at the thought of any killing has now become almost downright sinister. Police Captain Bezu Fache certainly had his reasons to be adamant about Langdon's guilt in the novel. Here he has an entirely different reason to be sure of Langdon's guilt. An entirely ridiculous, implausible reason. The character of Jacques Sauniere is someone entirely different from who he was in the novel and the change in his character helps to destroy all the emotion the novel had, which came almost entirely from Sophie Neveu's quest to learn the truth about her family. Suffice to say Akiva Goldsman's truth does not match Dan Brown's. You'll much prefer Dan Brown's.<br/><br/>Somewhere in this film Dan Brown's terrific story is still there. Maybe it's only there as a rough outline for Akiva Goldsman to follow (and ruin) but what's left of that engrossing, fascinating story is pretty much all this film has going for it. The acting by the two leads, Hanks as Langdon and Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, is forced, wooden and completely devoid of any emotion. There is absolutely no spark between the two. Far better and far more convincing performances come from Ian McKellen as Grail scholar Leigh Teabing, Paul Bettany as murderous monk Silas and Jean Reno as Captain Fache. With what's left of Dan Brown's story and some quality performances there are a few good parts here. But it doesn't add up to anything. Nothing worthwhile at least.<br/><br/>Anyone who read the novel could have seen a film adaptation would be quite a challenge. There is a lot of historical information to get across and sure enough the film often gets bogged down explaining the background behind the central theme of the story, the Holy Grail. And the novel took so many sudden and unexpected twists and turns which would certainly be a challenge to portray. But the way many of the plot points are revealed in the film does not even begin to match the stunning revelations of the book. Most notably the novel had one great ""A-Ha!"" moment where everything gets turned on its head. It should have been the key moment, the most thrilling moment, in the film. It is not, as the big revelation comes across with a whimper not a bang. In another of the most misguided changes characters who were absolutely essential in paying off one of the novel's big themes do not even appear. All the wonderful emotion of the book's conclusion has been lost. Do not be fooled by the obligatory ""based on the novel by Dan Brown"" credit. This is not Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, it is Akiva Goldsman's. And we are all the worse for it."

","I had a hot dog when I went to the theatre. As for the movie, well...uh...the hot dog was good, did I mention that? Great...sausage. I think even the slightly stale bun was better than watching poor Tom Hanks try so darned hard and succeed in being outacted by a tree. OK, so it's not like I had any expectations whatsoever but damn, that was a horrible movie! If it had been 1 1/2 hours, it would have been more tolerable but then, alas, that wouldn't have allowed for the rather silly and asinine ""Beautiful Mind""-type ""visualizations"". The point in which Tom Hanks was solving that Crypto-box thingy and he was visualizing the Newton solution was a complete and rather dull rip-off of those nice scenes in ""A Beautiful Mind"" where Russell Crowe had his ephiphanies and things. I will say that Paul Bettany and Audrey Tatou (sp?) were OK and Ian McKellen did a fine turn replaying his X-Men character with a less mutanty edge. Granted, I'm not a fan of the book but I will say that despite the rather horrendous writing of Mr. Brown, he kept you turning the pages. The movie made me yawn. And laugh. And wish it was WAY shorter. And poor, poor Tom Hanks. I hated Robert Langton in the books because he was such a pompous twit. No matter how hard Mr. Hanks tried, he didn't exactly become Mr. Langdon for me. He tried to become pompous but his Tom Hanks-iness sort of got in the way and I think he succeeded in being the equivalent of watching Chicken Little try to act like Popeye or something. The result was...wooden, to say the least. <br/><br/>However, I will say, my favourite moment was when the Albino Monk asked ""Do you dare mock me?"" (or something like that). Oh, how I love when characters talk to me because I can't help but respond! Also, there's this rather darling scene between Jean Reno's character and that other boring french policeman when Bezu or whatever the heck his weird French name is admits to being Opus Dei. If you replace the word ""killing"" with the word ""writing"", you have my whole philosophy on the works of Dan Brown! Hurrah for Hollywood!!"
"Michael Heide","7","0","2","25 May 2006"," Pretty close to the book. Unfortunately, the book already had its flaws.
","I like Dan Brown's novels. His choice of words is weak, his research is poor, his plots are painfully similar. But they are entertaining as hell and you can't lay his books down until you finished them. You like his characters - protagonists and antagonists alike. And while the central idea behind each book is nonsense, it makes for a hell of a great read.<br/><br/>I like the Da Vinci Code. Jesus marrying Maria Magdalena and getting kids is bull, of course. Besides, it has been done to death. And it's been done better. But the book wraps this tired (and cheesy) theory in a captivating thriller. While the theological conspiracy theory doesn't work, the thriller leaves you on the edge of your seat. What more do you expect from a movie?<br/><br/>The casting was inspired. Hanks as Langdon is the only weak point. The books describe Langdon as Harrison-Fordish, I would have picked Gary Sinise. Hanks comes off as too tired and too boring. Audrey Tautou however is beautiful and fits the character perfectly. Ian McKellen steals every scene he's in, and his almost childish excitement is infecting. Jean Reno is the only one who could have played the role of Bezu Fache. I missed the part (that is in the book) which set up Fache as a red herring, but the film is long enough as it is. Great performances from Alfred Molina, Paul Bettany and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow as well.<br/><br/>All in all, a very faithful adaptation of a pretty entertaining book. I'm looking forward to adaptations of Angels and Demons, Deception Point and Digital Fortress (and Brown's upcoming Langdon book about the Freemasons and Washington, DC). But I'm really starting to wish that Brown and the filmmakers do better research next time. The whole DaVinci code theory that ties the plot together is the weakest part of the book (and the movie) and the Opus Dei? Don't get me started."

How much tension can a director suck OUT of a sequence? The one good sequence of the film - between Sir Ian and (wannabe Sir) Tom - is driven by Sir Ian being the only person on the set who actually seems to understand the words being used. Hanks, to give him credit, does actually try and raise to the occasion. This is not the worst thing I've seen Tom do (it's no Forest Gump!).

","Okay, I decided to write a review of THE DA VINCI CODE, but I thought, golly gee, wouldn't it be great to do the critique, but do it in calligraphy in invisible ink on rare parchment paper, seal it in a container with a numerical lock so complicated that only a mathematical genius could decipher it and bury it in sacred ground at a location that can only be determined by solving an anagram created from a riddle written as a limerick and scrawled in blood on the back of a rare painting hanging in a museum that is protected by armed guards who will allow you to bypass security, but only if you can prove you belong to a secret society by telling them the password that is the answer to a question posed as a palindrome written in Hebrew and posted at the website dopeyopie.com.<br/><br/>But, then I asked myself, who in their right mind would be stupid enough to go to all that trouble just to learn the secret of what I think of the movie THE DA VINCI CODE -- as brilliant and insightful as my opinion ultimately might be. Of course, my little scavenger hunt is nothing compared to the conspiracies and counter-conspiracies whose gnarly tentacles thrive like kudzu in Ron Howard's movie based on Dan Brown's novel. It involves competing secret societies, both of whom seem obsessed with creating elaborate puzzles and word games designed to keep or uncover sinister schemes that will either save or destroy Christianity as we know it today. But just who in this ridiculously complex game of charades is supposed to be the good guys or the bad guys is open to interpretation. At any rate, there are tax codes that are easier to decipher than the rambling plots that unravel and tangle up again in this bloated narrative.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, clearly miscast as a Harvard professor, plays a ""symbologist"" who, for reasons that are never made clear, becomes the unsuspecting contestant who is sucked into the rival convoluted conspiracies that center on the search for the Holy Grail, which we are told is a who and not a what. All this springs from the notion that Jesus Christ did not die a virgin, but married Mary Magdelene and sired a child and that created a lineage that survives today. It is but one of the film's innumerable plot holes that it assumes that after 2000 years and possibly 100 generations, only one possible offspring would exist and not the thousands that are likely. And if you don't figure out just who that one possible offspring is within the first half hour, than you definitely are not heavenly inspired, because that is the least mysterious mystery in the story.<br/><br/>All the densely packaged clues, theories, wild guesses and ""evidence"" that supposedly reveal that the Christ story is a hoax are tossed at the audience in a fast and furious manner, yet the story still seems to drag on endlessly. And after going the long way around, it is obvious at the end that the revelation of the ""truth"" is not likely to make one bit of difference: It would take a lot more than this junk theology to cause the devout to doubt or the church to crumble. Seldom will you find a film's ending more deserving of a shrug and an indifferent ""So what?"" It is, however, obvious why the Catholic church among others are offended by THE DA VINCI CODE because it does suggest that the churches willful have lied about Jesus' divinity as a cruel excuse to brutalize others and commit church-sanctioned murder. And while it is refreshing, in this era when so many movies are constructed like insipid video games, that here is a movie and book that tries to appeal to the thinking man. But strip away the sanctimonious pseudo-religious prattle and it is just another film about nailing the evil corporation (i.e., the Catholic Church, Inc.) that is selling a product deemed to be defective (i.e., religious faith). That aside, THE DA VINCI CODE is little more than ludicrous neo-feminist propaganda: the piety of women versus the chauvinism of men.<br/><br/>Yet, if Jesus did marry, what's the big deal? Becoming a husband and father would only confirm belief in the power of marriage and family and it would not necessarily contradict Jesus' virgin birth, his divinity or the validity of his philosophical teachings. The true mystery is why the churches have so foolishly acted as the PR agent for the film. All the indignant protests and hysterical calls for boycotts have done nothing but create book-buying, ticket-selling publicity that has drawn in millions of gullible consumers who otherwise wouldn't have cared less about this rather silly story.<br/><br/>And in its pursuit if the Holy Grail, DA VINCI's quest is neither as funny as Monty Python's or as exciting as Indiana Jones'. And for that matter it isn't even as amusingly bad as the similarly themed HUDSON HAWK. Despite its arrogant self-importance, the film doesn't even meet minimum standards as decent entertainment; so let's just say that DA VINCI isn't up to code."

","I read the novel a year ago. And then the wait began...<br/><br/>In the 48 hours or so, up 'til seeing it on it's opening weekend Friday night, I, like most people, had heard the negative reviews (Cannes, pans, etc.). And after the 3 hours that I had sat in a Chicago-area movie theatric that night, I somewhat agreed. That first night, ""The Da Vinci Code"" seemed rather boring, a little hard to follow, and for the most part, unimpressive. Tom Hanks was something of a shadow: there, but not really more than to just follow the real action, which seemed to be occurring in every other storyline except for his. Ron Howard's direction was so-so, I supposed.<br/><br/>Another 48 hours went by, and on Sunday night, unplanned, I went to see it again.<br/><br/>After walking out of the theatric the second time, I was somewhat speechless. I suddenly had plenty of respect for this movie. Things that I didn't notice the first time jumped off the screen at me the second time around. I found Hanks' portrayal dead on to the Robert Langdon I remember reading of. And yes, Langdon pretty much is a shadow on the wall throughout the book. Oh yes--Hanks is the star. But Imagine (pun intended) Hanks in his ten-year old ""Big"" mindset screaming at you, ""But the movie isn't about me!"" Speaking of Imagine, Howard, who did a great job with ""The Missing"" (at least *I* thought), steered this very well considering, well, how many tens of millions of people have already read the book and already directed this movie in *their own heads.* I wonder how many of us were hoping that we'd see a ""shared vision"" with Ron Howard up there on the big screen.<br/><br/>Howard got the right performances out of a terrific cast. And a name you might not hear mentioned in anyone else's comments is Akiva Goldsman, who is credited with writing the screenplay. Goldsman does a fine job with a fantastic literary work--don't hear that too often.<br/><br/>""The Da Vinci Code"" is a very brainy work of fiction. For movies of this nature, see anything by the Coen Brothers. I learn something new about ""The Big Lebowski"" every time I see it (and I'm on 10 times at least by now). And that was never a book.

I believe this was done very cleverly and deliberately, such that the ideas that Dan Brown included in the book as though they were fact, but actually turned out to be untrue, have been removed.<br/><br/>At first I didn't feel that Tom Hanks was right for the role of Robert Langdon, but I changed my mind almost instantly, he put across an brilliant performance. Paul Bettany's portrayal of Silas was both excellent and harrowing, I felt he almost stole the show.<br/><br/>The films length flew by, keeping me thoroughly entertained and even slightly on edge, despite knowing the plot inside and out.<br/><br/>Definitely one to watch."
"dust-7","Null","0","2","24 May 2006"," The grail is what again? and it's . . . where?
","This is one of those films that you don't know to ask for your money back until it's mostly over. Only then do you realize the full scope of how brainless it all was, and how you were cheated.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is interesting in the part, though dull. The casting seems otherwise good. The French do suggest a little unintentional comedy. But maybe that's just a French thing.<br/><br/>There are those I've heard say - gee, it really makes you think. And they'll turn around two minutes later and say - just fiction and whatchya complain-an about, it's just a movie? So, until such folk get their heads in working order, I'll just suggest that the plot is insane. The tomb of Magdelene is supposed to be buried in the little pyramid under the glass pyramid fairly recently built in the courtyard of the Louvre Museum. And the Tom Hanks character doesn't want to upset 'organized religion' by telling anyone, I suppose. So that's why they built that ugly glass pyramid (as bad guy #1 called it). Had to be a reason. Of course, the real whopper is not that there is this line of offspring, which just coincidentally, we'll say, happens to end with a girl - because imagine how the plot would look if it were a guy - from Jesus Christ. It's that Jesus Christ was just a man, just a prophet. There's a number of sects that believe that, like the Freemasons, and the Muslims, and any number of heretics in the Church's past. Jesus was just some good guy - who literally claimed to be God, Himself. So he was just a good guy, who was completely out of his mind. He was great teacher of morality, who fornicated with Magdalene, or then secretly married her to make it all legal. And then there are Catholics, and Protestants and Greek Orthodox who obviously believe otherwise.<br/><br/>As with pretty much the same supposed conspiracy said to be concealed by thousands and thousands over the millenia as proposed by Kazantzakis, also made into a film, and the same as with Lincoln's original Holy Blood myth from which Brown's fiction is wholly lifted, despite what a court may have ruled, what's sort of sad when watching this is not that the film just seems to drag on and on, it's not that the camera occasionally bounces all around, or that it screens like a book when they first elude capture, etc., but that people actually spend their lives coming up with these kind of conspiracy theories. To imagine that this described the early Church, the Apostles and disciples who literally were tortured and martyred, that of course is the classic argument against this, or similar notions.<br/><br/>As for the Priority of Sion stuff, this group of four that is murdered by McKellen who are trying to protect the female descendant, and the supposed 'grail', which in this myth isn't the cup at Valencia Cathedral, but the corpse of St. Mary Magdalene, this 'Priory' was admitted to be a hoax perpetrated in recent decades by a couple of guys, a con-man named, Pierre Plantard, and his buddy, Philippe de Cherisey. As for the Opus Dei involvement in the plot, that may come closest to the truth. The cult is not necessarily orthodox, and has been otherwise seen as heterodox, but it seems even more just to be a group which is very opportunistic, and really just out for itself, and power. It's a shadowy group, no question. It's considered dangerous by many traditional 'religious' Catholics. Whether any Opusites wear monk costumes is another thing, as is whether it's just a group of psychotic assassins, as Brown would have it.<br/><br/>If one wants a real conspiracy, a real threat to Catholicism, it's been in the news and in front of everyone - since at least the mid-1960s. It's the changes made in virtually everything, and blamed on Vatican II by the very 'reformers' themselves. There's a line that one of the bad guys, played by McKellen, says, or keeps saying. People ignore what's right in front of them. But what people see, and don't want to see, is this 'reformist' destruction on the inside (not necessarily including altering the appearance of Da Vinci's Last Supper), and which extends to the Protestant denominations, as well, and all the while the anti-Church conspiratist nuts keep pounding away with Holy Blood myths, and Gnostic gospels. That's the danger. It's 'world church reform'. Watering down. There's your threat, not in the deep desire of Kazantzakis and others that Jesus Christ be some sort of guy who can't keep his pants on. Such notions are so ridiculous, and so trivial in the face of the real threat, and what's really going on. In fact, one wouldn't be surprised with the desire of these newChurchers, who speak like secular feminists in everything, to believe that St. Magdalene wasn't really a Saint, but was rather the Incarnation, herself. Considering how far gone they are, already, that would just be one more against them on the list of offenses to both God, and The Church which He founded. If that's what 'making one think' is what anyone means who says it, hopefully it will.<br/><br/>Now, if Ron Howard ever made a film about the life of a Catholic Saint, that might be a sure sign that one could use ice skates in hell. But he'd probably go Oliver Stone one better and have the Saint dream of 'sexing' Jesus while discovering that The Church has been concealing the 'truth' that Pius X was a ten year old girl, name John - Joan. abbr. in Latin - who had good make-up people to make her appear old. Dakota Fanning as the Pope. Teen Pope. Coming soon. After all - it's just a movie!"

"xUptownGirlx","5","0","2","24 May 2006"," Too different from the book.
","I love movies. I especially love when great movies come from great books. The DaVinci Code happens to be my favorite book. I've been looking forward to the movie version since I first read the novel two years ago, since the book always seemed like an excellent screenplay. I went into the movie theater opening weekend with high expectations and excitement, and left confused and disappointed. I do not want to give any spoilers away, but from the very beginning of the movie, details were already changed. Now, I knew they had to change some things, but these changes were ridiculous! Not only were details cut from the movie, but things that NEVER happened in the book were in the movie. What purpose is that?? Also, I believe that as a result of the amount of controversy that surrounded the novel when it first came out, the creators of the movie decided to minimize the controversial elements. This did not help the movie. In one chapter of The DaVinci Code, Teabing and Langdon are explaining the secret of the Holy Grail to Neveu, both agreeing and on the same side. In the movie, Langdon is arguing Teabing, trying to dissuade Neveu from believing everything Teabing was saying about Mary Magdalene. The movie was lacking in suspense. Also, Langdon's character is too religious in the movie. In the book, his religion does not make up a large part of his life, whereas in the movie, it seems somewhat more important to him. What's most upsetting, however, is the missing ""what if?"" factor. Yes, the novel is fictional. Yet, after reading the book, you can't help thinking, ""What if Dan Brown's right about something? What if maybe .... really happened?"" The movie didn't have that at all.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you have not yet read the book, I would recommend seeing the movie first. The DaVinci Code has excellent actors and a superb director. All and all, it is a good movie with a good plot. However, since The DaVinci Code is my favorite novel, I'm going to be too nit picky and dislike the movie, purely because it is too different from the book."
"linda-513","8","0","1","24 May 2006"," Sublime imagery buoys up difficulties of The DaVinci Code
","After all the blustering and whining commentary on what is termed ""wooden"" about Ron Howard's handsome take on Dan Brown's hugely popular novel evaporates, perhaps someone will notice the graceful and occasionally sublime imagery employed to buoy up a difficult topic. We are taken into Langdon's vivid imagination via CGI and beautifully compelled to embrace obscure concepts. Having read Brown's book and it's source, ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"", and a good deal on the Templars, and European history and art in general, I'm pretty delighted to be part of a culture that allows a writer or filmmaker to have this kind of adventure with what we consider to be the foundation belief system of Western Civilization. (And, anyway, who can complain about looking at Audrey Tautou, ever?) The real issue at question is not art, it's math: if Mary Magdalene's issue had procreated by even the minimal factor of two per generation, Christ's descendants would have outnumbered the current population of the planet by the year 825a.d.! Brown's payoff, that Sophie is Christ's sole living descendant, can only work if each successive offspring exercised extreme discipline and produced only one child per life. It's a dicey proposition that I'm not sure is adequately addressed in either book or film."
"scurvy_wench","4","0","2","24 May 2006"," Gross mis-justice
","Little more than half the content of the book is portrayed in the movie. They seem to have just picked out the pieces that they liked best while also inventing others eg. her super-magic Jesus power to heal robert's claustrophobia. Teabing has become nothing more than a comic element with the audience laughing at most of his dialogue.<br/><br/>The worst thing has to be the scenes with Rossyln Chapel. The interior may be the church in question but the exterior sure ain't. For one it's a semi-ruin in the process of restoration (doesn't actually have a roof at present) and secondly does not sit atop a hill in a near jungle-like forest, it's about half way down the valley with views of the surrounding villages easily seen. How do I know this? I live in one of those villages, I've been to services at the chapel and it looks sfa like that. At the cinema in near-by Edinburgh where i went to see it the audience could be audibly heard to gasp when the scene appeared on screen with people even proclaiming ""Where's that?"". Such a fuss has been made over the use of the chapel in filming that i find it insulting that a CGI landscape has been used.<br/><br/>Apart from that, it's an OK film. Better if you haven't read the book I suppose. Bit of a non-brainer but easy to eat popcorn to."

The heroin, after all, was the unsuccessful. I have expected her very much. But it is the result, which is regrettable. Has she something wrong in her privacy? Or has you some by yourself, Ron? When I was asked who can make that best-seller, ""The Da Vinci Code"" into film, I thought you'd be the best. Eventually we had needed an Orson Welles for this sort. I guess a Hitchcock would be available anyway. It is what the book wants, isn't it. On just running around, you could not convey that noble story to the audience, We have very few scenes which they halt; it is the point of the failure, Ron.

The scenery was great, when they were going through Paris it really pulled me into it. This thriller really gets your heart rising and your on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next, with car chases and bloody violence at some parts it keeps you gripped.The acting was excellent as well, Tom Hanks the leading role really shone in this movie as he excelled at the role of a clever professor. Audery Tautou a women I happened seen acting before was amazing at her role and her and Tom Hanks's on screen chemistry also made the film enjoyable to watch. I enjoyed watching Ian Mckellen, as I think he is a great actor to begin with. Also he shows off his talent as the role of Lee Teabing. The only character I didn't enjoy watching was Stalis played by Paul Bettany, not because he is a bad actor, in fact he's an excellent actor, the reason was I was scared of him. His character was really creepy! Overall I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it, as it also had me questioning what would happen if Dan Brown was on to something and it was true. Would it show that women were equal to men, or that Jesus was a normal man? Many other questions I could ask. I hope you enjoy this film as much as I have and i definitely want to see it again."

Number One the the movie was cast perfectly except for Tom Hanks, but thats okay because he doesn't hurt the movie, he certainly doesn't help it, but with the other characters he really doesn't need to. Yes the character of Robert Langdon is important but there are far more interesting characters in the book and they were cast to perfection. OTWN talks of the plot as if it were bad, maybe he should try reading the book or reading anything for that matter other than a critics point of view. The plot is great. Where this movie slacks is with simple corniness. Yes it's a Ron Howard film. Yes its bound to have some corniness. I think many of us expected this for those of us who didn't we should try other Ron Howard films (ie. Ransom). So with that being said Howard doesn't steer very far off of the plot of the book, some stuff was discarded but this was definitely expected. Even now everyone I've talked to seems to have enjoyed this film. I understand its easy to criticize a movie when Peter Travers bashed it in Rolling Stone and you think that you're in the majority. But please don't compare this to National Treasure, this was far more interesting than trying to steal the Declaration and then hike to the core of the earth. Disregard the critics this one time and check this film out if you like Dan Brown's novel or you simply like science fiction stories"

Last Friday night, with my tickets in hand I sat in the line for the theatre for 1 1/2 hrs so that i could get the best possible seat, only to find that my favorite book had been butchered. The ending was completely wrong (like all those documents that had been protected for hundreds of years would just be kept behind a rope that says private), and numerous important parts of the book were excluded (the first cryptex etc). Furthermore, the made everything seem to easy for it to be found, or deciphered, or broken. That was part of the essence of the book that they had to work hard to crack the codes and really think and use their brains. and the fact that teabing and langdon were fighting in the grail explanation scene (which was actually quite magnificently done) NEVER REALLY HAPPENED, it made langdon look like he was too religious to ever think that this could ever be plausible. I thought Paul Bettany did an amazing job of Silas, he really became his character, as did Audrey Toutou, however Tom hanks performance was to say the least disappointing.

"ErasmusSpikher","5","0","2","24 May 2006"," Little mystery in this mystery - what a relief
","Is it sensible to make mystery (sacrament) into a theme of a mystery (detective story)? I doubt. The genres are too different. Take this fragment from the introductory chapter of the book: ""The click of an empty chamber echoed through the corridor. The curator's eyes flew open. The man glanced down at his weapon, looking almost amused. He reached for a second clip, but then seemed to reconsider, smirking calmly at Sauniere's gut. 'My work here is done.'"" This is how these nasty guys always act - the more so if they are albinos. They just cannot help it. In the next few pages you get a tall blue-eyed hero and a charming heroine, and there you go. But at a certain moment a character starts to lecture on some funny, pop-art sort of religion theory; and the more he dwells on it, the more suspicious you are that the author, unbelievable as it is, believes every word of it. You need not to know about what is said of Jesus in the Dead Sea Scrolls (nothing), about the ""marginal"" vote of 2 to 300 something at the Council of Nicaea, or about the Priory of Sion hoax. From the very wording of Teabing's exposition it is clear that nothing of substance is revealed to his eager listeners. Right, it is just a fiction. But the driving impression that the author is dead serious about it is, uh, painful. Perhaps one should take comfort in the line by D. B. himself: ""'Pain is good, monsieur,' the man said."" In the movie, the SF (Sacred Feminine) promotional sequence feels much less annoying. Who cares about a slide show when there is a fine car race before it and a villain jumping from behind the door after it? The action is perpetual, although it proceeds at a rather mild pace. This is understandable. It is not appropriate for a man of letters, like the main character, to jump from one sky-draper to another attached to a rope like Tom Cruise in MI3; neither one would show good manners if setting off a couple of rockets at a nice old château near Paris. The meek behavior of the characters during the action takes, however, does not imply that one can truly sympathize with them. They are, after all, but comic book characters. All in all, when factorizing out the pretentious ""revelation"" scenes, the movie is not that bad. A piece of respectable craftsmanship, I would say. The mechanical development of the plot may seem a bit awkward, but the emperor of the Andersen fairy tale, too, preferred the artificial nightingale to the real one. Perhaps a distant echo of beauty can be heard even in the sounds produced by a mechanical gadget. Producing Fibonacci numbers is mechanical as well but, as Robert Langdon himself mentions in the book, if you wait long enough (in actual fact, infinitely long) you will end up with the Golden Section."

Fictionalizations are part of literature and Hollywood, and 'secret societies,' and any exclusive group should expect to be misrepresented from time to time.<br/><br/>Then again, I may be biased, having read the book and having been exposed to the theories and speculations introduced in the book in Philosophy classes before that.<br/><br/>The Davinci Code is an interesting work of fiction, and a very entertaining one at that.<br/><br/>Casting was very well done, and even the changes made from the book to the screenplay were well thought-out.<br/><br/>Obviously Teabing wasn't quite as over-weight, or red-headed as in the book, but Ian McKellen was still perfect casting. As were Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou... And most everyone else appearing in the movie.<br/><br/>In closing, if you don't take fiction as an exposition of fact, you will enjoy this movie.

Alas, I was disappointed. Not that this is a bad movie, but unlike the book, this version seems disjointed, and not that Tom Hanks or the other actors did a bad job, but they've seen better days. It seemed to me that the script was rushed, which isn't surprising considering they had to condense a long book down into 2 hours - but because of that, the movie suffers, with more explanations necessary. That said, one interesting method Howard employed was to see Langdon's as he ""sees"" (aka highlights) the numbers and letters (a method Howard used with Russell Crowe's character in ""A Beautiful Mind"").

It bears re-watching. I think critics are jumping too early on the ""let's pan it"" band wagon. It's almost impossible to take one's eyes off Audrey Tautou, or off Tom Hanks for that matter. In fact the film is impeccably cast down to the smallest role. It's hard to imagine a better adaptation of a book, and I can't imagine who could have done it better.

","First and foremost, I have to say I did not read the book prior to seeing the movie. I have started it today, but only read the prologue, thus, I saw the movie with nothing to compare it to. As with any movie, I found a variety of pros and cons, but by no means were there more cons and pros. I overall would say the movie was extremely enjoyable, and had it not been for the lack of sleep I had obtained over the past three days, might have enjoyed it more.<br/><br/>Lengh of the movie?: This is questionable. The movie obviously needed the time to make sure it got enough of the valid points in. However, unlike King Kong, the time didn't seem wasted or useless. I enjoyed the progression of the story, though I am sure it could have progressed at a slightly faster speed, thus keeping a little more interest early on.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting, I found, to be very well done. My favorite character by all means was Silas. However, from my understanding, he was bigger in the book. IF this is the case, I would have definitely liked to see more of him. Perfectly cast. By no means was Hanks bad, that isn't what I""m saying. But he did leave something to be desired in the chemistry he had on screen. Ian, of course, was great, no question there.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Loved it, there isn't much I can really go into without wanting to give away info, haha, but it really was very well done. Definitely caught my attention, and kept me involved in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I could go on, but I would prefer to read the book to do a full review of the movie. From the point of a movie goer, it made sense, it told the story appropriately and kept me interested.<br/><br/>Good job Ron Howard"

","I cannot believe the bad reviews this movie has gotten, the stir it has caused! it's been years since i saw some real controversy over something that is a fictional story! I've read the book and after i saw the movie i was personally amazed at how accurate it was to the narrative of it! even if some of the lines comes out cheesy at times,this for the purist is a point of honor! the fans of the book (like myself) won't be disappointed with this adaptation, it have a great cast of name actors, it has a great pacing and it's a very enjoyable movie! Look for it not as a masterpiece of cinema, but as something that is entertaining, and the experience will be good! the critics don't know jack about what they are talking!"

","Well, the first 20 minutes was rushed.. Langdon(tom hanks) was solving puzzles and codes to fast, and if you did not read the book, it might have made it very confusing.. The Actress who played the role of Sophie Nueve was miscast and portrayed the character poorly. Besides these two things the movie was great. Ian Mckellen played his part great, and if you get past the first 20-30 minutes, the movie becomes more understandable and fun.. i would recommend this movie, but you should read it first in order not to get lost with the small details that might not be noticed in the first part of the movie. .... off topic, iam now writing to burn space and to actually write enough to get this review submitted."
"mlkyusuf","4","0","2","23 May 2006"," Cannot Compare to the Novel
","Most of the reviews I have read of this film, due to its subject material, are biased, either completely towards it, or completely against it, simply based on its accusations against Christianity. Almost none of them, however, have even mentioned anything about whether it was a faithful adaptation of the novel or not. Therefore, I believe that it is my duty to inform fans of the novel that this film will most likely disappointment you. I personally found the novel to be a great read and it was easily one of the most interesting books I've read in ages. I account this primarily to the fact that I took it merely as a piece of fiction, although the arguments it made intrigued me. The novel was a great page-turning thriller that ended every chapter with the reader wanting more, however the novel, although extremely thrilling, is not the type that is easily adaptable to film. This is due to the facts that it is neither emotionally nor psychologically deep nor does it contain very much action. I therefore did not expect much of the film, but even my low expectations weren't met by this unfaithful adaptation. My primary concerns are that a significant deal was changed for the worse. It is important that film versions of books do not copy their source material exactly and that they inject something new, however this film did little new and instead removed a few important parts of the novel. Anyway, in conclusion I was disappointed by this film because it barely maintains the suspense and thrill of the novel and does not remain, in my eyes, very faithful to it. However, if I were to solely grade it based on my expectations I would have given it a 5, but due to the fact that I'm trying to be impartial here and that if I hadn't read the novel I might have enjoyed it somewhat, I shall give it a 6 for now.<br/><br/>P.S. Please take this film for what it is; FICTION!!!"
"Amy_Polk","10","0","2","23 May 2006"," Exactly what I expected
","There was only a few spots in the movie that did not coincide with how it happened in the book. The few spots have nothing to do with the formation of the plot, but that is beside the point. The first one at the very beginning of the movie. Langdon is at a book signing when the police tell him about Sauniere. Almost every Dan Brown book starts out with a phone call in the middle of the night. Not a big deal and nothing to do with the plot, but it really bugged me. The second one was that they used some kid's cell phone to connect to the library when they really did go to a library and used a big database to search words like grail, blood, etc. Again, not important but wrong.<br/><br/>The thing that I missed the most in the movie was the information. The best parts of the book for me is when they are sitting around exchanging information. There is a scene in the book when they are at Teabing's house that consists just of them sitting around staring at each other and trying to think of different possibilities of a code for the cryptex. I missed moments like that. I also would have liked more explanation of Silas's background. I understood the flashbacks because I had read the book, but I'm not quite sure that someone who didn't read the book was going to fully understand Silas's past. They also left out things like the camera in Sauniere's office that the ""Teacher"" and Remy had been watching him on for months, maybe years.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was terrible as Langdon. I missed the flashbacks to Langdon teaching the symbols of the sacred feminine to his class. I missed Langdon's personality. I missed the way he was able to crack a joke even though he was in an extremely dangerous situation. I also think that Sophie needed to be played as a brave and smart girl and I think the actress played her a lot dumber than she actually was. Every line she said was a question. In the book Sophie was a brilliant and cunning young woman. There was also a lot of romantic chemistry between Langdon and Sophie that I think could have been played up more. Silas was perfect. Teabing was more than amazing. Collet and Fache weren't the best, but I enjoyed them.<br/><br/>Overall it was an OK movie but the book is ten times better. I do suggest that you all go see it though."
"goodkate88","10","0","1","23 May 2006"," Great movie for thinking adults
","I thought the DaVinci Code was an excellent movie for thinking adults. I had read the book, but did not remember many of the details. The settings were incredible and the plot made perfect sense to me. I don't understand the reviews that have ranged from negative to lukewarm. This isn't a typical action movie, but it did have me shouting out and gripping my companion at a number of places. For a progressive religious person who thinks a great deal about the history of Christianity and isn't afraid of looking at it with all of its warts, this is a great choice for viewing. Tom Hanks and Ian McClellan were excellent as was the ingénue from Amalie. The length of the movie was not noticed by me or my companion. We thought the time just flew and were totally engrossed in the plot. We both said, ""Great movie. What were those reviewers thinking?"" when the film ended. I was very glad we decided to see the movie for ourselves rather than paying attention to the several reviews we'd read.<br/><br/>Kate Goodspeed, Denver, Colorado"
"lpmobrie","4","0","2","23 May 2006"," OK, sorta ""Indiana Jones""/""The Game"" mixture. But shoddy history.
","Cast, director, genre, and polish save the film from absolutely awful. It's still worth seeing if you want a mediocre mix of Indiana Jones type stuff with ""the game."" The theory behind it is primarily bunk, with major historical errors re council of Nicea, some unnecessary overly general slugging of Christianity's view of women, and some great embellishments re Opus Dei and other groups and past events. Good choices for cast. Of course, the main reason this film will do well is because of the cast. The other booster group will be pretty much anybody who wants a movie to slave any pre-existing prejudices they have concerning organized religion, people of faith, or the church in general. Go see the film, but if you're interested in it for the theory, make sure you read some reputable academic history on this stuff first."
"imdb-5807","8","0","1","23 May 2006"," Fine adaptation
","I asked several people sitting nearby, at least 7 out of 10 have read the book. There are differences, at some points they simplified the story (e.g. # cryptexes), however I think the movie is true to the spirit of the original story.<br/><br/>I was glad to see the segment when Teabing and Langdon argue/explain the grail history in Teabing's house. It was made clear that there is controversy on important points of the grail history; this was probably ignored by those who gave the 1-3 marks to the movie out of (misplaced) ""religious loyalty"". (I guess the mere fact that there are / can be alternate theories or people considering them irks these reviewers.) It is worth looking at the median score for this movie: 8. I wish IMDb would show both the median and the average on the main page as well. A significantly (>1 diff) lower average than the median may indicate that some zealot's are voting the movie down.<br/><br/>Some parts may be difficult to understand without reading the book, for example Teabing's background was not presented fully.<br/><br/>Note that when reading, the reader adds a lot through their imagination. You cannot make a movie matching everyone's idea. For example my girlfriend pictured a more bulky guy for Silas, and so on.<br/><br/>I liked that they did not make out an obvious romance between the main heroes. There were some hints for attraction letting the viewer interpolate to his/her wish. I also liked the ending a lot, finishing with focusing the intellectual aspect (search for truth/solution/resolve whatever) and not the action, hence putting the two in excellent balance.<br/><br/>Some will say the movie is slow. My theory is that many moviegoers today use their imagination less and less. Using the brain is work you know. They just want all their senses overwhelmed with effects, speed, action, emotion etc. without any effort on their own. A friend of mine sometimes mentions that a movie is good/interesting but a little slow. That immediately makes me consider it!"
"graham-heath","5","0","2","23 May 2006"," Great casting but the book was better
","These are entirely personal opinions from someone whose faith is not hampered by fiction. In my opinion this is not Dan Brown's best book and carries pride of place based on skillful manipulation of contentious material. I love a good stir, so I was really looking forward to this film. I was impressed with how much from the book they managed to pack in, I was very impressed with the casting, Reno and Tautou carried the French angle superbly, Bettany and McKellan both turned in sterling performances. At this point though it all falls apart, having been so faithful to the book, and cramming so much in I found myself squirming in the seat waiting for the end. Hanks' (or maybe his lines) did not match my expectations of an American Professor. The book for me was a real page turner, I was wholly enthralled by the pace and the ideas that circulated around the text. The film though stuttered in several places leaving me hanging and disinterested. Such a shame, it promised so much but in the end delivered a middle of the road product. The star of the film, well that has to be the glass pyramid!"

","Fanatastic film! I always have lots lots of question regarding the Christian faith. I don't know, until now it seems hard to understand it with my logic. I think that is why people try to make theories by themselves to make it logic. But i never knew this one, especially about the code beneath Leonardo's's work on the last supper. Wow, for me this theory is a new one...that is why this film it is so intriguing for me, it catches my mind in how this film sets up another new theories about the origin of the Christian faith  again to make it logic! I never understand until now why a man could be perceive as a God and put that as the main dogma in the faith. Isn't it simple to believe a man as a mortal rather than an immortal. I cannot imagine a God being born as a human, nursed and taken care by human, educated by human then grew up to be God the Almightywell this film really workshell he grew up to be a real man, wise, handsome and in need of love from a woman."

","the Da Vinci is a good movie in my opinion because the most difficult thing to do is to make a movie out of a book. And director Ron Howard has done that very well. The cast in the movie are all perfect and especially Silas (Paul Bettany). He is also my favorite in the movie so... The music by Hans Zimmer, is (as always) gorgeous. But I'm not giving it more than 8 because the trailers and commercials have made everyone think that there is a message hidden in the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci. When actually Mona Lisa has almost nothing to do with the movie. And the end was kind of disappointing. I mean, how can you know what would happen if the heir of Jesus Christ realized who she was? But it was a wonderful treasure quest and a good bunch of special effects."
"katelaurabaldwin","6","0","2","23 May 2006"," Disappointing
","Hmmmm - is there anyone else out there who read the book (in my case probably about 5 times), thought it was pretty damn good (not exactly Shakespeare in terms of the skill of the author) but a decent story nonetheless and yet was completely disappointed with the film?! I'm not going to go into storyline details but some of my feelings are listed below. 1. What was the point of Audrey Tautou's character? Yes, she looked very pretty but she had absolutely nothing to do! In the book, as the cryptologist, she solved, or at least had a very big part in solving, the riddles, puzzles and clues. On top of this, Sophie was feisty, in control and had a very major role. In the film, she simpered and pouted. Not a great performance. 2. I went to see this with a friend who had also read the book and we both agreed that if we hadn't have done, we wouldn't really have known what was going on. Before anyone jumps down my throat, I know it isn't possible to put absolutely everything from the book into the film, but I feel too much of what was important/interesting/relevant in the book was left out. 3. Why was Jean Reno's character such a thug? In the book he came across as tenacious, determined and rather bullish, but he also came across as a decent police officer and human being. In the film, he was simply portrayed as a bully.<br/><br/>However, there were parts of this film that were very well done. I think Paul Bettany did a really good job as Silas; although I usually avoid Tom Hanks films like the plague, I actually didn't mind him in this; the support cast generally were very good (Collet and Vernet) and the pace of the film was good. Special praise must be given to Ian McKellen who was simply phenomenal as Leigh Teabing. Without his explanation as to the Grail legend halfway through the film, I honestly believe the whole thing would have collapsed.<br/><br/>My advice? Wastes a couple of hours but wait for it to come out on DVD"

","National Treasure on steroids. I couldn't believe my eyes. Don't get me wrong the story was okay but it needed serious improvement and I think I've lost a little respect for Tom Hanks. His performance was so stale. Bettany was amazing but you never sympathize with his character. I've always liked Ron Howard movies but this one lacks his usual spark and charm.<br/><br/>I liked it better than the book but I'm probably the only person on he planet who hated the book. There were some serious plot holes in the book and the movie didn't even attempt to fill in those blanks. What the hell? I repeat, what the hell?!"

","*SPOILER*SPOILER*SPOILERS* As all who read the book I saw the movie with great expectations, although mixed with the anticipation of Hollywood part on hmm lets say lower the quality of the storyline. But knowing the cast especially to m\hanks and his Oscars , and the director Ron Howard a man who directed v.good movies like beautiful mind , and Cinderella man ,and his partner (seems to be ) writer Akiva Goldsman ,I expected to be happy with the finale scene But apparently I wasn't very. Away from all the religious debates going on, away from all the hustles. Let be honest Mr. Howard and Mr. Akiva , made so many mistakes on this moving it turned at some points to become disappointing , i.e. (in my opinion ) un necessary change of places ) why did they picked up Langdon while signing the book which was actually his hotel room ( it could've been done to fit the movie and still be faithful to the book ) the ride to the museum why not showing few little seconds of the scenery while Langdon thinks things over ,small dialogues and comments made by Langdon to several characters and if you read the book you'll see that in the movie the characters were actually doing nothing why not the small talk and I mean like the comment about the symbol the detective was wearing when he met Langdon at the Louvre it would've took 30 seconds just to do this conversation But I think the film crew was busy making a movie we didn't watch, or maybe enjoying the journey to Europe The book was a great mystery from start to end, always talking about riddles and clues and symbols and anagrams. But not yet revealing anything that would harm the ending surprises and the momentum build up But hmm at the movie they decided to let Mr. Langdon just literally say it on so many occasions Like just after 30 mins or so into the movie when he tills Sophie that her grand father was preparing her with all the puzzles and games hmmm (very insightful and intelligent), they actually almost destroyed all elements of surprise <br/><br/>then again when they arrive at the chapel and ( oh crap ) they easily magically find the place where the grail was ( where was that on the book ) as naïve as movies can get Langdon looks at the newspaper and discovers that hmm her grand father wasn't really her grand father ( hmmm yeah ) WHY ) what benefit the movie gained by twisting the story at this point ( hmm absolutely none ) then a disaster < Langdon again with a drawing on the wall finds out and till Sophie that she's Jesus descendant ( on another word grand daughter ) again whyyyyyyyyy even if the book hinted it , it wasn't ever meant to be literally announced ( I find it very dumb ) when I 1st read the book I knew that what ever was Dan browns believe or findings , the book wasn't about then , even though he hinted some of it , but the book was pure thriller and a great fiction Oh will I need not to go any further I hate to say this ( as a great fan of the book ) but Dan browns da'vinci code was an amazing journey adventure and its no where to be found on Ron Howard's movie <br/><br/>I believe 6 is fair enough rating for it"

","The Da Vinci Code/2006/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: Tom Hanks Ian McKellen Paul Bettany Audrey Tautou Jean Reno Alfred Molina<br/><br/>Every single person in the United States knows that this film has caused more controversy than any film in decades and decades. I don't listen to one word those people say. They might as well shut it because no one is listening to them and if anyone is listening to the people who waste their breath they're in the crowds shouting like lunatics like all the others. I think the unnecessary ranting and raving should stop because now it's just getting ridiculous. ""IT'S BLASPHEMY! DON'T BELIEVE ONE WORD OF IT! DON'T SEE IT OR YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL IN BURN IN ITS FIRING, EVIL DEPTHS!"" the overly-melodramatic people roar. I will have to say for the sixth trillionth time, it's FICTION! Do NOT blame Dan Brown or Ron Howard, one of THE BEST directors of all time besides Spielberg and don't blame the actors either or the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman who does wonderful scriptwriting for several Howard films. I also have discussed the film with three of my teachers and they all believe it is FICTION and should really be left alone and not be insulted the way it is. No, when I talked to the teachers, they said they hadn't seen it yet but they are planning on it. So even the TRUE CATHOLIC SCHOOL teachers aren't making as big a deal about it as much as these extremely annoying protesters that are really starting to get on my last nerves. But yet I tell a few students that I had seen the film and they gasp and say it is against our religion. Is it? Yes. Is it FICTION? YES! It shouldn't be offending the Catholic Church or our Lord. You know why? Because it wasn't us that thought of the theory. It was Da Vinci who thought that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and had a child and that the famous painting The Last Supper proved it. All the movie is is a fiction. A fiction with fictional characters and crisis<br/><br/>THE FILM: The film was far-fetched and entertaining at the same time as was the great National Treasure which I thought was much better than what the critics thought. It contained a murder mystery and also contained a few secrets which I obviously will not reveal The murder mystery was an old man that supposedly had to tell an albino (Paul Bettany) this information that is later explained in the film. The albino is part of the religious membership Opus Dei which is another religious group besides others that are mentioned in the film. Opus Dei also includes French actor Jean Reno playing the captain named Captain Fache. It also includes a bishop named Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina) who also seems to be part of the Opus Dei scheme. Opus Dei seems to be portrayed as the criminal group here or at least in my eyes it is because it tries to seize the Priory of Sion's secret which is a secret religious organization. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is the one to solve the murder mystery. The ones that find the body pick Langdon because they think he is an expert on examining religious symbols. He is a quite impressive symbologist! His photographic memory also comes in handy during the investigation. Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) is the woman who is gifted with wonderful experience in cryptology and who also is the woman who joins forces with Langdon with this murder mystery. The symbols and codes they find and try to find lead up to the Priory of Sion and what it is. And unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher puzzle in time everything will be pretty much be lost. And that's not good. So it kept you going with intense, preposterous scenes and even some humor from which you wouldn't expect it from, Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing. He was a very interesting character that seemed very wise and yet it was a surprising end that involved him but obviously it is not fair to tell unless you've already read the book. The reason why I'm not making this movie review as long as some of the others I write is because most of the film is secret so if I say too much you have just been told a secret from the film and you will blame me for spoiling the film for you. My lips and words are shut about the film's story now. The movie was not excellent but it was not stupid either as some of the anti-'Da Vinci' think. I thought it was good and Ron Howard, as I said in my Cinderella Man review, is becoming better and better and will soon be the Steven Spielberg of film. Movie directed by Ron Howard."
"mamakin987","7","0","2","22 May 2006"," The movie was exceptionally cast.....except for the director.
","Having read the book twice, once around when it came out, and then again when i bought the paperback, i thoroughly enjoyed the book. I loved the characters, the plot, the time line it followed, everything. The movie, I can't really say the same. I thought it was a decent adaptation, though there were a few glaring omissions that would have made it much better, and a couple characters who's parts were drastically reduced who were larger characters in the book. Though the characters in the movie i found were cast very well. Though i would have liked to see someone else as Langdon, i thought Tom Hanks did quite well, as he always does. Audrey Tatou(sorry if i butchered her name)I found did very well as Sophie, and never have seeing her act before, i thought she did very well. Paul Bettany was impeccable as the misled Silas. I thought Aringarosa could have had a larger part, and how they twisted his storyline i did not like, though Alfred Molina did well with what he had. And what can i say about Ian McKellan that hasn't been said before, this man can do no wrong. He always takes what he is given and makes it his own. His scenes were the funniest, and truly got the character.<br/><br/>The only part cast that i had qualms with was the director, Ron Howard. Why would they give this highly controversial(whether you believe it or not)story to him. This man makes family movies. He washes down what he can to make it less a controversy so that it panders to everyone. I felt that just about anyone, including Lucas could have given this story a better treatment. My choice would have been Scorcese(again, sorry for butchering the name)to direct given his record for making ""His"" movie, not the ""Studio"" movie. Even Roman Polanski could have done well, and would have had no problem directing in France, though England would have been problematic.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was decent for an adaptation, i wouldn't recommend it for a night movie, don't waste the 10 to 12 dollars, see the matinée."
"mrliteral","3","0","3","22 May 2006"," Boy is this movie dumb
","Putting aside any religious reference and only looking at the movie, nothing had anything to do with anything. Langdon is supposedly an expert on religious symbols, but that hardly comes into play. He spends most of the movie following other character's leads and looking sedated. I like Tom Hanks but what was he doing? Didn't seem like he was acting as much as simply being on camera.<br/><br/>We've got a psychopathic masochistic killer albino monk. That's three adjectives too many for one character. It doesn't give him depth; it gives him too many scenes without plot relevance. There are flashes of flashbacks for him and for others that only serve to show parts of the characters the rest of the story couldn't figure out how to get across.<br/><br/>They're chased on suspicion of murder without evidence. They have intimate knowledge of every obscure religious reference they happen to need. Despite making it incredibly easy to find or entrap them, they always get away. There are clues that could mean anything but always happen to mean exactly what they think it does, except when they guess wrong the first time and realize it later. It's just dumb storytelling. They also never eat or change their clothes or use the bathroom, but one can't fault the movie too much for that. A lot of movies are the same way.<br/><br/>Then there's the supposed religious aspect to the story. That made less sense than anything else. How anyone would find this blasphemous instead of ludicrous is beyond me. The controversy seems to be about the idea Christ was not what the church claimed. I think they would find it much more offensive that the church, as depicted in the movie, has spent centuries killing anyone who tries to disprove that divinity. Because what sense would that make? The church doesn't want anyone to know their belief is a lie? Why? So they'll keep donating to the church? And if you don't we'll kill you? That's the stupidest thing I've heard this week!<br/><br/>I could understand a religious organization's objection to any attempt to sway the beliefs of its followers. However, if the attempt is to show proof, of which said organization is aware, that those beliefs are false...I don't get it. We know we're wrong but we'll kill anyone who tries to prove it? That doesn't make any sense. If there was actually proof they were wrong, they'd find another way to claim they were right, and deny the credibility of the evidence. They wouldn't spend two millennia killing everyone who came in contact with the proof.<br/><br/>And as for the proof, within the logic of the movie, there really isn't any. There's a lot of information and conjecture and assumption, but no proof. Even if they prove the one thing they're trying to, that still doesn't discount the initial religious claims. It just tells a different story.<br/><br/>I can't be more specific without giving things away, but there's no point. A lot of little moments in the trailer tell you all sorts of things you're not supposed to have figured out. And whenever someone or something turned out not to be what they or it appeared, it was fairly obvious, but it still didn't matter because even though I knew who was supposed to be good or bad, I couldn't tell why. I had no idea why anyone was doing anything they did or had others do for them. Totally unmotivated. Some things are explained in a throw-away manner, but that's simplistic motivation, not explanatory. ""I did this because of this."" It's a reason but it's not defined.<br/><br/>A stupid movie with nothing of interest or any moment of solid entertainment. One guy in the theater snored through most of Ian McKellen's big scene with The Last Supper, which was actually pretty dull and wholly uninformative, not to mention meaningless. No I wasn't the guy snoring. I do snore occasionally, but I don't sleep through movies.<br/><br/>DaVinci hardly has anything to do with this movie. It's called his code but there was almost nothing shown of his works that came from him with the purpose of mystery or hidden truth. Slightly more was done by someone else in reference to his work, but only as a point of reference. I can say that, without giving anything away, somebody leaves something for someone else behind one of his paintings, and writes in blood on the floor and the window in front of the Mona Lisa. Just a location. DaVinci himself did almost nothing to contribute to the mystery. It has nothing to do with him. If you want a fun movie about the intricate mystery of DaVinci's work and inventions, go rent Hudson Hawk. It's a lot more entertaining. It's even more realistic, and if you've seen Hudson Hawk...it ain't realistic. But it is funny.<br/><br/>The only truly enjoyable part of the movie was that Audrey Tautou always looked cute. I don't mean to sound like a dumb guy in saying that, but seriously...I didn't like the photography, the music annoyed me, none of the actors looked all that thrilled to be there...even she didn't seem interested in the story. But she still looked cute. For whatever that's worth.<br/><br/>The financial success of the movie, however ridiculous that is, probably means we'll see another Dan Brown adaptation within a couple years. Having read a pair of his paperbacks before DaVinci first hit the shelves, I can honestly say I am not looking forward the promotion of another crapfest."

","In the few days before seeing the Da Vinci Code, I had heard nothing but bad things about it. Critics found it a bore, a jumbled mess, and too slow for a film such as this. Going in I expected the critics to be wrong, like they usually are to my judgment. Well, they were a little right.<br/><br/>Halfway through the movie i began saying, wow, when will this end? Ironically enough i was basically praying for it to end, it just moved so slow. I'm sure Ron Howard had a reason for this, but I don't know what it was. the film could have easily been 30-45 minutes shorter and it would have only helped. However, even with its slow pace there's really nothing it could use to cut.<br/><br/>Along with the length i noticed all the supposedly big twists were either easy to predict or not as big as they wanted. One of them i was even sure they had figured out, because they'd said it earlier in the movie, i was certain. Then they revealed it at the end, and i was surprised only because they were just BARELY revealing it.<br/><br/>It wasn't necessarily a bad movie. Being a catholic, i wasn't offended (though i was shaking my head almost laughing at some parts). And the acting was top notch, just what you'd expect in a film by Ron Howard. If you can finish the movie without giving up on it because it seemed so slow, it was still a good movie. nothing great, but oh well."

I remember after I read it I said ""This would make a great movie!"".<br/><br/>Ron Howard's directing was no doubt worse than Dan Brown's writing, but it wasn't unbearable, it could've been a lot better. The acting from Ian Mckellen was superb, same goes with Tom Hanks. But the plot in the movie was not informative enough, and too much was left out.

The jokes that were cracked were ridiculously cliché and a lot of the Langdon/Neveu characters are not explained. Not only was it not entertaining, the plot line seemed overly dramatized and nothing seemed genuine.

"techcrw421","7","0","2","22 May 2006"," a good film, not as good if you have read the novel
","For the record I did read the book before viewing the movie but I will try to abstain from making this review an essay comparing the movie to the book.<br/><br/>First the acting, overall the actors did a fine job, however there was some room for improvement. I did particularly like the part of Ian McKellan as Sir Leigh Teabing. I thought that Audrey Tautou could have brought more the character of Sophie Neveu, there seemed to be an overall lack of chemistry between the characters of Sophie and Robert. When I first heard that Tom Hanks was picked for the lead role of Robert Langdon I was surprised, but after viewing the film I have changed my thinking, his character was very well played. Jean Reno was perfectly casted as Bezu Fache and Paul Bettany could not have been a better choice for Silas.<br/><br/>I did have a few issues with the screenplay, especially the fact that the movie reveals secrets far before it needs too, particularly when revealing one of the main villains. The film at points used flashbacks to explain historical data and personal backgrounds, but at a point they sometimes revealed information that would have been better if just spoken in dialog.<br/><br/>The film visually was very well done particularly the scenes that take place in the Louve and in the home of Ian McKellan's character Leigh Teabing. For instance visual elements were added when in the book it was simply spoken by the characters.<br/><br/>Now for the book-to-movie comparisons. As with any film based off a book cuts had to be made from the story to fit it all on screen, however with this film the screenwriters added elements to the story that were in no way alluded to in the original novel. I will not give too much detail on these changes but let me just comment that some of them were made in what appeared to be an attempt to cause more controversy particularly with the role of the catholic church. The film changed several major plot points that Dan Brown originally wrote, I believe some of those changes took away from the story.<br/><br/>Overall the film on its own does very well, had I not read the book before seeing the movie I would have thought that this makes a good mystery story, and I most likely would have been more interested in reading the original novel. However, those who have read the book upon seeing the movie might have several questions about the plot changes."

There was not enough happening, the book seemed to hold your hand and drag you through the quest... the movie felt like it needed a push here and a shove there and it wasn't as breathtaking as the book, nor was it faithful to it. The only thing that i enjoyed was the brilliant visual explanations of gadgets and flashbacks.<br/><br/>I've seen tom hanks do better, i've seen Sir Ian do better too, Audrey Tautou did well, she seemed to be as shocked as i was by the whole thing. Paul Bettany, did a FANTASTIC job! The script writers decided to slash out bits that kind of killed the movie for me. But they added things like the close up of ""THE LAST SUPPER"" where Mary Magdelene is moved away from Peter and seems to be resting her head on Jesus' shoulder! That was amazing stuff!

Harrison Ford could have played the part of Robert Langdon but could have been even more wooden than Tom Hanks (at least Tom Hanks remembers to smile now and again).<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou was terrible, not sure if Sophie Marceau or Virginie Ledoyen would have pulled it off either...<br/><br/>I give it 5 or 6 out of ten for entertainment.<br/><br/>Just keep your expectations low and you may enjoy the ride."

The direction and photography are excellent. The sights of London and Paris are a visual treat for somebody who has not visited those places. The movie moves at a satisfactory pace - not to slow to test your patience, nor too fast to leave you baffled.<br/><br/>The only minor disappointment is in form of Tom Hanks, as his character does not demand any extraordinary acting abilities.

Each minute detail was paid attention to in the most extraordinary way. At no time during this film was I bored or restless. It's impossible to take your eyes away for even a moment.

","I have no idea why Hollywood is so afraid to write a straight adaptation from book to film (it works for Harry Potter), but they seem to feel the need to change a bunch of things that made the book great. In this case, the Da Vinci Code was a wonderfully written book (setting aside religious arguments for others to fight). But Ron Howard removed scenes that would have made the movie better, added scenes that either didn't make sense or slowed the movie down (the most egregious toward the end of the movie) and all in all made an exciting book boring. This is of no fault to the visuals, which were stunning to say the least, and were really the only thing that lived up to the book. But the screenplay was bad, the editing a bit abrupt and the cast's performance, with some exception to Ian McKellen, were as flat as flat can be. I just felt that a movie based on a book this well written, with this much hype, with a cast this great, with a director this acclaimed and especially with a budget this huge should have been far far better than it was."

","It is difficult to translate a book into a movie. It is even more difficult to adopt a very popular novel that almost everyone heard about or read. High public expectations do not simplify that process either. For me personally, the book was a clear winner, a page turner, a great adventure. Movie, in turn, was a dull, slow going, yawn-generating compressed adaptation. Honestly, I did not care for it at all. Having such important issues at stake as religion and the genesis of Christianity (never mind imaginary), a director could have made a very powerful story of the Da Vinci Code. Instead, Ron Howard created a very toned-down, more restrained, politically correct movie where the dynamics of the book are really not felt at all. Despite its 2 and a half hour runtime, it felt like events were rushed one on top of the other, the story was not developed, things were barely explained. I think that overall this movie was a very poor representation of the book."

","I succumbed a month ago to buy the Da Vinci Code book and I was pleasantly surprised to find a cleverly thought out book merging fact with fiction to produce a damn good story. However, the film was sadly lacking for me as it skipped over some of the more interesting parts of the book. Obviously a film can never fully recreate every thought mentioned in the book, but there were obvious omissions which could have easily been included. (I am awaiting the DVD Director's cut edition to see if they made the cutting room floor!) The supporting cast were superb, and not something that I had obviously noticed in other films - maybe because Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were a little disjointed together I noticed it more. Jean Reno as the 'Bull' Fache was particularly good. Without reading the book first, however, I think that viewers would have really enjoyed it as a light thriller with excellent locations and wonderful trick photography - Newton's funeral cortège for one was brilliant and brought me out in goosebumps. My husband is now reading the book AFTER seeing the film and he is now agreeing, although he did enjoy the film more than me! A few moments when I jumped or cringed kept me on my toes though, so overall not bad but could do better."

","When watching this movie the first thing I noticed was the almost total change in the character of Robert Langdon. His character was watered down simply to put a skeptic about the ""true"" grail in the movie. It renders any legitimate connection to Sophie ridiculous and creates the effect of no chemistry between the two leads (which may or may not be true). Particularly horrendous was the changing of the bishop's part to 'evil bishop plotting to destroy the grail and kill all those involved.' This is extremely unfaithful to the story and creates a very watered down version of the book which is made more ""safe"" for Christian audiences. It is appalling how changes like this were probably necessary because Americans cannot be free thinkers and instead must ban ""heredical"" thought.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the book I would recommend going to see the movie.

I mean you can't expect anything less from Tom Hanks. Another negative in the movie is all the French subtitles you have to read. In the book there are only bits and pieces of French. But in the movie you have to actually read a whole conversation in French and then it switchs back to talking in English, which I felt was very distracting.

It must be fans of MacGyver, desperate to see more of the same since Richard Dean Anderson moved on to Stargate-SG1. I went to see this film with low expectations, but even these were not met by this-made-for-TV adaptation. The production as a whole seemed rather pedestrian, both writing and acting were, for the most part, poor. The cinematography wasn't the greatest, there was never a sense of foreboding no matter how many dimly lit churches the characters entered. As for the plot, which apparently makes up for everything else, I lost track of the number of anagrams,cyphers and other examples of word play and it soon became tedious. They may keep you interested when you're reading the book, but they fail to do so on screen, especially when Langdon seems to solve them so quickly only to move onto the next. I'd agree that a cryptic crossword is an engaging, thought provoking source of entertainment. But you can't seriously watch someone else solving one (being fed the answers) and say it's thought provoking. Nor is it thrilling or exciting ""I need to get to a library fast"". Especially when the ""crossword"" has been set by Dan Brown (the non-thinkers Umberto Eco). Being an atheist myself this kind of conspiracy theory should pander to my lack of belief in the divinity of Christ and the power of the Catholic Church. But it's all based on factoids and the writer's own machinations. The way Teabing glosses over the fact that the Priory of Sion was the brain child of Pierre Plantard (a hoaxer who believed he was a direct descendant of the Merovignian Kings) with ""That's what THEY want you to believe"" is a perfect example. I fail to see how it can be so readily accepted as the truth behind a religious conspiracy. After all ""History is the search for fact NOT truth""."

"loveandrevolutions","3","0","4","22 May 2006"," The Da Vinci Catastrophe.
","Films rarely fit the viewers' expectations of the books, and then there are films like The Da Vinci Code. Dan Brown's novel should never have been made into a film. First of all, in the novel, the story paces itself well, keeps up the suspense for the reader, and explains its theories in detail and clearly. When converted into a film, the story dilutes itself and the pacing falls short of anything remotely exciting or suspenseful due to the interlacing explanations. Secondly, Brown's novel is plot-driven, not character-driven, so when transferred on to the big screen, Tom Hanks and Company have little to do but recount theories, stories, and throw out clues for the viewers. While the film does stick to the novel (for the most part), it cuts out quite a bit of details that may confuse someone who has never read the book before (I went with someone who hadn't). The script should have included more suspenseful and thrilling scenes, but it ends up taking itself way too seriously and kills any potential thrills. For example, even the potentially awesome scene of Sophie driving backwards through the streets of Paris was ridiculously botched by shaky camera work and lack of focus.<br/><br/>As for the actors' performances... The people who really walked away winning from this film were definitely Paul Bettany and Sir Ian McKellan. Bettany is absolutely brilliant in his supporting role as the albino Silas. His performance really outshines everyone else in the film, including the King of Kings in Hollywood - Tom Hanks. McKellan was blessed with the few funnier lines in the script, which is mostly why his character really shines through. However, much credit must be given to his impeccable timing in dialogue. Tom Hanks, though a brilliant actor, falls short of anything incredible in this film. He goes through the entire film (the whole whopping 2.5 hrs) with a constipated look on his face and very little creativity. However, I think that is largely due to the fact that Brown's novel lacked greatly in character development to begin with, so it's not really Hanks' fault. Audrey Tautou -- looking absolutely sexy in this film -- has her moments of high-level performances (i.e. the scene where she confronts Silas in Teabing's jet), but overall, like Hanks, has little room for character development. Fortunately, being the eye-candy of the film, she generally alleviated much of the intense and overly serious atmosphere. Tautou and Hanks did all they could with what they had, so I don't blame them for their lackluster performances. After all, both are obviously highly qualified actors. The end product of the Hanks-Tautou partnership becomes two people running around on screen recounting the legend of the Holy Grail and shooting at or being shot by people. Even more unfortunate is the fact that they have zero chemistry.<br/><br/>Finally, I also want to make a note that the last 10 minutes of the film was completely unnecessary and over-the-top C-O-R-N-Y. Overall, I was quite disappointed and bored with this film. The pacing was horrible, the acting was stiff, and basically, it was a poorly-presented story. However, I will admit that Ron Howard did all he could with it because frankly, I don't think this novel should have been adapted into a film in the first place."
"mlong2","6","0","4","22 May 2006"," The wrong man for the job
","It's obvious after seeing The Da Vinci Code that Ron Howard was the wrong man for the job. He just doesn't have a feel for the material. This is obvious from his casting choices. Tom Hanks is all wrong for Robert Langdon, never really understanding the character he is playing, the same for Audrey Tautou. The sense of urgency that made the book such a page turner is totally absent. That said, there are some good things, most especially Paul Bettany who captures the savagery, blind devotion and anguish of Silas, and Ian McKellan as Leigh Teabing who chews up the scenery as only a great English thespian can. And despite the two and a half hour running time, I was never truly bored, but I must admit I do love a good conspiracy theory so all the details didn't bore me. Still I do think there may have been a more imaginative way of conveying the information to a visual medium. Think of what someone like Spielberg could have done with this material. Maybe in 15 or 20 years a remake will be produced by a director who better understands the material. It's been known to happen (think ""Lord of the Rings"" 1978). Until then, and as someone once said, the book remains after all."
"bmcdannell","8","0","1","22 May 2006"," A Visual Cliff's Notes
","I took the time to read a sampling of other reviews here, spanning the entire range, before writing mine. While none of them changed my opinion, many reinforced what I had already guessed I would find, which was: (a) Most (not all) of those who pan the movie had not read the book. I can understand this. My wife (read it 3 times so far) and I (read it once) agreed that if you had not read the book you might have a difficult time following or even wanting to follow the movie.<br/><br/>(b) Many of the bad reviews mention long periods of exposition. However, this is not only necessary in order to competently bring the book's plot to screen, but it is also faithful to the book, which contains much lengthy exposition.<br/><br/>(c) Many of the bad reviews - those from people who did read the book - complain about so much being left out or abridged in the movie. People, there is simply no way to cram a complete novel into a 2.5 hour movie. Deal with it.<br/><br/>(d) Other reviews, both good and bad, focus on the controversy or the plausibility of the plot, and certainly the media have gone bonkers over the religious implications and have gone to great lengths to dig up various spokespeople who are more than willing to froth at the mouth in front of a camera over this sacrilege or that blasphemy. Can we all please remember that the book is a work of fiction, does not pretend to be anything other than a work of fiction and, as a work of fiction, is an enjoyable and provocative romp? In case you're wondering, my own perspective here is that of a former clergy member (as is my wife). Ease up, folks.<br/><br/>As to our actual review, we both thought the movie was extremely well done, tremendously faithful to the novel, and we had a difficult time imagining that it could have been done any better while remaining true to its source. Given the time constraints of a movie, pretty much everything you could have expected to be there was there. We could think of three instances where there were noticeable plot alterations and in each instance the alteration served the purpose of condensing plot elements in order to suit the movie time frame. In our view, this is perfectly acceptable.<br/><br/>In our opinion (seemingly supported by many of the reviews here) you won't really appreciate this movie unless you've read the book first. You also won't particularly enjoy it (or the book, for that matter) if you insist that all plot elements must be plausible. My title for this review may seem like a bit of a dig, but it really isn't. About halfway through the movie, my wife remarked that she was a bit perturbed by the fact that, while so much of what she was seeing was what she had imagined in her mind's eye as she read the book, many of the characters had different faces than what she had envisioned. We both quickly realized that this was actually a tremendous compliment to the filmmakers, and was how we both perceived the movie. It was as if Mr. Howard et al had shared our personal visions, from actions to ambiance, and had succeeded in bringing this to the screen. Small quibble, then, that some of the faces didn't quite match our own imaginations.<br/><br/>If you've read the book and can be realistic in your expectations of how a novel can be translated to screen, we highly recommend this film. If you haven't read the book, we highly recommend you do so before you see the film. If you insist on taking any of it seriously, you might as well take a pass on both - and try lightening up a bit."

I swear, I was thinking: ""I should buy a BMW. They look great!"" and ""I'd like to come out of a Rolls Royce like that at my wedding."" The story? I didn't care.<br/><br/>The code? Big Whoop. If you can't figure it out in 20 minutes or less at the beginning of the picture, I feel sorry for you. I did 'nod' off at a few points, but lucky for me, got jolted awake by the audience laughing.<br/><br/>Tom, Audrey, Jean, Albert, Jurgen and Sir Ian did what they could with what they had. Sadly, I didn't get any build up of suspense, intrigue, international espionage and the questionable dealings of the ""church"". I got a tad bit of this -- and a tad bit of that but I felt like I was eating fast food....Satisfying for a moment but not very filling and the calories complied on me later are sinful for taking such an indulgence.<br/><br/>And yes, like many other comments I read, I sat there thinking, ""Who could have done a better job directing this?"" John Woo? David Lynch? No, my choice was definitely Darren Afonsky -- but any of those named above would have had you on the edge of your seat with their interpretation and view of the book. I found this two and a half hours of a film that just doesn't live up to all the hype.<br/><br/>It's not fair to call this a ""stinker""..but it isn't a blockbuster of entertainment either. But....just to stay awake...I did have a gas humming tunes from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" in my theater chair - clearly a better film on just a part of this issue."

","I did not read the book, so I am not one of those people who compare movies to books. I knew nothing about the book, characters, or story. So I am judging this movie solely on what's on the screen. I found the whole movie difficult to follow and extremely confusing. I lost track of the characters and did not believe the story logic. This is one of Ron Howard's worst directed film. He cut scenes everywhere. If two people were talking, he would cut between them. If someone picked up a glass of water---bamm! closeup of hand picking up water then cut to a closeup of person drinking water.<br/><br/>Subtitles were overdone. Sometimes there would be something on the screen we were supposed to pay close attention to, but unfortunately was distracted from because we were supposed to read the subtitles! The actress who played the lead french girl was annoying beyond belief. Her whiny french accent became unbearable.<br/><br/>I know this film was fiction, and I am sure most people know that. But I can understand why (and I am not a religious person) the church does not like this film. It unfairly puts the church down with theories that some people might think are based on real theories. I gave this movie a 3 rating but in my heart I would like to give it a 0."

","Negative reviews of this film have more to do with critics fear of the religious right than any minor flaws this movie has. Is 'Da Vinci Code' a great film? Probably not, but it's a darn good film and Ron Howard stays very close to the source materials in the major points and while it relies on a great deal of actual history for elements of its back story it never claims to be anything more than a work of fiction. All performances are solid, the pacing allows for character and story development and the action pieces are exciting with out stretching believability too far. If Catholics and other Christians could accept 'The Passion' as authentic despite its reliance on works outside the Gospels and its overwhelming antisemitism then they have nothing to complain about in a movie that never attacks Jesus. As far as Albino's complaints, they do get used a lot as villains in cinema and 'Powder' hardly makes up for a stereotype based only on their skin."

Howard is remarkably faithful to the book but does no more, and as the book can not be regarded as a particularly ""good"" book  a somewhat poorly written adventure essentially, the movie itself is exactly that  a slow, visually bland adventure. More effect should have been taken to make the film ACTUALLY interesting instead of a visual form of the novel.<br/><br/>That's not to say the film is bad, it just lacks imagination. Everything in this film is just plain average, the acting specifically where Hanks attempts a lackluster performance that comes off as forced and Tautou who seems more concerned at speaking in English than actually acting.<br/><br/>No doubt this film will be a box office success with the 60 million fans that have read the book, and some would find that great to great out this ""truth"".

","Having been amongst the many who had read and loved The Da Vinci Code, I wasn't sure what to expect from the movie. I had heard the stories about people walking out but I wanted to see for myself if it was really that awful. The answer is, in short, it is not that bad. If you expect it to live up to the hype and the precedent set by the book, you will be disappointed. If you go in with minimal expectations expecting a typical Hollywood thriller, you will probably enjoy yourself. Readers of the book will really notice how much is missed out in the film. This may be simply due to the restrictions of the medium, as the pages of explanation of different symbols, ideas and theories are probably not easily adapted to the screen. This makes the storyline lack depth and appear superficial. The movie does not stand alone well and will be enjoyed the most by those who have knowledge of the background detail supplied by the book. Cinematically, it is enjoyable as the shots are beautiful but there is a lot of superimposing of images that are supposed to represent Langdon's thought processes as he solves puzzles which just get annoying and serve only to demonstrate the very large budget the film obviously had. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks does better than expected, but he lacks the intelligent charisma required by the character of Langdon. Audrey Tautou is sweet and charming as Sophie, but there is no chemistry between her and Hanks' Langdon and their relationship seems more father-daughter than anything else. The strongest performances are by Jean Reno as Captain Fache and Paul Bettany as Silas."

","I watched DaVinci earlier today, and omg what a big waste of money IMO. It was laughable, and that's with pity. The facts that led to the whole theory that Jesus had a bloodline were basically forgotten, they weren't laid out like the book did. I tried to block all knowledge I had from the book, but it was hard to follow what was going on without going back to it. I had to constantly explain to my friend why things were (she was my test subject) happening.<br/><br/>And for chrissake there was even no mention of the golden ratio (being the math geek that I am), nada!! 1.1618....the only math mention was the Fibonacci sequence, which wasn't even explained!! Now how many people know exactly what the Fibonacci sequence is, and its relation to Phi? Plus points though to the casting of the guy who played Silas, Paul Bettany. Although his hair isn't really white, it looked good on him. Also plus points for choosing Audrey Tautou for Sophie.<br/><br/>Speaking of Sophie, apparently all she was was a doll. Of course we all know that she's the last descendant, but that doesn't mean you leave all the figuring out to Robert. What's the freaking point that she's a cryptologist? And not once did she mention grand-pére, which she does a lot of times in the book. Not that it matters, I just think they totally changed her character.<br/><br/>Finally, Robert Langdon, played by no longer suave Tom Hanks. Nicely acted yeah, but there's something missing. There's no charisma to his character, he's boring, he's not the Robert Langdon who was introduced to me in the book, he's not convincing me that what he's saying is true. Oh and he has ""near-photographic memory,"" which was shown by floating images that sparkle and shine....oooohhh....the letters in the anagrams are shining and floating.

","My biggest problem with the film was the plot holes, most of which were motivational.<br/><br/>While the curator was running around thinking of complex codes, writing arcane rhymes (in a foreign language no less), stripping his clothes off, smearing himself with little-known religious symbols in his own blood and visiting the Mona Lisa and the Madonna of the Rocks for one last look and to drip some sanguine clues.... Wouldn't he have had the time to get himself some first aid, and maybe live? It was a rather herculean task for a dying man.<br/><br/>Teabing naturally as an expert and the mastermind of the entire plot would have wanted Langdon to come to him. But Teabing never really laid a fail-safe trail straight to him. Sophie and Langdon never would have found him if Langdon hadn't thought to call in an expert.<br/><br/>Fache was the most inept cop since Inspector Clouzeau. He had multiple opportunities to capture Langdon and Sophie, and let them slip through his fingers by falling for ruses anyone with a brain would have figured out.<br/><br/>Remy, the manservant, was not to be trusted from the beginning, and the direction made it obvious. But why go through all the rigamarole of him staying in the car to guard Silas when they were in cahoots with Teabing?<br/><br/>Aringarosa's character was completely inconsistent.<br/><br/>What was Vernet's motivation for stopping the truck? It would have made more sense for him to simply deliver them to Teabing.<br/><br/>All in all, it was well acted and the dialogue was good. Overall, I enjoyed it.

"jtimmerman327","7","0","2","21 May 2006"," Still don't know what to think
","Like the majority of the world, I read the book, and loved it. The beauty of the book was contained in the shock of discovering things as Langdon did. Heading into the movie, I knew all of these things and knew all the secrets of The Da Vinci code. For example, I knew Teabing was the teacher and I knew that Sophie was the blood line of Christ and all that. It's impossible for me to review a suspense story such as this because the shocking revelations that occurred in the book simply weren't shocking in the film.<br/><br/>That being said, I also don't think some things were presented to be as shocking as they were in the book. Especially the opening sequence in the Louvre. When Langdon cracks the codes in the beginning of the book, it is one of the most exciting points of the story. However the movie takes a while to get into its stride, a Ron Howard trait. Once it gets going, it is a decent film, nothing remarkable, but not terrible.<br/><br/>The casting was okay. Jean Reno, Paul Bettany, Ian McKellan, and Audrey Tattou are great in their roles. And Tom Hanks is great too, I mean he's Tom Hanks, he's never bad. I just didn't like the choice of him for Langdon when I heard it, and Hanks simply isn't what I feel that most people had in mind when they pictured the professor in their head. This is obviously opinion, but with such a STORY-based film, it seems to help when there are no huge name actors involved (Star Wars is prime example) and having perhaps the biggest actor in Hollywood in this film brings the viewer away from the story somewhat.<br/><br/>And finally, it is sadly a Ron Howard film. He's not really great at suspense. Good director, works well with high priced actors and big budgets, I guess that's why he was chosen, but I would have liked to see a director with a talent for suspense and darkness take this on, it would have made it much more enjoyable."

It looked nice at times, but there were instances when I asked myself ""what is that shot doing in there?"" There were times when I snickered at the delivery of lines, but nothing like the reports from Cannes. The actors did an adequate job. Ian McKellan was absolutely wonderful as always, and his scenes were by far the best of the whole film.<br/><br/>However, it did feel like the whole thing was a bit thrown together. It's hard to put my finger on it, but the narrative flow of the film, the fact that it often felt very linear despite the many 'plot twists,' and the fact that it never really had the mystery of a thriller, left me wondering ""what is all the fuss about?"" This could be a screenplay problem, or a directing problem - I suspect it's a combination of both.<br/><br/>Go see it if you're at all curious about this movie - it was worth the 2.5 hours and the price.

The movie talks about the hidden truth of Christianity and what the real significance of the shadyness of the catholic church. The story is historical fiction with some truth to it. Robert Langdon is a symbologist hired by the french police to decipher some symbols found on the dead body of curator of the Louvre. He meets Sophie and they begin on an epic journey to discover the secret of Christianity through piecing together clues from Da Vinci's paintings. This sends off on an chase and hunt throughout Europe to discover the truth hidden from the world for over 2000 years. But however they are being tracked by a mysterious cloaked man named Silas who tries to prevent them from discovering it. None of these characters are real. This does not that the Da Vinci Code is totally false. There is a Priory of Sion organization that existed thousands of years ago. There could be a possibility that this movie could have some truth to it. Overall i give this movie a 7 because i love religious movies and i like Ron Howard and Tom Hanks so i think that they did a good job on this movie.

","This movie is disappointing. I am a huge fan of the book and was so excited to see this movie. I understand that they couldn't fit all of it in there but why did they change what they could fit in there. The first half was okay, but the second half ( which was the best part of the book) was changed and was almost a completely different story. The Suspense of the book was left out of the movie. The revealing of the Teacher was completely not as anticipated in the movie. I feel embarrassed for the people who have not read the book and saw the movie because I feel like they are like "" this is what we have missed out on"" The people who have not read the book are robbed out of hearing this great story. I feel like I have been slapped in the face. Why Dan Brown would let them get away with this, I don't know but I am very disappointed that he let this happen. I am also disappointed in Ron Howard, whom I was a big fan of before this. This is a very disappointing movie to the fans of the book!!!!"

Mix that with religion and you get this movie... the ""ease"" at which he figured out puzzles reminded me of Bruce Willis in The Fifth Element. Who would have guessed that ""Magneto"" (Ian McKellen) would have been the bad guy in all this? OK, maybe you wouldn't see that coming, but when it happens, there's no surprise. The plot was pretty good and not overly predictable. I also expect people to destroy the glass pyramid thingy (Pyramide du Louvre) in the end to look for Jesus' wife, people are crazy and often can't tell fact from fiction, movie from reality. There are some things that would make the open-minded think, ""yes, this could be possible"". I'm sure it will offend some people, and those kinds of people should stay home in their closets. Like I said, it's a decent flick, go see it."

If you have not read the book just make sure that you pay attention to the dialogue, if your mind wanders for a minute or two you may miss something important (which I suspect was the problem the critics made, ie, did not pay attention therefore lost the plot).<br/><br/>Definitely worth a second viewing, and will add to my DVD collection when it is released on DVD."

Not one lets us down. The two primary leads do well, although I had the feeling that Hanks wasn't comfortable, and the chemistry between he and Tautou didn't come off in my opinion. But, as I said, each played their parts well.<br/><br/>Those that have read the book, I would say that you will enjoy the film, but do keep in mind that such a long novel cannot carry the whole story to the silver screen.

","We came to a general consensus that we all enjoyed the movie pretty well. My wife especially seemed to enjoy it. We both enjoyed it for the same reasons I enjoyed the Angels and Demons book. It does a good job of undermining the Catholic power base and contrary to what anyone will tell you it is actually pretty factual. The events described were far closer to the truth than anything the church would have one believe. For me the movie, like the Angel and Demons book, was puerile in its overuse of meaningless symbology, stuff I outgrew when I was 13 or 14. Arcane , bizarre combinations of numbers and obscure references that some poor soul scribbles in blood as he is dying - give me a break please. I only add this as my contribution to what I didn't enjoy about the movie and why I rate it lower than an 8 or a 9. Why would ANY person write anything backwards in mirror writing - just to make it harder to read ?. Like I say - things I did when I was first in grammar school and got a kick out of it. I thought Tom Hanks and Amelie Tatou did a very credible job contrary to what some critics said. Tom Hanks made a much better scholarly University expert type than they seemed to be looking for. I heard one review on the radio where they said something to the effect of he couldn't pull of the polished smooth character he was supposed to be. I read the book. He wasn't purported to be that at all. Tom Hanks was excellent in his role and Audrey is , as usual , divine. A good watch."

See it for yourself and decide don't listen to the critics. One critic claimed that Tom Hanks gave a mechanical performance. Tom Hanks, the Oscar winner? How was Tom Hanks suppose to act? He is playing the role of a professor of symbology. I would think that a professor in that field would be a little mechanical. He surely wouldn't be a James Bond type."

","Generally the movie was good but there where a few flaws. The worst thing about the movie was the ending they search the world for the holy grail to find it was the girl he was travelling with. this was predictable but that was not the end, Robert Langdon(Hanks)cuts himself shaving, looks at the drain then reads the book. He leaves the place where he is staying and walks down the street,kneels down and thats the end. what was the point in that there was nothing really special, in my opinion it ruined the film.

It was a good thriller with an interesting plot, good acting, and decent writing (though it would be unfair to blame the script writers when I understand that Brown did not provide masterful prose in the first place).

","You can read a book, watch a football match, learn two dozens of words in foreign language, walk the dog, meet a friend. You can even just stay in bed and stare at the wall. Each of this would be much more useful then watching The Da Vinci Code. This movie is ridiculous and boring at the same time, so that you're getting nervous choosing between laugh and yawning while watching it.<br/><br/>Mr Brown realized that his theory lacks of logic, facts, proofs, evidences and, the most important, originality. Actually, his book is a total fiction of quite a mediocre person who expected that his readers never attended history classes or have no idea of who Da Vinci was. Or never have been to Paris. (Actually, I don't know, what audience he expected to impress?) So he spent dozens of pages trying to explain what makes Sophie Christ's descendant and The Da Vinci Code - an interesting book.<br/><br/>The creators of the movie lack of screen time, so the whole picture consists of huge gaps and of situation that have no any sense or explanation. I wonder, why didn't they put a based-on-a-true-story stuff at the very beginning. That would allow them to avoid those funny attempts to gather Da Vinci, Christ, Maria Magdalena, emperor Constantin, Isaac Newton, Opus Dei, st Grail and etc. together.<br/><br/>Instead of making a Harry Potter-style story, in which fiction is on the surface and is a part of the game, they made it seriously, as if they would be writing a new Byble. I wonder if they have ever read a single history study? I don't count mr Brown's books! And what specially makes me wonder is the reaction of the church. The only goal that they reached is that they really helped the producers to spend less money on the promotion.<br/><br/>I wish they'd protest against war or gather money for starving children in Africa with the same strength. That would really helped to make the church's image more convincing and closer to what is written in the Byble."

But other than that if you just see the movie for what it is, a movie, you should really enjoy this take on religion and women.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a different side of religion and how it was planned and defined by not a few people who wrote the bible, but by leaders of all the religions around at the time of its conception to establish Christianity to the world.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing, Christian or not."

Whereas Crichtons novels read like film scripts and need little tinkering with, this is a ripping yarn within a flawed book that needs a lot of 'oomph' to make it work. Bettany and Reno are good, Hanks and Tatou are wooden, McKellen overacts like a demented victorian shakespearian thespian ... and most of the supporting cast is sub-wooden - nay ... concrete... to say the least. There is no characterisation that engenders any empathy .. except Bettany's ... whose side story would have made a better film in itself alone ... and the final denouement is flat and mawkish in the extreme. It was along 150 minutes ... which is bizarre as the books pages fly. Just how they managed to de-excite this film beats me with all the money and alleged talent at their disposal. OK it's a mildly entertaining evening out .... but it looked pretty thin stuff even compared to Woody Allens slight tale 'Match Point' which I saw in the same cinema the night before (with 6 people instead of a full house) ... which left me with a much more lasting impression and more food for thought.

","And I thought the book was disappointing! Well I've now got a newfound appreciation for it despite its horrific writing style--all it took was seeing the movie!<br/><br/>Let me preface the remainder of this review by noting that I do not abide by Catholicism and was not offended by the story's subject matter--if anything, I was disappointed that the ""secret"" was essentially a puff of hot air and, in the real world, would never muster enough attention to threaten the Catholic church.<br/><br/>For the ""biggest movie of the summer"" this has got to be one of the worst. I read the book about three days before the film's release and, admittedly, was quite disappointed with it. The film however, makes the book look like a Pulitzer Prize winner.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was an awful choice. His makeup was in poor taste and his wardrobe lacked the intellectual feel Langdon *should* give off. His on-screen chemistry with Audrey Tautou just wasn't there. Most of their scenes--and hence the bulk of the film--felt awkwardly acted. The production value also seemed oddly low for a book boasting over 40 million copies sold; It's as if the producers felt the second-rate book deserved a second-rate screen adaptation or they had simply spent their budget hiring Ron Howard and Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Let's face it: Screen writers add and remove elements when adapting a screenplay from a novel. In this case it is painfully obvious that their choices were not entirely prudent. The most obvious case was the initial scene in the Louvre which was insultingly short and suspense-free. The scene at Rosslyn was equally strange and poorly acted/directed--the dialogue was embarrassingly awkward.<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD and avoid the long lines and protesters who are unable to distinguish between entertainment and a threat to reality!"

","So I saw the Howard/Hanks collabo having already read the book and feeling that it was a very entertaining piece of fiction. With that understanding, I entered the movie hoping that the filmmakers could credit the human race with enough intelligence to realize that since this is a MOVIE, its value is ENTERTAINMENT (for the most part). Unfortunately, we have not earned that credit, so instead the movie is dumbed down to the lowest common denominator and so wrapped up in presenting the movie without upsetting anyone that the opportunity awarded to a controversial film to open lines of communication is completely overlooked in light of the low quality of the film itself. I am very curious as to what happened to the Oscar-winning Hanks as well. I'm still not sure if the role was just not right for him, or if he just realized half-way through filming that he didn't want to be there anymore. Audrey Tautou didn't do a bad job, but the Sophie character is written so weak, I felt sorry for her the entire time. In replacing Dan Brown's strong female counterpoint with the weak woman so dependent on Langdon, I find a certain sad irony. The ideas presented by the Da Vinci Code are revolutionary partly because they back-up the idea that women are strong, powerful beings forced into a role of subservience by the men who lead the Church. It must really stink for a woman today to be feeling those same outdated pressures in Hollywood. As for the rest of the film, the cinematography was OK, Ian McKellan was a riot (just because he could be, was the only real spark in film), and the two and a half hour running time was uncalled for, especially with this dragging storyline. SO DISAPPOINTING."
"nobull408","7","0","2","21 May 2006"," Constroversory aside... it's a very entertaining movie
","I will get this out of the way first. I read the book ""The Da Vinci Code"" when it was first released some years ago & I thought it was very entertaining. First let me say that I'm not religious & I saw this movie with four devout Christians & one other non-religious person. Out of all of them, I was the only one that had read the book. Upon the movie's completion, we all talked about the movie and everyone liked it, the Christians didn't believe it & that's it. There was no yelling at each other... no screaming... no claim's of 'heresey, etc. We all were able to discuss the movie as a form of ENTERTAINMENT not religious fact. Upon leaving the theater, we were approached by a Christian group asking us, if we had seen the Da Vinci Code, we answered yes & immediately they gave us a pamphlet written by a Pastor about the Da Vinci Code. This movie, will not cause Christian's to loose their faith. I encourage anyone who see's the movie, reads the book or even hears anything about the storyline to do your on research. There is a plethora of books on the subject coming out every few weeks. Now onto my review...<br/><br/>I thought Ron Howard did a fantastic job with directing, some of the cinematography is just beautiful, particularly the scenes inside the Louvre. He kept the movie flowing at a good pace, since if he followed the book, page for page, we would have had to watch a mini-series. Tom Hank's was convincing as 'Robert Langdon', a cryptologist from Harvard who is wanted for murder he didn't commit. Audrey Tautou was also fantastic as Sophie Neveu, a French CSI'Esq member. But the real scene stealer was without a doubt Sir Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, an eccentric billionaire Grail fanatic. He played the part perfectly, adding a charm to the film, it would have lacked without him. Paul Bettany & Jean Reno were also convincing in their roles.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave the movie a 7/10, there are a few things they have added, such as dialog (Langdon saying, ""I need a library. Fast!) was a little 'overdone.' See the movie, ignore the protester's & just got to be entertained not to be taught a theology lesson."

The concepts of the mind seeing what it wants to and believing in something without proof are prevalent in the movie. Of course, being the movie adaptation, some things have to be changed. Character motivations have changed from the book, but the story remains essentially the same. There is more argument between Langdon and Teabing, which speaks to the ambiguity mentioned earlier.

You get an unpleasant impression that nearly everything is wrong or, at least, is non at the book level, starting from the cast (consider Tom Hanks is normally good and I personally like him, but he is wrong choice for Langdon and he also gives an under his level performance) and going on with some dialogues (you will find quotes from the book that are not really needed and then some needed quote that is missing).<br/><br/>In the end, I must say it is not a completely bad movie and a couple of my friends found it pretty good, but it gets bad if you think what kind of raw materials and worldwide expectations they had in hand to forge it. I give them all a 6 just because I'm sure the book was great (as a novel, not as an historical text) but I also have to admit that it was not simple for sure to be translated on the big screen, especially if your audience, having read the book, is already aware of all the main revelations in the plot."

I had a hard time picturing the details of the painting, specifically the posing of Mary Magdalene and Jesus.<br/><br/>I thought all along that Tom Hanks (one of my favorite actors) was a bit miscast as Langdon, but he was credible. Audrey Tautou is understatedly beautiful and sophisticated as Princess Sophie. Jean Reno played Capt. Fache as if the role was written for him. Ian ""Gandolf"" McKellan was perfect as the obsessive Grail historian Leigh Teabing. And Paul Bettany was spooky as the Opus Dei assassin Silas.<br/><br/>Bottom line, ""The DaVinci Code"" didn't live up to the hype, but was nowhere near as bad as the critics say. 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>and now, a rant: The worst part of The DaVinci Code had nothing to do with either the book or the movie. We had to sit through 18 minutes of commercials (yes, commercials!) before the previews. Now I don't know about you the reader, but I go to the movies to escape the commercials. People in the theater were actually booing and yelling. I don't drop $9.50 on a movie so I can watch commercials that I can see at home.

His movies always tell a story about something, teaching and informing his audience about the human condition. ""The Da Vinci Code"" has proved that there are huge numbers of people who appreciate and are entertained by a mystery, and who are seekers of knowledge about themselves and others. From now on there will be another great divider of the people - The Pro Da Vinci Coders and the others!(Poor things!)I don't think anyone could have brought this novel to life as a movie better than Ron Howard's cast and crew have done."

","The Da Vinci Code is a great movie and very close to the book. Acting is absolutely amazing  I believed every scene. Applause at the end of the movie was unexpected since several viewers were trying to deliberately ruin the movie by making snoring noises and loudly telling to each other how boring this movie is. So you can safely assume that you will see some fanatics that will try to spoil your movie experience. If you are not familiar with at least some of the historical facts discussed in the movie you will have a hard time following the logic of it. This is not your typical Hollywood movie and it is better then the book in many aspects. Book was trying to capture the audience by clever tricks and movie was trying to show unusual insight on human history."
"DrTso","8","0","2","21 May 2006"," Quite a good movie but a little disappointing...................
","I have recently seen it on Friday and my overall comment is that the movie is actually quite good but there are some points that I want clear out.<br/><br/>First of all,in the book Sophie is the one who suppose to decode the password, the code, etc. Howvever in the movie, it is Rober who has done the job of Sophie. Therefore this made the role of Sophie meaningless. Also Robert is just a symbologist. How can he know so much things about cryptography? Secondly, when Teabing killed his servant, at the same time, he is revealed as the ""teacher"". May be because I have read the book before, this scene can not give me a stunning feeling. I think this scene can be supplemented with more music in order to more fully demonstrate the ""stunning"" or ""shocked"" feeling.<br/><br/>Overall this is quite a good movie for it is not easy to refer back to the history without much talking. Ron cleverly used some colourlful and beautiful visual effect to demonstrate it in order to avoid boredom."

"LA_Songs","3","0","3","21 May 2006"," Fact or Fiction?
","The book of The Da Vinci Code has been out for a couple of years, and people have had plenty of time to check out the so-called ""facts"" presented in the book.<br/><br/>The main lie in Da Vinci Code is that Jesus was secretly married to Mary Magdalene. Is that fact or fabrication? Let's check out an eyewitness' account and think about it. According to Apostle John, who was the eyewitness of the crucifixion, Jesus made arrangements for Mary, his mother, while hanging on the cross. Mary Magdalene was standing right next to her. Yet, Jesus made no arrangement for her. If Jesus were secretly married to Mary Magdalene, wouldn't he at least have said something to her before he died? But John recorded nothing that Jesus said to her or about her.<br/><br/>Dan Brown based his assumed marriage on an account in one of the Gnostic Gospels, written hundreds of years after the death of Christ, using someone else's name (Thomas, Judas, Philip, etc.) who clearly did not write it years after their death. The account said Jesus kissed Mary Magdalene  (then the page was torn, and the account was incomplete). But Dan Brown's highly imaginative and heavily polluted mind jumped to the conclusion that Jesus must have kissed her on her lips, which led to the conclusion of this assumed marriage. How do we know Jesus did not kiss her on her forehead or on her cheek? I for one would rather believe the person who lived with Jesus for years, and not give any credit to an account written under a pseudo-name by someone who lived hundreds of years afterward.<br/><br/>So this lie alone by Dan Brown, deliberately and purposely presented, would disqualify this book, or the movie for that matter, as a historically accurate account. In fact, judging from the motive of writing this book, I would not hesitate to say that Dan wrote it to satisfy his anti-Christian bias; and so did Hollywood in producing this movie out of the same bias. If this book were written about Mohammed or about Islam out of even less amount of bias, Dan Brown will certainly be living in hiding now, like the author of The Satanic Verses' author Salman Rushdie still does today. But has Dan Brown ever thought about his own eternity? Though Dan Brown is making $millions now, can he take one cent with him when he dies?"
"Existential1","7","0","2","21 May 2006"," Controversial because...
","The strongest statement made by ""The Da Vinci Code"" is one of irony. The fear this movie has generated among Christians does not stem directly from the possibility of Mary Magdalene being Jesus' wife and having children by her. No, the most damaging idea the Da Vinci Code conveys to Christianity is the possibility that Jesus was not divine. The DVC posits that Jesus was just a man and it was the church, as a powerful institution, that perpetuated the legend of his divinity. Over time and through tradition, like so many other legends, Jesus' divinity became accepted as fact. The DVC makes viewers think about which possibility is more plausible; was Jesus a normal human being or was he God. Which seems more likely to you? Devout Christians don't want people to think about this because it strikes at the pillar of their beliefs. The sweet irony is that ""The Da Vinci Code"" presents the question of Jesus' divinity as fiction and Christianity presents it as fact! It may be that the movie is fact (concerning Jesus' divinity) and the religion is fiction. That's the blasphemy. It's nicely demonstrated by Sophie, at the movie's end."

The one other problem that I had with the movie is that it could have ended roughly about 4 times, and around the last 10 minutes of the movie drag on FOREVER! A lot of critics are saying also that Tom Hanks did not do a very good job in the movie. I would have to totally disagree with this, compared to his last couple of movies... like The Lady Killers..?? He delivered his lines well and did a good job. Everything was good with Hanks, up until he monologued in the end, it was a bit corny, but I can deal with one bit of corn in a 2.5 hour movie.

"Metronome11","6","0","3","20 May 2006"," Worth seeing but somewhat over-hyped
","Tom Hanks and a pretty French girl in high heels on a quest for the Holy Grail in the churches and museums of France and England.<br/><br/>Interesting and worth seeing, but not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first Star Wars, or the first Ghostbusters, and hence somewhat over-hyped. I agree with the SF critics that while the characters are in constant danger, people keep getting shot, and a centuries-old mystery is about to be revealed, it's not all that thrilling. Maybe Ron Howard's directing is too conservative, or the book is a glorified Agatha Christie novel.<br/><br/>For those who haven't read it (myself included) ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a Grail-Quest novel, set in France, featuring a renegade Catholic sect (with some Opus Dei members) who want to wipe out all traces of the Grail, versus another ancient secret society (The Priory of Zion) who are sworn to preserve it. The quest involves a series of clues, like an Easter Egg hunt. There are many mysteries and reversals as characters are revealed to be part of one group or the other, and engaging in gangland style warfare.<br/><br/>Despite the religious furor, few would (I hope) mistake this for serious history. The list of what-ifs goes on and on, the plot is driven more by hunches and coincidence than evidence, and the underlying premise of a secret that will shake the foundations of Catholicism might have been electrifying 50+ years ago, but is ho-hum today, at least in the West.<br/><br/>(In particular, since Christianity didn't exist in France in 43 AD, any descendants of Jesus would have lived in total obscurity for centuries. Also during the Middle Ages every monarch in Europe tried to claim descent from the Caesars, Jesus, King Solomon, or whomever, to bolster their claims to the throne. So there would have been ample motive and opportunity to fabricate such a romantic legend in Merovingian France, including perhaps still-existing secret societies.)<br/><br/>This movie needed a director who realized he could not coast on the bestselling book. Just narrating the story isn't enough. Why is the Grail such a big secret? How will the Church 's foundations be shaken? What was the real richness of the message or meaning that was handed down through the centuries? If the film had done a better job of laying some groundwork, the plot action could have been more compelling.<br/><br/>Even just some eerier music, more portentous scenes and lighting, or a few miracles could have made a huge difference in setting things more on edge. Plus the idea that this is a ""millennial revelation"" of an ancient secret (with current news value) is not leveraged at all. ""The Bridges of Madison County"" did a much better job of faking authenticity for emotional impact.<br/><br/>Many in the audience, and anyone who's seen or read ""Possession,"" will guess the secret at least 40 minutes before the end, so how suspenseful can that be? Author Dan Brown did a nice job of borrowing themes from ""The Celestine Prophesy"" (ancient religious quest with violence) and ""Possession"" (self discovery via historical research) and weaving them with some old French legends. But that's it -- it's a decent novel, not a major cultural event.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13. No sex, not even a kiss, but brutal killings, some nudity, and disturbing images."

","One would think that with names like Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, Alfred Molina, and Ian McKellen attached, and the best-selling novel as the basis, this movie would blow audiences away. It seems, however, that none of these names cared that the screenplay was dreadful, just that they would be backing a summer blockbuster called the Da Vinci Code. I cannot say that this movie was totally bad. In my opinion, had there been no book and this movie had been made the way it was, it would have been quite the spectacle. However, almost every person who saw the movie the first day had read the book and was comparing the movie to the book. If you see this movie and expect it to be in the same league as the book you will be seriously disappointed. Now, I must admit it has been a while since I read the book, but it seemed that a lot of information was taken out and/or changed. Also, many of the twists and turns that made the novel great were quickly thrown in and poorly explained. I must admit that I think Tom Hanks is a great actor but he seemed very dry in this role. I never thought he was right for this part. Audrey Tautou is a fantastically charming actress and I felt her part was done pretty well, but she had no chemistry with Hanks. Jean Reno, in my opinion, nailed the role of Bezu Fache, he was perfect. McKellen was good, but he didn't have the look of Teabing. Aringarosa was played somewhat well by Molina, but it was Paul Bettany as Silas that really seemed perfect. He was eerie to say the least. All in all this movie, compared to the novel, was a bust, which is sad to say because Dan Brown himself backed the movie. And with the star power behind it, this could have and should have been a site to see. It fell short. I must say that the last 2-3 minutes of the movie did give me goosebumps, as it was well shot and the music was perfect. But again, do not go to see this movie with expectations that it will do the book justice."

","I'm no die hard religious guy and I'm not saying that its bad because of its controversy, but I had high hopes for this movie and was disappointed. The casting was good, but Howard did a terrible job in this flick. Some of it seemed kind of lame, and i feel he left out some important details from the book. The characters are developed poorly, which doesn't surprise me because he blows through the first 150 or so pages in around 5 minutes, which is to say disappointing because i thought that the beginning was was the best, as well as the most important part of the whole story. In certain parts I felt it it was almost necessary to have read the novel to understand what was going on. Ialso didn't like how he made some parts word for word from the book,yet added in things and left others out. As it says in other reviews there is absolutely no chemistry between the main characters. Events in the movie sometimes seemed out of place, leaving you wondering, and then finally their answered an hour later.Some of you may disagree with on this, but I thought that the movie was almost a slap to the face of the book. The book talks about how the major religions down play the importance of women, compared to the pagan religions which worshiped them (to which no no real explanation was given except machismo). In the novel Sophie is quick witted, as a cryptologist, and langdon even says that he was intimidated by he r intelligence, while in the movie langdon some how knew everything it seemed, figuring out things that took him in the book, he knew seemingly instantly case and point: the vitrouvius man or the anagram,o Draconian Devil!O Lame Saint! This had the potential to be a great film, the novel was excellent, but it was just made poorly. <br/><br/>P.S. If your whole views on religious foundation can be shaken by a movie be it this or maybe the passion, your are obviously stupid and more impressionable than a 3 year old. Also Robert Redford should have played Langdon"
"AnnoyedRabbit","7","0","3","20 May 2006"," An interesting idea gone Hollywood
","Having never read the book, I went into the Da Vinci Code with no expectations other than those I usually have going into a Ron Howard production.<br/><br/>The beginning sequence dove right into the story and Paul Bettany's performance as Silas begins in spectacular fashion. Unfortunately, and it seems to last throughout the entire film, Hanks' acting skills seem to have been buried along with the secret of a holy bloodline and never makes an appearance in this film. Ian McKellan proved himself once again a great actor as Sir Leigh Teabing, and Jean Reno was a natural choice for Captain Fache.<br/><br/>The story itself was utterly predictable if not entertaining. Hanks and Tautou's lines were classic Hollywood thriller (boring and cheesy), and that was not helped by the fact that they looked uncomfortable along-side each other for the entire two hours.<br/><br/>Thankfully for us, the viewers, Bettany and McKellan save the piece from itself."
"indyfreak2002","Null","0","2","20 May 2006"," Great potential, great director, bad casting
","I read the DaVinci Code before i even knew it was going to be a movie so i have just been counting the days until it came out. Well, i went to see it last night and while the movie remained rather loyal to the book the casting did not. Tom Hanks should not have been Robert Langdon. I had hoped that it was merely disappointment for me not seeing him as Robert before, but watching the movie confirms it. His look and everything just doesn't fit to me. While Audrey Tatou sort of warmed up to me as Sophie, she still seemed to hold some sort of stiffness about her. Now, most likely the cause of my dislike in the portrayal of the characters has to do with some of the horrible lines that were used in the movie.<br/><br/>And i mean horrible. In the attempt to include information, especially in the Louvre, it came across really fake and very out of character for them to be in a life-threatening crisis and take the time to explain the meaning of artwork. Now while this is very well crafted in the book adding intellectual rigor with a stunning plot it is merely used as part of Dan Brown's descriptive style. That is why i've come to the conclusion that it is impossible to successfully adapt any of Dan Brown's books into movies. They truly contain too much information. While it fits in a book as description and thoughts that run through Langdon's mind, it comes out awkward with Langdon giving Sophie Art 101 while they are hurrying to figure out her grandfather's riddles.<br/><br/>It literally would make me cringe at some of the lines with how robotic they were. As well such things like Sauniere not being Sophie's grandfather when he was; at least i always thought he was when reading the book. And of course such little details like Sophie having brown hair and not red (since that was a pretty important detail in the book), Silas having blue eyes and not pink, the grandmother having short and not long hair bothered me for they were clearly described in the book. And as much as i think of Ian McKellan, Leigh Teabing was described entirely different in the book. He was supposed to be portly with curly hair.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong, Ian McKellan did a wonderful job and definitely pulled off Teabing, but i feel that you cannot capture the book if the characters do not fit correctly. So that definitely bothered me as i watched it. The best was Paul Bettany as Silas, perfect for the part. Besides being a wonderful actor he truly fits the role with the look and everything, minus the pink eyes which as i've said before, bothered me. As well Fache and Aringarosa were perfect in the casting.<br/><br/>So over all, it is a really good movie if you have not read the book, but if you have then i would suggest to not see the movie, because more likely it will annoy you than entertain you. I can be pretty picky on adaptations of books, so it's not so much a bad movie as just disappointing. It's still pretty good though."
"greek2thebone","7","0","2","20 May 2006"," Depends on whether you've read the book or not
","First I'd like to say that I am perplexed from people who rated this movie with 10 out of 10. Even though I try to be non-judgmental with regard's to people's taste, this movie is definitely not perfect and certainly does not rank with The Godfather and the like. But who am I to say so anyways, right?<br/><br/>The movie review now. If you have read the book, an excellent read (but with no literary value, mind you), then you will be happy to know that it is a pretty good adaptation that stays close to the text without major diversions. Some added dialogues between Hanks and Tautou though attempt at making the movie more ""religiously-politically correct"" and that annoyed me. A book is a book and if it offends you, don't see the movie. The extra dialogue and cross questioning in some scenes, aiming at easing the burden on the Catholic church, was too much and irrelevant. Everything else aside, book fans will like it. Yet, the movie does not move as fast as the book and the reason is that the explanatory dialogue (explaining splendidly the theories presented in the book, particularly to those who haven't read it) overwhelms the action and pace. If one judges the movie on its own merit, book aside, will be left with the impression that there is no chemistry between the protagonists even though the casting is pretty good. It is a decent movie, provocative in its own way, with good photography but does not add up to the pre-release hype. Had the book not been famous beforehand, I don't think the movie would ever be made. Overall, a decent movie and that's just about it."

","It could have been a masterpiece! Ron Howard is one of my favorite directors. But he was disappointing this time. Turning a book like Da Vinci Code into a movie is not an easy task, but people like Ron Howard are not supposed to fail! There is too much information and a movie cannot be too long. There is also a certain pace people expect from thrillers. <br/><br/>But adapting a book doesn't mean you have to start and end the way the book does!! I would have given audience a quick 5 minute curtain raiser on the subject without killing the suspense, before plunging into the main story-line...this also could have helped Hans Zimmer who just couldn't liven it up in the first half an hour (not sure if Horner would have succeeded either, the way Howard chose to shoot it)...the movie never really picks up..McKellen rescues the movie now and then. Tom Hanks looks half dead! if it can be of any consolation to 'the church', the movie is not going to be remembered as a masterpiece."
"SDMovieMaven","6","0","3","20 May 2006"," Too Subtle for Critics? Too Balanced for Zealots?
","This is not Howard's best work, but I would recommend seeing this film for several reasons. The first is that even more so than the book, the film tries hard to walk the fence between decrying religious faith and exonerating Jesus' divinity, and is less about persuasive refutation and more about questioning basic assumptions of history. The second is that all of the actors do a wonderful job navigating the more obtuse aspects of their roles. This is where I think the critics misunderstood: these performances are not wooden or ""sleep walking,"" they aim for subtle, and often hit the mark. If anything, the editing is a bit heavy-handed, putting exclamation points on the end of already compelling statements (i.e. Yes, this person really DID choke! And they really ARE dead! Look how DEAD they are!). Because of this contrast, the more nuanced acting is often lost (or perhaps better understood by European audiences?).<br/><br/>Lastly, there is real magic in many of the sequences, and it continually probes our understanding of history, religion and very personal spiritual faith. Probes  and excites controversy  but as the verbal sparring between the ""historical authorities"" in the film so often reveals, the story doesn't slam the door shut on any one particular worldviewor on any possibility. Personally, I found the film inspiring, exciting (despite the fact that I had read the book and new the outcome), and much more enjoyable than I had anticipated."

Viewing it as a movie on its own merits it was a good thriller. Definitely had an heir of mystery. The acting from Tom Hanks was good, he had a sort of fatherly tone at points, making him a believable professor. Ian Mckellan did a wonderful job and perhaps did the best acting in the film. Audrey Tautou I felt also had a good performance, but not great, she however seemed fitting to the character, and I am glad to see her break her way into more mainstream films. Many worried this movie would stir up controversy, but I do not feel it took a biased approach to the religious themes presented, and probably was more PC the than book itself.<br/><br/>Looking at it as a book turned movie I think it was very well adapted. There are few parts that differ, which at the risk of spoiling anything for non-readers I will not mention suffice it to say it is pretty true to the book, and the parts that were changed I was able to understand the reason for the change. The movie kept a lot of the informative sections without making them bland, through discussion we get somewhat of a history lesson, I'm sure some people would fine it bland, but I am patient and like the background, it adds a great depth to the story.<br/><br/>Good movie, not great, for those who read the book its a quick fix, for those who hate reading but wonder what the fuss is about, go see it."

Without the book or a deep knowledge about this kind of history, you won't know or get any of the good stuff in the story. The film follows the storyline of the book rather faithfully with a few scenes cut/altered.

"James2507","7","0","4","20 May 2006"," OK but not great
","I have to say that my expectation was running high for this film although I felt that it had much more potential than what it achieved. For a director of Ron Howard's calibre I was expecting this to be the best movie of year but I'm afraid to say that it just isn't. As is the case with many films, it is well below par with the book, but it is quite entertaining and will keep you gripped throughout. When reading the book I felt that the character of Robert Langdon would not be played by someone like Tom Hanks. Although I enjoy most movies Tom Hanks stars in, I couldn't really place him in the shoes of Robert Langdon, I thought that someone such as Clive Owen would better suit the role. The one person, however, I instantly knew should play the part he did was Sir Ian Mckellen as Sir Leigh Teabing. Ian McKellen fits the role so well and I have to say he gave a wonderful performance. The book for me was very enjoyable, it is a world-wide best-seller and naturally the film had great expectations. However, whoever made this movie, the critics wouldn't be happy, the book just had so much success that no one could ever do it justice, that is why the critics have given it such poor reviews. Overall, this is quite an enjoyable and entertaining film which has much more potential than shown, it is hardly the best movie of the year, but it is worth watching and although not completely true to the book, a pretty good movie."

","I saw the Da Vinci Code with my husband (who hadn't read the book) on opening day. We both loved it! I think it's a great movie. Although it's not fiction (neither is it non-fiction). It presents ideas that have been of interest to scholars for ages and portrays them in a thriller that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and interests. <br/><br/>The hopes of Dan Brown and Ron Howard are probably that it would at least start a dialogue as to what really is the truth? What happened? And I think it has easily managed to do that. <br/><br/>I'm not a religious person but I think that people who truly believe in Jesus (as oppose to just the ""organization"" of the church) would definitely be pulled to see this. Because ultimately they would be more open to the finding the ""truth.""<br/><br/>It's definitely ""a must see"" for anyone."

","I thought The Da Vinci Code was good, not great. The left some things out put new things in...but I guess I shouldn't be too shocked about that. One thing I really loved was seeing the Lourve, Paris, Teabing's Villa...it was everything I had imagined it to be. I thought everyone's performance was right on...but the Robert Langdon is much more exciting than the Robert Langdon on screen. It moved pretty fast, I think the movie was about 2 1/2 hours long but it went by so quickly...none of the scenes dragged on at all. The flashbacks are also enjoyable. Ian McKellen's performance as Teabing was great as well as Paul Bettany's. Overall I thought it was good film."
"cynsk8","7","0","3","20 May 2006"," The Critics are Wrong this Time
","Critics have flamed this film and I have to say I think they were wrong and overly biased. This is not the first time this year where professional reviews were just plain off base. Come on, who really thought MI III deserved a 70% on the tomato meter. MI III had to be one of the worst movies ever, and I love action movies and have seen tons of them. I'm usually pretty dead on with critics of my assessment of a film.<br/><br/>Reading all of the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, I just don't buy that the story was flat. Let's face it, the book, although a page turner, was not an action packed thriller. It was more of a slow evolving mystery-thriller. Hello, that's why a 2 ½ hour movie was necessary. Although I do agree that Tom Hanks was wrong for the role and that Ron Howard is a sucky director anyway, this movie did NOT deserve an 18 on the tomato meter.<br/><br/>I saw the movie in Lake Mary, Fla and the audience clapped when it was over. I thought the film did what the book didand that is appeal to the average American audience. I read one review on IMDb that pointed out the lack of European flair, but this movie was made for Americans, by Americans. Who is more American than Opie? So why the crummy reviews? I think critics and movie snobs alike, all got on the band wagon to pick apart one of the most anticipated movies of our generation. Let me say here, that I don't believe this movie deserved a 90%, or even an 80% for that matter. But an 18??? Who are we kidding. The movie was very respectable. It had good pacing and took time to elaborate the details, albeit multiple times, but it was very necessary to get the whole point across.<br/><br/>Everyone that I have spoken too really liked the movie and seemed to get a lot out of it. It may not be a work of cinematic genius on par with the likes of the top movies of last season, but certainly did the book justice."

","Unlike many others, I say this movie is excellent. It is hard for others, but I watched this movie discarding the religious controversies the move ignites. The acting is well done in most areas of the film. Tom Hanks is an amazing actor, and while this was not his best performance. it certainly was good.<br/><br/>The plot is a good one, and for the most part stays true to the book. There a few minor changes of situations and words, but the book is there. However, the movie is LONG. The mystery that is to be solved, though intriguing and exciting, gets a little boring. It was fun to find out what this message meant and where this riddle leads, but it goes on for too long. But Howard wanted to keep to the book, and cutting too much out of the movie may have ruined it.<br/><br/>Overall The Da Vincie Code was an exciting and enjoyable film experience, and without some of these minor flaws, it would be a perfect film."
"lilauthor1","8","0","3","20 May 2006"," film better than book
","Ron Howard has delivered a film that surpasses the original novel in ease of comprehension, although the premise that Tom Hanks' character needs to explain the concepts to Tatou's character at each juncture (obviously to clue in the audience) is too much talk yet too little illumination. The story line is interesting, obviously believable (hence all the outcry opposed) and has generated more religious or theological discussion within my circle of family and friends than we have experienced in generations. Any film that can do that is worth seeing. The film and book are fiction but expose many truths, fears and fantasies that have gripped civilized man from the beginning of Christianity. It strives to note the past human foibles and judgments which have left some of our basic truths open to various questioning or repositioning. No one should be offended, shocked or upset by this film, which only tries to tell a ""what if"" chapter of Christianity, NOT TO DENY the one the world has accepted for 2000 years. It takes nothing away from Christ or His followers.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film much more than the novel's wooden style. (Nonetheless, I feel a stronger lead than Hanks was warranted. It was as though he was marching while everyone else was dancing.)"

","I can see only one reason why anyone would vote below, say, a 7 for this movie: if it made them question their faith and they resent such a thing happening. Of course, if a movie can make you question your faith, then it wasn't very strong to begin with.<br/><br/>The movie itself is very well made. Direction, acting, cinematography, art direction/set decoration, action, pacing, etc. I did not feel there were any plot holes; it is a complete movie. I felt that it was gripping, exciting, suspenseful, intelligent, and even had a bit of humor thrown in at the right moments (so you could shift in your seat, relax again, and move on). People at my screening all laughed out loud at funny moments, but were otherwise quiet and seemingly enthralled throughout the rest of the film. I even heard several gasps here and there. A few people clapped at the end. My wife said the look on my face was perfect for someone who hadn't read the book (she has read it). She gives the movie a 9 as well, and a 7 when comparing it TO the book (which she said was a 10).<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is a statement, but it isn't trying to convert everyone. It's just giving you another theory about what may have happened. In all honesty though, I do find it a very convincing theory/story.<br/><br/>I believe everyone SHOULD see this movie, if for no other reason than to defy the governments and churches that are trying desperately to continue controlling the masses. Why would they care so much about a movie unless it scared them? It doesn't take much to realize that powerful people fear losing their power. I think this movie at least gives us pause to think about the things we've been told to just blindly accept for all these years.<br/><br/>Myself? I'm not religious at all. I found that the movie simply confirmed the things I already wondered about and/or doubted about Christianity anyway."

","I won't get into the details of the movies, as most of you by now, know what the story is about.<br/><br/>I've read the book and I was excited to see this movie, but then I became disheartened after reading all the horrible reviews for the movie. However I went into the movie and was quite pleased with it. I'm not sure what the critics were complaining about, but I was entertained by the movie. I'm not sure if a lot of people are just expressing their displeasure with the subject matter instead of the movie itself.<br/><br/>Furthermore, one important thing I must point out is the balance it brings to both sides of the religious argument. There are statements made by Tom Hanks that bring balance to the religious argument that is going on about this book. Ron Howard didn't need to put that into the movie, but is a great touch and people who have some against this movie just because of their religious views, should see this movie for themselves."

For those of you who read the novel, you are in for a treat. True, the movie is not the book, word by word, scene by scene; if it had been, the movie would have been a lot longer than 2 1/2 hours. I think it was very well done, overall. At first, I was disappointed that they had chosen Tom Hanks for the lead as Robert Langdon, I felt it was too old and it was Hollywood's attempt to distort the actual book but he did an excellent job in playing the character. In the interest of time, there were a lot of things that was in the book, not in the movie. I still say, Ron Howard, Well Done!"

","It took more than one year after I read The Da Vinci Code, the most popular and controversial novels of our time and just 2nd best sold after The Bible, more than one year until the adaptation was finally released. <br/><br/>The movie has an international cast headed by two time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks supported by Sir Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina and Jean Reno, every one of them a mega star. Audrey Tautou brings freshness to it in a ""jolie"" kind of way and Paul Bettany and Jurgen Prochnow are also not to be missed. Ron Howard is a great filmmaker, following Brown's formula (exotic setting, astonishing disclosures, a frenetic search for the truth and also the chase to cover it all). With the help of his crew he elevates it into a greater entertainment full of style and an aura of mystery that is undeniable.<br/><br/>I had VERY high expectations when I went to watch the movie. I already had my own image of the whole story and the characters and was mostly wondering how Tom Hanks / Robert Langdon will fit into it. He did! Maybe the fact that I am an European helped me enjoy this movie from a different perspective as well. Langdon (Hanks) is a Harvard Professor who brings the young American spirit into this who's who mystery network of french police-mens, Italian Clerc and English noblemen. He is trapped and drawn into solving a mystery as old as the world. <br/><br/>I think that beyond the story of the novel Hanks and the entire European part of the crew managed in a brilliant way to reveal this inter-cultural mixture. Wonderful! Another nice surprise was that, except for a few details left out, the movie follows the book religiously. The novel is quite dense and i suppose the director had only this much time on his hands. Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno do a good job of not overplaying their roles, and Sir Ian McKellen (you might have seen him in The Lord of the Rings, X-Men and quite a few TV productions of Shakespeare's) overplays his in just the right way. Young Paul Bettany portrays a convincing Silas. Jurgen Prochnow, a leading man and strong character of the German stage and screen does a wonderful job during his short part as Andre Vernet. Sauniere himself is portrayed by one of the key stones of French cinematography, Jean-Pierre Marielle.<br/><br/>It has also been wonderful to me to so see the Louvre again - even if the Grand Gallery was build out of scratch in the studio. The paintings, the spectacular wooden floors - everything, even the window sole are part of the studio decor, but build identical to the real thing to millimeter. Bottom line, this is a movie not to be missed. <br/><br/>If you liked the book, like a good riddle, are a history lover or an art lover or you just want to enjoy a good cast, go and see it. In the theaters. Now."

","I saw it last night with my 15 year old son. We both enjoyed it as an action movie. I don't think it will threaten anyone's view of religion. It was vintage Ron Howard. If you liked Apollo 13, you will love DVC.<br/><br/>My son read the book and enjoyed it. He thought the movie followed the book well. I thought it was less detailed and less historical with much more action in the ""24"" sense of action -- they were always running someplace.<br/><br/>One issue not well covered in the movie was the riches supposedly found by the Templars in Jerusalem. When the Romans destroyed the Temple in 70 AD, they took most of the treasure back to Italy and used it to finance the construction of the Colosseum. Is it so far fetched that some of that fabulous treasure was hidden from the Romans but found by the Templars and removed to finance the construction of Feudal Europe?"

","I thought the movie was pretty entertaining as a piece of fiction. Sure it had its flaws, but on the whole it could have been a lot worse. The major flaw, i found, was that it lacked any real build-up to climactic events. It seemed as though Ron Howard made the film under the supposition that everyone has read the book (which wouldn't be all that inaccurate). Therefore he didn't give the turning points the proper feeling of anticipation and build as the book did. I never felt as though the characters were ever making any revelations with the story. It was delivered all-in-all rather blandish. The music didn't help with this either. I felt the music to be rather boring. The most notable example would be the car chase scene where Sophie and Robert escape in Smart Car. Where was the exciting music? It was cut together in an exciting way with fast pace cuts, but the music was lagging. It seemed as though Howard was treating this film as a drama/thriller rather than the fast paced high intensity popcorn entertainment piece the book offered. The result- a fairly light entertainment film that could have been a lot more entertaining!!! But worth seeing non-the-less."

","I know this is probably going to turn some thumbs down here, but what i can say is this is a 2.5hrs movie taken from a 500+ pages book that's gonna take you at least 2 days to finish reading it if you read it non stop. Ron Howard did well to consolidate all the information from the book and turn it into a movie which could truly captured the audience imagination. Both for readers and non readers. Tom Hanks Acting was mediocre if you compare it to all the previous films he has acted in, but readers should know it's a helluva task to fit in a role of a very complex character, Robert Langdon, as he was portrayed in the book. Audray was okay as Sophie, she seems more of a strong willed type of lady in the book as compared to the movie. Ian Mckeller played Leigh Teabing excellently and so did Paul Bettany as Silas. I would like to invite everyone to go watch this movie before making any comments and also not believing people whom are giving prejudgment and criticism of this film without even watching it. Keep an open mind, erase the thought of any written history and watch this movie adapted from a fine piece of fiction(as claimed by the majority) Think, if The Da Vinci Code is a fiction written by man Isn't there a chance that the bible is a great piece of fiction written by men also?

A little extra was added to the ending (I won't say what!). And some of the intellectual thought was removed, but only to keep the movie flowing. For those that had said the critics were right, must have not watched the same movie I watched. Those who haven't read the book will enjoy the movie just as much as those who have. I know, because my girlfriend didn't read the book. I give this movie a 9/10 (only cause they changed the story a bit!) Overall, great story, great acting, great special effects. I wasn't watching the movie thinking, ""this is Tom Hanks."" I was thinking, ""Wow.. that's Robert Langdon!"". My biggest complaint is the audience.

"lenaforsgren","7","0","2","20 May 2006"," I enjoyed it!
","It was with great anticipation that I went to see The Da Vinci Code at the premiere last night. The many bad reviews had lowered my expectations somewhat, but I was still looking forward to seeing the film very much.<br/><br/>The opening is really intense, which is extremely important in this kind of film. Pretty soon we get to see Silas punishing himself with the cilice belt and the whip. This scene is extremely powerful and I noticed that some people had a hard time watching it.<br/><br/>Having re-read the book recently I found that although the script follows the book very closely on a general level, very many little things are actually different. Most of these things I think was cleverly done to make the book work on screen. Overall I really enjoyed the film. It is well acted, visually perfect and has a beautiful score. And I always like a great conspiracy theory. There are some problems with the movie, though.<br/><br/>One problem with the film is naturally all the information that has to be conveyed to the audience somehow. Of course all the dialogue slows the film down a bit, but I did not miss the hysterical tempo that could have been if the script had been cut shorter. Actually I think I would have preferred an even longer film if that would have meant more insights into why some people suddenly turned out to be ""on the wrong side"". These twists and turns are explained in the book, but come more or less as surprises in the film. If I had not known the story I might eventually have expected Sophie to suddenly point a gun at Robert, telling him that she had hired her boyfriend Silas to kill her grandfather and that Robert was the next in line! (Or maybe not, but I hope you get what I mean.) Another thing that I found less convincing is that Robert and Sophie at times do not seem to be in a great hurry, which is a mystery to me.<br/><br/>The puzzle solving is also a bit of a problem. It seems a little too easy and there is really no time for the audience to try to figure it out for themselves. I do, however, not see how this could have been done in any other way in this format.<br/><br/>At the end of the film the tempo slows down pretty dramatically, but this is necessary in order to follow the book's storyline. Having read the book I had no problem with this tempo change and I must say that the very last scenes, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's amazing original score, are just as intense as the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is definitely Sir Ian McKellan's interpretation of Teabing. He is extremely funny without ever being silly. I was also impressed with Paul Bettany as Silas, although I did find him ""just looking crazy"" in a few scenes. I am glad his role was not reduced to just looking crazy and brainwashed all the time, though, and I would have loved to see more of him.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast did a fine job, too. I do not understand, at all, the bad press that Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou have received. I found them totally convincing, but of course their parts are not as spectacular as that of Silas or Teabing.<br/><br/>Some critics have called this film boring. I do not agree at all. It is exciting and very often funny. Some scenes in The Da Vinci Code have been accused of being unintentionally funny, but I was very pleased that the audience last night never laughed at anything that was not supposed to be funny. The applause after the screening was not a thunderous one, but it was pretty widespread and I never hesitated to join in. Although it could have been better, I was not disappointed."

","The problem was always going to be how to get the ideas in the book across to a cinema audience , Howard manages a workman like job of this, but I felt viewers who may not be familiar with the story may have been confused by some of the ""leaps"" made in the explanations.Saying that it is very faithful to the book but Sadly Howard fails to capture the energy and tension of the novel and some of this has to be down to his choice of Hanks as Robert Langdon. Fine actor that Hanks is he just doesn't cut the mustard in this role, The Langdon character in the book comes across as slightly more dashing charismatic and occasionally Heroic , Hanks I'm afraid came across as a bit of a plumb !. Audrey Tautou is excellent and was everything I imagined the character of Sophie to be , Mckellen again does a superb job ,and Paul Bettany tremendous. The Loctaions were superb and Howard uses some techniques he first employed in ""A Beautiful Mind"" .<br/><br/>Its amazing how this film just does not capture the spirit and breakneck pace of the novel , which heaped revelation upon revelation on the reader and rather like ""24"" left you wanting more after each chapter.<br/><br/>Alas Howard and Hanks really were a bad choice for this film and some the dialog feels rather clumsy. If You haven't seen this or read the Book my advice would be read the book . If you see this you'll wonder what all the fuss is about."

I was really pleased when I heard that Ron Howard was directing some of Hollywood and Europe's finest talents. Imagine my surprise when I found myself getting a little bored during the movie. It had all of the elements, intrigue, chase scenes, mystery but no real sense of tension. The pacing seemed really slow and I have been wracking my brain to see where it all went so wrong.. I have come to the conclusion that there was so much story to tell that the characters spent most of the time explaining the background to the tale. The film I was hoping for would have been an intelligent version of ""National Treasure"" which although very slight was paced just about right. I think that I may have enjoyed the Film more if I hadn't read the book."
"vinod_amladi","9","0","2","20 May 2006"," Brilliant Movie
","Quick summary: I felt the movie was simply awesome.. it was worth the wait.<br/><br/>To back up a bit - I read the book a couple of years ago and felt it was a fairly interesting read.. I was more impressed by the way the book was written then by the actual content i.e. the holy grail, Christ's bloodline etc (though I must admit that I was very tempted to visit the Louvre, Rosalyn chapel etc while I was in Paris and Edinburgh for other reasons). After the book, I did catch up on a few follow ups on Discovery or the History Channel related to the DaVinci code but my interest really perked up when I saw Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou on the cover of a French magazine in Paris. I simply love Hanks and was just waiting for the movie to be released.<br/><br/>I saw the movie last night with my wife (who was not as thrilled about the movie) and here's my thoughts:- The casting is simply superb (except for Reno.. though he does a good job of the character cant Hollywood find anyone else to play a French cop?!!). Hanks and Tautou do a fine job and I felt the on screen chemistry was just perfect. The subtle smiles, the tension.. leaves the viewer guessing on whats going to happen next towards the end of the movie. The supporting characters are very well chosen and acted out. I also liked the direction and the overall pace and flow of the movie. I don't remember the book in much detail and thus did not compare if the movie was as good as the book."
"MovieRat-2","6","0","3","20 May 2006"," Is this even the same story?
","I read the book a week before the movie and, despite serious objections to the falsely claimed ""facts"" given by Dan Brown, I was drawn in by the engaging cat-and-mouse/treasure hunt story and wanted to see how this story can be adapted to the big screen. Despite the film's keeping to the basic storyline (search for the holy grail and its true meaning while evading multiple opposing forces) I left with the overwhelming sensation of ""what the heck did I just see?"" Granted, one can never transfer all the minute details, exposition, dialog, or action that the book contains into a 2 hour film; however, there is a fine line between editing out certain parts and adding new parts that have absolutely no relevance or relationship to the original story. In the film version of ""The DaVinci Code"", director Ron Howard not only crosses this line but leaps over it with reckless abandon. The pacing was all wrong, far too fast to develop any sense of tension (except the scenes where Silas physically attacks his adversaries). Character interaction in some cases were so different from the book that you are looking at a completely different person (see spoilers below). The ending was for the most part completely different (again see spoilers below). But despite all these changes, the overall film (standing on its own) was a serious let down in the entertainment factor. Bad pacing (as stated before), motivation of major characters changed unreasonably or were never explained, dialog seemed forced by some of the characters (Sofie and Langdon), and the ending just reeked of cheese.<br/><br/>6 out of 10. Definitely no where near the quality of film that Howard or Hanks usually produce.<br/><br/>********************************** SPOILERS **********************************<br/><br/>This is mostly for those who have read the book. As I watched the film I couldn't help but cringe or scream (internally, wouldn't actually do it in the theater) ""HOWARD YOU *******"" based on these blatant changes:<br/><br/>1) Silas's eyes are blue in the film, not red as the book states.<br/><br/>2) ""The Sacred Feminine"" theory that is so blatant in the book is not as aggressively ""preached"" in the film. A change that I actually found relieving. <br/><br/>3) Bishop Aringarosa, to put it bluntly, is not the same person. The book portrays him as a righteous priest duped by to find the Holy Grail in hopes of saving Opus Dei from being excommunicated and is horrified at what was done in the name of God. The movie, however, portrays him as a zealous member of a inner circle within the Vatican (no where mentioned in the book) who will do anything to destroy the Holy Grail including lying and murdering. <br/><br/>4)Fache's motivation for thinking Langdon is guilty is different. It starts off like the book, Sauniere left Langdon's name at the crime scene thus, in Fache's mind, Langdon is identified as the killer; however, later in the film we are told that Fache is after Langdon cause Aringarosa lied (as later revealed) that Langdon told the bishop he committed the murders in confession. <br/><br/>5) Fache and Aringarosa's relationship. The movie portrays Aringarosa as a manipulator like ""The Teacher"" and pulls the strings of Fache's sense of faith and duty by framing Langdon. When the truth is revealed in the end, Aringarosa is unrepentant and still hell bent on his mission. The book is nothing like this. Why Howard decided to make a blatant change to the story is beyond me.<br/><br/>6) Only one cryptex, the smaller one with the Issac Newton riddle, is kept in the film. Any reference to the larger (heavier) cryptex and the ""Sofie"" riddle are completely gone.<br/><br/>7) Langdon is approached by Collet at the lecture and not at his hotel room. Minor point, I know.<br/><br/>8) Langdon and Sophie's trip to the Swiss Bank is on foot instead of by Taxi (they even added a scene of Sophie paying a guy to not take drugs). <br/><br/>9) Rosalyn Church is completely different than described in the book. Don't know if the movie shows the actual church or not. Furthermore, Langdon and Sophie actually go beneath the church and find Priory documents and evidence at the sarcophagus was present. No such event was in the book. <br/><br/>10) Major changes concerning Sophie's family: Sauniere was not her grandfather but acted as one after Sophie's family died to protect her; Sophie and her brother were in the car wreck and only she survived; as stated before, her brother is really dead; it was her parents that took her to Rosalyn church not her grandfather; she was scolded (rather harshly) by Sauniere because she was trying to find out what happened to her family (not because she snuck into his room and found the key). <br/><br/>11) Langdon figures out the rose line riddle all on his own with absolutely no help from Sophie's grandmother. <br/><br/>12) Sophie confronts Silas in the airplane. This scene didn't make any sense. Not the way Sophie acted, but how Silas talked to her which I felt was totally out of character."

","It's hard to say for certain if this movie lived up to the hype. It provides a good two plus hours of entertainment, but doesn't leave much of a lasting impression and you probably won't want to see it again.<br/><br/>In my places the movie plays it too safe, it's almost as if Ron Howard is terrified of doing anything that might offend the Catholic Church. As a result, the film does not push the envelope as much as the book does.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks does a decent job as Robert Langdon although he seems to be without emotion for much of the performance. There also seems to be a lack of chemistry between his character and that of Audrey Tatou.<br/><br/>The best performances in the film come not from Hanks but from the supporting cast. Ian Mckellen, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany and to a lesser extent Alfred Molina account for most of the films more dramatic moments.<br/><br/>Yes there are many changes from the book, but the central plot twist revealed at the end is the same in both. In the movie though, savvy viewers will probably figure it out about an hour before it is revealed as it seems to be pretty well telegraphed through most of the films second half.<br/><br/>The film also seems to suffer from lack of comedy relief. There are perhaps two chuckles in the whole film. Granted, this is a serious subject, but even a serious film needs a bit of humor.<br/><br/>Is it worth the price of admission? Probably. Is it one of the best films ever made? Definitely not."

","OK first off i don't see why ""67rocks"" from sydney Australia is saying the movie wasn't good... there is no way anyone can make a movie that is as good as the book the da vinci code. they cant get every single detail into the movie. as i watched i noticed they left out some parts, but they gave you all of the main ideas and explained them very well. i agree with wrong actor... tom hanks should not have taken this role, he is a good actor but not serious enough to play robert langdon.<br/><br/>having read the book i knew what was coming and i knew what was going on. if you have not read the book i suggest reading it before watching the movie or you will be asking everyone what is going on... i heard ""what is this"" at least 1,000 times while sitting in the theatre last night.<br/><br/>i had such a pre-conception to what robert langdon was supposed to look like, so i couldn't really settle with tom hanks. overall i enjoyed the movie, it didn't blow me away, but i enjoyed it... my expectations were too high i guess, but it was a good movie."

There is no new information in the book, and even Brown's conjectures are not his.<br/><br/>But the history nerd in me enjoyed the movie, and the best part for me is Audrey Tautou's performance as she gradually awakens to her real origins, and what her life from the end of this movie, on, may be like.<br/><br/>In the sold out theater I was in, there was what seemed like respectful silence at the end of the movie. . .no applause, which sometimes happens on the opening weekend of a movie, but my sense was that the audience was moved, and it also seemed like about half the people got their cellphones out and were calling people about the film.<br/><br/>If you are literary at all, you will like this flick better than the book, I think."

","I think that a lot of people that give this film a low vote is because of its improbability. If you are looking for a historically accurate film, don't get your hopes up going to this movie. However, it is entertaining. I think that the most important outcome of this movie is that people actually ask questions about religion and not just accept what the Church tells the world to believe...<br/><br/>Also, I think that Audrey redeems herself from a slew of average movies since AmÃ©lie. I think that some viewers might miss a few elements of the movie because there is quite a bit of French dialogue. Most of it is translated but there are several times that someone says something that isn't put in subtitles. There isn't anything crucial, but it does add to the movie."

","Well I have just come in from seeing the fi-lum and I thought it was very good. I enjoyed it! I enjoyed it so much I have now seen it three times, I will be buying the DVD.<br/><br/>Just to think Tom Hanks stood in my foot steps when in Scotland. No shots of Edinburgh. Still Roslyn seven miles south of Edinburgh Scotland looks great inside and out.<br/><br/>I like the book also. So its not Charles Dickens so the fi-lum is not Gone With the Wind. Its a good thriller like the Thirty Nine Steps man gets murdered: man goes on the run; man seeks answers, mystery solved. <br/><br/>Puzzles to be solved, now the holy of holies what on earth was the Maltese Falcon all about and does it matter? Its a good film too. Like the Da Vinci Code.<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with the fi-lum but as always the book is always better, but at 603 pages its shortened for the cinema. I'll give it seven and a half out of ten Its no more far fetched than Mission Impossible. Well more believable actually. Any changes from the novel are for the better in my opinion.<br/><br/>I simply can't see what the critics have a problem with, hell its just a movie people like the Thirty Nine Steps. What the critics loved was BRICK which was lousy. God now that was a waste of money. Seems to me if the critics love it; I will hate it; if they don't like it I will love it, and most of the paying cinema going public would agree with me. Rather than the snobs who don't even pay for the price of admission.<br/><br/>Yes I recommend the Da Vinci Code to everyone who likes a good thriller. Its faction {part fiction part fact} like any Fredrick Forsyth novel. Dan Brown only took some true facts some true history and wrote a fictional story a thriller which makes a very good film. D.Brown did not write the historical facts! Facts are facts history happened or it did not, he only took the historical facts with some myths and added a fictional story. No one attacks Christian beliefs. Who cares if Opus Dei does not have monks? Who cares if the pyramid has 666 panes of glass or 669 its fiction. The Vatican is not attacked. Robert Langdon does say the Priory of Sion was a hoax. ""That's what they want you to believe"". If people can't follow the unfolding story its because they have the attention span of a goldfish.<br/><br/>Its not in my opinion if you have faith but do you have faith in what old men wrote hundreds of years after Christs death?. This is not a theology documentary but a fictional story and a damn fine story at that. See the movie and enjoy the story its very very good. Only the MTV 30 second attention span generation would have a problem and those who can't read subtitles. French people speak french to each other and not English. _____________________________"

","well the movie was great! i mean a lot of people think it isn't only because it says something u might believe in but come on if movies can't influence u that much.Even in the movie, Robert Langdon says ""It all depends in what you believe."" This movies isn't suppose to bring so much contravery as it has and neither should the book. Dan Brown and the director of this movie were simply making a great mystery story and I have to say that if this movie and this book wouldn't have left you thinking it wouldn't of been good. If u strongly believe in what you worship then there is no need to believe in what this movies contains. After all, Dan Brown has a pretty good imagination and has to have a great mentality to put all this together. To show that, the director made an awesome movie packed with action, mystery, and betrayal. The movie was great and i would pay again to watch it in theaters!"
"schwenkbl","5","0","2","20 May 2006"," Think ""American Treasure"" for grown-ups
","For all the hype surrounding it, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is somewhat of a letdown. At about 2.5 hours it was all I could do to not wake up my girlfriend and make an early exit from the theatre.<br/><br/>I'd never read the book so I didn't walk into the theatre with any expectations in that regard. However, I was somewhat disappointed that with such a smart cast and crew, the viewer has to suspend his disbelief for most, if not all, of the movie. Hanks solves the puzzles and codes a little TOO easily, and too much happens in such a short period of time. The smartest of men have worked their entire lives to do a fraction of what Langdon and Co. did in a few days.<br/><br/>There was no character development, save a few grainy childhood flashbacks, and the characters were rather unsympathetic. The dialogue seemed forced at times. Much of the movie I wondered if in real life Langdon would've stopped and said, ""Woah woah woah... slow down here! Why am I involved in all this mess and what the hell is going on?"" But he never did... despite the fact people around him were losing their lives, Hanks's character just went with the current, going where ever it took him.<br/><br/>I know this isn't a big deal but it bothers me... We never see a break in any of the action... we never see Langdon or Sophie or Teabigs or whatever his name is stopping for a bite to eat or a few hours to sleep or for a quick shower. Yet Langdon and Co. are going at it full-throttle; Langdon with a cleanly-shaven face and Sophie with her unblemished hair and makeup. I know, I know.. it's a ticky-tack thing to bemoan, but honestly I felt I could identify with these characters a little bit more if we saw them doing some of the routine simple things we all do in our every lives. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie wasn't THAT bad; I (and many like me) was let down because of the hype. Think ""American Treasure"" with a more sobering undertone. Everything happens too fast and everything works a little too perfectly for viewers to get seriously involved in what's going on on screen. It's apparent the world of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code depends on a lot of brains and a hell of a lot more luck for everything to come together for our characters at the right time."

","I don't know why there are so many bad commentaries. Here in Belgium I was one of the first to see the movie on the 17 of may. Maybe Ron Howard shoot of stayed by acting. I know it could better the movie but it isn't that bad. Tom Hanks (as Robert Langdon), Audrey Tautou (as Sophie Neveu), Ian McKellen (Sir Leigh Teabing) and Jean Reno (as Captain Fache) are all great actors. The fact that miss Tautou speaks English with a very bad French accent makes it great. The story is in France, Langdon is a American and don't speaks French so the French speaks English to Langdon, so of course there is a French accent in there English that makes is so great.<br/><br/>Il loved the book and the movie. There are some things that aren't completely the same as in the book, but the story is the same.<br/><br/>I really recommend this movie. If you don't like the book maybe you can enjoy the film. I liked it. I could be better if there was another director. For example Chris Columbus (the first two Harry potter's are still the best till now) or Steven Spielberg one of the best directors. But the choice was Howard, not a bad choice but I think because it is Ron Howard that the reviews are so bad, the story is great. The book is a bestseller in the world."

"rippa76","6","0","3","20 May 2006"," Everyone's a critic...a fine film that hits the mark
","Adapting a successful novel is a difficult task that greater directors than Ron Howard have failed. The screenplay for ""The Davinci Code,"" is a high achievement. Little is kept out of the film and that which is changed ensures the books themes and pacing are true. The use of flashbacks to give some of the novel's depth to certain situations (especially including Sophie's upbringing) were perfectly placed and well paced). Howard's use of visual effects to help the reader through a scene--first used in ""A Beautiful Mind,""--were valuable to the pacing of the film. <br/><br/>The casting is also spot on. Tom Hanks is being unnecessarily trashed for his portrayal of what is, by my account, one of the most poorly developed characters from a best-selling novel in decades. And I read a lot of novels. Dan Brown uses Langdon in ""Code"" for the second time, and thus, dispenses with some element of character development. Upon reading the novel I believed Langdon to be a very dull, essentially empty character. I thought only Tom Hanks or Kevin Spacey could fill the role of a peaceful academic caught up in an out of control situation without resorting to stuffed shirt foolishness. (Russel Crowe as Langdon would have been idiocy...I would NOT have seen that film.) Hanks appears to do an apt job of stuffing Langdon's turtleneck and getting out of the way of the story...which is this film's real selling point. Audrey Tautou made herself future millions, Jean Reno is great as Fache, Molina is very strong as the bishop, Bettany is adequate as Silas, and McKellan is a scene stealer as Teabing. <br/><br/>I've wasted a lot of units of $9.50 at films in my life, this was not one of those films."

This movie should have met the likes of King Kong, Titanic, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, but quite simply didn't reach anywhere above the Princess Diaries 2(a much better movie may i add). It was as sour as a sequel and as deprived of detail as my printing paper. Maybe a bit far-fetched but... lets hope in a few years from now we will see a properly done remake that isn;t going to tip us to the edge of utter boredom. Tom Hanks was just wrong for the part,he was much to old and passionless, like ''oops i found a keystone to the holy grail(giggle giggle)'' and their lines were stunningly dead. It was like they were forced to do the movie and desperately didn't want anything to do with it. Fache and Silas were the only two characters that struck me as good.

But I'm kinda familiar with history, so I new when I was watching the movie I noticed that some things, in the movie were presented as facts, where actually incorrect or made up! So you have to keep in mind when you're watching the Da Vinci Code that it's a mix of more fiction than facts! When you don't think about this, and you are not making any judgement towards any religion on this earth based on the storyline of this movie, it's absolutely wonderful and very exiting! I can see why there is al this media-fuzz about this movie, because fiction is presented as facts in the movie. Though, it's interesting that it maybe possible that indeed there is a small possebilty that Christ was married and evenso maybe had a child...so that sheds a interesting light on this movie.

","When the Tom Hanks character confesses that he once said a prayer to Jesus when he was a boy, a prayer similar to a boys desire for Santa Claus to bring him a puppy dog for Christmas, it was a moment that revealed what lied in the heart of the main character, nothing at all. Like any good fairy tale, there is a little bit of truth and a whole lot of make believe in order for a tale to be enchanting.<br/><br/>The Davinci Code is a very good bit of Hollywood movie making. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou are world class actors. Ron Howard made a very entertaining murder mystery movie. There was a good balance of tension rapped around the urgent need of the heroes to uncover a mystery.<br/><br/>The films shortcoming has to do with its biblical inaccuracies. Like the biblical inaccuracies redefined as doctrine within the Catholic Church, I'm afraid most fans of the book and now the movie will be seduced by this new cult that has been unleashed onto a naive populous."

Although the cast was perfect (Ian Mckellen was the very appropriate person acting Teabing and Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were very convincing too), it remained unused and marginalized by the lack of suspense. Also, interesting scenes of the book have been ignored while others have been changed dramatically in order to limit the duration of the film but that affected the transmission of the deepest ideas expressed in the book. To sum up the most interesting and thrilling book of the last 20 years turned into an ordinary adventure for pop corns.

","'The Da Vinci code' is not only a very well made film plenty of action and excellent performances, but also an interesting story which could be true or not depending on people. The film is quite similar to the book and although it is totally impossible to describe the whole book on a 2 and a half hour film, the movie is very close to the book. I like both, the book and the film. I do not understand why the critics have been so critic with it because 'The Da Vinci code' is full of action and very well made, other thing is that perhaps they do not like the story, but this is another question. What I do not understand either is the attitude of some powerful groups of the Catholic church, as a Catholic I dot not feel ofended by the film because it is just fiction, nothing else. There is no reason for attacking neither the book nor the film, if the Opus Dei attacks it is because this is a powerful, conservative and dangerous sect inside the Catholic church. But apart from what the Opus Dei say we live in a free society where there is freedom of expression and they should keep in mind that our society is secular and everybody has the right to think by themselves. I feel totally ofended by the declarations of the Opus, which are absolutely closed to the fundamentalist Muslims. In conclusion, I totally recommend this film to all those people who have enjoyed the book."
"Aquillyne","7","0","3","20 May 2006"," Good entertainment - don't expect much else
","The Da Vinci code (the book) is a clever story. The film makes excellent work of a clever story in a well-directed way. It cuts out the unnecessary sub-plots and complications (e.g. instead of solving a puzzle-within-a-puzzle, they just solve a puzzle), and adds to a somewhat drab book a certain elegance, grandeur and ethos. For worried book-fans, don't worry - it follows the book pretty faithfully, with obvious licenses necessary for a film.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is fantastic and atmospheric - although not so much so that it becomes over-the-top. The director must be commended for pulling off the story without taking it all far too seriously. Epic is not overdone and is sparse, mystery is not blown out of proportion but is gripping. It is very delicately handled by Ron Howard in light of the obvious success of the book: a very good adaptation; in my mind better than the book.<br/><br/>The film introduces (or emphasises) certain motifs and themes not as strong in the book, for instance putting more of an influence of the visual motif of a rose. This adds a certain style and director's license to the film which makes it more than just a book-to-film transcription.<br/><br/>Despite certain poor performances (odd extras, and Sophie Neveu), Hanks and McKellen, plus particularly Bettany, pull off their characters very well indeed. Silas (Bettany) is done extremely well.<br/><br/>Overall I feel this film was an enrichment to a good story, certainly worthy as a counterpart, if not as a replacement altogether. Grand and visually rich, it was certainly worth watching - but maybe only once."

As a Catholic, I was not in the least bit offended by the movie or the book, but especially the movie. Always keep in mind, IT IS A WORK OF FICTION. I feel that the book and movie can be used to strengthen or even encourage one's faith in what they choose to believe. It raises points that if researched, may actually bring you to deeper understanding of your faith. I hope that the movie will cause people to look into these issues for themselves. Don't take the movie as history. Too many people do that<br/><br/>Tom Hanks didn't give the performance of his life, but I felt he was pretty much the way I imagined Robert Langdon as I read the book. Sophie's character in the movie wasn't as strong as in the book, but I think that is due to time constraints.

I lot from the book is skip or changed but .. as it says in the credits.. ""BASED ON THE NOVEL"" not ""EXACTLY LIKE IT""..<br/><br/>This isn't THE movie of year.. or of the month.. or of the week. I mean, I know it will sell a lot, but its not a great movie.. Some people have said to me that the movie was slow.. and i say it was going on a little fast. for not-readers comprehension..it misses order and a lot of explanations. My apologies to Howards.. but this wasn't your best work. In other part, congrats to Hanks cause he did a good R. Langdong.. not what i would wanted ..but good anyways..<br/><br/>For my conclusion, the Da Vinci Code, its just that movie that you have to see.. only because it will be the most commented thing the next day. But i think the essence or the power and force of book and its ideas were lost in transition! Thank u!"

","With a book loaded with details, which covers a journey that almost can't be caught on film, why worry about the length of the film and the depth of details inside the movie? It's a wonderful journey, especially by the great acting of Audrey Tatou. Must see, even if you didn't read the book..The riddles, the suspense. Everything makes this movie one you have to watch. The chase in Paris with the Smart is crazy, but very nicely done. By all means, you couldn't expect anything more in the translation from the book to the cinema. Of course some people won't like the movie, especially because of the statements made. But when you look through those statements, it's a very nice movie, and the look of Paris and London makes up for some losses (like not filming in the Westminster)."

","I was highly disappointed with the DaVinci Code movie. After finishing the book I was anticipating a great movie, but it didn't deliver. I thought there were way too many plot deviations from the story line in the book. I understand that some of the plot had to be changed to speed the story along, but most of what was changed was either unnecessary or way off the original plot line. It didn't go as deep into the breaking of the code as the book did. It also seemed to me that Robert Langdon didn't know much. The book made him seem highly intelligent and in the movie he seems to be learning just as much as Sophie about the grail. The end took a VERY different turn and overall I was just annoyed with the changes. I am recommending to my friends to skip the movie and read the book instead."

","I have the misfortune of not reading the book. I understand a lot of people that have first read this story will be upset. I have already read reviews of people that are upset. It seems the only REAL complaint is that the book is much better. As a person that has not had the privilege, I enjoyed the movie. It was never dull, and it was never insulting. The characters were well played, and the story was non offensive. It could have criticized the church but didn't. It was an incredibly interesting movie and I highly recommend it to all. The only complaint I have is that I had to sit in an uncomfortable movie theater seat for two and a half hours. Go see this movie. My advice to those who have read the book is to separate the two in your head. It would be an insult for a movie to replace a novel. Movies of books have and will always be highlights, or they will be just one short interpretation of the story itself. This is a great interpretation."
"LaffingNow","7","0","3","20 May 2006"," Expect a provocative and intelligent thriller!
","A man runs through the Louvre museum in Paris, France past paintings as a dark figure pursues him. He falls while attempting to remove a large painting only to meet his death at gunpoint by a robed, albino assailant. Forced to reveal a secret before his demise, with his body later pentangled in the pose of Leonardo Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, this smart and intriguing film begins. Did the dying man, with his last ounce of energy, draw a pentangle on himself in his own blood and finally die in this Vitruvian pose (notable for Da Vinci's attempt to correlate the material with the spiritual aspects of human existence) in order to leave a material clue or evidence that leads to a spiritual revelation? After viewing the film, I think yes.<br/><br/>This movie was not what I thought it would be. It was more. Although fiction, it weaved a tale of theatrical suspense, drama, and excitement driven by an intelligent theme without delving into gratuitous violence or substitution of literary substance with the distraction of superficial action meant as filler. This is what I really enjoyed, thickening plot, interesting characters, dueling motives, the unexpected, and of course literary drama based on historical perspective. Scholarly Robert Langdon (actor Tom Hanks) and Paris police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (actress Audrey Tautou) initially form an uneasy team based on mutual motives to discover the identity of her grandfather's murderer, which later builds into a close and mutually inter-dependent alliance. The benefit of this alliance, each with their own open-minded contributions, is that their individual strengths support the other's weaknesses as they unlock the multi-faceted code.<br/><br/>The film's premise is that Mary Magdalene was not only the apostle believed to be John to Jesus' right in Da Vinci's painting of the Last Supper, but also was his wife who, after the crucifixion, bore Jesus a daughter named Sarah. Artful and intelligent, coded elements are designed to connect finally ending with the answer regarding the holy bloodline of Jesus. This cannot be revealed to the general public, as it would likely bring into question the credibility and legitimacy of Christianity based on the divinity of Christ. So there exists a rogue Christian sect that must ensure its secrecy and preserve the continuity of the belief that Jesus was divine and not just a man; for the revelation of even the possibility that Jesus sired a child would have indicated that he was indeed just a man and not divine (in the face of the immaculate conception), directly challenging the concept of the trinity. Additionally, does the aspect of apostolic gender jealousy enter into the equation? Suffice to say that there is plenty of evidence that Jesus could have sired a child.<br/><br/>Ron Howard did a fine job directing the audience to rely on examination of evidence in front of them. This combined with the fast pace forced the two main characters, and by extension the audience, to think on their toes and not just blindly and dogmatically follow what has been told what to believe. Look what the church had been doing for decades regarding pedophilia, which was protected by the clergy only to repeat itself. Its results are ethical, moral and financial bankruptcy.<br/><br/>One thing that I learned from established artist friends is that one never leaves the center of a painting empty (the masters would never do this). This artistic no-no came into distinct focus while reviewing Da Vinci's Last Supper. Da Vinci was a brilliant man and for him to inadvertently leave the center of an important painting empty I believe is unlikely. The patrons who commissioned it were furious at his four-year delay (1495 - 1498) but he refused to go faster. The empty space is there for a reason. Da Vinci was known at the time to dislike the direction of the Roman Catholic Church and was also known to be heretical. With obvious motive, and the fact that his main focus was his love for science and anatomy (artistry a bit of a sideline), since he only made 27 paintings (most incomplete) to approach these select few paintings with the embodiment of cryptic symbolism is not a surprising activity.<br/><br/>An interesting character development scene is when Sophie exhibits a proclivity for coolness under fire during the Parisian street escape lending credibility to the secret she and the audience were later to discover. This demonstration of a natural affinity for confidence and leadership in taking matters into her own protective hands while under physical danger underlined the feminine aspect early in the movie. This personal tendency would later inherently support the film's central revelation. Film notables include the saying ""The mind sees what it wants to see,"" laughter by the women in the audience when Sophie tapped her sole on a pond, and the final scene leaving the distinct possibility of a sequel open.<br/><br/>Again, like the furor over the Last Temptation of Christ, The Passion of the Christ, faith was not shaken or stirred. I was excited at the thought of watching the film knowing it would be controversial & provocative. My personal faith remains well intact as I continue to respect the authority of God while questioning the intentions of people and their misinterpretations of the Bible for personal gain. The Bible does not state Jesus married; however it does not state that he didn't either. But if you ask me, in a world so corrupt, insolent, unforgiving, arrogantly contemptuous, meaninglessly violent, sometimes seemingly headed towards some no good place, it would be a nice thought that the sacred bloodline perpetuated over millennia for salvation in our time. So my questions are these: What if the Sangre Real bloodline still endured today? Could it have survived to contemporary times in secrecy? And if it did, would that be a silent test for us as individuals and the public at large? Finally, what if this blood is within you? What would you do?"

","The book was written like a movie. Short chapters, quick action, suspense, etc. So the movie adapted well. In the movie Langdon is summoned differently, they change some of the character's relations slightly, but nothing you'd notice to be important. The flash back footage of Paris, Israel, London was great. They really took advantage of illustrating history visually. Audrey Tautou who plays Sophie Neveu is a 10. Movie was cool! It wasn't insulting to catholocism at all. The ""teacher"" who is the villain, is the one making the church and Opus Die look bad. Everybody else is cool about religion. People need to get a hobby. Stop crying every time a movie or show or book comes out that people say mocks your religion. People like that never even see the movies or read the books anyway. They're just bored with life."

Still, the major plot points are treated well for those few who don't know the story or the reason for the controversy. At times, the film does seem rushed, but at 2 hours and 26 minutes, extending the film any longer may have had the opposite effect, ie: the film seemed too long.<br/><br/>The movie plays out like the book, so expect a lot of flashback sequences, not just for the characters, but historical flashbacks that help to push the movie forward. <br/><br/>I wouldn't look for any academy awards out of this film, but it certainly does entertain, and for fans of the book, it is a real treat to see the story presented in a movie format. But for the casual moviegoer, I think they may struggle to keep up and follow the story cause there are elements left out from the book that could help explain certain scenes and motivations more.

"baka_kyle","9","0","3","19 May 2006"," When it finally ended, I recall smiling and giving the arm rest of my seat a good thump as I, myself, had triumphantly solved the whole thing.
","Having never read the book on which this film is based, I can safely say I hold no bias in either direction one might steer when gauging it's value. I watched this movie with an open mind and simply sought to be entertained. And I must say, despite a few odd things I noticed during my viewing tonight, I was thoroughly entertained throughout.<br/><br/>Firstly, let me say that the music here did not stick out for me until the end, as which point it was the driving force behind all you could see. The main theme to this film is beautiful. You'll find yourself humming it as you leave the theatre, I do not doubt. Onto the characters...<br/><br/>Tom Hanks did not strike me as the man who was born to play this role. He is, of course, a professional through and through and I got the feeling that he did the best he could. His character, however, did not seem suited to him. Mr. Hanks just does not strike me a deep thinker, not on this magnitude, although he does pull off a very casual method to it all as I imagine a genius would adapt. There are scenes where Mr. Hanks is in deep or frenzied thought, trying to sort through a puzzle of some sort in order to progress to the next step, and I can quite honestly believe that he is sorting it all out at the pace that is suggested. I credit the use of computer graphics for this more than his acting (the use of CGI was very well done here and showed us exactly what was on his mind and how he went about solving it). He doesn't give too much away by thinking aloud, nor are we expected to come up with it all ourselves. We're shown his thought pattern so he doesn't have to tell us and, so long as you are not an idiot, you can easily see where he is going and in most cases arrive at the same conclusion as he.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou's character did little for me. Serving as the character who asks all the questions that we, the audience, would like answered, she can certainly communicate a sense of motivation. Her character seems surprisingly simple until the last legs of the movie, where more focus is mercifully placed on her and we can truly begin to appreciate her. One funny little thing bothered me though, and that is her character's apparent superhuman driving ability. How she got as good as she did is never shared, nor does it seem we're expected to wonder about.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany did a fantastic job here. As a fanatically faithful servant of God, one willing to go so far as murder to uphold ancient tradition, he brilliantly conveys a man lost in his faith. A troubled character to be sure. I found myself pitying him not long after his introduction. A maimed and tortured soul to be sure.<br/><br/>Ian MaKellen steals the show the moment you hear him. The man is quite brilliant, and having him play a brilliant man was a logical and wise choice. Combine his earthly wisdom with some great lines (he made me laugh more than once) and you have a truly great character to watch and grow attached to.<br/><br/>The pacing of this film was spot on. I never felt rushed nor did I ever feel I was being dragged down. I received all the information I needed to appreciate the plight of the characters and I felt quite satisfied when a pivotal moment or clue is passed. I watched this film alongside my two cousins (who both enjoyed the movie as much as I) and was surprised to learn the movie is as long as it is. When it finally ended, I recall smiling and giving the arm rest of my seat a good thump as I, myself, had triumphantly solved the whole thing.. I loved the ending to this film, especially the music.<br/><br/>I need to get that soundtrack!"

","I find it disappointing that most of the negative reviews of this movie is based on the controversy centred around Jesus rather than on the actual storyline and quality of the movie. I have read Da Vinci code a year ago and at that point in time this book has not left much impression on me as much as what it has on others. I personally enjoyed Angels and Demons more than the Da Vinci Code and always thought that it will make a better thriller movie than the Da Vinci Code. So, I went into the cinema with very little expectation out from this movie.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, after watching the movie, it has rekindled my interest in re-reading the Da Vinci Code. I like the flow and the pace of the movie and it was very comfortable sitting through the two and a half hour movie. I think people has been too harsh on this movie. I am not going to argue about what are facts and fictions here. There is not a single moment of boredom and from the point of entertainment, it has certainly done its job. As a consumer, I could not ask for more. So, well done Ron Howard, Tom Hanks and the rest!"
"sarriagada128","7","0","3","19 May 2006"," An echo of the novel...slightly different, and not heard as well.
","Every now and then a best seller rises up to international fame, a film hitches the ride and punishes audiences with missing scenes, bad direction, story change and everything else that made the novel so special. This is not the entire case for Ron Howards 'The Da Vinci Code'. Normally i think it would be wrong to compare a film to its novel, however there is no secret to its popularity and it wouldn't be wrong to assume most of the viewers of the film would be the readers of the novel or Tom Hanks and/or Amilie fans.<br/><br/>The film in comparison to the book is not far off, only the occasional additional lines, that i will not give away, seem to be strategically placed to calm the Christians who were outraged by the novel. The character of Robert Langdon seems to be dumbed down and given a spiritual side, this i could imagine would outrage the most devout believers of the novels claims. However, i still think even though the film was not completely faithful (95% faithful) to the novel, it was still a good little puppy; following the main issues of the book. The film did create the atmosphere i remember reading about, i found myself sitting in the theatre and thinking 'this is how i imagined it' but then again i have seen postcards of France.<br/><br/>The performances of the actors were mediocre. Tom Hanks was lacking dimensions of a character known so well to so many, personally when reading the novel i pictured Harrison Ford in the pre-adventure university lecturing acts of the Indiana Jones movies. Audrey Tautou wasn't as great as i imagined her to be, my advise would be not to expect too much from her. Ian McKellen (Sir Leigh Teabing) was fantastic, i imagined his character to be stocky from the novel, but i forgot all that at once when seeing the charming old bugger.<br/><br/>The film loses a sense of revelation, which the readers of the novel apparently obtain. My guess it was done to calm outraged Christians, but it is my guess again why they would be watching the film. However with or without revelations, the film was entertaining and worth the watch. Bonza!"

The acting was well done with much of the dialog in French as it should be. (I hate to see French actors having to speak English especially when the film takes place in France). Despite how you feel about the theology of Dan Brown the author, the story is engaging and very entertaining. I don't believe that the film is going to undermine anyone's faith and I resent people saying that I or anyone else should't see it. I especially agree with the film's director Ron Howard that we need more films like this to get people talking and asking questions about the history and foundation of the Christian faith so that those who profess to be Christians know why it is that they believe what they believe.

The use of flashbacks can become annoying, but I found the visuals in them and throughout the entire film incredible. Once again Ian McKellen is outstanding and possibly saves this film from critical destruction.

","I personally liked the movie. The truth is that Tom Hanks doesn't feed in really well to the character of Robert Langdon we are all used to. Anyway Ian Mckellen as well as Audrey Tautou made a great job. Jean Renois perfect for the part of Bezu Fache. The script is very attached to the book except for the ending which is quite different. But for all the people who haven't read the book I suggest you watch it. It's a great movie. And it is also a great story. And for the people that did read it. Also watch it 'cause I think it's just about the best anyone can do which such a great book. And by the way Audrey Tautou looks fantastic!!!"
"safaribooks","9","0","3","19 May 2006"," Another Well Made Film by Ron Howard
","I went to see the film on the first day when it was released for the public. Having read a few negative reviews in the media, I was rather apprehensive about this film by Ron Howard. I recently purchased the illustrated edition of the Da Vinci Code, but decided to read it after watching the film, as I did not want to know how the story begins, progress and ends. Here I was inside the theater with no anticipation or expectation. The author, Dan Brown never claimed his book was based on facts, and consequently he called it a fiction.<br/><br/>The result was fantastic. I enjoyed every second of it's 149 minutes. It was Indiana Jones all over again, except the Da Vinci Code was a bit more intellectually written, a step higher than the average ""Boys Adventure"" story. During the hunting for the Holy Grail, the characters study several paintings by Leonardo Da Vinci, and found a clue in his Last Supper. Whether the person standing right side of Christ was Mary Magdalin or John the Apostle maybe debatable. But for the sake of the film, it had to be Mary Magdalin to whom Christ was married and bore a child. Apparently this information was considered taboo in the religious world, and certain factions within the religion tried to conceal that side from the public at any cost- including murders.<br/><br/>AS the story progress, there were a couple of times, the dialog seemed to be a bit lengthy when explaining some of the controversial theories. This is to be expected in a film like this, as it is going to be screened worldwide where there are millions of non Christians gather into their theaters to enjoy.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks has done justice to his character as Professor Robert Langdon. Ian Mckellan is brilliant as Lee Teibing who outshines all others. Audrey TauTou's Sophie is commendable. French actor Jean Reno- I haven't seen him since his appearance in Mission Impossible- is built for this role. Paul Bettany's Silas too was well done. The sound effects combined with the Dolby Digital was fabulous. All in all, Ron Howard made another good film to entertain the hungry audiences worldwide."
"abum190","7","0","2","19 May 2006"," I liked it- really
","I went into the movie with the knowledge that Cannes audiences laughed at it instead of with it, and was pretty worried. However, I was really wasn't disappointed with it, even at its lowest points.<br/><br/>Those lowest points come near the end when the story begins to drag into multiple endings that aren't necessarily boring but more anticlimactic. The involving action and plot twists leading up to the end should signal a more dramatic finish. The real finish works, but it seems like it could have played out in a more entertaining fashion.<br/><br/>However, the high points of the movie outweigh the occasional dull moment. The actors, for example, are quite good. I especially enjoyed Paul Bettany and Ian McKellan, but then again, they're always good. I've loved Paul Bettany since A Beautiful Mind, and it's encouraging to see that he's still finding good roles. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou have surprisingly little to do besides look scared/pensive/incredulous, but they do well with what they have. Regarding Alfred Molina, I wish we could've seen more of him- but not in the way we see more of Bettany. You'll see what I mean if you go to the movie.<br/><br/>And as for the controversy surrounding the movie- well, I was going to say that you should disregard it, but you really shouldn't. No one should change their faith over a movie or a book, and I don't think this sort of popcorn fare will. The debate has been over-hyped for a year or so since Dan Brown's book came under scrutiny by the press. All I can say is that the controversial ideas mentioned in this movie are just that- ideas, not proved or dismissed. If it means that much to you, don't see it. If you think you can get past it, then by all means, see it. It's fun and definitely worth it."

","I never read the book so I had the awesome privilege of not having any clue what to expect from the film. To me the worst thing any movie goer could gripe about is: ""...it ain't as good as the book.."" you know -the typical complaint against any movie made from a best selling novel. Otherwise,I have no idea why the critics hated this movie!! Probably to be different from the hype (a last ditch effort of balding flabby gutted non film makers trying to be off beat and radical) Admittedly this film has little action so if you need CGI and explosions in your ADD existence then it's true, this film is not for you. However, if you enjoy watching a mystery unravel before you this movie is about excellent. The pacing is faster than an early 1970's film but slower than say LAST BOY SCOUT. But I never found myself fidgeting in my seat or turning my cel phone back on. The characters are well developed and done so quickly enough so as not to keep you wondering why they are the way they are. Also the acting is very convincing. The film is written well enough to add a chuckle here and there without making a farce of the atmosphere. Also the writer doesn't make the main character a super genius amongst a band of idiots. Personally, I feel, being the film is set mainly in France had Ron Howard added subtitles, cut scenes without thought and paced it even slower he'd have ensured the critics of today to taught it as inspired and a masterpiece. Seriously, the only problem I had with the movie at all was that I guessed the mystery half way through the film. Yet despite that I thought it was great and I would gladly sit through it again. Please don't let this fall by the way of THE ALAMO or TROY it is definitely worth the watch."

","If you have read the book then the movie might not be your favorite. The movie lacks the focus of code breaking and turns into an Indiana Jones treasure hunt of the 21st century with very little detailed history of femininity. Some scenes are changed, skipped, and some dialogs are rewritten which makes it sound cheesy, rather sophisticated. <br/><br/>For the one's who haven't read the book, well they might like it. Overall, it is a good movie refreshing our minds about history, religion, and femininity.

","After reading reviews, I went to see the movie with a salt shaker... and came out wondering how the reviewers could be so blind. Ron Howard did a careful weaving of reality, recall, imagination and history which made it engaging and very satisfying. Having read the book, as well as Angels and Demons prior to seeing the movie, I was prepared to be disappointed in the adaptation to film. Instead, I was pleased at how well the important details of the epic were presented, and how well the boring details were reflected quickly. Impressive cinematography, as well as spot on casting for the rolls of Sophie and Silas. The only disappointment was the casting of the roll of Langdon (Tom Hanks), when the roll called for an older, more handsome man."
"Jasmin4","7","0","2","19 May 2006"," Better the second time.
","Saw this movie again yesterday and decided to simply sit and enjoy the movie without the critiquing and comparing it to the book. It was more powerful to me after the second screening and my emotions were more moved this time as well. All I can say is that Dan Brown is the literary version of the Wachowski brothers. His story hits me like the Matrix did. <br/><br/>Below is my review from the first time I saw the movie. <br/><br/>This movie is a niche movie. It is a GREAT movie for those who 1) have read the book and 2) are big fans of the codex nature of the book or 3) a big fan of the opinions found in the book. . If you have not read the book the movie will be a confusing 2 ½ hours of your life.seriously. You'll have to read the book just to make sense of the movie. The movie does not do well independent of reading the book. If you have read the book and what you enjoyed most was the fast pace action of the book the movie will bore you. BUT if you enjoyed the many religious explanations or following the clues to solving the code then this movie is for you. It's an intellectual movie. It's a movie that ponders and explores alternative Christianity. This is a movie that lays out in front of you all these alternative ideas of Jesus with references you may or may not agree with. It will make you think. Yet, it does have some action in the movie. <br/><br/>Acting: Mostly very good. Silas was too monstrous for me. He walked with a limp like some hideous monster. The way he acted reminded me of Frankenstein. I always seemed to expect him to say teacher ""teachhhhhhhherrrrrrrr"". My take on Silas from the book was a smart street wise man who found the church in Opus Dei. The movie version of Silas didn't fit. Tom Hanks was good and he got better as the movie moved along.<br/><br/>If you understand French that will help you 100% to enjoy this movie better. This movie had subtitles because when the scenes were in France the French characters spoke French. And that was the case for the first hour of the movie. It's authentic but if you can't understand French those subtitles were a bit cumbersome. This movie should be a hit in France.<br/><br/>The movie deviated from the book in a few areas and that made the movie a little more enjoyable because it made the movie less predictable. If you read the book then what happens at Roslin chapel in the movie is not in the book. What happened at Newton's tomb is not how it happened in the book either. Also how Langdon determines who is A. Pope in the book is NOT how it is done in the movie. So this movie took some liberties. <br/><br/>Scenes: Wonderful. The scenes are the reason I'll see this movie twice. It takes you inside all those fascinating places found in the book. You see Newton's tomb which is amazing. You visit the Templar church, Roslin chapel, and the Louvre. The scene of the sex rite was tastefully done but if you didn't read the book the movie does not explain what it was. Overall it's a great movie for the intellectual Da Vinci Code fan."
"kimg29-2","7","0","2","19 May 2006"," Entertaining to non-reader
","From early reviews I was anticipating a movie that would be boring, but found myself thoroughly entertained. The faster pace of the movie kept it from being boring and I enjoyed the story line and fairly easy to follow story, if some of it was predictable to me.<br/><br/>But then - I haven't read the book. My 13 year old daughter (an advanced English student and avid reader) had and updated me on all the differences in the movie, but felt the movie was worth seeing even though she has read it. Don't expect an epic film, or even worry if the leads are supposed to be romantically linked in their on-screen chemistry and you should be entertained - worth the price of an evening out."

It ended nicely though.<br/><br/>Well filmed and fairly well acted, I was a bit put off by the aforementioned slow pace in the middle of the movie. It was slow to get the people who have not read the book caught up, but for a thriller, it had too much dialogue.<br/><br/>Some scenes were beautiful, but the night scenes at the beginning were too dark. Don't the French know about electricity yet? I have no spoilers in this review, but I do recommend it to those who read the book.

","This movie is excellent, really good job. Photography, very good. Good action.<br/><br/>The performance of Tom Hanks, Jean Reno and Ian McKellen excellent, very convincing. <br/><br/>I do not understand why the Church has made such a big deal about this movie. Thousands of histories has been made about this topic and the church did not say anything about it.<br/><br/>There must be a reason why they pay so much attention to something that can be considered as social fiction and has not any proves to demonstrate that the Church is wrong.<br/><br/>Perhaps they have stocks in Hollywood and by forbidding something they make people wanting to go to see what is all the fuzz about.<br/><br/>Or, the main reason is that people will lose their faith or believe less in Jesus or God. If that happens so is because the church has done a terrible job along history in teaching faith and morale, when they have encouraged the killing thousands of people just because they think different. Why are they so afraid of, anyway?"
"Tony43","Null","0","3","19 May 2006"," So, God was NOT my copilot?
","Despite reports of bad reviews, I didn't find this one nearly as hard to take as I expected. That's not to say it is any Hitchcockian masterpiece, either, although it has a Hitchcock feel to it in places.<br/><br/>It is a slick, well directed, well produced Hollywood thriller/potboiler that, after an excruciatingly long opening sequence in the Louvre, is off and running, running so fast at times that it is hard to keep up with.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou star as two people on a quest to find the Holy Grail (so to speak) and Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina and Jean Reno, among others, play the bad guys dedicated to keeping them from their goal.<br/><br/>While the acting is uniformly solid, and the direction crisp, the film takes a good deal of suspension of disbelief for it to work, not in accepting the premise, but in making peace with the rich collection of murderous bad guys menacing the hero and heroine. Of particular note is Paul Bettany as an albino monk turned hit man who, when he is not trying to murder people, engages in naked self flagellation, apparently to atone for sins past, present, and presumably future. He was probably not intended to exactly provide comic relief for this story, but he is always just one step away from pure parody. In fact, in some ways he would have fit in better in a Mel Brooks movie and you can almost count on his being roasted on Saturday Night Live.<br/><br/>I have never been much of a Tom Hanks fan and he did little in this film to up my opinion of his work. Although saddled with an under written part, he failed to do much with what he was given and I never had any real reason to become emotionally involved with him. Over the years, many actors, from Jimmy Stewart to Gregory Peck to Joseph Cotton have played Americans caught up in intrigue in a foreign land and made us feel much more for them. Hanks went nowhere in my view. Audrey Tautou, not my favorite French actress by a long way, was also a little wooden.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the controversial content of this film, which does deserve being addressed. You would have to have just emerged from a time capsule if you didn't already know the ""secret"" before you watched this movie. So this was a film about process --how the mystery unfolds and how the protagonists go about solving it. And the only part of that mystery we didn't know in advance was the role Audrey Tautou played in it and I guessed her hidden significance almost immediately.<br/><br/>Which leads us to the theology. There was little in this particular theory of Christianity that I had not heard before, even though I have not read the book.<br/><br/>Yet I can understand how Christians would be offended by this one, since the basic premise implies Jesus was NOT god after all. But why his ""marrying"" or even just having dated Mary Magdalene would prove he was not god is never really explained. If you believe in the concept of god, then god could probably marry anyone he wanted. He could probably set the rules, too. ( ""No, I am not helping with the dishes or taking out the garbage and if I want to go out one night a week with my buddies...."" Well, you get it.) Also of concern to me is the number of murders churchmen are seemingly willing to commit here and who is behind them. The film seems to say they are the work of a ""rogue"" group of clerics within the church. Oh, yeah, we've heard about those Black Ops groups before. And I assume their role is to give the Vatican plausible deniability<br/><br/>Lastly, and this is the part that bothers me the most,is the sort of feel good ending dreamed up here, an ending that takes great pains not to come down on either side of the theological argument. Was Christ god or not? Tom Hanks' character tells us it doesn't matter, because he was a great profit no matter what. Hello? Try telling a couple of billion Christians it doesn't matter. Hell, tell Pat Robertson, Jerry Farwell, Doctor James Dobson and the rest of the Looney tunes who populate the airwaves that Christ was actually NOT god after all. Oops, our bad, they will say. All you guys we condemned to hell. You can come back up now.<br/><br/>Overall this one makes for some good moments, but it is not a movie you want to examine too closely, when unfortunately, its premise requires, no virtually commands close scrutiny.<br/><br/>A marginal thumbs up, but more for the direction than any other element."
"avril_larissa","Null","0","2","19 May 2006"," I suppose I set my expectations too high.
","I only finished reading The Da Vinci Code in April, and was really pumped for the movie. The trailers were thrilling, and Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen sounded perfect as Langdon and Teabing. Unfortunately, I never liked the choice of actress for Sophie Neveu, because she wasn't even remotely how I pictured her. I suppose I was sort of determined not to like Audrey Tautou during the movie, but she did a good job despite my judgment that she wouldn't.<br/><br/>I guess I just thought the movie would be better. A lot of important details in the book were changed, like the fact that Jacques Saunière was not Sophie's grandfather at all, but only assigned to protect her. A large amount of excellent bits from the novel were cut out, including the intense code breaking of the first cryptex on the plane, which hinted at Sophie's bloodline.<br/><br/>Of course, there is only so much you can take from the novel to put into the movie. Almost 500 pages of reading are hard to fit into a two and a half hour film. Will I buy it when it comes out on DVD? Most likely. It was enjoyable, and I always tend to be analytical of books turned to movies when I see them first (which is why I hated the third Harry Potter movie for some time)."
"mrsantUSCG","6","0","2","19 May 2006"," Almost entirely faithful to book, but the only change ruined it.
","This movie was one of the most faithful to a book I've ever seen. From the beginning it followed the book to a tee and I knew exactly what was coming next. For the first 2 hours I was impressed with seeing what I had pictured as I read the book on the screen before me.<br/><br/>**SPOILER ALERT** However when the movie finally departs from the book is when they portray that Aringarosa and condoned the killing that the teacher was doing, not that he was trying to stop it when he found out about it. No mention is ever mentioned that he wanted the Grail to force the Catholic Church to keep Opus Dei as a member. They portray it as if they were doing it in conjuction with the church to destroy the bloodline. That's okay I can live with that.<br/><br/>The other change though I could not and totally changed my opinion of the film. The ending with the revelation of Sofie's grandmother and brother are totally changed. In the film Jaques Suniere was not really her grandfather, and her brother is dead. When her grandmother is revealed, there's no emotion. She never thought her grandmother was dead in the film, she was never told that she was in the car. She never knew her.<br/><br/>That took away the whole powerful ending of the book, along with the scene I had looked forward to of the brother noticing the box.<br/><br/>Overall I gave it a 6 out of 10, during the first 2 hours I thought it would be the masterpiece I'd hoped for, unfortunately in the end they ruined it for me. Perhaps if I had not read the book I would not have minded this ending."

","The Da Vinci Code. Lately I've been hearing those four words a lot lately, both good and mostly bad. But i know that sometimes critics may be biased, so i went against the grain and I have to say, maybe critics aren't that right nowadays. This movie was extremely idyllic and thought-provoking and was no where near as disappointing many critics have touted it to be. Although the movie did have some flaws, very minor although: <br/><br/>Pros: -Acting was on-key and consistent, unlike the reviews. Tom Hanks, although not shedding his charm at all, still maintains to be interesting. Audrey Tautou has her moments as well. But the show-stealer is none other than Magneto himself-Ian McKellen, the most vocal about the project since the controversy. He is humorous, dramatic, condescending and fragile all in the same line and delivers with such a exciting intensity, it brings you into the movie. Paul Bettany also steals the show as the Opus Dei monk Silas, bringing a dark and eery feel to the movie. <br/><br/>-The cinematography. Howard knew how to film the movie in all of it's European splendor. From the Louvre in Paris to the Rosalyn Chapel, he focuses on mostly every detail in the room or city. <br/><br/>-The explanation. I personally decided to research Opus Dei and Priory of Sion before the movie and I can honestly say I could've not researched at all and still recognize most of the movie.<br/><br/>-The final shot. This is a spoiler: Seeing Hanks as Langdon stand over the glass pyramids, where the movie started, as the last shot was brilliant and unexpected. <br/><br/>Cons: -The editing. You'd ever think that something irrelevant is coming your way after 3 seconds of watching something else? Think about that while watching the movie. <br/><br/>-The claustrophobia side story. Kind of unnecessary if you ask me. Didn't need to be in there. <br/><br/>That's personally what I think about the movie. And go in with an open mind if watching. As Langdon says ""It is what you believe."" I believe this movie is something critics are panning to kill the controversy, even so this movie is way better than they said. <br/><br/>Breakdown: Acting-18/20 Directing-17/20 Cinematography-20/20 Screenplay-14/20 Music-20/20 Final Score: 89/100- B+"

There is simply no sense of urgency in the movie which the book had. The music did little to help the movie along. Sir Ian McKellen steals the show and gives the whole movie a more intellectual flavour. I was hoping for Sophie Marceau to play Sophie, there would have been a bit more life there.

It is not integral to the film but they moved around the important parts to fit the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is long, over 2 hours and does sometimes move rather slow.

"hherdocia","7","0","3","19 May 2006"," not great, but worth the admission
","I read the book a few months ago and noticed that the three Dan Brown novels I've read follow a pretty similar formula; Similar story + Similar Characters + meticulous detail = a decently interesting yet trite kind of novel. Brown's attention to detail is probably what made this novel-to-film adaptation receive less ""stars"" than expected. There were few significant differences between the novel and movie that stood out. Yet when you consider amount of info written in the novel about the artwork, the buildings, the Roman Catholic Church, the opus dei, the priory of sion, and Da Vinci, one should expect that some of the information has to be cut. Otherwise you'd end up watching one of those ""Da Vinci Code themed"" documentaries that have been trying to cash in on the hype. I liked that the actors were true to their characters in the novel. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were fine choices to personify the main characters, and Jean Reno is perfect for Fache as was the choice of Ian McKellen as Teabing. The acting was convincing, and the movie was filmed nicely. I didn't like how Ron Howard chose to shoot some of the history in the book (both the factual, and character back stories). Sometimes it felt like you had taken a mind altering substance that put you back in the time when these things happened. Characters would remain but the background would fade into the same place in a different time, and it felt more like a hallucination than a good transition. Additionally Tom Hanks would occasionally think a puzzle through and some CGI effect would float in front of him as if he were on a peyote trip Though the differences between novel and film are tolerable, they are not necessarily justified. While, I guess, the changes worked somewhat well with the movie, had the screenplay remained closer to the novel it probably would have worked better. In sum, yes the book was better than the movie, what was cut will bother Brown fans, what's different will bother people who love and read the book. Yet for those who haven't read it, the movie will probably convince you to pick up a copy of the novel and figure out what everyone is so bugged about. It was a pretty good attempt and worth watching."

In the movie Tom Hanks sort of matched my perception of Dr. Robert Langdon in the book. However, a few of my friends disagreed. Ian McKellen plays a magnificent role and steals every scene he is in. Jean Reno also matched the exact description and played the role of Captain Fache to a ""T"". The movie was slow at some parts and seemed like an adult version of hunting on a wild goose chase.

","""The Da Vinci Code"" is an excellent film with a really suspenseful punch. Tom Hands plays the lead role of Robert Langdon, a professorial role for him in this adaptation of Dan Brown's extremely successful novel. Audrey Tautou plays Sophie Neveu the fictional descendant of the Messiah. She has a charming screen presence and gives a very convincing performance. I found the part of Sir Leigh Teabing to be a most eloquent portrayal by Ian McKellen. He gives an electrifying performance that truly ignites the story. The photography is perfect under the direction of Ron Howard. His incorporation of the scenes and architectural sites in France and England are brilliant and cleverly woven into the theme. This cinema has the intrigue and energy of a James Bond thriller coupled with educational spots that titillate the imagination. Dan Brown's book has been given good justice by the director.

","If you are one of those people who never watch an adapted film because you think it will never be better than the novel it is based on, think twice. OK, again, the novel is better, but at least this time the result is good, and it is worth watching. First, it is good to see Tom Hanks in action, second, the director Ron Howard, did a good job.<br/><br/>The first minutes are incredibly fast, and it may confuse people who haven't read the book. The ones who know the novel, people like me for example, may have to think of the the original text sometimes, but it does not damage the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>As someone who has read the novel and seen the film, as well as a Christ believer and highly interested in history, I say we have to be always ready to learn and know fact that may (or may not) take us to the truth, no matter if sometimes we have to redo our own faith."

","I found DaVinci Code to be a beautiful film, thoroughly thought provoking, with much factual material embedded in the fiction, sort of like a Richard Armour version of U.S. history. At the Clark Theater it would be paired with Dogma, another film about Jesus' family in current times and also about the Roman Catholic Church. One should also read Dostoyevsky's chapter ""The Inquisitor"" in his Brothers Karamazov. Then of course there are all the slanders against priests and their problems with sexual molestations. Incredible, of course.<br/><br/>The DaVinci Code, in a word, is provocative, wonderfully, deliciously so, much as The Last Temptation of Christ was a few years back, or as The Passion more recently provoked, except on its head. Roger Ebert says enough about the films good points as a ""film"" per se: good acting, good direction, great music, delightful setting, suspenseful enough plotting. It did follow the novel closely, thank you.<br/><br/>One theme worth noting is that of the feminist issue. There was an Emperor Constantine and a Council of Nicaea, and the place of women have had their ""inferior"" place in church history since and before it.<br/><br/>The film has exposition, yes, and complication, complication, complication, and its denouement is not altogether satisfactory, yes, but if the film has predictable elements, it is very satisfying altogether very much and deserves better than its negative clamorers."

"kpizzle0104","7","0","4","19 May 2006"," Not boring if you understand or have read the book
","It is frustrating for me to read reviews that comment on how boring the movie was. I can imagine for those that have not read the book it would be quite boring, but for those of us that have, the outcome should have been expected. The screenplay is adapted from Dan Browns novel as we all know, which follows an historical theory to the bloodline of Christ. No one that is familiar with the novel should have expected this film to be an intense action packed thriller. The plot of the film was exactly that of the novel, we can't blame the writers of the film for a poor plot...that is something you'd have to take up with Dan Brown. The movie is a history lesson (theoretically) not an action movie, its purpose is not to watch the police chase the suspects but to follow the pieces of the puzzle and uncover the mystery as the characters do. This movie and novel force people to think outside of their original paradigm regarding the Christian faith; that is, to possibly consider another aspect to truth about Christ.<br/><br/>Overall i think this movie was worth the $10, but only if you are a fan of the book. Of course i do enjoy the book adaptation better, it seems to leave a little more to the imagination, whereas the movie sets our thoughts in stone. But as you watch, don't blame the actors, directors, or writers for a boring movie. It was more closely drawn from the book than any movie I've ever seen (granted a few scenes due to time constraints). Ultimately they should have made Dan Browns ""Angels and Deamons"" into a movie before ""Da Vinci Code"". I believe it was the better of the two novels and it is also the first time the reader is introduced to Robert Langdon; which would have gave the viewers a better understanding of his character. Tom Hanks played him well, but this was not his best role. Again don't expect a thrilling police chase full of explosions, chase scenes, and fighting. This is no love story nor an action adventure, and the movie producers have nothing to do with the intensity of the plot, they made it exactly as it was meant to be portrayed."

However, after the movie was over my sister, mother, and I all turned to each other and said, ""That was great!"" I do not understand the harsh criticism of the film, because THE Film IS NOT THE BOOK. Perhaps from all of the buzz surrounding the movie, people have built up such a high expectation of the film. I am at a loss as to why everyone is coming away so disappointed. All the scenes are beautifully shot and I thought the performances were spectacular. There were many moments of tension. The intensity was so great that I jumped in my seat a couple of times. Like the book, the film generates discussion.

Overall experience it and relive the feel - its greatly done. <br/><br/>I think both actors are great, i don't know why people are gossiping about Hank's hair and the chemistry with the lead lady, all were fine.<br/><br/>what would you rather want a US actress giving a fake french accent? Ian Mckellen does a great job - Audrey too had the class to represent royalty. i cant say how a person who hasn't read the book or doesn't know about these strong theories would react to the movie. might be too much for them to learn. but overall its great entertainment! and Hollywood should do more original stuff than make stupid movies like MI 3. they actually called the organization IMF - impossible mission force, how dumb is that? The Davinci code had a lot of ground to cover - in compressing the book. some small parts had obviously to be left out. and as always a book is more descriptive than a movie.<br/><br/>but the point is - its great entertainment - a very well done job. at least people will pay more attention to art, davinci and all the good stuff. rather than focusing on the usual oil-war-terror nonentertaining crap."

",".... as it's not as good as the book but I wouldn't say that it was a major disappointment. The build-up was good, but it seemed to linger too long in France. It was a little slow to start, but once it got started, it moved along pretty well. It was well cast, though I did find it difficult when I first heard about Tom Hanks in the role, preferring someone a little more like Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones, though when he is being a professor rather than an archaeologist. But he surprised me and was actually rather good. Same with Audrey Tautou, and most of the central characters were well cast.<br/><br/>There were some odd moments though, like when the Bishop visits the Vatican Council and plays pool with what I can only presume is the Pope and then has a supremely modern mobile phone. Or Silas's phone and car, when he lives in a cell in order to bring himself closer to God. Little things which don't make sense. If the geography of London is not known, then it is easy to believe that Remi manages to drive all the way to Tower Bridge and then back across the river to Docklands (some 6 miles from Temple) in the same time that Langdon and Neveu take to get to Westminster on a bus only half a mile from where they started off. Plus, there's several libraries closer to Temple than Chelsea, it being on the other side of Central London, including the library originally in the book, and only a five minute walk away.<br/><br/>The scenes in the Louvre and Paris were fabulous though, and made me really want to revisit Paris. Several little things were left out of the book though, which was slightly disappointing, though, all in all, it made for a thoroughly entertaining film although I recommend that you read the book first!!!"

Anyhow, the music is a bit disturbing and feels a bit too much Hollywood sometimes, but otherwise it's one of the greatest movies ever. Only ones who criticize is people who haven't read/understood the book or people in Opus Dei or other religious movements. Tom Hanks as professor Langdon is also great. Some of my friends thought he was boring and to be honest, he is at a few moments, but he is in the book as well and since it's the book that came before the movie, the movie has to follow the book. And it sure has. I believe that it's sad though that they met such a resistance from the church. I mean, they weren't allowed into Westminster Abbey, they didn't even got an explanation. In Moldavia, the press had wrote a report on the film before it had even been showned to the world, telling everyone about how it would split the country and so on and so on. Judging by the fear of the churches all around the globe and their influence on the criticism of this movie it's obvious that they're in possession of too much power, which is really sad since it's a great film!"
"synkronized-1","8","0","2","19 May 2006"," the greatest secret of our time
","The book was great. It's even one of my favourites. My hopes where quite high when I went to see it. I mean I liked the movie very much, but there was still something missing. I expected a little more of it. Ron Howard is a great director. So I knew that it can't be a total disaster movie. The movie started off really quickly and evolved pretty fast. I doubted if Tom Hanks could handle the role of Robert Langdon. I thought they were so much different, but when I saw the movie I knew I was wrong. Hanks did a great job and looked more handsome than he's ever looked. One of his best roles lies within Langdon. Audrey Tautou was brilliant. I've never seen her in a bad movie. I think that her person helped to put out the best of Sophie Neveu. And I think that Leigh Teabing's character (played by magnificent Ian McKellen) was really the first one who brought in some relaxiation. In the meaning of jokes. First the movie seemed to be a bit of tense, no real laughs, but Teabing and he's three questions seemed to be the ones that people really laughed about. Good Brithish humour never dies apparently. And I also must mention that Paul Bettany really was Silas. Although I would've made him maybe ever more pale. I don't even need to mention how good Jean Reno was. However I would've liked to see more of the Remy character. He was not given so much role here. Somewhere in the middle of the movie I started to mix the book and the movie. And things got a bit different, but I didn't let myself disturbed from it. I understand that it's a difficult job to transform such a complexed and informative book into a movie and certainly you can't put everything in it and you usually have to change something. The one thing that bothered me a bit was the ending part. If the beginning was fast, then the end was a bit too slow and it got a bit boring even. And again,everything wasn't quite like in the book. And they didn't do IT:( And what I really have to say is that they visually did a wonderful job with the secret of ""The Last Supper"". Technology is a good thing! I certainly hope that there will be more close to the book scenes in the DVD near future. It's not necessary to read a book before watching the movie, but if you have read it, the more exciting things you know. And don't let yourselves disturbed for goodness sake - it's just a fiction! A brilliant fiction!"

Of course, I have to say what has become a clichÃ© when a film is adapted from a book... the book is better, so if you liked this film (or didn't like it) and haven't read the book yet, I suggest you do.<br/><br/>The film is very entertaining with a brilliant cast. The only person I have to say I was disappointed with is Sir Ian McKellen, who was definitely ""chewing the furniture"" in this one as the eccentric Sir Leigh Teabing. He took it a tad too far! The star of the film is most definitely Paul Bettany who is simply terrifying as the albino monk, Silas. Its nice to see him in a film that isn't a chick-flick or a romantic comedy! As always, Jean Reno is very good, but unfortunately we didn't see enough of him.<br/><br/>If you like a good thriller, and don't like films that instantly spell everything out for you, go and see this film. Its definitely worth the price of a ticket and you're bound to find some part of it entertaining. But if you don't like these kind of films, or your moral values are likely to be offended by the content matter (and we all know what that is.

","Having read the book I wondered what plot lines would be abandoned. I was surprised to find the book's plots were more or less intact. A good point and a bad point. Good in that a complex interesting book found its way to the screen more or less intact, bad in that the film turned out overlong and rather too talk laden (plot lines were talked of rather than shown). The actors stuck to the task well enough but were so busy explaining things that they hardly emerged as people. On the whole baddies did better than goodies. I have rated the film 7 rather than the 6 or 5 it may have deserved, probably as a reaction to the ungenerous reviews of the professional critics which nearly prevented me from seeing an interesting effort of filming a complex book with some good action sequences, nice plot twists, some splendid photography and a bit too much gore for my taste."
"BrentKailbourn","8","0","2","19 May 2006"," As Jesus himself said, ""Who do you say I am?""
","Quite simply Dan Brown is a Gnostic. He has his reasons to attack the Catholic Church for it's 1500+years of pushing the Gnostic faith towards irrelevancy. However Dan is guilty of horrid prose, tepid dialogue and playing free and easy with facts. And He's retread a formula (a mysterious man assassinates an elderly leading authority in a field whose female progeny teams up with Robert Langdon to set about to discover a conspiracy through esoteric clues...) that he has made millions off of - which is a literary sin but not heresy. And he ends every single chapter with a mini-cliffhanger fooling people into thinking the book is a real page turner. I was rather exhausted with his books. Onto the movie. Ron Howard did an excellent job with integrating history (the crusades, nicean council, knights templar) into the flow of the movie. And they gave a more fair and balanced approach to the material with Langdon being rather skeptical at the beginning. The big explanatory scene with Ian McKellan is the best in film since Donald Sutherland's Mr. X in JFK-a movie the DaVinci Code should truly be most compared with. Some people will find the movie slow going-even boring. Not enough chase and CGI special effects. But at least it does involve thinking-unless the viewer either buys all of Dan's half-baked theories or prejudges against the hidden story. I for one found this movie to be far more thought provoking about the nature of Jesus than Passion of The Christ. But it's still no Last Temptation Of Christ."
"MSchnitzler2000","9","0","2","19 May 2006"," interesting story well presented
","I saw the movie today and I liked it very much. I had read the novel before. So I concentrated on the question how the director of the movie presented this quite difficult and complex story. The journalists who saw the movie at the festival in Cannes severely critized it, but I think Howard did a very good job. I cannot understand why so many critics said that the protagonists spend too much time with talking which would make the movie boring. If you compare the plot of the movie with the book, you will see that the long explanations (e.g. about the conflict between paganism and Christianity or the hidden codes in da Vincis ""Last Supper"") have been shortened to the most important facts which you need to understand the story. The cracking of the mysterious ""cryptex"" is much easier in the movie than in the novel. Some dialogues and explanations appear at different positions. So the movie constantly switched between talk and action and so becomes lively and interesting. The director changes or even adds some scenes. Langdon and Neveu don't go the library in London, but use a mobile phone with internet access. At Rosslyn Chapel Sophie learns the truth about her family from Langdon, not from her grandmother. The scene with the blood dripping into the basin pointing Robert to the ""rose line"" in Paris isn't in the novel. Howard also added the fact that Bezu Fache is a member of Opus Dei. But all these changes and additions don't reduce the quality of the story. The only minor point of critic I would like to mention is the scene in Westminster Abbey. The producers were not allowed to stage the movie in the original church and so they had to build a copy of Newton's tomb. This work was not done very well. You can easily recognize that the big orb on the tomb is made of styrofoam.<br/><br/>So you should not discuss whether the catholic church or Dan Brown has the correct theory about Jesus, but enjoy the novel and the movie. Both are excellent!"

","I read the DaVinci Code over a year ago. Reading the book did prepare me a bit for the references to secret societies but the complexities of the various histories were hard to retain in memory, so the movie seemed fresh in that regard. I was more intrigued by the history of the use of symbols than the religious controversies.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Salvatore Totino is excellent. I love his use of colors, the blues, grays and shades of light. Totino's camera-work is an actor in this movie, too. The dialogue/ screenplay is crisp, respectful and occasionally amusing. Howard's direction is tasteful and excellent. The story jumped with energy and suspense.<br/><br/>I may never get to Paris or see the Louvre, so I found the movie's various settings intriguing.<br/><br/>Great acting by Hanks, Tautou, McKellen, Reno, Molina and others. I take exception to the previous reviewer, George Floyd's comments on Hanks' performance. I felt Hanks captured the sense of an academic caught unprepared in the middle of a violent power struggle. While I enjoyed Tautou's performance, her character was confusing to me. One minute she seemed in control then she slipped into confusion, and her input as a cryptographer was minimal.<br/><br/>It is a thought-provoking story that if treated respectfully by those who disagree with it's premise could be a vehicle to revitalize interest in religious history. While I was raised Methodist, I became a Unitarian Universalist at 18. So, questioning history and seeking facts appeals to me because, as a UU, I am an active participant in my own spirituality. Do I think the theories presented are true? I am not a historian but I feel there are some small truths buried in the complex theories of conspiracies. One fact and it is a fact, millions of women were killed during various witch hunts over the centuries and it saddens me that we, as humans, can be so cruel, for if Jesus stood for one thing, he stood for compassion and love of his fellow human beings."

I was surprised that the audience at Cannes laughed at the most intense parts, but went anyway. I read the book about two months ago, well after it became popular. I really enjoyed the novel and was quite excited to see the movie. It is an action packed book, which I believed would translate well onto film.<br/><br/>The movie was excellent. There were some points that were a bit awkward, but that can happen in all movies. They changed the story somewhat, but it did not change the theme of the movie. In response to the controversy surrounding the book, I feel the director, Ron Howard, and the writing was well done enough not to throw the ideas of Jesus having children right in your face. It focused more on how Jesus was still great, and does it really matter that he was a father? I am not really religious, but I saw the book and movie as FICTION.

","Well for the past 6 months we've trudged through the court case, the controversy the endless documentaries spouting theories surrounding what is deemed as the most controversial thing...ever. And then came the film...<br/><br/>First off, I did read the Da Vinci before the film came out and enjoyed every minute. It was a guiltless, fun, enjoyable and thrilling read and when the film was advertised I was quite excited. But as with many of these hyped-up blockbusters it's bound to suffer backlash and in this case I wasn't overtly surprised that virtually every critic under the Sun took every opportunity to nit-pick on the tiny details and then say it's one of the worst films ever.<br/><br/>Before I continue, I would just like to take the opportunity to say that I enjoyed the film. Although many accuse Hanks' performance as ""woody"" at best, he was playing to the best of his ability to the lines Goldsman provided. It wasn't the most polished script but I thought the film was wonderfully edited, acted to the extent it could and shot in brilliant locales. I especially thought the transition between modern London to Newton's London particularly inspired.<br/><br/>This is slightly ironic considering the film itself was about, I reckon, 80% faithful to the book and the book was hailed as an intelligent, fast paced thriller -a real page turner! These critics really can't make their minds up can they. But then again we mustn't forget there is a distinct difference between book and film and although the book was good the film did lack the pace that was expected.<br/><br/>Still though, it was a good film although not the most technically precise however with all this hype we must sit through the Da Vinci backlash and hope that soon, in the not too distant future, we all having something else to talk about because all this controversy is getting slightly tiresome."

When the film finished there was total silence in the cinema, it was the silence of people thinking of the film and it's contents and satisfaction at having seen an outstanding film. In my opinion the critics have slammed the film, not because it is a bad film but because they think they should and were to scared of being seen to agree with the film's contents. They should mark it on it's premise and it being a work of fiction and not it's so called attack on Christianity. My advice is go seen this film, enjoy it for what it is and make your own mind up."
"dglink","9","0","3","19 May 2006"," Fine Adaptation of Dan Brown's Intellectual Thriller
","There must be a vast clerical conspiracy to use film critics to convince the movie-going public that ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a dull, inept, and plodding film, because Ron Howard's adaptation of the best-selling Dan Brown novel is anything but. Although the movie is far from a masterpiece, it does engage the thinking viewer and holds attention for its two-and-a-half hour running time. Like the film version of ""Gone with the Wind,"" Akiva Goldsman's script feels like the entire book has been covered, even though logic tells you that much has been omitted from the long, detailed work. Unfortunately, the script apparently has been softened by political correctness throughout, and several instances of ""but that's only a theory"" pass between characters that must have forgotten that few Biblical events have ever been proved with incontrovertible historic evidence. However, unlike Oliver Stone's ""JFK,"" ""The Da Vinci Code"" does not blur the line between history and fiction and, thereby, confuse less-informed viewers. Anyone with the intellectual curiosity to pursue the subject will be more confused by a reading of ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail,"" the book that inspired the novel, than by a viewing of this relatively safe film.<br/><br/>For avid readers of the Brown novel, Paul Bettany perfectly embodies Silas, the albino monk. Bettany captures what could have been a cardboard villain and imbues him with the glow of a true zealot whose trust has been used for evil. Ian McKellen shares top acting honors with Bettany, and, with devilish charm, he effectively carries the heavy burden of expounding the theories and history that surround the Holy Grail. Grainy footage is often used to add visuals to McKellen's historic details about the Knights Templar and to some of the characters' relevant memories. Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon is effective, if not dynamic. His oft-criticized long hair works in the context of the film, and the English of his partner in the search for the Grail, Audrey Tautou, is easily understood. Her accent is nowhere near as thick as critics have declared. Readers of the novel will enjoy the scenes that were shot on location in London's Temple Church, the Louvre Museum, the Rosslyn Chapel, and other sites that are now famous from the book. However, somewhat disappointing is the elimination of any mention of the 19th-century priest in Southern France who gained great power and wealth from something that he found while renovating his old church.<br/><br/>While ""The Da Vinci Code"" does move slowly, the script has much information to impart, and the film could be termed an intellectual thriller, because the excitement is found more in the pursuit of clues, ideas, and truths than in chases. However, while Hanks and Tautoo have several tense moments, and Bettany provides a few bloody scenes, the movie is not for the action crowd. Unlike ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" the film is not for religious people who want to explore spiritual issues. Instead, Howard has crafted an intelligent thriller for inquiring minds who are not afraid to ask questions. As a fan of Brown's book, I was not disappointed in this wide-screen illustration of the novel, which may send me back for a second reading. The extent of the conspiracy to degrade the film has even extended to revisionist carping about the quality of the novel, which was generally received as an exciting read. Could countless millions of readers have been wrong? Hardly, and countless millions of viewers of the film will likely enjoy Ron Howard's fine adaptation and later relish some lively conversation."

I don't want to say too much about the movie since it did just come out and don't want to spoil it for others, but just to say that it was excellent and if you have an open mind you'll get delightfully wrapped up in this treasure."

I consider it a well done flick.<br/><br/>If you base (the book's) success on sales, then the movie should surpass that handily. One of my jobs, before retiring was screening carry-on luggage at an airport. ""The Da Vinci Code"" seemed to be everywhere.

","Slight variations from the book, but when you watch the movie, some of the differences make sense. The guard is not pointing a gun at Sophie Neveu, but she and Langdon escape without confronting him. History depicted in the book is shown in purple as flashbacks, in scenes reminiscent of Braveheart and Gladiator. The hint of graphic imagery in the book, ie. tightening the cilice belt around thigh, is made more intense in the close ups. Langdon is shown to possess a photographic memory, which proves to be beneficial later in the movie. The ghostly animations in London, and cross sectional views of Westminster Abbey set apart filmmaker from the novelist. Time factor is another issue addressed by Mr. Howard. Instead of wasting time (as noted by Langdon in the movie), they borrow cell phone and search the web, finding name of Alexander Pope. The Neveu lineage and family is brought into question at the Rosslyn Chapel, and largest tangent from the novel. Sophie is an only child, and not related to the young male tour guide at the chapel, though a crowd of strangers are brought into the chapel to show Sophie people willing to sacrifice themselves to save her lineage. At the end of the novel, Langdon is depicted as standing below the ancient Rose Line in prayer to Mary Magdaleine. The movie end seems more accurate for someone visiting the Louvre after hours. Langdon is outside, standing over one of the Arago Medallions, pondering the puzzle ""She rests at last beneath the starry skies"". This final departure from novel is followed by the camera work spiraling down the pyramids, to what is depicted as a secret chamber beneath the Louvre, and the sarcophagus of Mary Magadeine.<br/><br/>The movie never slows, providing a definite conclusion, though finding the tomb of Sir Isaac Newton should have been more complex than clues found through a cell phone."

","This film is underrated by critics because of how a lot of people do not like Dan Brown because of his theory of the holy grail. What they do not do is concentrate on the acting and how it is Filmed. I enjoyed this movie because of how it was Filmed the exiting plot even though it was a bit offencive to some people. I also thought it had a strong cast including two time academy award winner Tom Hanks who also starred in Philapelphia, Forest Gump and Saving Private Ryan and starring Sir Ian Mckellen who starred in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and the X-men movies. So over all I thought it was a good movie with a strong cast good filming. I think it was better than the book."
"mattrocksusuck","10","0","5","19 May 2006"," A great movie to see
","This movie stood up and overcame the criticism. Many critics believe that Robert Langdon's (Tom Hanks) part felt flat in this movie. It was supposed to be a more serious role than we are used to with an incredible actor such as Tom Hanks. The acting gave off the impression of a very serious professor. That's is who Langdon was meant to be. Ian Mckllelan is the actor who brings the livelihood to the set. The same was in the book. The ability for a director to condense a 500 page book into 149 minutes is rare. Ron Howard did an exceptional job including all the major details. This movie was meant to be dark, serious, and overall thought provoking. And that is just what it did. Tom Hanks' performance as the professor brought the mood to the theater that this movie will get your mind actually thinking, a feat few movies have accomplished. Paul Bettany as Silas was thoroughly convincing. True to the book, it brings out the sense of deceit and confusion. Where does the fact begin and fiction end? I give this move 10 stars. A phenomenal cast along with great directing, make this movie a privilege to see. And, come on! Who doesn't love the dreads that Hanks is working? Huh?"

","The Da Vinci Code - Ron Howard's adaptation of the infamous novel in which Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou, a favorite of mine) unmask a mystery involving Mary Magdalene's place in the Catholic Church, and the finding of the Holy Grail. I've been told by nit-picks that I don't include enough plot details. You want a total synopsis, see the movie.<br/><br/>Anywho, Lot of big names in this one, and not coincidently, a lot of good performances. Hanks does well as Langdon, and Tautou even better as Neveu. Ian McKellen has great fun with his screen time and is quite good at clearing through lengthy exposition (There's quite a bit in this movie, but it's all done quite well). There's suspense and intrigue, and no one is quite who they say they are. It kept me on my toes for the movie's two and a half hour run. Jean Reno and Alfred Molina have slightly less time on screen and bring strong support to the table. Paul Bettany is quite shocking and scary in his role as Silas.<br/><br/>The film is about 98% fiction, but personally I've always wondered why we've promoted Jesus into a deity. ""Does mortality take away the splendor of his deeds?"" is one of the themes the film goes into, and it really makes you think.<br/><br/>I have not read the book, but I am told that this was pretty much the same experience. If you liked the book, you'll like the movie. If you haven't read the book, give this film a run. It's a summer blockbuster suspense movie that makes you think. I couldn't have asked for more. This film gets an A-"

","The film starts when Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is lecturing somewhere in Paris at the exact same time as Jacques Souniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) is followed and murdered by an Opus Dei monk in the Louvre. At his book signing Langdon is approached by a French policeman, who wants him to look at a photo of the crime scene. Langdon is taken to the Louvre to see the crime scene itself. And this is where the charming police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) appears on the scene and warns Langdon that police captain Fache (Jean Reno) suspects him of murdering Jacques Souniere. Langdon and Neveu try to figure out the clues Souniere left for them which leads them on a quest for an important secret kept by a secret society.<br/><br/>Now, I know that almost everyone has read the novel by Mr. Brown, and there's not much I can do to ruin the story for most people. However, I'd like to stop my summary right here and now, otherwise it may ruin what you will see when/if you go and watch the film.<br/><br/>The press crucified this film, saying it wasn't worth watching, and they did the same for the book. I'd beg to differ though, I truly enjoyed this film, even if it was a tad long. At least while watching it one is not distracted by Mr. Brown's mediocre writing style (and I have to admit the man is a master story teller even if his writing leaves a lot to be desired). There is just one thing wrong with it, and that is Tom Hanks. I do appreciate Mr. Hank's performances in other films have been absolutely wonderful, this part just didn't seem right for him right from the start. I personally pictured George Clooney as Robert Langdon from the minute I read the first chapter.<br/><br/>Hanks certainly tries to fill Robert Langdon's shoes and on occasion he manages to do so for a split second, however his lack of facial expressions (he has two or three in this film  mostly involving a lot of frowning) just didn't do it for me. The lovely Miss Tautou however, is everything and more than I had imagined for the part of 'Princesse Sophie'. I only felt sorry for her since she had to run in those high heeled shoes throughout the film  but well that's Parisian women for you dressed to the nines for every single occasion even if it's going to the supermarket.<br/><br/>When I heard that Paul Bettany had been cast for the part of the Opus Dei monk Silas, I wasn't too sure whether he could pull it off. I had no idea who would be the ideal Silas. Paul Bettany was after all an excellent choice. The emphasis in Silas' performance lies in his deep rooted faith, and his wish to protect the bishop he works for and idolises. Though he is the bad guy in the film, you can't help but feel sorry for him as he is in fact a tragic hero.<br/><br/>Another actor I'd like to compliment on his part in the film is Ian McKellen who plays Sir Leigh Teabing, an eccentric historian and old friend of Robert Langdon. When Langdon and Neveu seek his help, he insists on helping them to sort out the clues that will lead to unraveling the mystery he has searched for for so long. McKellen's performance is outstanding.<br/><br/>What you need to take into account before you go see this film is the following: The parts that are set in France are mainly spoken in French, the bishops and Silas mainly speak Italian or Latin (not quite sure) so you will have to read a lot of subtitles.... However it does give the film an authentic feel.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is slightly different than the storyline in the book. This does not make the story worse... in fact some of the changes actually give the film more strength.<br/><br/>Did I mention I enjoyed the film?"
"toseid","10","0","5","19 May 2006"," It is less blasphemous than Opus Dei wants us to believe
","Strange that so many gave the movie a rating of 1. I voted 10 although the movie is not perfect, of course, but still very well made. I think those who voted 1 may not have seen it at all and don't want other people to see it either (typically members of Opus Dei who have not even read the book because they are not allowed to). They say is blasphemous but what they are really worried about is the way this prelature is pictured by Dan Brown. They were quite lucky that the chapter 100 of the book does not really appear for full in the film. This is maybe due to the need to compress everything into 150 minutes, but it could also be the result of pressure from Opus Dei!! This chapter could become a reality before Opus Dei imagines. I am a practicing catholic and of course we know that the stuff about Jesus and Mary Magdalene is probably not quite true. Anyway, I do not think it is blasphemous at all. In conclusion I enjoyed the 150 minutes of intense suspense, beautiful scenery and good acting. Go and watch it and judge for yourself!"

","I have been disappointed with the many reviews I have read over the past 48 hours concerning The Da Vinci Code. Many reviewers and critics have predetermined their mark out of ten before they have even seen the film itself! While the film is I felt too long at 150 minutes (10 minutes + could have been shaved off the running time), it is however a solid piece of work. Critics have complained that there is too much talking and analysing in the film, yet they complain also when films focus too much on action, at the expense of plot. You learn little in the film about the characters themselves (especially Robert Langdon) but it is somewhat irrelevant. The film is about the story NOT the characters, the plot is what drives the film. It is worth noting that I have not read the best selling Dan Brown novel, and therefore entered into watching the film with no preconceptions. If you want to see an intelligent blockbuster that doesn't patronise its audience then this is for you."

"scubaone","7","0","4","19 May 2006"," time to speak
","OK. It's time to say something. Having read the book and seen the film it is startlingly obvious that Dan Brown is not the most talented of writers but he hit on a great story and the movie is a fair reflection of that. So to the critics, 60 million book sales can't be wrong and any Ron Howard and A list cast movie will hardly flop, particularly with all the free publicity kindly provided by world-wide church folk. I enjoyed them both.<br/><br/>I'm a Christian and I follow my faith and I have to say it takes a lot more than an average novelist and a good movie to sway me away from that. Especially when it is a work of fiction and has never been claimed to be any more than that by ANYONE. Just correct references to art, architecture, documents and secret rituals. But not the story.<br/><br/>Did the religious world go crazy when in Raiders of the lost Ark, Indy went in search of a TRUE religious relic the Ark of the Covenant, the treasure hunt which followed and the murder of the nasty Nazis at the end. The same holds for Indiana Jones and the last Crusade - the search for the Holy Grail no less - followed by treasure hunt and 800 year old templar nights protecting it - sounds kinda familiar huh? Joseph and his amazing technicoloured dream coat - based on a religious truth and turned into a musical - do i really think it happened that way - no, its a fictitious musical obviously still running in theatreland across the globe without religious protests to help market it. The Omen series was actually based on the BIBLE and other easily accessible religious documents and had more of a basis for being fact than most but no, its a made up story, a good yarn - we didn't need to be told then and we don't now. Devil's advocate, where Al baby screams that God is an absentee landlord etc etc - did I shake with religious fury, no no no - its made up you see.<br/><br/>I could go on as could you - the point is very clear. Come on church people, have a little faith in your world-wide flock - we know its just a story and it seems to be you who needs convincing otherwise. You have done far more to raise doubt over the truth we know and believe than Dan Brown ever could have. Have faith."

Some people say this film is Blasphemous:<br/><br/>blasphemous - grossly irreverent toward what is held to be sacred<br/><br/>So what exactly is being held sacred? Jesus' Devinity? The belief he had no heirs? The belief that he had no wife? All of these are irrelevant to believing in God and in Jesus, Jesus still died to save the souls of sinners. <br/><br/>He is still believed to be the son of God. These are the core beliefs christians should concentrate on, these are the things that made him important in history.<br/><br/>Blind faith is not strong faith, its faith for the weak of mind, for those who have no imagination, for those who need to be told what to believe.<br/><br/>If this film causes you to question your beliefs, then your beliefs were not strong in the first place.<br/><br/>If you truly believe in Jesus and God, then this film should be no more than an entertaining yarn that holds an exciting suggestion.<br/><br/>Barthez"

","OK, I'm tired of hearing that this film was bad. I mean, remember, most of the reviews came from over there from the Cannes Film Festival. Most reviewers here found it entertaining, as did I was well. I thought Tom Hanks was the perfect choice for Robert Langdon, bringing him to life in a different, yet recognizable, sense than what we read in the book. The screenplay was very close to the book, which is what you find rare in Hollywood these days. Ron Howard did a wonderful job of directing this big, anticipated adaptation and I found myself more into it than most people. Now, I went to a midnight screening and, unlike the Cannes, the people applauded. I did as well. I would definitely go see this film and I wish people would stop complaining about the film's length. You wanted a true adaptation of the novel and now you've got it. So, yeah, I highly recommend this movie for serious film-goers. As for you negative types, go see ""See No Evil"". But do see ""Over the Hedge"". That film is almost as good as ""The Da Vinci Code""."
"evanjonesaber","8","0","6","19 May 2006"," Genius!
","First off, to all those there who have called the film boring or lacklustre. Were you expecting to see an all action movie, have you even read the book? This was never going to be a terminator, last action hero, or an Indiana Jones. NEVER! The book is a dark thriller based on the beliefs and foundations of the Roman Catholic Church. How many movies that are entitled thrillers do you know that could be called all action? Not many i am guessing. The Da Vinci Code on the big screen is monumental! It takes all the super aspects of the book - the twists, the darkness, the riddles and mysteries, and the murders - and portrays them almost exactly the way in which you imagine them as you read. There is a serious underlying tension in the film that keeps focus and concentration at their highest levels, because you realise that once you switch off, you may miss something, and due to the complexity of the plot, if you miss something, you will be confused for the rest of the time. Dark, gripping, tense, complex - not really a Friday night popcorn film, but a film that makes you think, REALLY makes you think! Superb for what it is."

","I take my words back regarding my anticipation of wanting to see this movie. Just saw it today and there was a huge number of changes from the book. Can't say I wanna complain about the changes made but it's more of the continuity of the storyline.<br/><br/>For those who read the book, you might feel like the story was a bit ""rushed"" that Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman tried to make a movie that practically stuffed the whole of the Dan Brown's book into a 2½ hour movie.<br/><br/>There were some parts that I felt that the film was a bit too draggy. But not as draggy or dry as the book. At least once you've done reading the ""drier"" part of the book, you'll be indulging in a refreshing treat of maybe a hint of clues to make you think. But the film version didn't really do that.<br/><br/>Plus, there are too many flashbacks into history. TRUE, while these flashbacks are critical in telling the story but they were rather too messed up.<br/><br/>***** SPOILERS STARTS HERE*****<br/><br/>Among the changes made were: 1 - Langdon was summoned at a book signing instead of from his hotel as written in the book; 2 - There was only one clue from the cryptex when there were in fact two as from the book; that is the first answer to the cryptex (SOFIA) was deleted; 3 - The identity of the ""TEACHER"" was revealed too soon.; Another point to take note was that Teabing's manservant, Remy, suddenly died without giving the audience any clue what he died from.<br/><br/>4 - The HIEROS GAMUS ritual was (I believe) almost deleted due to its sexual nature.<br/><br/>5 - As compared to the book, Sophie was reunited only with her grandmother but her brother was nowhere around; the young church caretaker might as well be her brother but even that info was not revealed.<br/><br/>***** SPOILERS ENDS HERE*****<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting that you totally ignore this film completely. By all means, go see it since it's a ""much anticipated movie"" of the year. This is only my personal opinion. Who knows maybe you might like it even more."
