","I was able to catch a screening of 'Superbad' last night in NYC and I was very pleased with the movie. I'm sure most will compare this to an 'American Pie' like comedy, but it's so much more than that. There were some ""shock value"" moments, but very well done to tip the scale more to funny than to gross.<br/><br/>It is a teen movie, so 'Superbad's plot is obviously basic. It's the performances of the 3 friends (Seth, Evan, and 'McLovin' Fogell) that really make it great. I am big Michael Cera fan thanks to the brilliant TV series ""Arrested Development"", and other fans will be delighted to see his equally hilarious performance as Evan. The movie has the sexually driven banter and gross outs that will appeal to 'American Pie' viewer and the smart timing and acting that will appeal to the 'Arrested Development' viewer. What was really surprising to me was the touching (platonic) relationship that Evan and Seth have. Also, 'McLovin' Fogell, is an absolute nerdy delight.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I noticed that it was a bit drawn out toward the middle, but it really picks up after. Overall it's a great time and might just be a success at the box office. Bad teen comedies are a dime a dozen, but 'Superbad' is a shiny golden egg!"
"unscripted1","9","317","510","26 July 2007"," Funniest Movie I've Seen In A Long Time
","I got to see an advanced screening the other night, complete with an interview with the cast. I figured this movie could go either way, especially when you consider ""40 year-old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" were funny and entertaining, but they weren't exactly loved by all.<br/><br/>I am happy to say this movie was wonderful. The jokes are crude, but dead on, and unlike recent movies with a similar style, like ""Clerks 2,"" the plot moves on without any real downtime (you know, where the plot slows the progress of humor and you find yourself checking your watch). Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have that best friend chemistry that this movie required as well as being dead on with their jokes. The real star of the movie, however, was newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who took the role of Fogell and OWNED it. I got the chance to chat with the actors and I was not only surprised to hear that both Mintz-Plasse and Michael Cera are 18 and 19 respectively.<br/><br/>For the type of movie this is and the brilliant script that Seth Brogen has presented, there is no reason why anyone, young or old, can't relate to this off-the-wall comedy. See this movie!"
"nrbucco-1","10","371","618","14 April 2007"," Absolutely hilarious!!!
","I have been lucky enough to see two advanced screenings of Superbad in Burbank. It is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. When I read the summary, I was a bit skeptical. The ""high school comedy"" is not exactly my cup of tea. My love for Michael Cera's performance in Arrested Development drove me to the theater and man was I glad I went. This is not your typical high school comedy. The writing is much smarter and funnier and the acting is superb. This movie so far transcends American Pie and its ilk that it cannot really even be compared. Go see this movie!!! I have a feeling it is going to go off the charts once the buzz gets around about how hilarious it is."
"Mehrdad1","10","244","407","17 July 2007"," Best Teen Comedy Since the Original ""American Pie!""
","Well, I just got back from the Superbad screening tonight (thanks to the folks at MySpace) and I must say that this is a very special teen movie. It has that same element of transporting you back to your high school days that the original American Pie had. Michael Cera does great as the awkward teenage kid, basically a reprise of his role as George Michael on Arrested Development. But it is Jonah Hill who absolutely rules this movie! He had me laughing from the beginning to the end. His ""silly fat-kid"" character is the only one in the history of movies that shows what it truly feels like to be the funny fat kid in high school. I should know, I was one! Gosh, I just can't believe how well he portrayed the unmitigated hell that was P.E.! Emma Stone and Martha Maclsaac also give very realistic depictions of teenage girls. None of that fake, over the top nonsense. The most over-the-top character was ""McLovin"" himself, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who did a great job of having us laugh with him as much as we did at him.<br/><br/>All in all, I think that everyone should be sure to watch this movie when it comes later this summer."
"wwe7961","10","57","88","7 October 2010"," Hilarious and also in many ways heartwarming.
","This movie is one of the funniest of the 21st century. The jokes are hilarious, and it is spoken by a great cast. Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth Rogen, and others are excellent in their roles. The characters they play you really latch on to you. They are extremely likable in many ways. The dialogue is also superb. It's a fast moving script that gives many great lines by the end of the movie. Also at the end I sorta felt some happiness. It's one thing to make me laugh throughout, but to make a vulgar comedy like this actually make my heart warm is a very big plus. It's a film about friendship, and that message manages to find its way through all the vulgar stuff.<br/><br/>4 stars out of 4"
"benmorse","8","197","338","15 July 2007"," Excellent, hilarious teen movie with likable characters, for a change.
","Superbad is a teen movie. It also will draw comparisons to American Pie, in it's ""losers try to get laid"" themes, and occasional gross-out comedy. But the comparison is unfair - Superbad is a funnier, more subversive and more importantly genuine movie than American Pie or any of it's awful sequels were. The three central characters have a believable, likable relationship, that the film takes time to establish. Cera, Hill (who deserves special praise, for turning what could have been a really unlikeable character into a sweet, if loud-mouthed and crass, teenager) and Mintz-Plasse bounce of each other perfectly. The movie creates some funny situations, and more importantly, hilarious dialogue throughout. Aside from one comedic misfire - an overly long (and poorly judged) gross out sight gag involving a pair of trousers and a dance - Superbad had me laughing constantly. It's sweet, it's funny as hell, and it's established a load of new talent."

"dafteskimo","7","400","718","18 July 2007"," Holy Crap This Movie Was Amazing!!!!
","Okay, so today i went to an advanced screening of this movie. It was really last minute and I didn't know much about it other than it was from the makers of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up and it looked pretty funny.<br/><br/>I expected it to be funny, but my expectations were blown out of the water. It was extremely smart and pretty much believable. Well, some of the situations are a little ridiculous, but what's a good comedy without a little nonsense? But the characters were all so awesome.<br/><br/>There were a few parts where i was a little uncomfortable. There are some pretty explicit drawings in it so you might not want to see it with younger siblings or parents. But I'm telling you, this movie was super funny."
"vovazhd","8","87","145","3 November 2007"," One of the best comedies of the year
","Superbad may look like a typical high-school movie on the cover, but its actually much more. It follows a trio of high-school seniors that decide to have one last party before leaving for college (and one last shot at grabbing a girl). The trio consists of Seth, Evan, and Fogell. They make a likable main cast that is very easy to compare to. Their acting style is ideal for this type of film. Joining them are several other intriguing characters. My favorite were the two police officers, Slater and Michaels. Pretty much every scene with them made me laugh; from their references to other movies to the spoofs on being an officer, its classic slapstick comedy.<br/><br/>The plot is definitely a strong point, unlike many comedies today. Most of the movie follows two distinct plot lines that join up at the end. Inter-weaved in the plot are countless jokes that kept me laughing almost the whole time. The plot itself involves booze, partying, and law enforcement, and somehow works these in to make a very absorbing story. Also, the particularly close friendship between Seth and Evan is an element that surpasses the comedy genre. The plot as a whole has plenty of unrealistic details, but manages to successfully meld comedy with some deeper meaning.<br/><br/>The comedy aspects are some of the best ever. Some of the jokes were a little disgusting (mainly the part about Seth's childhood), but I gotta admit they were hilarious. The beer aspects were pretty cool, and the sexual jokes did their thing. The law enforcement spoofs and McLovin gags were probably my favorite.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole is among the better comedies ever. I liked it more than Knocked Up (7/10). It still suffers from some of the weaknesses inherent in the comedy genre, but has a lot more value than most movies nowadays. Highly recommended for people in high school or college, and also recommended (albeit to a lesser degree) for everyone else."
"MovieAddict2016","8","70","116","19 April 2008"," Definitely the best Apatow-group film yet
","I enjoyed ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" but didn't feel it was entirely worthy of all the enormous acclaim it garnered. And for all the praise ""Knocked Up"" received, I thought it was fairly average. So I wasn't expecting much from ""Superbad."" However, I'd have to say it's the smartest and funniest Apatow film yet. I know he didn't direct it, but his influence is distinct. And in the past I've felt indifferent towards Apatow's brand of humour, but combined with Rogen's sensitivity towards the teen condition here, it works really well.<br/><br/>People have compared it to John Hughes' better teen comedies, but I don't think the approach is entirely similar. ""Superbad"" is cruder, ruder, a bit more focused on the sex & alcohol jokes. But it works really well because it captures that dynamic - better than ""American Pie"" because it invests more care into its characters. One of the strengths of ""Pie"" over other films in its genre (such as, say, ""Slackers"") has always been its characters, and ""Superbad"" similarly relies on its characters for support. Plus, it's just really funny.<br/><br/>The performances all around are pretty funny, even if the Fogell/McLovin pop culture references are ruining a good joke (kind of like ""Yeah, baby!!"" ruined Austin Powers when 20-year-old frat boys around the country thought it would be funny to shout the phrase every five seconds).<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have great chemistry and another one of the strengths of this film is that its teenage characters actually do look their age (even though Hill is in his early 20s, he still passes as a senior). But it was Bill Hader and Seth Rogen who stole the show for me as the clueless cops.<br/><br/>Overall this is just a funny, well-made film with heart. It doesn't mock its characters or their predicaments but casts a knowing eye on the high school experience. It captures all this very well and was certainly, in my opinion, far superior to ""Knocked Up."""
"vincelutton","9","165","295","18 July 2007"," Hilarious, gross, yet smart movie
","Superbad was an absolutely hilarious film. There were so many mind bogglingly hilarious one-liners in the film that I will need to watch it again to see which ones I missed while I was laughing. This is one movie that I will definitely watch every time they rerun it on cable in the future. It had its completely gross-out teen moments, but those were grounded by its hilariously absurd and witty (also gross) conversations. Michael Cera was great, and most Arrested Development fans should find his performance here just as entertaining as his take on the George Michael character he played on that show. He is absolutely awkward and downright hilarious. Jonah Hill is the funniest he has ever been, confidently spouting out uproariously funny lines at every hot girl in sight."
"gigan-92","10","16","23","16 December 2010"," Raunchy yet Hearfelt
","One of the best comedies ever served in m y opinion. The all-too familiar Greg Mottola is the man at work here, and where credit is due I'll award points to the writer s Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. However, this film would drop dead on its face without its hilarious cast undoubtedly, Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse being the two most unforgettable stars. Michael Cera is the kind of, I suppose, innocent-type guy who is both driven by hormones yet conflicted by almost inhuman genuine-ness and politeness. Not too many laughs coming from his way but when he did, he did so superbly. Bill Hader and Set Rogen were just top notch. I would also like to amend Emma Stone as Jules, who delivered the greatest ""what the f*ck?!"" in a good while.<br/><br/>All these zany and truth be told rather realistic characters were interpreted pretty well and where as the film was insanely funny the character development was right on par with the laughs. That's probably the film's most monumental achievement, seeing as the soundtrack was one I was rather indifferent about (but not one I despised). ""Super Bad"" is grade A comedy at its finest."
"DCLOUDkid","10","16","24","22 July 2008"," Raunchy, but almost exactly how real teens talk.
","And that may seem like a turn off to people (parents in general, but kudos to those who like it) because they don't expect the realism of the characters and their dialog. What people (parents) what to generally see for some odd reason is some High School Musical garbage lifestyle for a teenager which is completely unrealistic.Having said that, a few of the situations do seem unrealistic, but the message of friendship and dealing with life when it doesn't seem to be going as planned is universally understood by all males and surprisingly a lot of cool chicks who can handle the edgy jokes in between.<br/><br/>I don't need a whole lot a space to said what I need to say so I'll give you the gist of it. <br/><br/>1. Almost every teen from 16 to 19 (and most guys for that matter) can probably say ""That totally happened to me! It's like they know me!"" or ""I've had this conversation!""<br/><br/>2. A punch line at every corner, and the jokes never get old. <br/><br/>3. It actually seems to get funnier and not ""That was kind of funny...."" <br/><br/>4. Can be watched over and over again. <br/><br/>5.

","Superbad shows itself as a simple teen comedy, and it is, but there is a hidden intelligence to the whole thing. Superbad is hilarious, its comedy is greatly written, while its plot remains very straightforward.<br/><br/>But Superbad shines in its dialogue, specifically the interactions between Micheal Cera's and Jonah Hill's Characters, they feel like real friends, some of the lines they exchange, although sarcastic and humorous, they are real. Very realistic, which is rare even among some of the greatest movies.<br/><br/>Superbad is quite possibly the greatest teen comedy of all time.

This film will stand the test of time, I've seen it three times and enjoyed each in same measure. Strict miserable parents should be forced to watch it. They might lighten up a bit! Anyone who doesn't fall half in love with this film cannot be human. A summary? A rare and wonderful film worth buying, keeping, and watching again and again!"
"StevePulaski","9","10","15","11 April 2012"," One teenage comedy with extra wit and soul
","Superbad is a parable of values and friendship, reminding us that a good and earnest moral upbringing will be able to safely glide us through life and make us achieve happiness much easier. Its characters are well-mannered and sweet, not to mention inherently likable, as well as everything being morally correct and admirable.<br/><br/>Now onto the real review. Superbad is a shamelessly raunchy R-rated comedy with more four letter words than a Webster dictionary. Again, this sounds like the introduction I'd give a poorly rated film. By no means is Superbad a bad comedy. It is a smart, witty, and factual teen movie side-stepping clichÃ©s and underwritten primary characters, while at the same time remaining funny and entertaining until the end.<br/><br/>2007 was the year where Judd Apatow took off. He gained attention in 2005 with The 40 Year Old Virgin, but pretty much garnered a household name with this and Knocked Up, both starring Seth Rogen. It wouldn't surprise me to hear that Superbad is an autobiography, since the writers of the film, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, share the same names as the lead actors. Maybe that could be why this feels so sentimental and close to home. Or maybe it's because Superbad is aware what kind of unsettling situations high school can put you through and knows how to document them in a fun way.<br/><br/>The film centers around loudmouth pervert Seth (Hill) and self-conscious, paranoia-stricken Evan (Cera) as they endure their last few weeks of being high schoolers before they are shipped off to separate colleges. Seth and Evan have been friends for years, and are tired of the fact that their separate ways have been the talk of their parents and friends.<br/><br/>Seth has a crush on the recently-popular Jules (Stone), a beautiful redhead, who trusts him with supplying alcohol for her party. Evan has a crush on Becca (MacIsaac), a sweet and simple girl who agrees to meet up with him at Jules' upcoming party as well. In order to purchase the alcohol, both Seth and Evan trust their pal Fogel (Mintz-Plasse), who plans to acquire a fake ID. Because of this ID, Fogel now becomes his fake name, ""McLovin,"" a name that has garnered much fame on the web.<br/><br/>The night unfolds into a chaotic spectacle of unprecedented stature, so much so that I won't go into explaining the routes and acts of desperation the characters take in order to be liked, admired, or even noticed. Fogel winds up teaming up with two police officers (Hader and Rogen) who act more like the bad guys rather than good guys. This setup and sort of topsy-tursvy treatment of character roles create limitless comedic possibilities, most of which are well utilized.<br/><br/>But what truly makes the film work is its level of realism and intelligence. It has wit, and puts it to use. The writing and acting captures the awkwardness of the teenage lifestyle with pinpoint accuracy, at the same time makes it fun and painful to witness. I can think of quite a few films that allow their characters to thrive on ego and self-interest, with no redeeming qualities. Here, the characters in Superbad just want to fit in and achieve the girl of their dreams, but shallow stereotypes and one stutter too many prevent this goal from happening.<br/><br/>Superbad is quite a rarity; a funny, good-natured comedy focusing on things of the immoral nature. Just like with American Pie, too many people believe these films are just raucous sex comedies with no substance, soul, or charm. The characters are likable and charismatic, and lack the oh-so-typical nihilistic, ""I just want to have sex with anything that moves"" mentality. Some may be surprised at the level of nuanced emotional instances the film reaches. The performances are fun, the writing is polished and witty, and the antics never seem to go over the top. It's too bad the women roles in the film feel a tad underwritten. Hopefully we have something like Supergood to explore that angle sometime soon.<br/><br/>Starring: Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bill Hader, Seth Rogen, Emma Stone, and Martha MacIsaac. Directed by: Greg Mottola."

","I tried to enjoy this movie. I gave more effort into trying than I've ever attempted. It was a sorry excuse for a movie. I'm sure this movie adds more to the stereotype of how truly messed up American culture is...teenagers consumed with sex, beer, and drugs, who have an EXTREMELY limited vocabulary. The only reason I didn't walk out was because I was visiting my brother in another state. It's kind of hard to walk out of a movie theater and go home when you don't know where the hell you are. This movie took two hours of my life I will never get back...they could have been spent watching a movie that was actually original and not coated with the F word more than Louisiana was coated with water two years ago. I sat through Napoleon Dynamite...which, in my opinion, was terrible.

","After I looked ""Superbad"" two questions came into my mind. First: Why should Seth Rogen write a screenplay after he acted so well in ""Knocked Up""? and 2nd: Why was this movie rated to Top 250 in IMDb? ""Superbad"" hasn't a story (underaged people only cruise around to get alcohol for a party) and the gags aren't funny. All the plot is about male virgins who want to have sex and talk about it, about alcohol and strange cops who are kids in mind. That's all. Yes, sometimes some jokes about vomiting or drunk people are funny, but they can't be the only content of a movie. Yes, the story and the stereotype characters are entertaining on a low level, but there should be more than the average plot of ""American Pie"" to fill 90 minutes and more. Critical oder serious elements I hadn't found during looking the movie and so I wished, that this teen-trash is over soon. Maybe other people would be found, that this movie is very funny and brilliant. But ""Superbad"" only repeats elements of earlier puberty comedies without vary the gags oder the story.

If so, this movie is for you. If none of these tests apply to you, save yourself the extreme boredom and waste of spending more than 1 second on this worthless endeavor. I started squirming from boredom during the opening credits and stuck it out, for reasons unknown, up until the midway point before I had to leave.

This movie was insipid, uninspired, vapid, tiresome, trite and wasn't even effective at its attempts at vulgarity. The characters and dialog were loathsome as was the direction and writing.

""Friends"" talking about how to hide a boner and how great it felt? Are you kidding me? Reminded us of those feminine deodorant commercials where the women talk about their problem ""odor"". Huh??? I agree with the poster who laughed when the fat kid got knocked over by the car - that was funny for all the wrong reasons. And then the guy jumps out and says ""I'll do anything?"" I was waiting for him to offer ""sexual favors"". And when the two got into the car with the guy, I was waiting for them to be driven to be raped by a bunch of older guys or something.<br/><br/>The two cops reminded me of Cadets Blankes and Harris, and I would not have been the least surprised to see a Blue Oyster Bar prominently featured.<br/><br/>There seemed to be a strong sexual overtones throughout the movie, but it involved Seth, Evan, and McLovin and little else."
"treezy-1","2","64","128","12 October 2007"," Very disappointed.
","This is not the sort of film that I would normally watch. I saw a preview for it, and thought that very thing and discounted it. However, several factors made me rethink this decision, including two 4 star ratings in Empire Magazine and the local paper, and hearing that it was done by the same guy that was in Knocked up (which I thoroughly enjoyed).<br/><br/>So, last night I went.<br/><br/>And it was awful. From the first scene I wanted to leave, but I can't leave films ever (just in case they improve). I thought the character of Seth was completely unlikeable. He was insensitive, rude, obnoxious, incredibly crass - actually I can't think of a single redeeming quality. Evan's character was nice and it just didn't make sense for them to be friends.<br/><br/>I just think that it didn't know whether it wanted to be over the top crazy-funny (which might have worked better) or just normal funny (which IMHO really didn't).<br/><br/>McLovin was probably the best thing in the film, but even the few bits where I chuckled could not save the film. It was a shame as it had a great opening titles sequence.<br/><br/>And while I could definitely get the Evan and Becca thing, the Seth and Jules thing just didn't work, as he is such a horrible person, and she actually had substance. Just because Seth carried Evan, doesn't mean he doesn't still think about women like they are a piece of meat.<br/><br/>I just don't get how this film is so highly rated. I simply don't."

","I had high hopes for this movie. The previews made it me think this was going to be a very funny movie if not he funniest movie of the summer and/or year. The media and audiences also adored this movie calling it hilarious but also heartwarming. I remember reading in the LA Times some quote suggesting this would be to American Pie what teenage John Hughes films were to ""Porky's"" and I enjoyed most of those movies mentioned in that analogy.<br/><br/>It wasn't that Superbad was a terrible movie, but it wasn't a great movie either. It did have its moments of hilarity, but it also had its moments of boredom. I was expecting to be laughing throughout the whole entire movie, but I was only laughing here and there. I did understand every joke, but it seemed like it tried too hard to sell it to me.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for a comedy that you want to laugh non-stop and enjoy, you may not want to see this unless you force yourself to laugh at every single situation in this movie, laugh at almost anything, agree with critics, or listen to the majority. My nephew said he loved it and it reminds him of his high school years. I stated that he was only seventeen and hasn't even graduated or matured. However, if you're looking to laugh on and off periodically, then I recommend this movie for you."

","I have to hand it to Apatow. If you hype any movie enough, you sell tickets. While the 40 year old virgin was good, and knocked up was an average comedy, this movie was sub-sub standard. Maybe, that's why they call it Superbad, because it really is. My wife and I could not wait for this movie to end. It dragged and dragged on.<br/><br/>This movie sucked after the first ten minutes. It's like watching a Kevin Smith movie with the profanity, but without the comedy. If you want to see a great buddy profanity comedy, watch Clerks. Most of the dialogue by the 2 best buddies is very gay. Sure everybody knew someone like the fat guy that mouthed off in high school, but they weren't these characters who are practically flaming homos.<br/><br/>The whole police chase was downright lame. Finally, I actually felt creeped out when the buddies meet a possible pedophile. ""Hey are you guys on MySpace?"" I recommend watching the first ten minutes then walking out."

Not a single laugh was heard in the half-full cinema up to the point where I left. Not one single giggle. Does that sound like a rip-roaring comedy to you?

But the original title works just as well when describing this flick. I found none of the jokes funny, that the heavier kid had to use a 4-letter word every other word (or so it seemed), that the geeky kid was referred to as a homo, and well, just the general way they talked to one another, all this made the movie a major turn-off.

This project is along the same lines as the student who gives a speech about how NOT to give a speech, thus securing inevitable success.<br/><br/>There is a nested story within this which mirrors the film proper. It involves a child with an overwhelming impulse to sketch one phallus after the next, an impulse the character shares with the film-makers themselves. Each scene in this movie can be seen as another gratuitously vulgar sketch drawn by an immature child. A vomiting cop. A menstrual stain. A teenager's erection. And on and on.<br/><br/>I imagine this was the impetus for this project, to create a truly superbad film, and it could have worked somewhat, had it actually been funny. Or clever in any way.

I actually chose this movie because it was listed as a top-ranking comedy on the website ""College Humor"". Judging from the other laureates on that site, I should have known better. It's not the fact that the movie uses a lot of gross humor and sexual references. It's rather because every idea in this film seems to end nowhere. Many situations had great potential but seemed to end in a bland void and, while I very much appreciated the character Fogell, this made it all so more frustrating as the whole story around him resulted in totally unbelievable fantasy about those cool, anarchic cops adopting him as their partner in crime. Also, a guy like Fogell would NEVER get laid as a teenager. I can tell 'cause I was that guy. I could imagine wonderful scripts around that person, even involving the other two guys. Unfortunately, what I saw wasn't wonderful at all which brings me to frolic on bad comments and write my own bad review. Something I rarely do.

However, the hype surrounding this movie and all of the excitement about its poorly written, downright dumb jokes were outrageous. I'm tired of hearing people talk about Superbad. I'm tired of hearing its name compared to good movies. And most of all, I'm tired of people saying it was good because they heard it was.

Whatever guy of high authority used the words ""good"" and ""Superbad"" in the same sentence deserves to be locked in a room for a year with this so called ""comedian"" Jonah Hill. This movie was the epitome of the word ""stupid"" in all of its essence. From start to finish I was waiting. Waiting for something that never came: A good joke. Anything that would have let me leave the theater feeling the least bit satisfied. The filmmakers attempted to make a film that we could relate to. ""We"" being teenagers. Unless you are a dumb brick, you can't relate to this film. Quite simply, they failed in that sense. I mean, are we really this dumb? I beg you, if you wasted your money on a DVD of this film, watch it again, but this time keep this in your mind: This is how adults view us. This is how the world views us. Yes they probably made a bundle off this low budget piece of garbage. But I remind them, I'm still waiting for something that makes me laugh. So I vote they make a new film, maybe start fresh, throw in some guys who are actually funny. How bout NOT Jonah Hill...and let's just steer clear of Seth Rogen, because he isn't funny. ""Knocked Up,"" another mockery of modern film making, was also crap. It's not like I don't have a sense of humor. I love comedies. Want to see a good comedy? Go watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Go see any film by Wes Anderson. Hell, I like the dumb ones too. I highly recommend just about anything with Jim Carrey or Steve Carrel. THOSE are comedians.

The movie portrayed today's young adults as slackers, partiers, goal-deprived and just plain stupid in their behavior and thought processes. (Although, I'll have to admit that the liquor purchase sequence in BOTh the supermarket and the liquor store were well thought out and well choreographed, especially Seth's ""mind's eye"".)

Lets get one thing straight - It is poor.<br/><br/>On the positive side, there is some funny dialogue during the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes. And the three main kids do a great job and are very believable as awkward high school students. However, the entire middle section of the movie is absolutely horrendous. This is where Superbad goes...uhhh...super-bad. The two policeman characters are over the top and non-believable. Their jokes are lame and forced. If they had only appeared in the liquor store scene and the party scene at the end, it might have been alright. But forcing them down the audiences throats for over an hour was a huge mistake and ultimately ruins the movie. Also, the scene where Seth and Evan get trapped at the adults house party is just out of place. The fight, cocaine use, and general awkwardness in that scene don't make sense and most importantly are not funny.<br/><br/>Overall, Superbad could have been much better. The three main characters are legitimately funny kids and the movie has an old but workable format. Unfortunately, several poorly written sub-plots and side characters ruin this film.

Maybe high school is different now than when I went to school, but being one of the un-popular kids, I can say the pretty girls in my school were on order more cruel to un-popular kids than the pretty boys were to nothing else keep their popular status. And when Seth is invited by Jules to her party that night, your first thought would be, yeah they are being set up for humiliation when they get there, which isn't the case, and in the end wind up hooking up with the two pretty girls, maybe in fantasy land, but in real life, not happening. Oh and the part where Fogel follows the girl down the hall staring at her panties through her jeans, real life response from the girl would have probably been ""Stop looking at me you freak loser"" not a hook up at the party later on.<br/><br/>I also found the constant swearing by Seth a little over the top, the two cops being total morons, I find hard to believe as well, if you want to watch a movie where the un-popular nerd type kids get the last laugh, and something more believable, I would recommend the original Revenge of the Nerds."

","It is with a great deal of surprise and disappointment that I have a negative review of Superbad. Many of my friends own this movie and were certain that I would love it; it was on their recommendations that we rented this piece of garbage yesterday and I want my 118 minutes back! Truth be told, I laughed out loud, and hard, several times, but as the movie plodded on, the laughs got to be fewer and fewer until I finally gave up hope in this truly awful film. We weren't expecting much of a plot, and we didn't get one. We expected lowbrow comedy, lots of sex jokes, and underage drinking. Check, check, and check. What we didn't expect were ponderous scenes that went far too long for the humor available, pointless scenes with irrelevant characters that did nothing to enhance the story or the laughs. I have read many reviews lavishing praise on this movie, and I just can't understand such effusive praise for a truly bad movie."

The weird police link was the only thing that came near to funny, and even that was so off the mark.

Between the penis drawings and the raw language, there is very little dialog. And, why would any female have anything to do with these guys? Their 'creep' factor is set to ""10"", especially the ""Seth"" character. Of course they wouldn't be invited to classmates' parties: they are creeps. And, what about the horrible portrayal of police officers in this movie? What was the point of making the two police officers complete idiots? How is that funny? I know that boys and men can be obsessed with sex, but this movie is just not funny. And, I say that as a fan of the first Porky's movie, American Pie, and Knocked Up. If this movie is supposed to be indicative of how ""most boys think and act"", then US society is seriously messed up. Luckily, I think this movie reflects a tiny population of teenage boys, and based on the way these characters act, people who find this movie funny won't be having sex anyway.

The only reason I went to see this is because its precursors, ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" also received extremely favorable reviews; I didn't go see those because I was afraid they would be like, well, like this movie. It's not just that the variations on the word ""fuck"" become really tiresome within the first five minutes, nor the teen-boys-trying-to-get-laid plot has been worked to death; there's just no wit or style to this thing.

This movie was a complete flop. It tries very hard to be humorous and fails miserably. One of the main characters think they're funny but they're actually just plain stupid.

Evan is headed for Dartmouth (Seth failed to make the cut) with another fair-weathered geeky amigo, Fogell (Mintz-Plasse, a star-making scene stealer, who constantly serves as a source of annoyance for Seth who really wants to score with hottie classmate Jules (Stone, who resembles Lindsay Lohan and sounds like she swallowed Linda Fiorentino, with her husky/sexy vocals), who invites him to her weekend party and asks for a small favor: if he can buy her the liquor needed. <br/><br/>Seth has it all planned out with Fogell getting a fake ID to get the alcohol, figuring that if they were both drunk the more likelihood they would have sex and she would simply think that he was a bad mistake considering their conditions. Skeptical Evan meanwhile is pining for his gal pal Becca (MacIsaac) who also invites him to Jules' party, so the trio get together to buy the booze, make the date and have the time of their lives one last time.<br/><br/>Naturally things don't' go as planned and to divulge too much would take away the fantastically concocted craziness that ensues but lets just say two slacker cops (""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE""'S Hader and co-screenwriter Rogen, who also serves as a producer with his fellow collaborator ,filmmaker Judd Apatow, inheriting the Harold Ramis/Ivan Reitman throne of smart/dumb vulgar comedies with rip-snorting gusto); an adult party involving illegal substances; some unlikely bonding; and of course the Holy Grail: Jules' party. <br/><br/>Rogen, who wrote the script with his childhood chum Evan Goldberg  when both were in high school themselves, basing much of it on their experiences - is on a roll since his debut in the lamented excellent high school sitcom cult classic ""FREAKS & GEEKS"" and its companion college spin-off ""UNDECLARED"" , and support work in films like THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN  and the anticipated starring gig in the aforementioned KNOCKED UP - has a talent for the raunch mixed with heart in this hysterical teen comedy that proudly wears its vulgarity as a badge of honor, and the mentoring of collaborator Apatow, have created another smash-hit cult classic in the making that ranks up with its genre forefathers like FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and DAZED AND CONFUSED. Director Mottola (THE DAYTRIPPERS) handles the comedy with great skill and lets his young charges get their ya- yas out (** @ the sneak preview I attended, Rogen, Apatow, Hader and Mottola were there and it was confirmed that the cast were allowed to improvise and it shows) It clearly captures the hellish existence of adolescence, angst, anomie and in general feeling like a loser when a winner is deep inside all of us. And it has a plethora of dick jokes.<br/><br/>What more can you ask for? Hill, who suggests the love child of the late Chris Penn and Gene Wilder  the former's raspy voice and the latter's manic likablities  is a truly gifted comic actor  here sporting a Richard Pryor t-shirt and rockin' his Jew'Fro - who finally has a showcase to show just how funny he is and it is genius to have the awkward deadpan of Cera, as the well-meaning and respectful nerd who comes into his own as well.. Sexy newcomers Stone and MacIsaac also hold their own with their likable co-stars. <br/><br/>But it is newbie Mintz-Plasse making an audacious film debut (his first acting gig ever!!) who suggests the coolest geek since the aforementioned GRAFFITI'S Charles Martin Smith's ""Terry The Toad"", as Fogell , AKA , ""McLovin'""  the singular moniker he chose for the fake ID, who steals the film with his mouth-breathing stylin' doofus who gets in one crazy situation after another with the police officers, who themselves prove to be just as cluelessly enabling their young charge with one ridiculously insane endeavor after another.<br/><br/>Trust me if you need to laugh long and hard from the funky opening credits with a killer soundtrack  from start to finish you will be in spasms of laughter to the point of pee-in- your-pants submission.

They have one mission in life and that is to score with a hot chick before they graduate. The only problem with that scenario is that all three are geeky nerds. Yet there is light at the end of the tunnel when Seth and Evan are invited to a cool party at the house of a hot chick. However, the only way they can come is to buy the liquor for the party. Fogell comes to the rescue with a fake ID. All three are driven to make this a night to remember, and what happens to them over the next several hours will be burnt into their memories forever.<br/><br/>(My Comment) This is your nerdy teen movie from start to finish. It will take you back to your high school days when everything was so important yet meaningless in reality. Some of the same crazy things are still happening in high schools today, especially, when you are a nerd and others pick on you. The movie has some of the basic pit falls that all teenagers fall into when growing up. They think they know it all, and can fool the adults. Even Fogell believes that he has fooled the police at the liquor store. There are some hilarious and outrageous dialogue throughout the movie and some absurdity that is going for the shock value. The teenage audience will love it, and even the older audience laughed throughout the whole movie. Just a warning, there are some explicit drawings at the end that are funny, but raunchy and crude. The movie really deserves its R rating. (Columbia Pictures, Run time 1:54, Rated R)(8/10)"

Overall the acting felt quite real too.

A very realistic one at that, one that I can relate to quite a bunch. Almost always people grow apart from each other, especially with something like transisitioning from highschool to college/university. You or them might get a girlfriend (in a guys' view) so you can spend less time together. That and you move to different schools, so that makes for even less time; which makes the friendship go even further apart. For a film that feels like such dumb humor fun like this one, it had an awful lot of realism as we saw great friends spending their adventure, which may even be the last one judging from that last scene.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this film if you want to be slapped by reality while having great laughs!"

This night no needs to end in a ""One night stand"", sometimes after these tribulations the characters realize that they have a new girlfriend o a new boyfriend, and this is another story.The most important is the friendship between these mains characters.
So I enjoyed very much ""Superbad"", because the story is quite crazy , funny and touching.
Thanks Michael Cera and Jonas Hill for your brillant performance !!"

","Superbad has been and mostly will be a favourite film of mine if not the best for me.<br/><br/>Links to its nostalgia watching this whilst going through school and having these anxious feelings of what's next and feeling a need to ""make memories""<br/><br/>The film has it all it's wholesome, funny really good cinematography and perfect actors for the role it was wrote by Seth and Evan whilst they're around that age so it comes off very to the viewer it's not some typical project x blue mountain state film. Not too bash these but this is in a completely different league.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a funny slice of life. It's heart touching side bearing film that I will continue to watch and love."
"rob55-2","5","9","16","7 April 2008"," The title says it all
","I just rented this with a friend of mine last night and was expecting the great comedy that the critics and public alike made it out to be. Boy was I sorely mistaken. For starters, I can't stand the constant use of the f-word. Don't get me wrong, I can tolerate profanity just fine, but this was profanity for profanity's sake, pointless. I agree with other reviewers about how Seth and Evan really shouldn't have been best friends, being the total opposites that they were. The plot was paper thin, the characters forgettable and the run time too long. Superbad was easily the longest 1:52 movie I've ever seen. It just seemed like it would never end. The only reason I gave it 5 stars was because I actually did laugh a few times. Otherwise, it totally does not live up to the hype."
"sammyocarr","3","9","16","15 February 2008"," Disappointing
","The trailers of Superbad did what they should, I wanted to see it as soon as it came out. It looked hilarious, unfortunately i can honestly say i felt that i wasted 2 hours of my life i'd never get back.<br/><br/>To start, the story was a little drawn out, it took them most of the film to arrive at this 'party' (which is supposed to be the main element of the film) and then only spent, 3 mins there. Very anti-climatic.<br/><br/>The film could of ended in a few earlier places perhaps preventing the movie from milking the comedy. The comedy its self was weak in some places but made up for it in strong slapstick in others, however i felt that all the best comedy scenes were shown in the trailer, making the film seem somewhat redundant. I believe that the film appeals to an audience seeking an easy laugh, with no thinking involved.<br/><br/>However, I cant say it was entirely dire, i laughed at a few moments, The punch in the store, Getting ran over (twice) and the fake ID's! all of which were amusing, just not intelligent comedy which i expected in this film. this film wasn't 'Super Bad' is was merely mediocre. I felt the actors seemed to know and play their rolls of useless geeks a bit TO well, with some over and exaggerated acting in parts.<br/><br/>Overall, not a very subtle comedy, if one at all."

","This could have been a very sweet, very realistic movie about two high school kids moving into the next stage of their lives and potentially losing their friendship. The two main characters had great chemistry together, and when the movie focused on that, it is at its best and funniest. <br/><br/>This describes the first and last roughly-fifths of the movie. The remainder, unfortunately, is unbelievably stupid and ridiculous. The crux of the problem is two policemen, one played by the co-writer, Seth Rogan, who seem to have popped in from a cartoon movie. They wave their guns around in the middle of unarmed, non-violent crowds; they drink beers, in public, on-duty; they take shots at roadsigns; they do doughnuts in their car in a parking lot and end up deliberately setting fire to the vehicle. And this goes on and on and on. What the hell? <br/><br/>Michael Cera, as in ""Arrested Development"", has the great, sweet ability to deliver any line with that slightly embarrassed, gawky demeanor that lets the script get away with a lot. <br/><br/>Jonas Hill, unfortunately, was saddled with one of those characters whose unlikeable qualities (almost continuously insulting his friends in a shouty, whiny tone) more than overbalanced any extenuating circumstances (so Cera is moving in with his other friend with whom he's going to college? And?). This kind of character is surprisingly common in sophomoric comedies (see Napoleon Dynamite) and, without being able to like, respect or sympathise with, makes it very difficult to watch.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow told the same story, much better, in Freaks and Geeks, and, though he isn't the writer, seems to have run the well dry at this point.<br/><br/>I am obliged to add that my wife thoroughly enjoyed the montages of penis drawings over the end credits, though."

","Seth Rogan, talent is all i can say. A cast of talented unknowns, a dynamite script. A damn good time, there are some films that give off no indication as to why they are so loved, like the Rocky Horror Picture Show as an example. Superbad's main card is that it is, strikingly honest in it's comedic situations, it's a film that anyone who was ever a young male, can relate too. Though females may find little humor in this film, men will be in stitches. I can see countless offended viewers that may walk out of this film offended, shocked. It is all an act, it's just too true for them to handle. That policeman may not be entirely perfect, that boys do have penis' and girls do have vagina's. That sex is good, that the moments that the world tells us to forget are the best times of our lives.

","The name plainly describes the movie, ""Superbad"". It was a typical Hollywood film about a bunch of geeks trying to get laid. If you think penis jokes are funny, you're in for the ride of your lives, because this movie had more penis's than Brokeback Mountain. Seriously, don't waste your time or your money. I watched the previews, thought it looked hilarious, but it was anything but that. Sure, it had it's funny moments, but Pathfinder had its good moments as well; does that make them good movies? (in case you haven't seen Pathfinder, the obvious answer is ""no"") In a crazy series of using a crappy fake ID to try and get alcohol, to a bunch of skanky high school girls puking on people, this movie is one potential laugh (which usually fails) after another."
"cothm88","3","14","28","29 September 2007"," Superbad was really super bad...
","How stupid can you really get? Horny teenagers? Incompetent cops? Alcohol? Sounds like fun, right? Well, it is, but only if your idea of fun involves knowing your brain cells are dying a horribly painful death while you're in the theatre. Then again, if you're that desperate to ruin your life, there are probably more efficient things you can be doing anyways.<br/><br/>Superbad delivers in the department of laughs because the jokes are oftentimes unexpected. ClichÃ©s pervade the movie, but several scenes are genuinely hilarious. The rest of the movie is vulgar, rude, and debasing. If you're into that kind of stuff, this is a movie worth watching. It might even work as a date-movie. However, the one thing Superbad lacks is intelligence.<br/><br/>Basically, you see the story of three Seniors due to graduate unfold as they try to buy alcohol with a fake ID. From there, it all goes crazy. The writers seem to have missed that crazy doesn't always equal funny. Then again, if you want to see funny, go buy Knocked Up instead."
"deac0n_fr0st","2","23","52","18 August 2007"," As confused as it is boring
","You know what we really hate? It's when movies show all their funny parts before you ever show up to the theater. Nothing makes us feel more like we've wasted our money than showing up for nearly two hours and laughing, almost solely, at those things we laughed at for free. This is the plight of Superbad, which relies on vulgar terminology in outrageous situations to generate laughs.<br/><br/>So what is Superbad? Is it a teen comedy? You wouldn't know it by all the dead time in the theater where none is laughing. The movie drags in several parts, and for me got to the point it was almost unbearable to keep watching. I truly wanted to get up and leave, but I sacrificed another hour and stayed through the whole thing. Had I decided to count the number of times I laughed out loud that didn't include things I saw in the previews, I may have been able to count them on Captain Hook's two hands.<br/><br/>So if it's not a teen comedy, is it a high school, American Pie-ish comedy? Like a raunchy comedy? American Pie shouldn't be downgraded to the level of Superbad. American Pie was smart, truly funny, and bad as it may be, delivered a message. Superbad, on the other hand, has no message. There is no rhyme or reason to the antics that befall the three lovable losers. The friendship scenes seem forced. The relational scenes are so far over the top and outside of reason you just hope and pray teenagers aren't as felony stupid in real life as they are in this movie. So far as raunch goes, it begins and ends with dirty words, that truly have an ""in the closet"" homosexual feel to them when you consider the wide use of the 'D' word for penis. You're almost waiting for one of the boys to admit they like men more than women.<br/><br/>So, it isn't raunchy, there's no nudity here guys if that's why you're wanting to check it out, and it doesn't have enough laughs to qualify as a comedy, so what is it? It's a very poor attempt at a raunchy high school teen comedy. Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg have missed the mark completely in this attempt. What we have a junior high script with elementary comedy and an unrealistic view of high school hotties and nerds. You can't even use words like parody, idiomatic, or satirical to describe what they've done here.<br/><br/>All in all, it's an unfunny movie with a few funny because of the language scenes thrown into the mix. The test of a comedy is that you could remove vile language and the movie is still funny. If you remove the vile language from this movie, it's an hour and 54 minutes of silence pictures. Do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD rental."
"ukproject","10","6","10","17 October 2010"," Coming of age movie that stands on it's own.
","First of all, any review that uses 'Superbad' in its title in an attempt to put the movie down reveals more about the depth of the review rather than the movie itself.<br/><br/>While there is nothing new about a movie that features a bunch of teenage boys obsessing over the opposite sex and ways to get laid, it is unfair to compare Superbad to American Pie, Porky's and the like.<br/><br/>The key factor that drives this movie beautifully are the characters. If we didn't know someone like Seth, Even and Fogell at school then that's probably because we were like one of them. Each of the actors superbly portrays the bravado boys use to mask their insecurities over dealing with girls.<br/><br/>The humour is plentiful, funny and appropriate and yes, there's plenty of bad language and crudity, but we're talking about a teen movie here, not an Alfred Hitchcock classic. Anyone watching a teen movie who then gets offended by swearing and sex should not be watching that movie in the first place.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of my own days at school decades ago now when us guys simply could not stop using the 'F' word and looking back we must have sounded ridiculous. I can also remember my first day lying about my age not in order to buy alcohol but adult magazines off the top shelf as well as the first alcohol fuelled party that I attended. Superbad brings these memories back vividly.<br/><br/>Even though I'm a big fan of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I have to admit that Bueller's character was not only unrealistic and outlandish, but bordering on dislikeable. Watching it recently I found myself rooting for Principal Ed Rooney to give Bueller his comeuppance.<br/><br/>Geekily charming, yet annoying and endearing at the same time Fogell 'McLovin' now has to be one of my all time favourite teen characters. The characters of Officer Slater and Officer Michaels only work well because they bounce off the character of McLovin. Seth and Even work well as a teen odd couple and all three lead characters are developed well to the extent that you even end up rooting for all of them. <br/><br/>So, all in all a very funny movie, with some very touching moments. If you want to watch a movie that takes you back to your school days, your old friendships and your attempts at trying to pass for 21, this is it."

","This was pretty darn dull. I never laughed or even really smiled throughout. Okay, I am not the target demographic for this film, left that behind a few decades ago, but even so, this film leaves much to be desired. I got the jokes and gags, they just didn't do anything for me. I can recall talking (to a point) like these kids do, and I did think it was cool at the time. Now I realize that it was boorish and idiotic. I do have to compliment a couple of the young actresses, Martha MacIsaac, who looked awfully nice, and Emma Stone, who pulled off that ""teenage girl who is sophisticated beyond her years"" role. The two cops were painful, and none of it clicked at all, and so was totally unfunny. There is really no reason to watch this movie."

Seth Rogen displays the widest range to date of his masterful acting ability. Bill Hader performs his usual magic with his Jim Carey like expressions.

","""Superbad"" is a 2007 comedy directed by Greg Mottola starring Jonah Hill and Michael Cera. Now after the holidays and all the watches of both festive films and all the mammoth sized reviews about the Skywalker trilogy I decided to sit back and relax with a rewatch of one of my favourite comedies of all time. You know, every cinephile has certain films they don't simply cherish, some films convey a specific feeling of comfort and some just feel like a second home. This is the case for me with this classic high school comedy. Unlike other takes on the genre, Superbad has always been standing out with its hilariousness. Of course the humour is not everyone's taste and it is way too vulgar and perverse, but it's not only this, it's greatly combined with a dramatic conflict of two childhood friends suffering from separation anxiety. It's perfectly balanced between both extremely funny jokes and heart-wrenching drama. All of this comes to life by the genuine chemistry between the two leading boys, but let's not underappreciate the contribution of the hilarious chaos cop duo of Bill Harder and Seth Rogen and the legendary and infamous McLovin played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse. The plot is well worded for a teenage comedy and shamelessly, but realistically deals with what hormone controlled teenagers are confronted in their daily lives. It has an impressive story structure and the way it all comes together is superb. All in all, this modern classic authentically showcases the chaotic adventure of three high school friends dealing with their desires and even their emotions towards their upcoming separation from each other. It's nasty, perverse and extremely hilarious, but all the while shows it has heart and doesn't only stay on the surface. A super good gem I like to revisit at least once a year and highly recommend to everyone who wants to feel like 17 again. Anyways, I'm McLovin it."

"andrewhumphreys-71924","10","3","4","27 October 2018"," Hilarious, relateable and memorable
","Superbad is a 2007 film that follows 3 friends (Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christoper Mintz-Plasse) on their quest to get alcohol for a party being thrown by Emma Stone's character Jules. Since they are graduating and going off to different colleges, they've made it their goal to get laid at the party before college. It's primarily a comedy but you could argue that it has a few elements of a coming of age film. It's filled with funny moments, relateable situations and memorable dialogue.<br/><br/>The humour in this movie is very similar to that of Pineapple Express and This is the End, it's not that dark and a lot more grounded in reality than the other two but the humour is still noticeably similar. One of the funniest scenes in the movie sees Jonah Hills's character Seth consider buying alcohol despite being under 21. He imagines different scenarious that could unfold one of which has the security guard slit is throat with a broken bottle. The humour in the movie stems a lot of the time from relateable situations that are being blown out of proportion. For example, a lot of people would probably have embarassed themselves in front of a crush. However, they probably wouldn't have passed out and head butted them.<br/><br/>While there may be a lot of moments in Superbad that are relateable for being Embarassing or Awkward, there are also a few that are relateable in a more positive way. For example, the end of the movie sees Seth and Michael Cera's character Evan saying goodbye to each other after the events of the film, knowing thay they will now be seeing a lot less of each other, which could at first be considered sad but when you think about it, it's something that pretty much everyone goes through, it could then be seen as Reassuring as it shows the audience that it's natural for you to drift apart from people who you thought would be in your life forever.<br/><br/>The dialogue and writing in Suoerbad is also great. The two funniest characters in the film are a pair of dimwitted cops played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader who take Christopher Mintz-Plasse's McLovin under their wing. One of my favourite lines in the film is When Bill Hader's Officer Slater asks McLovin if he's ""familiar with Yoda from Attack of the Clones."" Equally the dialogue between the main 3 teenagers is just as funny. From the crewd insults to the drunken slurs, everything they say in the film is something you'd expect a 18 year old to say.<br/><br/>Superbad's status as a cult comedy future classic is well deserved. While it's yet to see if it will hold up, Superbad is currentlt one of the best, most relateable teen comedies available. I'd put it on the same level as other great teen comedies like the Breakfast Club and Dazed & Confused."

","Superbad starts strong right out of the gate and it never lets up. Two teenage boys desperately want to lose their virginity before college and will seemingly stop at nothing to make sure it happens. The movie will absolutely remind you of similar antics conducted in high school, whether it be shotgunning beers in your parents basement or awkwardly learning how to communicate with the opposite sex. Jonah Hill's lack of filter is hilarious, as about one in every three lines he says in the movie would make your mother cringe. Michael Cera consistently lacks confidence throughout the entire movie, in typical Michael Cera fashion. Despite the light-hearted fun constant throughout the entire movie, Superbad does do a great job analyzing the struggles of maturity, feelings of inadequacy, and the persistence of friendship. I've seen the movie at least 10 times and I'm usually laughing so hard by the liquor store scene that I'm in tears. A timeless classic."

","Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are precisely in their element as a pair of hyper-awkward high school seniors, attempting to delicately navigate their way around virginity before college. Snide, sharp and effortlessly witty, it's an absolute howl, even for folks who may not have worked through the same problems at that age. Hill and Cera have great chemistry, bouncing insults and muttering puns at a machine-gun pace, and they get a ton of help from the supporting cast. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader damn near steal the show as a pair of irresponsible cops out for a joyride with Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who is himself unforgettable as the eccentric uber-geek ""McLovin."" I just wish it could've hovered in its zone of meaningless shenanigans the whole way through, because the last twenty minutes - when the plot suddenly realizes it needs to get going - are something of a chore to push through. Still, it's great enough that I'd call it a generation-defining comedy, tremendously written and utterly unstoppable when it's in a groove. Extra kudos for introducing the world to Emma Stone."
"willcundallreview","8","3","4","12 March 2014"," A very funny alcoholic adventure
","Superbad is comedy with lots of laughs and a great story about teens going to college and making one final stand to do what they loved best about high school and being friends. The film mixes good laughs and genuine emotion of the characters to create a very good film which could be considered one the best teen comedies round, and definitely the best of the 2000's. I felt as I said that it wad Very Good, and here is why I did.<br/><br/>The story is great and moves along a fantastic pace mixing character stories between each other and running into one another with unpredictable and funny circumstances. What sets this story apart from other party films is that the film has a preparation for the party and then what happens after the party and so you get to know what the characters are like whether sober or drunk. With fantastic lines and fun characters it makes the story even better and one you can see over and over.<br/><br/>I liked the cast who do a great job with the comedy and even with there movements can make you chuckle. Jonah Hill is the comedy king of this movie and serves up nearly every joke in this with fine brilliance and calm sophistication. Michael Cera is the more rational mind but he does it well and although not so funny still manages to set the other funny characters off. The entire supporting cast around that such as Bill Hader and Seth Rogen among others do a great job and just add to the laughs of this very funny movie.<br/><br/>The script obviously is the funny bone and without a decent script it would be a terrible film, and so all acclaim must go to Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg who one are the basis of this film, but also the great writers of this who mix comedy and friendship well together so that it isn't sweet but not too sour either. The direction also needs praise as much of that is what makes it funny with fast scenes that you just think ""WOAHHH"", perfection in this genre of comedy.<br/><br/>Any bad things come, well I am not sure, some jokes do miss the mark but never that badly. I feel some people also will hate the crude humour and so that is basis for some criticism to say it relies on that type of humour, but what do you expect from a teen comedy like this. Yet again it is your perspective when it comes to criticism and what YOU like and don't like in comedy, some will like some won't, but I do think the majority will enjoy this.<br/><br/>I would recommend it to basically to who I said would enjoy it, those who like teen comedies should be pleased by this and American Pie fans should equally be pleased by it. Don't watch if you don't appreciate drunken behaviour and sexual tones too because this is chock full of it, maybe only certain people will like it and possibly being a teen comedy, it is aimed at making teens and young adults laugh.<br/><br/>Strongly a Very Good film and I felt it was super close to being a straight great but wasn't quite a there at great and excellent film but all the same very good is no underrating nor overrating. Watch it with friends and drink and eat with it and go with the flow, the party can entertain large groups of people at a time and laughs with come from all corners of the room."

The cops should be more straight. That way it would be more relatable, and much more funny."
"Tcarts76","8","4","6","27 September 2012"," If you get past the first 15 minutes it's not too bad!
","In the first 15 minutes of this movie I wanted to turn it off. It was just a bunch of obligatory swearing and had no value at all. If you can get past the beginning though it turns out to be a decent comedy worth watching.<br/><br/>It is the usual teen movie story line. A group of teenage losers hatch a plan to buy alcohol for a party in order to impress girls and lose their virgin status. Now, I saw a problem with the cast already. Michael Cera seems to be only able to play the same boring, nerdy, over thinking, teen character in every single movie he is in, and Jonah Hill is not much better. The usual nasal boredom of their voices usually makes me want to shoot myself for listening the to movie going sheep who love these movies. I watched it anyway and found it to be a pretty funny movie.<br/><br/>It turns into a teen misadventure movie that is rather well crafted and a fun ride. Fogel ""McLovin"" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse ) is definitely the best character in the movie, and Bill Hader and Seth Rogan make great appearances as bored cops out or a little fun.<br/><br/>It IS a basic teen movie but the misadventures make it worth watching and it actually met the expectations that a lot of people touted. Again, if you are an average person of adult age that doesn't spend every waking moment of your life playing video games and smoking pot, it may be hard to get through the beginning, but from then on out it will still have some good comedic value.<br/><br/>Like my reviews?

","Before I begin my review, I'd like to say that I HATE teen movies. Almost all of them have little plot and lots of sex, sex, sex. It gets old. That's why I was very hard pressed to see this movie, despite all of my fiancés goading. I braced for the worst.<br/><br/>As it turns out, it was actually hilarious. Yes, it was full of sex. Getting laid was the entire plot. There were many great one liners and subtle humor involved though. There were some scenes that had me laughing well after the movie was over.<br/><br/>This movie isn't for everyone though. I hardly think older generations would enjoy it. Anyone who is uncomfortable with sex, cussing, and perverted jokes wouldn't like it either. On the other hand, young adults would like it. This is definitely full of ""4chan humor"", so you know anyone from there would love this movie.<br/><br/>The great acting, funny scenes and characters, and relatable high school humor will make up for all of the crudeness involved. Give it a try!"

","Superbad, A funny tale of three teenage boys revved up by their hormones, Seth (Jonah Hill), Evan (Michael Cera) and Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) decide that their only chance left to become cool and remove themselves from their geek status, they agree that getting a load of booze, getting completely wasted and getting laid is the only way this will happen.<br/><br/>Seth and Evan are best friends, inseparable and are at their last few days of high-school. Usually shunned by the popular kids, Seth and Evan luck into an invitation to a party, and spend a long day, with the help of their nerdy friend Fogell, trying to get enough booze to get their chances with two girls, Jules and Becca, so they can kick-start their sex lives and go off to college with a summer full of experience and new skills. Their adventure is complicated by Fogell's falling in with two inept cops who both slow and assist the plan.<br/><br/>Evan is bright, a young student whose sweetness over shadows his suffocating fear of heading off to college without his best friend Seth - a hormone-driven mischief-maker who wasn't accepted to the same school. And both know this will have an impact on their friendship Meanwhile, Evan and Seth's friend Fogell acquires a fake I.D. that instantly attatches to a pair of truly legendary cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen). <br/><br/>My opinion of the movie is that its a really a good movie, fun and enjoyable especially for teens of the same age group as the characters. It portrays reality in teen age troubles and shows exactly how most teens feel at that stage of life. I definitely would recommend that people watch this movie however both younger children may not understand the movie greatly and adults may not like it due tho the language and storyline but this maybe an indication that the movie is mainly targeted at teens. I would give this move 8/10 as the movie was funny, clever and relateable but maybe not for all viewers."
"darkknightr","Null","4","6","14 September 2011"," One of the well written and best performed comedies of the decade
","Superbad is one of the well written and best performed comedies of the decade. It totally cracked me up after a long time with its fresh authentic jokes. After being numbed by Hollywood clichéd teen comedies, Superbad gave me some genuine laughs. One might classify this movie as modern day 'American Pie' but it has got much more than that. I don't know how I missed out on Superbad initially. Now it's definitely going into my favorites.<br/><br/>Jokes in the movie originate from storyline without jeopardizing the flow and pace. You have to give it to Seth Rogen for his brilliant writing. I am a fan of Seth Rogen's works ever since 'Knocked up'. You can definitely see Apatow's style throughout movie. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill, who are two pillars of the story, delivered some excellent piece of acting here. Especially Jonah Hill has awesome dialog delivery skills. His character is not the usual high school fat kid who does freaky stuffs. He rather plays a sensitive, smart and equally funny role. Emma Stone is irresistibly hot with her new looks that suits her quite well. The cool irresponsible cop roles played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader, sabotaging every possible investigation, is so hilarious to watch. You can also find other Apatow's usual cast doing their part.<br/><br/>Another nice thing about Superbad is that the crude and explicit nature of jokes are smartly exploited which makes them enjoyable eliminating the gross element. It's quite rare to find a comedy movie that's so natural, funny and fast-paced. If you want to take a break, spend some time without getting bored, Superbad is recommended. The movie has some feel-good elements too. You'll get to know when you see."
"staleno","5","4","6","2 January 2010"," Mildly entertaining
","If you're looking for an uncomplicated and funny movie, Superbad does the job. The characters are witty and the dialogue is sometimes hilarious. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera both performs decently as the main characters Seth and Evan. Personally I think the two police officers, played by Bill Hader and Seth Rogen, were priceless, and performed far better.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is actually quite good comedy. You are taken along on a ride alongside three high school losers that are willing to go to great lengths to score with the girls, and get involved in several messed up situations. The second half of the movie is unfortunately terrible. The movie turns into an American Pie clone with the stereotype brainless girls that are ready to get down on the first loser they pass along the way. The second half is also packed with scenes that are painful to watch, due to both the awkward settings, the awkward acting, and the awkward script.<br/><br/>Despite a promising start, the movie ends up like a standard highschool comedy that you've seen many times before. And finally: why do they insist on using 25 year olds to play high school kids? It's so incredibly lame."

","Basically it is like I said. An R rated version of Can't Hardly Wait, or a funny version of American Pie (Thats right peeps, that movie was not funny...give it up.) In Reno Nv here we got an advance screening shy of 3 weeks before the release date so with a crowded movie theatre (all seats filled) and a freakishly strict no cell phone policy (tighter than airport security) we trudged on...<br/><br/>I haven't laughed this hard since Borat, J&S Bob strike back, Anchorman or Super Troopers. Talk about a movie where you actually care about the characters, yes, Losers make the best protagonists.

","The trailers for this movie were pretty funny and a good friend of mine even saw it twice cause he said it was so good. When I saw it for myself I was waiting for it to begin for 2 hours. This movie just drags on and on and on with boring irrelevant conversations between the characters that have nothing to do with the plot. In between these conversations are sad attempts at humor. blurting out a stream of obscenities and talking about porn is only funny for so long before it gets old. The lack of a plot is fatal and the lack of an ending leaves you feeling even more dissatisfied. It seems like the writers of this movie were trying to make another ""Harold and Kumar"" but just failed miserably."

You will laugh, no matter who you are, and it is every actor at his or her finest. If you liked knocked up or 40 year old virgin, you will love this movie.

","Superbad is a movie about awkward teens coping with high school and their lack of popularity (like so many others). The big difference here is that this film is so over the top insane and crude that it's much worse than most high school movies. By way of comparison, it makes American Pie look like a family film.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, a couple of best friends in high school (with a third in tow), all very low on the popularity totem pole, plan on using a fake ID to buy booze for a party being held by one of the most popular girls in school. They think that if they can come through with the alcohol, the two girls the most desire will make them men just before their final year ends. Along the way, they run into muggers, cops, psychotic college partiers and a host of other oddball characters.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen's writing (and Judd Apatow's contribution) here is evident, simply because this movie is so crude and rude and fully deserves it's 18A/R rating. Nonetheless, it is very funny. Seth Rogen also does an excellent job as a rookie policeman who inadvertently helps the guys buy the alcohol."
"the_wolf_imdb","1","6","11","13 November 2011"," Boring and disgusting
","I'm simply amazed anyone in their senses can consider this movie even moderately funny. It simply sucks. It's not your average ""adventure of drunken guys"" - no, it is sad quest of pathetic teenagers for a bit of sorry f*ck.<br/><br/>We have sad version of Cartman who can think only about the dicks and vaginas. And about himself. To listen his lines actually hurts my ears. Then there is his mentally retarded friend who can somehow pretend to even more retarded cops he is 10 years older. Then there is incredibly dull character who is probably supposed to be ""positive hero"". Then there are two ultra dumb cops who get drunk on duty, shoot in the city, blind themselves with flashlights while driving etc. All these pathetic characters are running around in the attempt to get some booze so they maybe get laid.<br/><br/>Seriously, I managed to survive about an hour of the movie in hope there will be some fun. You know, something funny, not like drunken shooting or drunken driving or drunken fight with drunken bum or menstruation blood of some drunken chick. You know some stories may feel funny if you are drunken and they did happen to you. It is not so easy to retell the more or less disgusting happenings to the others so they might find them funny as well. The ""Hangover"" managed to do it and it was enjoyable. But this movie is as fun as to be the only sober on the party forced to watch babbling and vomiting drunks all around. I waited for some twist but there were none and when the movie started to repeat itself I stopped it and decided to return the DVD without suffering it to the end.<br/><br/>I do not understand the high valuation of the movie here. Maybe it has some nostalgic value for those who like to remember when they have been fat, nerdy and had no chance for sex at all. The problem is this is not funny. This is just creepy and to listen jokes about dicks, vaginas, menstruation and vomiting is straightforward disgusting. Maybe you should reconsider your life values if you actually enjoy such sorry stories."
"recife423","1","8","16","13 March 2008"," Superbad Is Aptly Titled
","It is indeed ""superbad"", possibly one of the worst movies I've seen...and I've seen plenty. The two people who brainstormed this whole script at 13 have hopefully matured since then. The plot was nothing new...there are lots of movies out there about horny teens who desperately want to score. Very few scenes were, in my humble opinion, laugh-out-loud funny.<br/><br/>I'm in my early 20's and I love crude humor but this movie seemed like it was trying too hard. After a while, the ""f-bomb"" and constant references to sex started to be annoying. Some lewdness is cool but this was completely overdone. Movies don't have to be full of crap to be funny. And speaking from a woman's perspective, it is impossible to bleed (menstrual blood) on guys from simply dancing with them. The movie was trash. I love comedy and I can appreciate old stuff like Porky's, which was pretty crude in its own way. This movie was a complete miss.<br/><br/>I liked Evan (Michael Cera) in the movie ""Juno"". He is pretty talented, for what it's worth. He constantly has that deer in headlights look about him. Out of all the people in this film, I felt like both he and Fogell/McLovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) were the true actors. They did well in their respective roles considering how bad it all was. The character of Seth (Jonah Hill) was unlikeable for the most part. I found him selfish, obnoxious, disrespectful and a terrible friend to Evan. He had a foul mouth, anger problems, and a screwed-up attitude towards girls. However, his human side did show at times so you realize he isn't a complete jerk...just painfully insecure because he wants this girl Jules to like him and because Evan is his only real friend. Had some things been different, my review probably wouldn't be as harsh."

","Superbad is one of those movies where you laugh out loud the whole way through. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill's relationship is hilarious and more importantly so real. Their chemistry drives the film but the supporting actors are equally as brilliant. As someone who just recently graduated high school, I can relate perfectly to the characters and their emotions as well the realness of the dialogue and partying. This movie is better than American Pie, more real than Dazed and Confused, and I can even say funnier than Fast Times. That's saying a lot. I just really can't express how funny this film is. Go see it right now if you haven't. I give it 9.5/10 only because it has about a 10 minute slow period, but the other 105 minutes are the most brilliant 105 minutes I've ever seen in comedy."
"marthatm","1","11","24","12 October 2007"," Vulgar, mean spirited, demeaning to women, no redeeming value
","I see a lot of movies, granted not gross-out teen movies, but the reviews for Superbad were good and it has connections to Knocked Up, which had much to enjoy. I never walk out of a movie, but I walked out of this one because of the language, subjects, characters, and situations. I agree these writers have some talent, but they don't have anything else: maturity, sensitivity, the ability to understand more than one point of view, nor any subtlety or sophistication, particularly with the English language. The humor is one note, mean, crude, vulgar, and demeaning to women. It shows that they began writing this movie when they were 13, it is at that level. I made it past the ""when I get home I'll take a shower to clean this off me"" point but when I found myself seriously thinking ""I'll join a convent so I never have to talk to a man again"", I left. I hope their mothers are as embarrassed as I was to have to see this drivel, and I hope other parents are smart enough to keep their teens from this type of entertainment. The industry does itself no credit when it produces movies like this, to say nothing of losing large segments of potential audience."
"charchuk","8","11","24","9 September 2007"," Hilarious and heartfelt
","As hilarious as I was expecting, but also surprisingly genuine and heartfelt. The relationship between the two leads is absolutely spot on and perfectly blends comedy and drama. This emotional core elevates the film above most other teen comedies and puts it right alongside American Graffiti, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Dazed & Confused. And it's also (probably) the funniest film of the year thus far. Everything from physical slapstick to witty one-liners are utilized and it all works fantastic. The subplot with McLovin and the cops takes away a bit from the central story, but it's so hilarious that it doesn't really matter. The film does run a bit long, and some of the middle should have be trimmed, but, overall, this is still a modern teen comedy classic."

","After watching this movie, I was appalled at the state of comedy in movies nowadays. Don't get me wrong thinking that I have no sense of humor because I do. I find most movies funny at the correct parts. But to say that the movie Superbad is one of the funniest movies ever made is a sin. The writing in the movie is poor because of the way they treat one another is completely unrealistic. I feel as if the writer of the movie decided to throw in profanity at certain points in an effort to make audiences laugh. The overall movie lacks a plot and is the little plot that there is gets old after about 30 minutes into the movie. There were points in the movie where I almost left the theater but I didn't because I didn't want to waste my money."

Seth and Evan become separated from Fogell (now called McLovin) and they still haven't got the alcohol for the party that night.<br/><br/>Let me just say one thing first. If you are not a fan of American Pie or any sex teen comedy, then i would strongly suggest you avoid this. The film is the usual story of teenage guys trying to get alcohol and trying to get laid, but it is the fantastic script that has been written and the lovable characters which makes 'Superbad' fantastic. The script is written and performed with a fluid motion. Unlike some films, the two lead characters, Evan and Seth really do feel like they've been friends for years. The three leads act so well. Michael Cera is the lovable nerd and Jonah Hill is one of the best 'speakers' in this film. The words just flow out of him. Chris Mintz-Plasse creates an iconic character which would be remembered for years. If you don't mind teen sex comedies, then you HAVE to watch this.<br/><br/>""Hello.

"diac228","6","8","17","20 August 2007"," It is not Super, nor is it Bad, but like High School it seems like it never ends.
","The return of the R-rated comedies is reaching full force, as we now have a new group of actors that's giving the Frat Pack some competition. Starting with the short-lived television shows ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared;"" Judd Apatow, Seth Rogan, and a slew of other buddies have emerged from the shade and into the spotlight with consecutive hits. Already with one summer success under their belt (Knocked Up), the crew has decided to take on the R-rated High School genre. This genre doesn't see much success, with movies like American Pie becoming an exception to the rule. Nonetheless, with its inability to hold back punches and amazing amount of energy and chemistry amongst the actors and actresses, Superbad looks like a hit from a mile away. While this movie does indeed deliver more laughs than the American Pie films, it's still far from perfect. The movie drags, there isn't much content underneath the vulgarity and jaw-dropping moments, and it lacks the emotion and chemistry from previous hits ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" But if you are looking for a raunchy good time, then look no further, because Superbad is quite a naughty little flick.<br/><br/>Superbad follows two high school friends that are about to separate once the semester is over. Seth (Jonah Hill) is a vulgar, unsympathetic, foul-mouthed, and sex-starved class clown; while his best friend Evan (Michael Cera) is a shy nice guy who has strong feelings for the pretty Becca (Martha MacIsaac). Together, they will try to score with their current crushes by joining a party and promising alcohol---with the help of the nerdy and antisocial Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Along the way they will not only run into a bunch of quirky and sometimes dangerous scenarios, but it will also unleash the vent-up anger that all three have towards each other. Written by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg, these two know how to incorporate high school anxieties and fears and embarrassments without the movie feeling clichéd. What makes Superbad so fresh and unique is that it does not fear offending nor does it fear potentially grossing the audience out. In here we get some really raw dialogue, graphic imagery, and plenty of gross-out humor. Taking place over the course of one evening, Superbad follows in the footsteps of previous high school classics like American Graffiti.<br/><br/>Superbad is funny, no question, there are plenty of wonderful one-liners and funny moments (especially in the first act). Yet going past the humor, it lacks the heart that classic high school movies contain. Also it doesn't help that our main character is a bit of a jerk. Why Seth and Evan are together is a bit questionable considering that Seth usually has nothing good to say, and Evan has nothing but a pure good heart and admirable qualities. The black sheep of the trip is Fogell, whose appearance with the other two is also questionable considering the lack of decent treatment he gets. The audience winds up rooting for Fogell in the end of the movie, not really Seth (Or it could be because he's actually McLovin, like the previews showed). What keeps Superbad afloat is actually the well-written story, as the impossibility of accomplishing their mission becomes more and more present as the third act approaches. This movie steers in many unique directions, and becomes quite unpredictable.<br/><br/>Greg Mottola, not Judd Apatow like the commercials make it seem, is running the show. In the director chair, he limits the improvising and focuses more on the story. That's what makes Superbad less of a quotable movie than previous adult comedies, yet maintains stability---until the end. The third act practically runs out of steam, as it looks like they didn't quite know how to end the movie. Instead, we are received with an ending that leaves out characters for the last several minutes, and doesn't quite feel complete. You need a feel-good ending in these types of films, and it just wasn't delivered here.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Superbad isn't an instant classic, nor is it a disappointing disaster. Instead, it's a decent flick with its issues and problems. The ending wasn't great, the main characters doesn't incite sympathy or support from the viewers, the running time felt a bit long, and it doesn't help that it has to follow-up to gems like recent adult comedies 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Wedding Crashers, and Harold and Kumar. The writing, directing, and editing were fine up until the very end, when they didn't quite know how to finish the picture. The acting was good, but the characters they were portraying just weren't that interesting(with the exception of McLovin). The genre has very few true classics and complete films, so despite the setbacks this still stands as one of the better high school comedies in recent years. Going with friends would definitely enhance the experience, as you all can relive the good ol' days of high school and the embarrassing moments that follow."

When I finally stood up to walk out of the theater, someone 3 rows behind me asked, in a very sarcastic tone,""Did you think it was funny?"" Then I realized how hard I had been laughing.

As they plan to participate in one of the year's last parties, they must enlist the help of their friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Passe) and his newly acquired fake I.D. to buy alcohol. But the road to the Promised Land is filled with buffoonish cops, drunken strangers, and debauched parties. Evan, Seth, and Fogell must conquer these obstacles before they can reach their dates.<br/><br/>Greg Mottola has a good eye in capturing comedy. He does not just point the camera while the actors do their thing. He focuses on the whole setting because that is where most of the jokes are played. This is evident right from the opening scene between Seth and Evan's mom. Mottola also is expert in catching the reactions of the characters. Every awkward rambling and shocked expression adds to the comedic effect of the jokes. Mottola's direction ensures that not only will the fans see the joke but feel it as well.<br/><br/>In a genre such as this, it is difficult to keep coming up with more outlandish circumstances and humor. Rogen and Goldberg more than meet that challenge. Right off the bat, they throw in outrageous jokes that are akin to this form of comedy. Physical humor is also prevalent in the movie by the all the accidents that befall Seth. Fans will be grateful to know that the writers' creation of McLovin is played out prevalently throughout the film. The jokes that stem from that character are practically worth the price of admission. Another great feature that they kept from ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" is to give the script heart. True, the film comprises of many jokes you wouldn't tell you mother. But the ending point is not always the raunchy objective of just getting laid.<br/><br/>Michael Cera and Jonah Hill have great chemistry as Evan and Seth. They compliment each other so well that it is easy to believe that they are best friends. Tapping into his George Michael days on ""Arrested Development"", Cera is a natural in playing his character's awkwardness and nervousness. Though there are times when it feels Cera is almost rehashing his television character, he also makes Evan a more headstrong and more determined character. He is quick with the comebacks and speaks more freely than audiences have been used to. It is a refreshing change and one that Cera fits in very easily. Hill also steps out of his range of the nervous, uncomfortable nerd and plays Seth as more crude and hilarious than we've seen him before. Hill is not only quicker with the delivery but also endures the brunt of the physical humor. Like Cera, he also seems at ease with the new character and style and could parlay this into a great comedic success. But the show stealer is the man who will forever be dubbed McLovin: Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Mintz-Plasse seems to have the most fun with the role and just ran with the name and character. For his first time on screen, Mintz-Plasse shows excellent comedic chops. Not only does he play up the clumsy teen role but also ad-libs brilliantly in his fake persona. Mintz-Plasse is smart enough to not overplay the character but feeds off of the reactions and lines of the cast. The great talent of these gentlemen also makes the audience want to cheer them on as they pursue their goal. They draw in the audience to feel their dilemmas and triumphs that they really become sympathetic characters rather than just horny nerds. Also look out for a terrific comedic performance by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as bumbling police officers who encounter the soon-to be-famous McLovin.<br/><br/>""Superbad"" is a can't-miss humor fest. It is so uproariously funny that it has to be seen a second time just to hear the jokes you might have laughed over the first time. Along with the script, the cast is the best decision for the film. The chemistry is so in sync that it is possible to believe that Cera, Hill, and Mintz-Plasse have known each other for years. The female leads of Martha MacIsaac and Emma Stone play the more straight characters but are also not made overly attractive so as to make Cera's and Hill's pursuits unbelievable. ""Superbad"" is simply comedic gold that will put a little McLovin in your heart.<br/><br/>SPECIAL OBSERVATIONS BY DORKUS MALORKUS GRADE: B+"
"pageiv","8","20","55","26 August 2007"," You got to be kidding me.
","I loved the trailer for this movie, it gave me hope for an American Pie movie, high school kids afraid of growing up looking for their last chance together, and get drunk and laid. Then the reviews (mainly on AICN) came in saying it was one if not the funniest movie of the year.<br/><br/>This film was beyond crude, but not crude in a way someone is just crass because he is an individual, but rude in a way that bordered on being hateful. Yes when I was younger we talked about women like with, but the way Seth was doing it whenever he felt the urge just left me totally uncomfortable. He reminded me of the douchebags that were asses to women and everyone else in school.<br/><br/>On the way home, my wife and I compared this movie to American Pie, both were about HS kids wanting to party, get drunk, and get laid, maybe it's a generational gap, but Superbad was just horrible pulling it off. I'm super stumped how this movie has been called, ""sweet"" or ""good hearted"" when it was directed at a 15 yr old boy maturity level. Maybe the internet has corrupted kids since 1999, or maybe I'm older, but the 15-18 yr olds in the theater were howling with laughter at the scenes I shook my head on.<br/><br/>I've never walked out of a movie, but almost on this one. I should've since I only get Sundays off.<br/><br/>I think the young boys growing up don't know squat about satisfying, and woman let guys act like immature little punks.<br/><br/>I also didn't think Knocked Up was extremely funny. I enjoyed it, failed to see it as a comedy. Seth Rogan was a lazy douche that no woman with an ounce of self esteem would be around. But she got ""knocked up"" by him, OK, but instead of focusing on that, Rogan wasn't portrayed as a juvenile moron, he was the voice of reason.<br/><br/>I guess I'm just too old, but American Pie, and even Can't Hardly Wait, owns this movie.<br/><br/>I've said enough, Flame on."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","7","15","10 May 2008"," Supertrash
","A friend of mine loved this movie so I thought I'd give it a try. This film ain't 'Superbad' but it's 'Supertrash'. Trying to be like the 'American Pies' and other teen sex comedies, this one failed to make much of an impression and I don't get what all the gah-gah is about. The first 45 minutes is full of cheap sex jokes that are not even funny. Had Kevin Smithdirected the film he might have done a better job. 'Superbad' slightly picks up when the two goofy CCs (corrupt cops) are introduced and here it goes (or tries to go) the 'Dude, Where's My Car Way' but eventually the cheap sex-jokes catch up and bring it down by a huge notch. I would have turned it off after 15 minutes but I was struck by Martha MacIsaac's beauty. Her screen time is limited but the film seemed to take a better turn once the coppers were introduced (but alas!). Anyway, i'll get to the technical stuff. Grdg Mottola tries hard to pull an 'American Pie' meets 'Dude Where's My Car' (and some other teen stuff) but he fails. Jonah Hill gives an irritating performance of an annoying character. Michael Cera is pretty much George Michael Bluthe (of 'Arrested Development' fame) but he's the only one who manages to make his character somewhat likable. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is alright as the transforming geek. Bill Hader and Seth Rogan are okay too. Martha MacIsaac and Emma Stone are eye-candy. What else is there to say? The second half is only mildly better than the torturous first. However, overall it's a poor movie. One of the most overrated trash of 2007."

","Taking its cue from the burgeoning geek vogue, Superbad audiences will get what they came in for: an extended barrage of brainless fun.<br/><br/>When they were still 13 years old, Seth Rogen (Knocked Up) and Evan Goldberg wrote the screenplay about two high school seniors, aptly named Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera), who are at a crossroads in their lives: slacker Seth will not be going to the same college as the more studious Evan, who will be going to Dartmouth. The boys deal with their separation anxiety on top of managing to get some illegally-obtained booze for a party they have miraculously been invited to by the girls of their dreams.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen also appears as Officer Michaels and Bill Hader as Officer Slater, who somehow get embroiled after stumbling in on the hilarious attempt of Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) to buy the booze with a fake ID posing as 'McLovin'.<br/><br/>If you plan to enjoy this flick, leave all pretensions at the door. Superbad is what it is: the jokes are crass, but spot on. The connection between the best friends seem very genuine, so despite all the gross out moments, they still make for ridiculously fun geeks."

","I hate to rain on the parade of the 'funniest movie ever' but Superbad wasn't bad, but is not a laugh riot. Some teen age insights amid the top the next one gross sexual joke, but a ridiculous cop buddy Supertroopers laid on American Pie-dom does not a classic make. As a guy I laughed a lot, not the kind of lost it at the movies laughs of a Dumb and Dumber or the building snort by snort belly laughs of The Big Lebowski, and not the continuous tumescence of Animal House. I also wondered what any girl might think of the whole premise of the plot or the grossness of the jokes? There weren't any girls in the audience I sat with, mostly guys in their twenties, some high schoolers, and amid the group there wasn't the universal hysteria the reviews posted seem to suggest. The major paid movie reviewers waxed rhapsodically about this movie but having spent many an afternoon sitting with movie reviewers in various screening rooms, they are blood brothers (and seem the types to giggle over menstrual blood) to Seth, Evan, and Fogel. Seth is given to many adult like rages, Fogel too many moments of unbelievable nerdiness, the cops too many similar scenes of 'just wanting to have fun, for this movie to move the average movie goer or to cause one to get beyond a laugh to a laugh riot. Evan, on the other hand, is allowed to make his character in the movie a real person. More universal, less nerdy or fake aggressive. There was something in his voice, something that we all were in high school that is the best thing in the movie.<br/><br/>It must not have been chance but clear thinking that did not include any of the ridiculous cop buddy sub plot in the previews. The cop stuff is like the energizer bunny: it goes on and on and on for increasingly hard to get laughs out of increasingly ludicrous situations.<br/><br/>So, six stars out of ten, and not even in the top ten of teenage gross out sex movies or cop buddy movies."

I love this one the most, mainly because, I AM those guys. I just graduated from Highschool, and parties and sex and all that stuff is extremely awkward. And they do that SO well. Michael Cera is the king of Awkward. Jonah Hill is becoming quite a funny guy as well. This movie was so freaking sweet. Go see it the day it comes out, and I promise your stomach will hurt by the time you walk out from laughing so hard, and if you think otherwise, I give you permission to punch me in the gut."
"Quinoa1984","9","8","18","20 August 2007"," a truly and unabashedly immature teen-sex/party comedy, and it's 100% irresistible to the 15 year old in me
","I know these guys, or at least feel like I do. Superbad isn't about simple clichéd figures of teenage angst and pent up sexual frustration, or with goofy nerdy stereotypes (though maybe for the latter there is almost that). Somehow Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who name the two lead characters after themselves, just know what it is about these guys, and that teenagers can be foul-mouthed and witty and naive and awkward and stupid and smart and crazy all in some equal measures with the levels put just right. It's low-brow to the max, but it never looks down on the audience but plays always to it, as if the same people right on the poster (McLovin included) are right in the audience, and are damn proud to see themselves up there. It's pretty damn near close to a teen classic comedy, with as much strengths in the dialog as a Dazed and Confused, and more outrageousness than an American Pie would think to go for. Even the cops in the movie are like the teenagers, only a few years old, and with guns, and lots of beer. It's the most fearlessly vulgar comedy of the year.<br/><br/>Seth and Evan (Jonnah Hill and Michael Cera, the former from producer Judd Apatow's Knocked Up and the latter from Arrested Development) are best friends in high school, seniors soon to part way for separate colleges, and it bothers Seth that this is happening. Nevertheless, the partying must go on! But where seems to be the question, as they're both not exactly 'hip' amongst most, and don't get invited. Yet there is a change, as Seth is asked by Jules (Emma Stone) to a party with the condition that he bring the booze. A problem? Not quite- McLovin- a.k.a. Fogel (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, one of the great teen movie nerds) has a phony ID with said name, and goes through his own crazy adventure in first getting the supplies, then punched out by a random looter, then riding along with cops (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) who wan't just as much a good time as he does; what better way to bust a crime than at a bar- some beers on the way! Then comes the party, but first a detour at another party, then some mishaps with a stain (big whoops), and finally some good times at the main party, though it may depend on your definition of ""good"" in terms of drunken would-be sex and letdowns.<br/><br/>It's all very outrageous, every step of the way, and there's not a scene that goes by that doesn't contain the laughs that the actors, writers, and director go for. Even stuff that should be just crude and insane, like the many, many, many drawings of genitalia (and more if you stay through the end credits) from the 4th grader Seth, or the near Raising Arizona-like chase scene with the cops sloppily on route following a sudden hit and run with Seth and Evan, or puke jokes, or the 'stain' joke (where you can hear the collective groan from the audience, a great sign that people in the demographic can still be shocked or disgusted at least), or even the fate of the cops and McLovin as they tear up the cop car. All of it somehow connects completely, because Rogen and Goldberg, as well as the actors, don't pass by the truth that is within much of the scenes. Through all the antics they're just guys who have equal anxieties at their age regarding sex and friendship (not to mention that perfectly gay scene when they're snuggled drunk in the sleeping bags), and there's even a sweetness to their ambitions and disillusionment.<br/><br/>Like Knocked Up, it's relatable as long as there's a given amount of suspension of disbelief. But Superbad goes even further than that film- and rightfully so- at combining physical comedy with what must be improvisation, hinging to the Mel Brooks credo to ""rise below vulgarity"", and at the same time not getting scared off to add some fantastic one-liners and pop culture goofs in the mix (that a goof like McLovin stays fresh all the way to the end is a testament to the longevity of a one-note gag played right). Look at it this way, where else will I find a flick with joke about Orson Welles and the Coen brothers in between lots of talk about d***s and p*****s?"

In my opinion Superbad is no where near as good as any of these 3 movies.<br/><br/>SUPERBAD is not SUPERGOOD. It's not even good. At best it's 6/10.<br/><br/>Superbad is not groundbreaking in its material. Superbad does not flow well at all and is veeeeerrrryyy drawn out in lots of places. I think American Pie was much funnier, with more action, and with better character interactions.<br/><br/>But perhaps it was just my high expectations. However, when a movie rates higher than a movie like The Big Lebowski, my expectations go through the roof.<br/><br/>I will concede that Jonah Hill was brilliant in patches, but he had some scenes that were so stupid they more than offset the good ones.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Average comedy that shouldn't rate on the top 250 list amongst the classics."

Jokes and gross-out gags that we have either heard before or are just so tasteless that they should have remained unheard. Considering previous generations have had The Breakfast Club, Dazed and Confused and even Waynes World, I feel sorry for the teens who will have their adolescence defined by something as low-brow as this. At least their is some kind of moral fiber to be found in the character of Evan and I guess the pillow-talk scene at the end between Seth and Evan is kinda cute.

Not to mention the most plot less screenplay since ""Beer League"". This features three high-school dunces spending an entire night trying to get to a party. Yep. That's it. And their numerous run-ins with hilarity which include standing outside a convenience store for a half hour and getting menstrual blood on their clothes. No, really.<br/><br/>And 'McLovin'???? This is high-grade humor to people??!! <br/><br/>Plus a glaring annoyance: what's with a group of early-20s filmmakers being obsessed with the 70s and 80s? Disco-ish soundtrack is out of place, as are the anachronisms; a kid who was 11-years-old in the year 2000 *COULD NOT* have had a Ghostbusters lunchbox. Get friggin' real.<br/><br/>I will say this: the character of Evan is the only thing close to resembling a realistic (or *remotely* likable) character, who actually speaks with sincerity and thoughtfullness. When he FINALLY lays into his buddy detailing what a dumb-John he is, the film got (gasp!) authentic for a second.<br/><br/>But the character of Seth is one of the more hateful and intolerable since Stiffler of the ""American Pie"" films. A nauseating drone who YELLS his dialogue at everybody, which is nothing but a series of desperately profane insults and imbecilic bodily nicknames. Seriously, this refuse reeks of having been written in less than 24 hours.<br/><br/>*ONLY* redeeming trait is the retro Columbia Pictures logo at the start, along with a kicky groove to begin things. It's quickly undermined (and erased) as soon as the script kicks in. But as mentioned in the summary, I'm done with the Apatow assembly-line of redundant vagina-inspired comedies."
"pauljcurley","1","6","13","17 December 2007"," Avoid at all costs
","I went to great lengths to rent this movie yesterday, traveling to a couple of video stores until I found an available copy (I scored the last one they had!). I felt lucky, and was really looking forward to cuddling up on the couch with my new girlfriend, and having a few laughs.<br/><br/>Yes, there were a few laughs here and there, but as the movie wore on, my laughter grew less and less frequent, began turning to discomfort, and then finally crossed over the line into outright embarrassment -- and even anger that this spectacularly bad movie has been greeted with such enthusiasm by audiences and - shamelessly - even critics.<br/><br/>I knew the plot beforehand - two dorky kids are assigned to procure alcohol for a party - which sounded promising - and something most people can relate to, if you grew up in the US after the drinking age increased to 21. I remember messing around with fake ID's, hoping to score some booze any way possible so my friends would think I was cool, being simultaneously attracted to and intimidated by girls, etc. This should have been a rich source of comedic possibilities. But sadly, the characters were unlovable, even unlikeable - they talk to girls in demeaning ways that bear no resemblance to the awe and fascination that I felt toward them when I was a teenager. I seriously hope that when a cute girl tells a nerd, ""I'll rub your back if you rub mine"", the kid does not reply that his back happens to be ""located on my c**k."" This might be funny due to shock value (I confess that I laughed), but it doesn't make me relate to this character or root for him to actually get laid. I don't recognize this brand of nerd, and have absolutely no sympathy for him. Basically, he approaches women like Stifler from American Pie, but without the cuteness or charm.<br/><br/>Furthermore, these foul-mouthed kids inhabit a world that I simply do not recognize - a world that might be what a 14 year old porn-addled boy envisions, due to his lack of actually having any real-life experiences yet.<br/><br/>I don't see how this movie could be funny for anyone who has actually (i) gone to a party or (ii) had sex. For me, the worst scene was when the kids go to an adult (30-something) party -- where the ""funny"" part is when one kid gets menstrual blood on his pants (message: girls are yucky!!). Another adult at the party shows up with a stolen case of alcohol, and screams ""we're gonna get f***ed up!"" as if he had procured some amazing hard-to-find drug that would propel him to a new, ecstatic experience - I guess a 14 year old might think adults talk this way about drinking but, um, we don't. Simply stated, this movie made me cringe at nearly every turn. Plus, the fat kid says the F-word or some variation thereof every 2 seconds, which was entirely unnecessary (unless it's designed to make you dislike him even more). Please avoid this miserable disaster of a film, unless you are a boy between the ages of 14 and 14 1/2."

"Benjamin_Cox","7","7","16","2 June 2009"," Not my cup of tea but a good teen comedy nonetheless - 76%
","I've never been a huge fan of the teen comedy genre, primarily because they are all essentially the same. Bunch of hopeless losers get together and have a wild, crazy adventure in search of sex, drugs and/or drink. ""Superbad"" sticks rigidly to this formula so in essence, this is no different to ""American Pie"", ""Porkys"", ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" or any other teen flick you could mention. But seeing as it features Hollywood's form actor - Seth Rogen - not only on screen but also on the screenplay, I figured that maybe this might have something to it. And to be fair, there are some laughs to be had and the unfamiliar cast certainly do themselves a power of good but personally, this isn't my cup of tea.<br/><br/>Best friends Seth (Johan Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) have been inseparable throughout high school and are preparing to spend their last few weeks together before separating for college. But after a chance invitation to a party, Seth hatches a plan for them to provide the party with enough booze in order for them to get it on with two girls (Martha MacIsaac & Emma Stone). Roping in fellow geek Foggell (newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and his fake ID, their plan quickly unravels after two inept cops (Rogen & Bill Hader), a homeless drunk and Foggell's bizarre new identity (McLovin) threaten to scupper their plans. Can they get hold of the booze? Can they get to the party and pop their cherry? And when will Hollywood change the record? <br/><br/>It's unfair to judge ""Superbad"" on sticking so close to the teen comedy stereotype because that's what it is - a teen comedy. So it's packed to the rafters with all the crude language, sex jokes and two dimensional eye candy in miniskirts you'll ever need. What ""Superbad"" has in reserve is what separates it from the seemingly never-ending supply of teen flicks spewing from Hollywood. First, it has a killer cast. They isn't a weak link in the chain anywhere, although all three leads are shown up by Rogen and Hader who are simply brilliant as the completely hopeless cops. There is also a surprisingly epic feel to the thing, like a juvenile ""Lord Of The Rings"" as their supposedly simply quest gets ever more convoluted and impossible. But there is also a sting in the tail, an ending that was not only heartfelt but plausible too.<br/><br/>So while it doesn't bring anything new to the party, ""Superbad"" is still welcome all the same. It wasn't the laughter-fest I was expecting but like I said, I'm not a fan of this type of film. If you enjoyed ""American Pie"" or any of its witless sequels then I suspect you'll get more out of this than I did. I just wish that something would come along and not rely on massive amounts of swearing and revolve around a bunch of losers trying to get laid - is that really too much to ask? Maybe ""Pineapple Express"" might appeal to me more but I'm not in any great rush to see that either. All I can say is give ""Superbad"" a chance but only if this sort of malarkey appeals to your teenage sense of humour."

Dancing with a girl at a party on her period, the evidence of which is left on your trouser leg, cannot be considered funny at any level. It's just wrong. The funniest set piece of the film comes when Fogle, a geeky kid, gets fake i.d to buy booze for the last party the three protagonists will spend together before going off to college. Instead of using a normal name like many people would, he changes his to ""McLovin"", neither first or last name, just ""McLovin"".<br/><br/>Continuing in the mould of ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"", ""Superbad"" has an idiosyncratic humour, scripted by and starring Seth Rogen, who also starred in the aforementioned two films. His role as a daft cop, alongside fellow cop played by Bill Hader is a funny double act, but starts to where thin towards the end of the film's nearly 2 hour running time.<br/><br/>This film's i.q is the same as the average shoe size, which is not a bad thing(in small doses, I can't believe I've used the words protagonist and idiosyncratic in my comment on it!), but it jarrs when it begins to take the moral high-ground come the end. It desperately searches for a change from the slapstick, chaotic tone it successfully establishes in the first hour and a half. The final half hour is slow and quite honestly, not that funny.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Superbad"" is not a superbad film. It's a perfectly fine source of entertainment all be it slightly too self-indulgent and aware of its moral responsibility.<br/><br/>*** out of *****"

Michel Cera and Jonah Hill is so funny that i almost wet my pants. Chrisopher Mint is exceptionally good in the roll of Fogel.You just feel sorry for the guy, but at the same time you cant stop laughing at him. I know there is a lot of funny comedies coming out these days, but with this movie is really well written, the jokes will make you laugh so hard that your stomach will hurt. I can understand that this movie is not for everyone, because the language is really bad most of the time. A LOT of swearing, especially from Jonah Hill, but if you don't mind the swearing you will probably find this movie really funny! This is not a movie for the older crowd."

","This movie is very crude and crass with very frank language, but that's what makes it clever and better than recent films in this genera. The conversation the guys have about girls and dating sounded like something you would really hear close friends talk about in private. Things like that are what made it very funny. Seth and Evan are two high school seniors whom generally don't get invited to parties. But, Jules the girl Seth likes is having a party and after overhearing they have a fake ID to get alcohol invites them to her party. Their buddy Fogell, aka Mclovin, is the one with the ID, so the rest of the movie involves what happens when Mclovin goes to a liquor store to purchase alcohol and then their attempt to make it to the party. About everything that can go wrong does.<br/><br/>The cops were a hoot. They take Mclovin to a bar, let him play with a gun, and drink on the job. I hope the real police don't act like that. And Seth and Evan have their own problems, they keep getting hit by cars and wind up at a party where cocaine is involved and get into fights.<br/><br/>All 3 finally make it to Jules' party.

And those of us that are still in education will be made aware of this during the opening scenes.<br/><br/>People who say this movie isn't funny, only find it bad because it is directed towards the 'American-Pie' age group - (so around 20), and the likelihood is, that older people would not find Superbad entertaining, but rather a load of rubbish, simply due to the fact that they don't 'get' the image and nature of the movie :)"

","After about a month of playing theatres, I finally got to see Superbad with my friend after seeing the other movies that had come out that we wanted to see. My friend liked it though he thought it had too much profanity. I didn't have a problem with the language but I did think the funny stuff came in little doses between several scenes that dragged. I liked the performances of Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and Chris Mintz-Plasse as the high school seniors trying to get laid two weeks before graduation as well as the slacker cops played by Bill Hader and the movie's co-writer Seth Rogen. But their performances weren't enough to make this a hilariously funny movie like I usually expect from producer Judd Apatow who had no hand in writing this movie like he had in his previously very funny directorial outings, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. Still, despite its unevenness, Superbad does get points for making the main characters' growing pains seem real and for getting the potential girlfriends of Hill and Cera not seem like such sluts..."
"susemck-1","6","7","17","20 August 2007"," The name says it all.
","I would have given ""Superbad"" a 3 out of 10, but the sweetness and authenticity of the friendship between Seth and Evan gives it some redeeming qualities. ""McLovin"" steals the show, of course, and if he gets his own movie, I hope it doesn't ruin the painful attraction I feel towards his character. If you were ever unpopular, or a nerd in school, you will feel pains of sympathy as he stumbles through the movie without ever realizing how cringe-worthy his behaviour is.<br/><br/>That being said, the rest of the movie is an extended penis joke with a few comments about vaginas thrown in for variety. It comes as no surprise that one of the main characters has a past obsession with drawing penises. Obviously autobiographical for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, as they never seem to have lost their single-mindedness for genitals.<br/><br/>If you are a teenage boy, you'll love the crude humor. If you're not in this demographic, skip the movie, or at least wait for DVD. Don't be fooled by the reviews noting how ""touching"" the pairs' friendship is. It's only surprising that there is actual emotion displayed in a movie so otherwise devoid of it."
"pbfanaticjoe","5","6","14","30 December 2007"," We've seen it before, but this time it's done Super-bad-Ly .
","There were funny parts. There were parts i laughed so hard that i didn't even hear the next 3 lines of dialog after a joke. This, in my opinion however, is not everything that goes into a good comedy. <br/><br/>In my view, superbad was a mix between the language used in a Kevin Smith film (Without the slight essence of genius.), and the story's of every teen movie made in the 80s. and every other Revenge of the Nerd(s)-esquire member of the comedy genre. In the interests of full disclosure i am a do-gooder kid with an intellecualist core. This makes me biased against anything with American high school kids. But at the end of the day, when I really thought about it, superbad was nothing special. It was mediocre for a new comedy. That makes it sub-par in the big scheme of things. The true reason that i didn't enjoy this film despite some moments that were genuinely entertaining cannot be put in one sentence, for it only becomes apparent after a long and drawn out explanation. <br/><br/>The difficulty is that those who are likely to patronize this movie are likely the same individuals who would vote superbad to be a 10/10 without truly understanding its consequences and only because it is the popular opinion to have. I'll be honest, I didn't see Superbad in the theater, i usually have avoided seeing comedy's in the theater since the too-long Beerfest (which was funnier than this) and the even more drawn out but more original blades of glory. I watched the unrated version from the video rental place at home with a couple of friends my age (teens). Let me say that i am not particularly bothered by toilet humor if it is used tastefully (haha) and if it successfully reaches its goal in making me laugh. Judd Apatow doesn't bother me either. Accepted was a really good true to life comedy. Fun with Dick and Jane was a smart funny like accepted, but the movies that some regard as his best works really weren't that funny to me. Knocked up wasn't amazing unless you have the movie-going experience of only those films brought out in the last few years. <br/><br/>Apatow needs to stop using stereotypes all together. It offends me that the portrait of all high school students as sex crazed heathens with substance abuse problems is truly frightening. This is simply not accurate. If film is an art form than this movie is deceptive art. What this movie ignores is everything that my high school experience has taught me. (my intellecualist core is taking it to seriously) No. This movie is damaged goods for us youth. There is no soul searching in superbad, the characters have a warped hierarchy of Maslow's needs. that is the fundamental flaw of these recent comedies. <br/><br/>one black character in superbad. 1 line in my review. Think about it.<br/><br/>where was this movie supposed to be set? In America? I don't know, it looks to me like it could've been in Nazi occupied America today if Hitler won world War 2. <br/><br/>No one is these characters, and these characters are not good reflections of any group of kids that i know. If i write anymore one will be forced to believe that I am crazy. Watch it, (unless you have to rent it,) but get it from someone who already bought it.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, my opinion is my opinion. I might've had overly high expectations for this movie. (Everybody in the mobocracy of my high school has hailed this as nothing less than the second coming of Jesus. Dear IMDb, you know your system for rating the top 250 is wrong if this movie gets there. Anyone who wants to ask me about my further opinion feel free to message me."

GREAT MOVIE a must see funny and you wont be disappointed. although i must admit it will be hard to watch at some scenes with the main feeling that you get towards this movies can sum that up. the camera work and cast was amazingly talented and they can make you laugh with out having to do much. one of the few best movies that has come out this summer."

I don't know how anyone could rate this so high, I know humans have different tastes in humor but I never imagined that this movie would be anywhere close to funny... I mean which human would think that a normal day-day sentence like "" Where are you off to"" is funny? It's more like having a candid camera aimed at two nerds and watching them go about their daily duties. God help us. It's overrated movies like these that make IMDb's rating system impossible to comprehend. Script sucks, acting is just OK, this is not ""hilarious"" like people claim it is.

"bob the moo","Null","5","11","25 May 2008"," Still an obvious genre comedy but rises above this to a point thanks to some imaginative ""geeky"" touches
","It is not long before friends Seth and Evan will be going their separate ways at different colleges but yet the changes for parties and/or any sexual experiences seem just as remote as ever. However when Seth gets invited over to a party with a girl in his home economics class he makes rash promises in regards buying alcohol for the whole party. To Seth, Evan and friend Fogell the biggest challenge initially appears to be buying alcohol with a rather unconvincing fake ID card but this soon becomes even more difficult than they imagined due to a robbery, a car accident, inept cops and several other obstacles.<br/><br/>Superbad came out shortly after Knocked Up and the hype surrounding that sort of continued to wash over this film. At the time I didn't bother with it because I wasn't sold on the trailers but after thinking that Knocked Up was quite good I decided to check it out. What I found was a film that doesn't want to be a simple genre movie but mostly is just that. The plot betrays this more than anything else since it is a bit of a geek fantasy with plenty of action and parties. So far so genre and indeed those that actively dislike the genre will not be won over by this, however that doesn't mean that it is just a basic genre film.<br/><br/>What makes it a bit better than it could have been is that the comedy does have some nice imaginative touches thanks to the writing of Rogen and Goldberg. This is not to say that it is brilliant but just that it is informed by a modern feel that connects with those in the generation who do talk in pop-culture references and such. This aspect of it does raise it above the rather obvious narrative and I did find myself chuckling along to it regardless. The cast help it a great deal. Cera dominates by bringing his ""Arrested Development"" awkwardness to the role. Hill a bit more obvious as he fills a more traditional genre role but does so with good ""fat kid"" humour. Mintz-Plasse is very much a simple physical gag but he is an enjoyable one and works well with Rogen and Hader despite their thread being one of the dumbest parts of the film.<br/><br/>Overall then a reasonably enjoyable genre comedy that benefits from the writing of current ""men of the moment"" Rogen and Goldberg as well as Cera being in the cast. Not good enough to get those who don't like the genre to enjoy it and not the brilliant comedy it was hailed as but it is still a pretty good entry in a mostly so-so genre."
"jstrode","3","5","11","5 January 2008"," Mystified...
","I heard Superbad was hilariously funny. I didn't laugh once. For a movie with so much 'buzz', I figured it would be more original and less of a rehash of previous teen movies. In the end it was sex, loss-of-virginity, booze, winking at authority and more sex. The plot was trite and in many spots, slow. McLovin character was engaging and sympathetic. The police were not. And, no matter how drunk, no girl that age, would do the loud, annoying fat kid. Seriously. At best, it was a redo fantasy of a sex-starved, self-hating, puberty. At worse, it was just plain, soft, limp and in desperate need of some Viagra. Actually, left me wishing for fart jokes. If Seth Rogen represents the future of Hollywood, I anticipate the onset of brain rot and can only hope for Alzheimer's in order to enjoy any future cinematic presentations. Sadly, another indicator of the decline of education and culture in the west."

","I'm 22 years old. I enjoy a good comedy. Even the perverted ones. Superbad had a good start, but it's set-up to be a ""heartwarming"" comedy is sadly corrupted about 15 minutes into the film. Although the obnoxious swearing left and right got a little old after the first scene, I was more disappointed with the actual plot line.<br/><br/>I understand the script was to sound natural, using the same method as in 40 yr old virgin and knocked up, but this kind of screenplay is becoming overdone. I enjoyed 40 Year Old Virgin, and Knocked Up was okay, despite dragging on for more than two hours in length. Superbad is the worst of this genre.<br/><br/>Who this film might interest: Basically more than half of the USA's young adult male population. It's got all elements of junior high trash talk of boners, vaginas, masturbation, etc... And, yeah, they were convincingly real conversations, but it gets so old. I shouldn't have to pay money to listen to a couple of high schoolers have the same conversations I had in junior high school! What I saw of this movie made me lose my respect for Seth Rogen as a comedian. I think I can compare him most with Seth MacFarlane, the creator of Family Guy. They both are using cheap humor in order to make a living. They couldn't come up with a great plot if their lives depended on it and instead rely solely on crappy gag-reel script writing. The majority of Americans who enjoy this chinsy comedy and actually find it funny have no intellect whatsoever. IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY!"

","Another year, another gross-out teen comedy about horny high-school losers attempting to vanquish their virginity. Two co-eds who are attempting to woo a group of girls by supplying their party with booze end up having the most elaborately awry night of their life. Going into the screening one could be forgiven for fearing the worst with the sheer number of schlock that had been farmed out of Hollywood since American Pie made the teen comedy cool again. Fear not, Superbad is a riot, and so for two key reasons. One - it is produced by Judd Apatow, comedy auteur of such hits as Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin. Two - its two stars, Jonah Hill and Michael Cena are fantastic finds. Hill takes an obnoxious, porn-obsessed oaf of a kid and laces him with bags of charm and great comic timing. Cera goes one step further, engulfing his character with the kind of nervous stuttering that only a Ricky Gervais sitcom might dare make funny. It may be crude, crass and deeply superficial. But sex is never funnier when high school kids try it."

The dick that had me laughing the hardest was juxtaposed with Tiananmen Square on screen, if you can believe that.<br/><br/>Evan (Micheal Cera) is the voice of reason that keeps the core of the film real, and he has enough chemistry with his blustery buddy Seth (Jonah Hill) to make the resolution satisfying and believable.<br/><br/>The girls all have personalities, which is a plus for a film like this.<br/><br/>The weakest parts of the film are those that include the writer, Seth Rogan, who along with Bill Hader play cops who are less competent and more broadly ridiculous than their Keystone Kop ancestors. But Fogell, a.k.a. McLovin, (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who transitions from timid and panicked in their company, keeps some of these scenes from hurting the film.<br/><br/>All in all, a fun time, if not a top-notch movie."

","Okay, there have been plenty of good comedies since Billy Madison, but this is tops. If you enjoyed Jonah Hill in Accepted, his performance in Superbad blows it out of the water. After seeing the overplayed previews of this movie on TV, the computer, and everywhere else I looked, I began to think, ""Here comes another movie where every funny part is spoiled by seeing them beforehand (i.e. Blades of Glory)"" But boy was i wrong. Each scene in the movie seems to be funnier than the last, which is saying a lot considering I was laughing out loud after the opening scene. The addition of quick-witted, slightly moronic police officers Slater and Michaels (Bill Hader and Seth Rogan) only adds to the laugh-a-minute comedy in this film. The way Hill and Cera are able to feed off each other in such a humorous way is genius. After reading the other comments made for this film, I couldn't help but to make the obvious comparison to the American Pie films. Superbad is on a whole other level."
"matthewduffyproductions","1","9","24","6 December 2007"," ""Superbad"" is just plain bad.
","The title says it all, ""superbad"". I rented this movie thinking it would be the greatest comedy of the year like everyone said. Boy was everyone wrong! I'll admit there were a few funny parts (few and far between) but overall this movie brings nothing new to the table (as in laughs or storyline). It would best be described as ""american pie"" meets ""super troopers"" (I consider that bad, but I'm sure there are those out there that love those movies). There is way too many homosexual jokes and undertones with the lead characters (and pretty much every male on screen). Now don't get me wrong, I think gay jokes can be hilarious but not every 5 minutes like in this movie. Is the only thing funny the writers could come up with was cheap obvious jokes? The language is just too much as well. Again I like swearing but that fat kid tries way too hard to sound like Vince Vaughn. Its not funny and is really sad. Maybe if you are a 16 year old virgin you would love this film. And In case you might think I'm too old to get this film, I'm only 26. I just don't get why people raved about this movie yet a much smarter and funnier comedy like ""the ex"" goes completely under the radar (not that I like Zach Braff's other work but ""the ex"" is quite funny with a great cast). Superbad's trailer pretty much shows you the funny parts and its all downhill from there. The only reason to see this movie is to tell everyone you know, that raved about it, that this movie is just plain bad."

","""Superbad"" is a teen-comedy overloaded with all the raunchiness and naughty humor you'd expect in the chronological vicinity than ""American Pie"" and those youth movies that pululated in the early 2000s (overlapping with straight horror through ""Final Destination"" or comedic with ""Scary Movie""). And yet it managed to rise itself above the usual farces that have no pretension to go beyond their demographic target and provide something as funny as a parody, but smarter. In fact, it is parodic in the way it subverts many tropes of ""wild nights"" films à la Richard Linklater's ""Dazed and Confused"" but without betraying a spirit that makes fun of kids while respecting and forgiving them.<br/><br/>Take a scene like the ""McLovin"" fake ID, which can easily be regarded as one of the top 20 most emblematic 2000s movie moments: that scene's not funny alone because it turns a common teen-situation into something of a sitcom level (though the Hawaiian organ donor with a unique name à la 'Seal' is really something) but it's funny because it's played straight by the three characters. Fogell aka McLovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) sticks to his guns and even rationalizes the second name option. Seth (Jonah Hill) is shocked by Fogell's obliviousness and expresses it with loud angry tirades full of F-bombs. Evan (Michael Cera) is the voice of reason but even his words fail to flap Fogell's confidence of his genius.<br/><br/>Any lesser comedy would have made the 'McLovin' thing a revelation, but Greg Mottola's film makes the situation work on three levels: it's the set-up, the joke and the punchline that provokes the intervention of the two cops (Seth Rogen who wrote the film and Bill Hader) and enhances the film's hilarity with two unexpected additions. The incident also sets up the whole chain of events that will make Seth and Evan believe their friend has been arrested so they could go find another way to get the booze. Evan is by the way the name of Rogen's co-writer Goldberg and the story was based on their teen memories. And what they created was a fun comedy where the booze will matter less than the journey during which Seth and Evan will settle a few records and discuss the limits of their co-dependent friendship (and a few other things).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, it's Fogell/McLovin who has the time of his life with the two cops whose intervention will awake their youth memories, and the result is a gag-driven night with a few interesting insights about the social function of partying, especially if we talk of the last night before school is off. To some degree, ""Superbad"" can be regarded as a fine and clever mix between ""last night"" classic ""Dazed and Confused"" and the first ""American Pie"" which was also about boys aiming to lose their virginity before getting to university, which (let's face it) was one of the big issues of a young male in his early adulthood.<br/><br/>The comparison with ""American Pie"" is even more relevant because the film doesn't make fun of girls, though it portrays them as a sort of vehicles to fulfill guy's fantasies. Still, it's obvious from the start that the misconception of girls denounces the boys lack of maturity. But if that's played straight by Seth, the character of Evan provides a fine subversion because he does have a crush on a girl but doesn't rely on alcohol to get her. Seth's crush Jules (Emma Stone) also corrects his conception by mentioning she doesn't need intoxicationd and she might think of sex if the partner isn't inebriated. Let that be a lesson to immature shy boys who needs social fuel and given the recent 'date rapes' scandals, the angle taken by ""Superbad"" proves not only to be insightful and respectful but also salutary for the film's legacy.<br/><br/>Indeed, whether you think you need to be drunk to get the girl or that she should be drunk, ""Superbad"" does come with respectful answers that tie every element of the plot together without putting girls on a symbolic pedestal either, they can have as much immaturity and insecurity as their fellow guys. It also shows a strong friendship being undermined by two existential issues when we say goodbye to the teenage years: girls and studies. The director handles the script with a sharp but tender eye, he seems to go for the over-the-top raunchy comedy at times but""Superbad"" ends up being as sweet and heart-warming as ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"". It is really a high point in teen comedies, that allowed two actors to bloom: two-time Oscar-nominee Jonah Hill and three-time nominee and Oscar-winner Emma Stone. That's how old the film is; and how better it'll get with time, like a good wine or a Goldslick Vodka.<br/><br/>And the cast looks all like teenagers despite being in their early 20s (except for McLovin) and once again, a bad comedy might have cast Seth Rogen in the titular role, the film didn't fall in that trap.<br/><br/>Now, the film refreshed many memories that I have already mentioned them in ""Lady Bird"", I laughed loud at the obvious gags but also for subtle moment like like the market vendor, and subtle moments like the vest or when Seth puts on Evan's father clothes, because I'm guilty of having used adult clothes and even a vest to look more adult. As for the obsession with ""losing it"" or the misconception of alcohol as a romantic tool, I'm glad a film took that up to eleven, showing that there's not much equity between boys and girls on that level. And it's only fair to have a few laughs about that.<br/><br/>And the film is funny, over-the-top and its satisfying coming-of-age ending makes up for the bits of naughtiness. And the ending drawing montage is the icing of the cake, showing the writing talent of Rogen and Goldberg, who raises a monument of vulgarity and bad taste to a high level of fun, like Mel Brooks with ""The Producers""."

The movie depicts their journey there, and the aftermath of the decisions they make.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a decently packaged movie filled with common teenage themes, and a few celebrity cops that entertain the older crowds.

"truemythmedia","9","1","1","11 September 2019"," One of the Best
","Superbad is easily one of my favorite coming of age school films, it's upbeat and hilarious, portraying a fairly accurate display of one's final year in high school before being set off into the real world. The relationships between all the characters are the real center of Superbad, with hilarious one liners and unforgettable moments, like Seth full on head-butting Jules in a drunken stupor, this film is sure to hit everyone's funny bone. It's crazy, over the top and just plain hysterical. While it does suffer with quite a few unrealistic elements, and some definite writing issues, Superbad is a film that will resonate with anyone who graduated High School in a similar fashion, with heart and humor tying everything together."

"SuperNerd17","8","1","1","31 July 2019"," Hilarious High School Adventure
","The first conversation of this movie is all about porn: the quality, personal preferences, and overall opinion. That conversation sets the tone for the rest of the film: crude, honest, funny, and in some ways realistic. Among high school boys, that is a common topic.<br/><br/>The writing is brilliant. The dialogue is enticing. Seth Rogan said a lot of the writing stems from his own high school experience. He has been writing this film since middle school so a lot of the event are true (even the girl who bled on Jonah Hill at the party while grinding on him).<br/><br/>Jonah Hill does a phenomenal job of diving straight into his character and bringing you in to see why he is desperate to get laid before the end of high school. Michael Cera is slightly awkward, rational, and simply a nice guy at the end of the day. The chemistry between both Cera and Hill creates a dynamic that is enjoyable to watch. They never take away from the other, only embellish them further.<br/><br/>A fun, crazy adventure of two average guys who want to hook up with girls. This film falls into the more 'teen comedy' genre, but will more than deliver if you are even a little amused by that sort of humor."
"ZeroWorldwide","10","1","1","20 July 2019"," Awesome

"renofhate","10","1","1","2 July 2019"," As close to a meaningful AND funny comedy as you're gonna get!
","People really enjoy a well-executed comedy movie; one that has a lot of jokes throughout while keeping you compelled all the same. Superbad does just that. The hilarity of it all is, ironically enough, the outcome and most meaningful factor of the movie itself. Although they're two friends who are trying their best to lose their virginity (well, arguably one of them is more in to the idea than the other), the recurring theme here is friendship. It's done so well and the jokes throughout are balanced coherently and are done right. It doesn't overstay its welcome in any scene, the comedy is there, at all times, but it's never tiresome. The camaraderie is wonderful. The cast themselves do a terrific job at keeping you engaged and laughing. And its support cast do a fantastic job as well - looking at you, Bill Hader and Seth Rogen. If you're a fan of comedies and you have yet to watch Superbad, I highly recommend it. Four times I have seen it now, and it still makes me laugh more than most comedies do. What Superbad has established and solidified here is you don't need over-the-top jokes, toilet humour and stuff, et al, to be funny. Balanced out, fresh comedies like this are the real deal, with this one being a prominent figure in that said topic of film. I laugh when watching it but its closure is somewhat heartfelt and it truly captures the essence of friendship. A funny and meaningful movie and definitely one of the best comedy movies of the past decade for sure. 9/10."

","Superbad works great as a comedy about a bunch of misfits in school and the usual clichés of losing virginity, hanging with the cool crowd, shenanigans that get one into trouble with the law and all that. This film consists of Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Bill Hader- a troupe with many comedy movies to their name.

","There are times in ""Superbad"" where Jonah Hill delivers a line so perfectly, so brilliantly, and so hilariously that is hurts. He's a comedic force of nature and is the reason why ""Superbad"" is one of the funniest and most re-watchable films of all time. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's script (loosely based off of their real-life experiences) is a perfect blend of jokes and heart that follows a reality high school friendship between two nerds who end up trying to prove themselves as big shots. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have brilliant comedic chemistry and are a dynamic duo who I wish would collocate again in future comedies. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as the cops who spend the night with the infamous ""McGlovin"" are funner than fun and add to the brilliance of this too-much-fun buddy movie that few comedies can dream rivaling."

","'Superbad (2007)' is crude, coarse and quite immature but it's also undeniably and undoubtedly hilarious, providing plenty of laughs and thus succeeding in it's primary function - which is more than can be said for most so-called 'comedies' nowadays. Sure, it's low-brow and vulgar but no-one ever said that rude humour can't be amusing too and that's exactly what this is from beginning to end: an entertaining romp that races through its relatively thin plot without ever taking itself too seriously or compromising its story for the sake of extended improvisational routines. It actually comes to a close with somewhat of a moral lesson. It's truly funny, and sadly that's an adjective I rarely get to use any more. 8/10"
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","1","4 November 2017"," Decent High School movie.
","There was a surprising amount of heart in this irreverent and sometimes insensitive comedy. It was a little cheesy but kind of nice that Seth and Evan got the girls they were both hot for but didn't have sex with them. In other movies, I might have been annoyed by this, but I liked it here, maybe because it contrasted the tone of the rest of the movie. I could tell pretty early on that Seth would not be able to get with Jules like he wanted to. It just would have felt wrong if his plan had gone through because his motivation just seemed completely selfish and sex-driven. Evan and Becca's situation kept me in more suspense. It surprised me that she liked him and didn't need to be won over like I had suspected. The closing shot with the Seth and Evan watching each other go their separate ways was really a nice way to end it, even though it did feel a bit cute and cheesy.<br/><br/>It would be wrong to say that this movie is realistic, but there were a lot of things that I thought it did right to make it more true to life. Most of the time when shy high-school guy characters are featured in movies, they are shown as almost completely socially incompetent or awkward or shelled in (see the 2002 Spiderman, Freaks and Geeks, Sixteen Candles, or Perks of Being a Wallflower for examples). Seth and Evan seem to be somewhat in touch socially, though not as much as they would like to be, and are kind of mean at times which felt more realistic. This is the only time I've seen Michael Cera not be awkward on screen. Even Fogell, who is closer to the stereotypical nerdy guy, is more socially bold than I had expected. Yes, they are all awkward at multiple points, but Seth and Evan are both sort of friends with Jules and Becca prior to the events of the movie. Another thing that felt true to life was the mellowness of Jules' party. They didn't feel the need to make the party completely raucous and trash the house like in 10 Things I Hate About You, or Sixteen Candles, or 21 Jump Street.<br/><br/>This wasn't one of the funnier comedies I've seen, but that's a matter of taste. I laughed pretty frequently throughout and I can see how it could easily be certain people's favorite movie ever. As you might suspect, there's a lot of off-color jokes that you might not laugh at if your mom was watching it with you. One could argue that it's unnecessarily crude, but the crude jokes are at least pretty clever most of the time and not just thrown in as a cheap way to get laughs. Seth Roger and Bill Hader as the two cops were really fun to watch. I would say it's good if you like 21 Jump Street, but it's not as loud and doesn't have action. It's definitely nothing deep or anything you have to see, but it's not a bad view into the life and struggles of two teenage friends. Overall Rating: 7.5/10."

"lambiepie-2","1","9","26","24 December 2007"," Super-sad
","I adore gross-out teen comedy flicks. The last 30 years have brought film-goers real classics out of films you may have never thought would be -- and a few duds that tried to bounce off of the others alleging to be instant classics. Superbad falls into the latter category.<br/><br/>Superbad will become one of those films to those who looked at it today will look back years from now and say, ""Why did I ever laugh at that?"". The classic teen films were funny then, and are still funny now - that's the difference. Superbad is super-sad, disappointing, dull, lifeless and not very funny or gross. But it is a wanna-be for other wanna-bes.<br/><br/>I find the reasoning behind this film to an interest is to have liked the short lived TV program called ""Freaks and Geeks"". I didn't like it, and applauded when it was taken off the air. But it seems as though Judd Apatow has a way of drudging up elements of the failed show and creating the most horrible let down of films that ever were - hence Superbad.<br/><br/>There isn't one character in this film that didn't annoy the heck out of me. Especially the leads. Very annoying. The girls and the boys. Not because the leads were two testosterone-laden geeky friends were trying to fit in, get laid and get booze for a party they never would have been invited to in the first place - I mean that alone is a teen-angst comedy waiting to happen. But these teens were retreads upon retreads of other raunchy and drop-dead hilarious teen-angst films who have done the same set up 1000 times better, with more 'pop'..and interest than this. There is more to raunchy than just saying the ""dirty-sexual"" words millions of times and 'tee-heeing, nudge-nudge' behind it, or having the a-typical overweight, pseudo-sexual-knowledgeable-punching bag buddy slob over without a context, or the ways the leads tries to buy the liquor (an old set up in itself) - for a bunch of dead-pan female teens you wouldn't care about in the first place - I could go on, but urgh!!! What made the other grossed out teen comedies work is that you COULD identify with one or more characters and those characters were radically different from each other. Here, they were all the same. No difference in any of them whatsoever. That's what made them boring as all get-up. Who cares what these boys did, how they did it -- ? Yawn! <br/><br/>For every teen, there is a film that gets next to them and touches what they're going through. If this is for teens today, I now understand the successes of a 'Brittney', a 'Beyonce', a 'Hillary', a 'Lindsay', a 'Kardasian', a 'Paris' et al, etc. Mindless, copycat, two seconds of interest in a 24 hour day dredge. For the other teens, I'm sure they may (grudgingly) agree that the original 'American Pie' is still the film to beat. Superbad is at the bottom, under the pile of dirty laundry."
"Ralphie01","10","5","12","18 August 2007"," So funny...you'll puke on your comforter.
","On the outside ""superbad"" seems like a typical teen comedy. It has the profanity, guys who want to get laid, and gross out humor. But what other comedies lack, ""Superbad"" has in abundance and that is heart. This movie has characters you care about from the beginning because...well...they just seem so much more real then ones found in other comedies. In fact, the characters in this movie will remind you of either yourself or people that you knew in High School.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is hilarious and will be quoted for years to come in this generation. There is just way too much happening, and never a dull ""no laugh"" moment.<br/><br/>Long live McLovin!"

","Okay. So, I was extremely excited going into this movie for a variety of reasons, a few being Michael Cera, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and the fact that Judd Apatow was involved and Seth Rogen had written this movie. This movie is the funniest movie of the summer and the year. The laughs never stop coming. There were a handful of moments where I couldn't hear a joke because the audience and myself were still laughing from the first joke. This movie is witty, which I love, and it is just an all around good, funny, well written ""teen sex party"" movie. If you are a fan of any of Judd Apatow or Seth Rogen's movies, you will love Superbad. Oh, and I feel I MUST comment on Christopher Mintz-Plasse's performance in this movie. For a first time movie actor, he was spectacular! GO SEE SUPERBAD NOW!!!!"

","First off I am a guy and I found this hilarious. My significant other, however, felt like walking out of this movie after the first 10 minutes. <br/><br/>The plot revolves around getting women too drunk to know what they're doing and then sleeping with them, so many women would probably feel a bit disgusted and objectified. Add to that all the colorful terms used to describe female genitalia and the fact that there aren't really any positive female role models in the movie (they all apparently just want to get drunk and get laid too) create a movie that women may find disgusting. If you're a guy, however, hilarious."

","In one scene Evan, (Michael Cera) finally gets alone with the girl of his dreams. She is drunk and he is a little tipsy also. She does a drunken dance for him and then proceeds to undress both of them. He is finally in the position that he has been waiting for his whole life. But he is not that drunk and he tells her that this is not the way he had pictured it: Both of them drunk and her begging him to do her. She continues to try and get him to do her, and he tells her, that maybe they should slow down. Then she tells him, to stop being a little b--ch about it. He just looks at her and he says, ""Did you just call me a b--ch? Wow, talk about losing your innocence. All at once, he was getting to go all the way, and he also finds out that people are not what you dreamed they would be.

","Honestly, having just graduated from high school, I might find this movie better than others. BUT anyone who ever was in high school will agree that the humor was right on and not all that over the top. There are only two over the top characters who add some funny parts so who cares. The whole movie leaves you laughing and saying ""I did something similar to that"" or ""Doesn't that remind you of *Random name here*"" Overall the humor was crude but is high school anything but crude? Best comedy I have seen in awhile. If you haven't seen it, you need to rectify that immediately. Parents, I wouldn't let your kids see this till they are in high school. Makes the humor so much better anyways. 10 out of 10"
"the_Poppuns","9","5","12","17 August 2007"," I laughed hard and often
","There are many different kinds of comedies out there. Some that make you smile, some that make you chuckle occasionally, and then the actual funny ones that make you laugh out loud. Superbad is one of those. I went to see this movie because of Michael Cera who I thought was the funniest person on the funniest television series in history, ""Arrested Development"". And he's hilarious in this as well, but so are all three of the lead characters. I'd nominate them for something if I could. <br/><br/>I grew up in the 80s when movies about kids trying to ""lose it"" before graduation seemed like it's own genre. So I was interested to see an update since I figured the newer generation were already grandparents at 25. Well it's good to see that nerds are still nerds and the entire populace hasn't gone crazy. It was interesting also because the people in it who are my age, like Rogen and Hader, are clearly the old people trying to recapture their youth, when I think most of us haven't completely grown up yet. It was sort of painful to see how the movie-isms we find funny are just old to the new kids. But this movie is definitely fun for people in their 30s we just have to realize that we're not them anymore and I think it helps. And it's smart. The jokes are really sharp and you have to listen because they almost roll into each other.<br/><br/>There is a lot of cursing in this movie and I only say that because I know someone who doesn't like that sort of thing. If I didn't know someone like that I probably wouldn't notice. But since I do if you're one of those people that might bother you. And although the goal of the main characters is sex, it isn't a sex comedy in the traditional sense. It's mostly a quest for booze. And there is one thing that's kinda gross but I don't know how to describe it without spoiling it. But if any of that bothers you enough to deter from seeing this, I can't imagine you'd be interested in this anyway. Otherwise I think it'd be fun for anyone from 13-45 with a sense of humor."

(Someday women writers/ producers will make a movie about plain teen girls getting laid by the cute boys at school. Who call them the next day and ask them to go steady.

","I just watched Superbad, after listening to everyone and his dog telling me how hilarious it is... well as far as I can see, everyone must be retarded. If this is what is considered as funny these days then no wonder Hollywood has reverted to making films for only the most very stupid people out there. this film is about as smart and witty as someone shaking a baby's rattle in my face. Okay Mclovin is amusing, but the rest of it is irritating beyond belief and really quite mean spirited. the lead characters made my teeth itch they were so awful. One was loud and obnoxious and pretty vile, the other was a charisma vacuum and dull to the point of being in a coma. really how can you people watch this rubbish and like it?"

","In my honest opinion, this film was ""groundbreaking"" to most people because it was 1)either their first R-rated flick or 2)they snuck into the theater & felt seriously cool to be there.<br/><br/>The whole movie is about sex, it's almost immature. The f-word is used every 5 seconds & unlike The Hangover, it's used unnecessarily. The ending was the best part of the movie but aside from its ""heartwarming-ness"", it seemed totally random and detached from the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Basically, I didn't understand it. Did it contain several funny/hilarious scenes? YES, it did, but the plot was weak and Michael Cera played his usual role.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This movie is over-hyped!"
"Ramalama_FFF","8","4","9","7 August 2008"," Funny, unless you're really prejudiced about it
","The majority of the people who criticize this movie so heavily are blocked by their prejudice and unintelligent enough to never ever question that maybe the point of this movie wasn't to deliver a great 'plot', that nobody went to see this movie for it to deliver some amazing 'dialogue' etc. I see people whining about how ""me and my wife"" just wanted to get out of the theatre. Well, did it ever occur to you that maybe this isn't exactly something you'd wanna watch with your wife or husband? That maybe you're just not the target audience? That maybe you don't GET what's so funny about some of these scenes? These inabilities are proved by all the false statements about the content of this film. For example did Seth and Evan really have a mission to have sex before they graduated? NO, THEY DIDN'T, and this is obvious to anyone who watched the movie without a prejudiced, high-mighty attitude.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, Superbad is just a pretty mindless comedy. Actually it sort of does have a plot, which is the friendship of Seth and Evan that is about to be broken as they will enter college, but that part only brings down the movie in my opinion; it's boring. It probably is a bit of a 'guy movie', and my guess is that if you're 30+ or more, you're less likely to enjoy it."
"RainDogJr","10","4","9","30 July 2008"," ""McLovin in the f*cking house!""
","According to the release dates listed on this site, 'Superbad', aka 'Supercool' in my country, was released in October 2007 in my country then in that October I didn't know what to really expect from a new release of the Apatow Company since then I haven't already watched 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', 'Anchorman', etc. But also I always felt desires to check specially this one yet I never went to see it on the big screen and once my cousin said to me that it was not that cool as everyone was saying together with the fact that later I saw 'Juno' (also with Cera) and later 'Drillbit Taylor' (also from Apatow Company) were enough things to lose most of those desires to watch 'Superbad'. Now I think about a month ago I finally saw 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' and that's a great and hilarious comedy so it was kind of ""I understand that the stoner of this film is the writer of 'Superbad' and that sometime ago I had desires to watch it so what the hell"". Right now I'm not disappointed because I laughed, and a lot in some parts, but here in IMDb we can read many commentaries praising the film in an excessive way so I'm afraid that it is not that cool, let's say that it is just cool. <br/><br/>As, for mention one, 'Dazed and Confused' this film is about only one day, focusing more on the night of that day that seems to be the last chance for 3 boys to lose their virginity before college. So is just about how the writers can make the most possible situations in order to make a longer, tired and surreal day for the 3 boys. In that the really funny character McLovin (Chris Mintz-Plasse) and the two cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen) are the funniest thing of the film and practically at a point those three are the ""soul"" of the film. In the other hand or better in other part of the town we have the ""adventure"" of the two main characters. One of the two is an extremely annoying guy who is talking s*** all the time and who used to draw pictures of man d**ks at the age of 8! The other main character has his first appearance in a film to later meet a girl named Juno in his second. This two have some hilarious dialogs in their daily conversations (the Coen brothers don't direct porn!!!) but as soon as they left McLovin everything turns to be less funny so at a point is like ""forget those guys and let's have some fun by watching McLovin and his new and hilarious pals"". After they meet again with badass McLovin everything is like the conventional teenagers picture, having problems with the alcohol and with the girls after a fight between the two to finally end the night both really drunk and confessing their love to, by he morning, be friends again. Maybe was the only possible way to end this film since and as Seth Rogen claims on the DVD documentary, ""our filthy brand of humour has become mainstream"" or something like that. <br/><br/>Conclusion: I do recommend this film if you are looking for a funny entertainment. It is not the near masterpiece of comedy that some persons are claiming on this site but those who are claiming that it is a film only for stupid persons well simply go f*ck yourselves. Anyway check this picture because and after all McLovin in the f*cking house!"
"knight_armour","8","4","9","27 July 2008"," Truthful Comedy
","I didn't know what to expect from this film but was pleasantly surprised. Seth, a high school senior two weeks from graduation has never actually been laid and desperately wants to to prepare himself (sexually) for college. Despite being an overweight, swearing, porn-loving yet somewhat sensitive mess of a teenager, he eyes baby-faced Jules as his destined conquest. However, he knows a hot girl like that will probably have nothing to do with him beyond casual conversation so he hopes to get her drunk and be the 'mistake' she regrets later. A mistake that he hopes will lead her to being his girlfriend for at least another two months before they part ways for college. Through all this, Seth has to deal with separating with his best friend, Evan who's going to a different college. An adventure ensues for Seth, Evan and their underrated third wheel of a friend, Fogell as they struggle to get enough alcohol to Jules' party, their ticket to getting laid. Two young and nutty cops add some remarkable fun to the whole plot. The dialog is well-scripted and honest. I found myself being able to relate to a lot of it (being kind of like Seth myself)."

This movie did not surprise me. It was as bad as i knew it would be except for i think 1 scene that put a actually unforced smile on my face, which was when Seth, the main character, wanted to steal alcohol and played back some amusing possible scenarios in his head; otherwise, this movie was an absolute disaster. The title really does sum it up for you. Every 2 words is followed by F--k or other incoherent expletives that serve no purpose in the movie. Whenever I watch a movie i usually look for some meaning or point, but i do settle for a pointless comedy once in a while. However, this isn't a pointless comedy, it's a terrific example of the plunge American ""culture"" has taken. The only reason i'm not astoundingly angered by watching this movie, is because i downloaded it and watched it by my own free will on my own time. So, watching this movie in theater's, if it's still out, is out of the question. This movie is not worth a penny, i only watched it to see if i would be proved wrong, sadly i wasn't. I regret getting this movie for free and advise everyone to avoid this movie, the same way you should avoid ""40 year old virgin""."

I kept waiting and waiting...but none came.

This flick is essentially Sixteen Candles minus the subtlety, characters plus a few thousand curse words. Apatow's crap is a continuation of the dumbing down of American humor which began with Adam Sandler and the Farrelly bros. and it must be stopped.

","This film is indeed super bad. In fact it is even super concerning. I'm no stranger to drinking under age or ""partying"". I recall many high school antics with amusement. What I cant get around is the horrific banality with which the obnoxious Jonah Hill character uses sexual dialog. Just disgusting. I mean really what the hell are quotes like: --""By the time college rolls around I'll be like the iron chef of pounding VAG!""<br/><br/>--Jules:"" You scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours."" Seth: ""Well, funny thing about my back, is it's located on my cock.""<br/><br/>--Seth: ""stop being such a vagine!""<br/><br/>I have a few issues with this: 1) I'm not offended my bad language if there is underlying cleverness of any kind. 2)Why would any woman/girl tolerate such language? 3)Why are men/boys made out to be women degrading, mindless perverts on a regular basis in current films? 4)Why are women portrayed as accepting of such ""men""?<br/><br/>If in fact such behavior is an accurate portrayal of high school aged male female relations I am truly amazed. <br/><br/>Reality check, neither of these characters would end up with girls of the attractiveness depicted by the film. I think this film is part of a new tradition of Hollywood crap that depicts slovenly men who are somehow accepted by model looks females. Is this catering to male fantasy or just crap that sells to young boys covered in acne?<br/><br/>I would really like to see some female reviews of this pathetic film.<br/><br/>Oh plot???

","Drop an f-bomb a billion times, have Michael Cera deliver everything with his lack of emotion, Jonah Hill is a severely maladjusted, possibly Tourette's suffering character who had a ""hilarious"" compulsion to draw penises when he was young, two cops who have never made cops look more unprofessional, and a kid who thinks that getting a fake ID with the name ""McLovin"" is plausible. This is a really, really, really stupid, annoying film. And don't tell me this is the new ""American Pie"" or ""Porky's"". American Pie had its melancholic counterpoints, its awkwardness (Jason Biggs being caught wacking off with a sock on his dong) which allowed us to sympathize with its characters growing pains. Chris Klein's jock was a little bit soulful. They didn't need to use stupid forms of profanities every other word. These guys, yes, there is intelligence behind the script, and Seth Rogen captures the painfulness of being an awkward, insecure, a-bit-too-intelligent-to-be-really-popular kid, but does he need to use SO much profanity? I would say no.<br/><br/>American Pie was funny because the soulfulness was counteracted with the moments of cringeworthy embarrassment. I didn't have any interest in these characters. Their backstories either didn't exist and they weren't particularly likable characters. Honestly, Seth Rogen needs to learn that you don't need to use an ""f word"" every other word to make people laugh. I have no problem with it, but if coarseness and profanity is your only method of trying to make me laugh, I'll pass. This movie annoyed me within about 5 minutes and never really let up. In addition....just one more thing.....really....cops who bumble, play with guns, don't know how to collect basic information, and make utter folly of their commitment to protect and serve? Again...I have no problem with making fun of cops....but this was ridiculous. It went overboard and it was so obviously overboard that I didn't find it funny.

A big end of year party offers them a chance at social acceptance, if their possibly more socially inept friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) can acquire the booze they need with his new fake ID. Our second or ""B"" story involves a pair of police officers who seem to have their own issues with maturity.<br/><br/>The film definitely delivers some incredible laugh out loud lines and great scenes but that alone doesn't guarantee a great movie.<br/><br/>While the writing is obviously very important in comedy also essential are the actors that deliver those lines and performances. We start here with a trio of exceptional young actors. The very talented Michael Cera and Jonah Hill may be known to some from their previous efforts, but scene stealing Christopher Mintz-Plasse makes his professional debut here. The performances from the police officers (Bill Hader and Seth Rogan) while at times hilarious seemed a little over the top, which kind of reflects their story as well.<br/><br/>The film was written by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg (notice the first names), directed by Greg Mottola (The Daytrippers) and produced by the now very hot Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up).<br/><br/>Overall the film lacks something in its cohesion, rather than telling a story (or several stories) it seemed at times more like a framework in which to place the jokes and the hilarious set pieces. Also somewhat off putting was the fact that the two different stories seem to reflect very disparate levels of reality. While this approach may have supplied a lot of laughs it might have been improved from a storytelling point of view by sticking with just one story and developing the characters more fully."

I was cautious because I had heard about it for years and years before it came out, which is never a good sign. Upon seeing the movie these are things I realized: -Honestly, I found some parts were funny. This isn't a total this movie is feces kind of comment. The cops were the funniest, and there were some moments here and there -Michael Cera was just about perfect. He's a very talented performer.<br/><br/>-Here's the downer part. I had to wait for so long for this film to be funny. The first ten minutes was them talking about porn and stuff and them drinking, it just wasn't entertaining at all to me, but maybe I was viewing it with too high of a reading level. And I shouldn't say just the first ten minutes, because 98% of the movie is stuff that would be funny to high people because they say anatomical parts, but no normal person would find funny because it's irrelevant or not even a joke.<br/><br/>-This movie relied so much on the words vagina and booze that it instantly made it the favorite movie of most of my high school. For those of you reading this, that's a note that you will probably like it. As for me, I usually find vagina jokes funny but there were no vagina jokes.

","I think The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up are among the best comedies of recent years. So, obviously when I heard the guys who made those movies made Superbad, my expectations were very high. Well, Superbad started off promising with quite a few funny parts, but as the movie went on I laughed less and less. After awhile the laughs were so few that I was just hoping the movie would hurry up and end. So what went so wrong? I believe the key is Judd Apatow, who was involved in the writing and directing of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. In Superbad, he was only the producer. Next time I see a movie ""from the guys who brought you Knocked Up"" I'm going to make sure Judd Apatow was involved in the writing and/or directing."

","This movie was incredible. I laughed my ass off so often, I actually felt pain in my stomach...I laughed so hard that people in the theater were laughing at me...for a comedy, that's enough to go check it out. But no, Superbad has a great story, and it ends on such a sweet, aw shucks note that you'll instantly fall in love with it. It's very crude and perverse...but the brilliance and the awkwardness captured is fantastic. I can't stop gushing, but Superbad makes everything else this year meek in comparison. I've been waiting a long time, and I can say, it lived up to the hype. The performances were great, the script was great, it pushed on boundaries and made me laugh...what's not to love. A true classic."

","With the charm of Linklater's dazed and confused and the wit of any Rogan/Apatow movie in recent history, this day long triumph of a film is rolling in jokes and steeped in awkward but hilarious acting. The film delivers so many knockout punches that you come out of the theater your head swarming with moments that you know you almost died laughing at but can't even remember the punchline. The R rating is rightfully deserved, but the gratuitous f bombing by Jonah Hill comes off as natural and easy. Michael Cera's quirky shyness comes off as authentic and empathetic while McLovin's weird self confidence is oddly disarming and as said by the cast itself, 'Can only be explained by him having a large (Explitve Deleted). The two cop characters are like every police academy movie rolled into one times ten and with thirteen road beers to go. In summation, this is the best comedy of the year and the best in recent history, no joke."

","Honestly, I don't know what I was expecting when I went to an advance screening of this in Edmonton Alberta Canada at South Edmonton Common cinemas last night. I had heard NO ""buzz"" about this movie at all, even from my teenage son, who considers it his mission in life to try and know more than me when it comes to movies, music and games...<br/><br/>The movie, honestly, was the single worst movie of modern times and recent memory that I have ever seen or been subjected to. It is one of the first screenings that I have physically had to restrain myself from walking out on within the first 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Some of the extended school hallway ""dialogue"" scenes in this movie will leave you wanting to take your drink straw to your ear drums and fill your eye sockets with popcorn. They seem to go on for a week and a half, then you wake up, and realize it's still going on.<br/><br/>I hear that the writers of this movie started to write it when they were 14 years-old. My take on this is that they had older brothers who were 14 years-old, and started writing it when they were about 11, imagining all the ""cool"" things their older brothers were dreaming that 17 year-olds did ""at parties""... And considering it is rated 18A in Canada, I don't think many under the age of 18 are going to be seeing this movie. Which just may save a generation of youth.<br/><br/>In short I told my son that if he listens to anyone over the age of 13 who advises him to go see this movie, or heave forbid, that it's a good movie, he will never trust an adult again in his life.<br/><br/>The physical pat down and wanding with a metal detector I had to endure to get in to make sure I didn't pirate this 'leet movie on my cell phone in 10 second chunks, was one of the most insane pre-screening experiences of my life, and being one who goes to quite a few advance screenings, this was truly over the top, even for Sony. And after the confiscation of all cell phones, even ones without a camera, the security guard hired to watch us all throughout the movie with his night vision gear, then proceeded to talk on his cell phone in the theater about four times throughout the screening... nice..."

I could have been turned off by something after the beginning and didn't watch properly for the rest and thus didn't like it. I didn't get how Seth could be so funny in the beginning and then be a virtual non entity for the rest. Just one off topic point: Evan was a huge waste. Maybe he made 1 or 2 funny jokes but he was pretty boring for the amount of time he took up. They should have used better lines for him or had a different actor."

","Considering all the money SUPERBAD made, I really worry about the future of the human race! I must admit up front that I simply couldn't finish watching the movie because it was so offensive and stupid. To make things worse, it wasn't even funny and yet it was billed as a comedy. Listening to unlikable teens talk about sex CONSTANTLY is pretty dull and after half the film was over, I was done--sick of the film and amazed at how stupid people are who actually liked this drivel. Now understand that I am not a super-prudish person, but the movie wasn't even funny--just obnoxious, crude and unlikable. If you really must hear a lot of obscenities, I suggest you try watching IDIOCRACY--at least it's funny and there is a purpose behind all the gutter language.<br/><br/>If your teens watch and enjoy this film, I suggest you either hire an exorcist or have them sterilized--people who like this film should NOT be allowed to breed!

","When you take into account the amount of bad comedies that have been released lately, and near enough the same sort of style, IE: ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"", when Superbad was advertised, I didn't really think to give it a chance. Another brick in the wall...boy how wrong was I! I got a private screening, and decided to give it a chance. Besides, from what I had heard, it was basically a teen-movie that had been recognised to be better than American Pie. I did enjoy American Pie, its more of a cult thing though with teenagers, and it was released around my age-gap.<br/><br/>""Superbad"" is far more crass and ""in-your-face"" than any other teen-movie. In fact, it simply grabs them by the face, and wipes its vileness all over them. Its absolutely genius.<br/><br/>The film is basically about 3 teenagers; Seth (Hill), a crude large lad who talks more pussy, Evan (Cera), a quiet yet philosophical and intelligent lad who gets his point across and Fogell (Mintz-Plasse), the nerdy, yet really open geek, who dons a fake ID with a name ""McLovin"" and thinks he's the mutts nuts when things go his way. This trio are quite the unpopular kids at their high-school. They share all the trauma's, laughs and gags together, which involve talking about sex, girls, watching porn, getting drunk and partying hard (in their own way). It's their last day as high-schoolers, and these guys want to go out with a bang. The story looks at each character individually throughout the film, as they get invited to one of the hottest parties in town. Their mission: is to supply the booze.<br/><br/>The casting is simple. Two main characters, with a good supporting cast, and the best supporting geek since sliced bread. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, take a bow. He portrays the ""high-school"" geek to absolute perfection. The guy that everybody love to hate - yet, you'll love the blighter so very much! His presence in the movie makes this film what it is. The way he talks, looks and actions he does throughout the film are golden. Jonah Hill takes the lead and gives a broad and crude performance, whilst Cera also dons a great performance taking and talking the more mature approach of the three. The relationship between these guys is magic. At times they hate each other, but you all know their still best friends. Its polite insults for them. The amount of swearing is probably a bit OTT, but hey, it is teenagers - name me teens that don't swear these days. Behind closed doors, this is what happens! I can honestly say with my hand held up, that this movie will probably be the funniest and biggest comedy this year, and the best teen movie since the original American Pie. Give it a chance.<br/><br/>It's all about McLovin!"

","There was a certain underlying sweetness to films like There's Something About Mary and The 40 Year Old Virgin, in spite of the fact that both movies (far more so the Aptow film) has some very crass elements to them. While not ideal, some of these elements can be viewed as necessary to the story line or the ultimate resolution of either of those films.<br/><br/>However, Superbad is just simply and plainly a terrible film - with very little genuine humor to redeem it. The crass elements of Superbad and far from necessary as their is no genuine story line other than to parrot teen comedies of the last decade: one or more boys try to get some booze, try to get some babes, and try to get ""some."" While those issues may have been ""ultimately resolved"" in Superbad, there is no genuine resolution there. The characters have not learned anything, they are no better nor worse off than before and the audience certainly hasn't learned anything -- except perhaps that the target audience of teen males who most want to see movies in the first two weekends when the studios can make their most money from the receipts -- still rule what films will and will not get made.<br/><br/>A silent Charlie Chaplin film still has the power to make us laugh some fifty years after it was made. In fifty years, people will likely wonder how something as crass and distasteful as this was considered one of the ""better"" comedies of the year."

"prestonm1993","1","3","7","13 July 2013"," ""Superbad"" is a Fitting Title
","Watching this when it came out on DVD, it was okay. But then I grew up. For some reason, even when I thought it was okay, I could not stand the cast. Michael Cera is an effeminate, monotone wreck. Christopher Mintz- Plasse is an obnoxious kid who became worthy of internet and reality television fame with his uselessness as a character in terms of plot. It's supposed to be about the one-sided homosexual relationship on Seth's (Jonah Hill's) part in his romantic-friendship with Evan (Cera). All the while this McLovin' (Mintz-Plasse) kid is handing out with these cops (Bill Hader and Co-Writer Seth Rogen) who are clearly going through a midlife crisis. My apologies to Emma Stone, a beautiful young actress, for having to work with these horrible excuses for actors. Bill Hader tried to carry the weight of his performance with the other half of the comic duo, but Seth Rogan's weight is too much (I am not just talking about his physical weight). ""Actor"" Seth Rogan is proof that talent is not a necessity to be an actor or writer in Hollywood. After watching the 9-Month long ""Knocked Up"", one can only hope that the mockery of comic film will end. Jonah Hill is a shorter, fatter version of Seth Rogen, who at least does have slightly better acting ability than the former. Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth Rogan, and Jonah Hill all have a place saved for them in Comedy and Actor's Hell<br/><br/>In closing, the title is quite appropriate with the quality of this abomination of cinema and the beginning of the end for comedy."

","Maybe I'm just too old to appreciate it, but finally seeing Superbad for the first time I just can't figure out what the big deal is. It's not that it's bad - it's just extremely generic. It's a teen sex comedy with crude, familiar jokes and gags, lots of slapstick, decent chase scenes and a couple of gross-out moments. It's completely beyond me how a movie like Superbad is considered by so many 'the best comedy ever made' - even if you ignore the existence of more intelligent comedies of the past like The Big Lebowski, Airplane, and the entire catalogs of the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks and Woody Allen (the list could go on and on), even in its own limited genre there is very little to tell Superbad apart from the rest. It doesn't help that the two leads - played by Jonah Hill and Michael Cera - aren't interesting or likable (though they're both fine comedians who do their best) and the romantic interests are completely flat. Actually, the only laughs in the movie come from Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth Rogen and Bill Hader who are supposed to serve as some sort of side story - but if the side story is more interesting than the main plot, something is wrong. Superbad has no subtlety, no subtext, no real originality and is probably best watched while drunk or high."

","The reviews of this film are really not very helpful as they are completely polarised between 9/10 star ratings and 1/2 stars so I thought I'd have a go at being less biased. <br/><br/>This film is no enigma. The humour is very immature (sexual, crude and and full of F bombs), the story is very simple and the characters too are by no means spectacular. The acting is good and Jonah Hill and Michael Cera definitely pull off the ""sexually frustrated teenager"" very well, though I suspect that these characters are not far from their actual personalities. The type of comedy in this film is probably what I would refer to as ""bland American"" (we don't have films like this made in the UK), meaning no subtlety and usually bad/over use of curse words or other rude or sex related words. Basically the kind of things you expect to hear from a 15 year old. The characters in this film also remind me of all the things I hate about teenagers (I should probably mention now that I am one); the obsession with alcohol, the obsession with sex, needless swearing and the constant abuse of each other amongst other things. This is the worst film for the average parent and those who always have to critically analyse all films.<br/><br/>though this may all sound negative, but this is actually one of my all time favourite films and I know a lot of other people who love it. It is a film which is not really to be taken seriously. Think Back to the Future; simple, predictable, fun and pleasing but instead for generally a more teenage audience. To summarise: I love it, my parents... not so much.<br/><br/>It's not to make you think, it's to make you not think and just have a good laugh and enjoy a easy going film.<br/><br/>My conclusion is that to enjoy this film you have to switch off your ""quality humour"" filter and laugh at the things you think you shouldn't find funny and you'll probably find that there IS a part of you that does think it's funny or at least appreciates the humour. Don't just dismiss it until you've tried this."

I think what helps a lot here is that the teenagers really look (and act?) like teenagers and not like twenty-somethings. I do think the teens (well mostly Seth) put way too much emphasis on sex but for him I think it was mostly a front as the teens do have some depth and ethics. The two cops are hilarious as some of the worst (or coolest?) cops in movie history. I also thought the guy in glasses playing McLovin was very good and believable.

I heard that it would be the funniest thing I've ever seen. It was incredibly funny, and I loved some of the dialogue. The two funniest characters in this movie are easily the cops, played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. But the story around the two main characters is very funny as well. However, this is not the funniest movie I've ever seen and it's not even the funniest of 2007 (that would be Knocked Up). It probably is the second funniest, which is still quite a statement. The one reason that Superbad failed to exceed ""Kocked Up"" is maturity. Whenever you hear a funny joke, the fact that it's actually mature can make it even funnier. Knocked Up got immature at times, but was also a very coming-of-age type of romance movie. It feels weird saying that, but it is true. But anyway, Superbad, definitely go see it. It's hilarious, and a great experience, but don't expect TOO much, or else you might be disappointed."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","3","7","16 July 2008"," Authentic and hilarious
","I don't think anyone is going to claim that ""Superbad"" is a film of extraordinary thematic depth or anything (although the script has more depth than most high school-based comedies, certainly), . What I will go ahead and say is that ""Superbad"" DOES have a great comedy script. It is not only funny quite frequently, it is also astonishingly accurate regarding high school life. Sure, the scenes with McLovin' and the cops are slightly indulgent and lack believability, but the rest of it is thoroughly believable, realistic, and authentic. It's also perfectly directed, with great use of music and terrific comic timing with the editing and direction, as well as excellent performances from the entire cast. <br/><br/>It is the sense of authenticity that makes ""Superbad"" different than and superior to most teen comedies. Evan and Becca's relationship is far more authentic than it would be in a more clichéd teen comedy script and is encapsulated perfectly in their first conversation in the film, where Evan is a bumbling idiot and Becca has a natural reaction of bewildered amusement to him as opposed to what you would have usually gotten in this sort of movie: she stares at him awkwardly and blows him off. Moreover, the actual conversations aren't based on what the writer THINKS teens sound like, it IS what teens sound like.<br/><br/>Admittedly there are several jokes that fall flat but for the most part this is a hilarious and honest script. Sometimes too honest, I don't recall anyone in the theater laughing much at the scene where Becca and Evan almost have sex, not because it isn't funny on a basic level but because it is such a brutally honest filming of the sort of event casual sex is at this age. You rarely see scenes like that in Hollywood movies, where everything is idealized. One doesn't need to look beyond the ""American Pie"" movies to see how that scene would have played out in most teen movies.<br/><br/>""Superbad"" is an excellent movie. It will be remembered and it will be popular a long time from now, I expect as popular as something like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is now, if not more popular. With all the limitations of making an out and out comedy about teen life (which is often too melancholy to examine properly without veering off too much into drama), ""Superbad"" manages a surprising juggling act and if as I suspect the fact that the names of the writers match the names of the lead characters is no coincidence, that is perhaps not so surprising.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

As is the norm with these movies, nothing goes according to plan and some difficult lessons are learnt in the process. Refreshingly, it's all handled so well. The two leads, Jonah Hill and Michael Cera, are both destined for great comedic futures. They have impeccable timing and the gift for slapstick comedy. Cera might be duplicating his George-Michael character from Arrested Development, but so what? He plays it brilliantly. But the actor who really has you splitting your sides is young Christopher Mintz-Plasse, playing a dorky loser. Chances are you knew someone like this at school, and he plays it so that you realise that a kid like this could have been one of your best friends. He makes you laugh, but out in the real world he still needs all the help he can get.<br/><br/>All-in-all, a fantastic teen comedy. A step up from American Pie, even though you might feel you've seen it all before. So watch it, and relive those awkward high school moments you can now laugh about."

Emily Stone (i think that's her name) is a stand-out.

"Donatien3","9","3","7","26 September 2007"," Superbad - super good
","Following in the footsteps of ""The 40-Year-Old-Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"", ""Superbad"" is the third comedy to star Seth Rogen  who has a minor role as a cop - in the past couple of years. ""Superbad"", which stars Jonah Hill and Michael Cera  who most people will recognise as George-Michael from the excellent ""Arrested Development""  is a coming-of-age film. While ""Virgin"" dealt with a middle-aged man coming to grips with his sexuality, and ""Knocked Up"" about the consequences of a one night stand, ""Superbad"" is about two best friends in the final throes of high school. Seth (Hill, in the role originally intended for Rogen when the film was written by Rogen and Evan Goldberg) is a foul-mouthed, overweight teen obsessed with sex (and drawing dicks, as shown in a hilarious montage) while Evan (Cera) is a quietly-spoken, studios young man, who is set to go to Dartmouth College, while Seth isn't. With two weeks to go until school finishes, Seth and Evan are getting ready to go to one final party, with the help of their dweebish friend Fogell who gets a fake ID with the name McLovin, and later befriends two lazy cops (Rogen and SNL's Bill Hayley)  with the aim to score with the girls they have a crush on by getting them drunk, though Evan, who is in love with Rebecca, is less concerned about this. Seth, however, is worried about leaving school a virgin. The plot, however, is just an excuse for a lot of coarse language and gross-out humour. Yet, the crux of the story is the relationship between Seth and Evan. Unlike some movies of this genre, which fill the third act with overbearing sentimentality, Seth and Evan's friendship is treated realistically hence Seth's incredibly foul mouth. While they're two peas in a pod in terms of intelligence, they've been friends all their life, and this comes through in the film. It's this realism which gives the film substance under all the gross-out humour, and puts it miles about movies like ""American Pie"" in terms of quality. The film is more about friendship then getting laid, which is refreshing. The only major beef I have with this movie is at two hours  it drags on a bit  but the satisfying, realistic finale makes it worth the wait."
"thebengalimafia-1","8","3","7","9 September 2007"," A great movie, but totally unexpected!
","It's always nice to walk into a movie and be pleasantly surprised. When I end up enjoying a movie I didn't expect much from, I can usually dumb down my answer and say something like, ""I thought it was gonna suck, but it didn't!"" Superbad was a great movie, but totally unexpected in the strangest of ways.<br/><br/>The film opens with two best friends, Seth and Evan; trying to decide what adult entertainment website they want to sign up for. For two seniors in high school who are three weeks away from graduation, this seems to be a big commitment. Seth (played by Jonah Hill) mentions to Evan (played by Michael Cera) something about telling Fogell (played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse) that Evan won't be rooming with him next year at Dartmouth. The truth about this small and over looked quip comes spilling out later in the film.<br/><br/>What sets the film in motion is that Seth and Evan, two semi-losers on campus, are miraculously invited to the last senior party of the year which just happens to be the same day they got invited. The girl who invites the two entrusts Seth with bringing the alcohol and hands him the money to pay. As you've probably figured out, the film that ensues is basically a barrage of antics and plots to get the booze for the party which goes from bad to worse to disaster. Fogell even attempts to get his hands on some booze using a fake ID which bears one single name, McLovin.<br/><br/>The raunchy and juvenile humor never seems to stop, not to mention an entire montage of hand drawn penises; a disease that took Seth at the tender age of eight. The humor was actually quite witty and not something I would expect from what was supposed to be (or so I thought) one more teen sex comedy. The presence of two of the coolest police officers in the world (played by Bill Hader and Seth Rogan) add to the slacker hi-jinks and poked some great fun at law enforcement. But there is something unique in this film that sets Superbad apart from all the others.<br/><br/>Most people don't approach a movie like this thinking there is going to be some sort of great story and/or character development. This is what made Superbad great, it has both. Seth and Evan have been best friends since the sandbox, but suddenly, Evan is going away to Dartmouth; a school that Seth isn't smart enough to get into. As if that isn't bad enough, Evan hides the fact that he will in fact be roommates with Fogell. The two friends have been hiding things from each other, and Evan has been hiding his secret for all three years of high school. There are a handful of scenes where the truth comes spilling out. Seth is angry at Evan for applying and getting accepted to Dartmouth because Evan was well aware of the fact that Seth isn't smart enough to get in. Evan on the other hand, feels he needs to get away from Seth because Seth had been holding him back all throughout high school. Evan even has a line about how much more he could've accomplished without Seth, and now he's going to college friendless and a virgin.<br/><br/>Two best friends emptying their hearts to each other about how they feel about growing up and moving on in life; this was definitely not what people expected walking in. It's rare you actually get to see this level of character development (and well acted at that) in a teen film.<br/><br/>We went in expecting Euro trip but we got American Pie mixed with a better developed characters and a great story. All in all, the movie was great, and I'm looking forward to seeing what else the two writers come up with. Go see this one, now!"

","I saw the movie opening night, and I must say, it met every one of my expectations. It truly was an amazing movie. The movie follows two high school seniors (Hill and Cera) and their nerdy, yet hilarious third wheel friend (Plasse) in their journey to get wasted at their last Senior party (kind of like a Harold & Kumar thing). Only problem is, it would be their first and only true high school party. But as I was watching the movie, that famous that's always shown in the trailer...of course it's...""You know when you hear girls say 'Ah man, I was so sh!t-faced last night, I shouldn't of fu@ked that guy!' WE COULD BE THAT MISTAKE!!!"" That sort of got me thinking. There were a lot of opportunities that could of been taken by me back in high school, but never went through with it. Like dating that hot girl in the front row in English class.<br/><br/>So after all the laughs I endured in this movie, I came up with my own moral of the story.<br/><br/>-Don't let opportunities slip out from under you.- <br/><br/>A perfect 10/10"
"bensteinfan-1","9","3","7","18 August 2007"," Movie Review
","Judd Apatow, who wrote the 40 year-old Virgin and Knocked Up, has become sort of the John Hughes of the new millennium. He has tapped into the roots of what Gen-X and Gen Why-ers experienced in their lives and made them into entertaining movies. With his new movie SuperBad (which he produced this time, not wrote), he has once again plunged into the soul of the public and put the things that made us who we are onto the screen.<br/><br/>SuperBad is about two best friends, who are aiming to finally lose their virginity during their last week in high school. Seth (played by Jonah Hill), a pudgy super horndog, thinks that the way into a woman's pants is by alcohol. His best friend Evan (played hilariously gay by Michael Cera) is the quintessential boy who doesn't know what a woman is flirting with him, and even exhibit some of the stereotypical gay qualities: can cook like a great chef, can sing very high notes, speaks in a high voice, and even has Flanders-esquire greetings and salutations.<br/><br/>They get invited to a party where they are tasked with buying the booze, which leads to their friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) getting a fake ID. His fake ID has only one name on it: ""McLovin"". The Fogell/McLovin character might be the most hilarious single movie character of the past decade. He is off the wall funny in how he handles himself. I would venture to say that the character (if seen by enough people) could be remembered as famously as John Belushi's Blutarsky character in Animal House.<br/><br/>The main characters and the writing in this film make it utterly hilarious. The writing, while vulgar, is actually well placed and allows for a lot of hilarity. If you liked either of the 40YOV or Knocked Up, this movie is a must see...and definitely not for kids. Seth Rogan (who also co-wrote the screenplay) and Bill Hadar play a couple of slightly-askew-of-the-law cops who just add to the fun. The plot is very similar in style to Weird Science, but the writing for this movie elevates it to an almost instant cult classic. The soundtrack is mostly 70's funk related and is reminiscent of Shaft or Dolemite. Its a great film, and you should definitely check it out.<br/><br/>Its the best comedy I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 of 10."
"juliehicks75","9","3","7","18 August 2007"," You must go see this movie...
","Let me preface this by saying I'm not a member of the target audience for this often-dubbed ""teen movie""; however at 31 years old I think I related to and laughed at this movie just an intensely as any 16 year old teeny-bopper in the theater. I think I stopped laughing for no more than 90 consecutive seconds at a time. I haven't enjoyed a comedy like this since I first saw Raising Arizona or Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Comparisons to American Pie are totally off base - American Pie isn't even the same league as Superbad. Myself and my other 30-something friends were DYING from laughter throughout the entire film, and quite amazed and disgusted at how much we could relate to the nerdy but lovable main cast. If you even remotely liked ""Knocked Up' or ""40 Year Old Virgin"" or ""Freaks and Geeks"", you MUST go see this movie ASAP...if for no other reason that to experience the genius of what is McLovin.<br/><br/>Seth Rogan, you are the man. Great film my friend."
"knapp83","3","6","19","7 December 2007"," Just Don't
","This movie was a huge disappointment. The trailer had me ready for a comedy that would have me rolling and I got, instead, a lame attempt at a comedy that could have been written by any high school student. Even with a crew of humored college students behind me in the theater keeping it fresh, I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>All attempts at comedy are simply toilet humor. Any time the screenwriters felt like they needed a laugh, they just threw in the F-word a couple of dozen times and a sexual reference... not funny. Just lame.<br/><br/>The widespread support of this movie makes me wonder if I'll ever see an actual funny movie again..."

The dialog and interaction of the characters made me laugh out loud numerous times. It's a whole new group of young actors doing and saying the kind of sophomoric guy things that you have probably seen in many other films beginning with ""Animal House"", progressing through ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", to ""Weekend at Bernies"" through to recent times. Even though I've seen it before in one form or another, I still thought it was funny, particularly the first half hour or so and also the last half hour, the middle dragged a bit. What bothered me was paying $8.50 to see it. If you MUST see it in a theater this is the kind of film best seen in the BUDGET theater, since there are no special effects to speak of or need for a dynamic sound system, and it's basically a rehash of stuff that I'm sure you've seen before. <br/><br/>Rent it on DVD when the guys get together."
"kayharley2","10","4","11","18 August 2007"," hilarious!
","This movie is the funniest movie I have seen in well, a long time. I laughed harder at this than I did old school, 40-year old virgin, or any of those. I am not usually a fan of movies with that type of humor, but this was really funny. I highly recommend this movie - a lot of swearing and it is a bit crude, but otherwise really funny. The lines are classics-they will definitely be remembered for a long time. The best part is that the funniest parts are done very nonchalant, the actors are very serious when they are saying them. It makes it even funnier. I literally laughed out loud throughout the whole movie...I probably even missed some parts."
"movieman430","10","4","11","18 August 2007"," One of the funniest movies of the year
","Superbad is essentially about two things: the first is friendship, the second is alcohol. The movie is very well made on several levels because it explores both aspects while cleverly disguising them with laugh out loud humor. Superbad centers around Seth and Evan who need to get alcohol for a party so they can get the girls of their dreams. This basic plot line allows for some intensely hilarious situations, many of them centering around their friend Fogell or ""McLovin"" and his experience with two policemen. <br/><br/>The film is very honest about itself and while the language and sexual explicitness is pumped up to a very high level, it depicts several aspects of high school life relatively well. The friendship between Seth and Evan feels real which keeps the film from becoming a cesspool of sex jokes and drugs. It also takes a very negative stance on alcohol, as apparent in the final scenes of the movie. <br/><br/>The film does not contain a great deal of nudity, but the sexual dialog is stretched to a maximum. The dialog becomes almost gratuitous at parts, but usually offers some very funny moments. There is not a weak link in the cast, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Seth Rogen and others do a great job as does director Greg Mattola on his first big project. <br/><br/>Superbad is a pleasant mix of witty humor, gross out jokes, and surprising devotion to it's morals. It achieves something more than just a funny movie, following in the footsteps of Knocked Up and Forty Year Old Virgin, although this time with a very different feel. It if nothing else is incredibly funny and offers some great future talent both in front of and behind the camera."
"The-Sarkologist","9","2","4","14 September 2019"," Another Seth Rogan Classic
","This is one of those movies that I had heard about, and knew that I really should watch, except that things sort of got in the way, and also it was basically a Highschool sex comedy, and I'm not particularly all that impressed with these films, except that it is a Seth Rogan film which means that it isn't going to be like your typical High school sex romp comedy. That certainly turned out to be the case, and in fact it goes way beyond that to not only being good, but also being incredibly intelligent. The thing that I love about Rogan is his ability to hide some really deep, and challenging, concepts, in a film that is as foul mouthed as they come.<br/><br/>So, to put it straight, this is a film about three boys, or rather about two boys, who have gone on a quest to get some alcohol for a party that they have been invited to. Also, this is one of the last parties that they will be able to get to (namely because they aren't invited to many) and it is also an opportunity to hook up with a couple of girls that they really like. The thing is that, as I suggested, this isn't like a typical film in that not only are the women treated like human beings, and not just a conquest, but kindness and respect are actually rewarded, as opposed to ridiculed.<br/><br/>In fact some of the characters are really interesting, particularly the girl that has put in the request for the alcohol, namely because it turns out that she doesn't drink. The only reason she wanted the alcohol was because it was a party, however she had no interest in indulging. In fact, one interesting thing is that we see these two guys, who are ridiculed by the 'jocks', turn out to be the better guys. In fact, the adventure makes them the life of the party.<br/><br/>Yeah, they really do go on a pretty awesome adventure, which results in what has turned out to be an all time classic gross joke - the period blood. I'll say no more about it, but I suspect that this is probably well known because the film has been around for quite a while. Mind you, I knew nothing about it until I watched the film, so I guess there is that. Okay, a lot of films these days do try to push the boundaries, yet this is something that is certainly going to be memorable.
Oh, and there are the cops, they are nothing short of awesome. Of course, we find the truth about them later, but the movie also does an awesome job of humanising the cops. Normally, especially in such films, the cops are seen as the bad guys, the party poopers, but not these guys. In fact, they are literally the life of the film, which once again isn't surprising because half of the scenes were improvised. Like, seeing them switch on their lights just because they didn't want to stop at a red light makes you want to scream out 'I knew it! I knew they did that' (though I have actually seen them do it on occasion).<br/><br/>Yeah, this film is an absolute gem. It is a film about two guys who learn that women are not conquests, but are people, and the end turns out to be quite surprising. It is a film about male bonding, not in a sexual sense, but in a sense that men can have a really close relationship without it being sexual in any sense of the word. Mind you, the conditioning of our society does say otherwise, but in reality, this is simply not the case at all. It is a film about how cops are people too, and that they can also have fun. Yet, it is also a film about growing up, about coming of age, and about how friendships may have their ups and downs, but in the end a good friendship endures."

"areatw","7","2","4","6 January 2017"," Immature and crude but successfully funny
","'Superbad' is an immature, crude and at times offensive movie that, for obvious reasons, only appeals to a certain group of people. The movie consists of a basic, yet entertaining plot and a whole host of rude and inappropriate jokes. If it plays to your humour, 'Superbad' is a very funny movie.<br/><br/>The characters in this film alone are hilarious. 'McLovin' provides plenty of laughs, as do the useless, childish cops. I do think the film is slightly longer than necessary, it does seem to drag towards the end and fails to justify the near 2 hour running length, but that is a minor criticism of what is a successfully funny comedy movie.<br/><br/>If you like your comedies on the immature side and aren't easily offended by crude humour, 'Superbad' is definitely a film I would recommend."

The number of actually funny scenes was very low, and even those weren't that funny. The story is very thin and I didn't really care for the characters. This movie really did not have to last the 113 minutes that it did.<br/><br/>I really do not understand how this movie got rated so high (relatively) when compared to other movies with a similar rating."

","Superbad was one of them films where the trailer was better than the film. When I saw this in the cinema I thought DAMN... I'm gonna have to see this! It looked like one of the funniest films of the year...<br/><br/>...and I was wrong! Of course there are a good few laugh out loud moments, but the problem is that this film milks the hell out of it's jokes and because of the lacking storyline, that's all you're focussing on.<br/><br/>here are my problems with this film: <br/><br/>1) The cops had way too much screen time. They should have just played minor roles. They didn't really belong in this film. They would have been better suited in a different style of comedy.<br/><br/>2) The girls are incredibly forgettable. I can't even remember their faces. The typical stereotype brainless girls that teen movies are full of. Girls who are just sex interests and not people. They could have been different and had interesting female characters.<br/><br/>3) McLovin carries the film. He's the funniest character. The situations he gets himself in are hilarious. Seth and Evan are OK, but annoying. A focus on the relationship between the two characters would have put this film on a different level.<br/><br/>4) The storyline is cliché in parts. Typical American Pie/Porkys style teen flick. Also what's with the 70s music and the 70s references. Am I the only one who doesn't get it? <br/><br/>Overall, I find this film disappointing because there was so much potential with this. The result isn't too bad though. This is a movie that is one to rent or borrow from a friend. It's a film that you can enjoy with friends over a couple of beers. I can understand why people like it. Everyone probably knows at least one character on this film who was like someone from school. If you're after comedy that isn't too taxing on the brain and immature jokes then this is for you. A teen comedy for the Family Guy generation. It's one of those comedies that University/College students would find funny. You need to be in the right frame of mind to watch this.<br/><br/>If you're over 30 then this film probably isn't for you."
"thesar-2","8","2","4","16 January 2011"," I'm Assuming the 'Bad' means 'Good'
","You know these kinds of movies. The ones that grow on you. You can watch the entire thing through and mildly like it, but for hours, if not days, following, you find yourself laughing and/or enjoying the product you experienced.<br/><br/>Superbad has now done that to me twice. Well, I've seen it now twice, and both times I kept finding it ""just okay"" or ""barely funny"" throughout, yet following and especially in discussion with a work buddy the next day, I found my laughing out loud at some of the lines and humorous (supposedly) irrelevant scenes.<br/><br/>I also thought of how innocently they re-created high school, much like the John Hughes comedies of decades past. Aside from the goofy, but hilarious cops, everything pretty much played out as if this was based on true events. (Was it, Seth?)<br/><br/>BFFs Seth (Hill) & Evan (Cera) venture through their last weeks of high school slacking, complaining and upset they can't continue their lifelong friendship into college as they're headed to different schools. While wooing their prospective mates, the inexperienced duos plan to hit up a party one night and they're set to purchase and bring the booze. Only they're underage.<br/><br/>In comes Fogell (Mintz-Plasse in his introduction role thatwillseriouslydefine him from here on out) who got a fake ID with the one name (Cher, anyone?) McLovin on it and that he's Hawaiian. I'm guessing this was California, but most license plates (and police uniforms) state ""Clark County"" – which, of course, could be just about anywhere.<br/><br/>At any rate, they go through hell & high water to get the tainted water and to the girls of their dreams while realizing they're losing more than they're gaining.<br/><br/>If these were adults, it would be hard not to relish the many events, close calls and fun times they actually had. Meaning, they act like this will happen every day of their life outside of high school. It could, but it's 99% doubtful. Perhaps if these characters were real, they could, in fact, look back and cherish the absolute fun they had, if not just on this night.<br/><br/>There's a ton of swearing and some sexuality towards the end – I did say this was realistic, so its crucial to the plot and actually separates this from those Hughes movies. It's also surprisenly touching, and I'm not referring to the bromantic ""drunk/love"" scene towards the closing. It's on the escalatorthe look Seth gives is so real and heartbreaking, it almost makes the whole movie, if you haven't already yet appreciated the humor – namely from (once again) the brilliant Michael Cera.<br/><br/>It's not overloaded like the other Johan Hill/Seth Rogan movies with cameos, though there are a few. I couldn't believe my eyes when Clark Duke is spotted in the party with barely a line to his character. And speaking of Rogan (as Officer Michaels,) as funny he was as the rookie cop along with Officer Slater (Hader) as the drunk veteran, I thought they actually brought the movie down a slight notch. Sure, they were both hilarious – namely with the liquor store clerk, but they are the absolute only unrealistic part of the movie.<br/><br/>That said, it's a real thinker. I've been told by more than one person – and as stated, this is my opinion as well, that this movie isn't great the first time. But it sure as heck grows on you the more you think about it. That's good writing.<br/><br/>Side Note: after recently watching Easy A, a movie I fell in love with Emma Stone, it was great to watch her here. I sincerely hope she goes far in her career."
"oneguyrambling","8","2","4","29 November 2010"," More true to life and funnier than a million American Pies.
","Superbad is the teen movie they are always trying to make when they come up with Meet the Spartans and Eurotrip, it is profane, gross at times, silly and very, very funny. It is also one of the most realistic films that deal with the teen years that I can remember, except for the joke-a-minute stuff and the fact that Jonah Hill gets the whip-smart likable chick And Michael Cera is knocking back headjobs And McLovin' scores the hot jailbait Come to think of it maybe this is NOTHING like growing up, but it still is funny.<br/><br/>For some reason the credits and music are largely stuck in the 70s funk era, even though the film is set in the present day. It most definitely is good funk music though, and never overpowers the film or distracts you from what is happening.<br/><br/>The film was written by Seth Rogen and his childhood buddy Evan when they were both kids in school, nerdy and unpopular. It deals with two school age kids named Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Micahel Cera) and how they desperately want to be popular and score with chicks.<br/><br/>Gee where do these guys come up with their ideas?? The first few minutes of the film show with reasonable accuracy the everyday goings on of a high school kid and his buddy. Rather than picking colleges (already done) they are picking porn sites to subscribe to. Rather than discuss school stuff they are discussing after school stuff, most prominently parties that they would like to attend, but won't because they are dorks.<br/><br/>Now there are many factions among the unpopular at every school, the smart kids, the computer nerds, the disgusting, the emo/Goths, the try-hards and the dorks.<br/><br/>Dorks are usually not as physically mature as the cool, jock types, not as suave with the ladies, and not quite ready for mature conversation. They also aren't computer geeky, nor total social lepers, they just aren't quite ready yet.<br/><br/>Seth and Evan are dorks. Their friend Fogel (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is also a dork, but exacerbates the situation by being a try-hard as well. His early attempts at hip-hop slang and mature banter create many uncomfortable chuckles. Fogel tells Seth and Evan that he is scoring a coveted fake ID that very day.<br/><br/>As the school year is rapidly winding down Seth, Fogel and Evan basically seem to ignore the class schedule, and track each other down to chat, we learn that they have been friends since childhood, but their plan of attending the same college and rooming together has been waylaid as Seth didn't get the scores required. (This also rings true as I'd bet thousands that Jonah Hill has half the IQ of Michael Cera.) Early in proceedings a ""cool"" chick in class named Jules mentions to Seth that she is having a party that night while her parents are away, she invites Seth and Evan along, and Seth tries to talk himself up by saying that he will have access to a fake ID and can bring the booze.<br/><br/>Much was made of ""McLovin"" in the marketing for Superbad, and with good reason, the scene in which Fogel unveils his new 25 year old Hawaiian organ-donor alias to the world is hilarious and creates much tension between the three leads, all of it leading to more jokes.<br/><br/>Seth thinks supplying alcohol to the party will get him into Jules' pants, Evan thinks that buying some vodka for his muse Rebecca will gain him kudos, and who the hell knows what Fogel was thinking. I actually think his D&D obsessed character in Role Models is only a heartbeat away from McLovin anyway.<br/><br/>While in the bottle-O trying to buy the booze the store is held up and Fogel is knocked down, once the inept cops (Seth Rogen & Bill Hader) show up they not only seem to swallow his story and new McLovin persona, but they offer to take him to the party direct.<br/><br/>Seth and Evan assume the whole thing has gone horribly wrong and that Fogel is being taken to custody, and being teenage great buddies like they are they split.<br/><br/>Now in separate cars going in separate directions, Fogel and Seth and Evan spend the rest of the night trying to get to the party, dealing with the many circumstances that seem to conspire against them ever making it. These events include mobile phone problems, an adult party (with very adult situations), and all in brawl, repeated police intervention and Seth being hit not once, but twice by cars in separate incidents.<br/><br/>The film is always funny and often hilarious. It is irreverent, frequently gross and more true to life than a million American Pies or ""Insert generic teen film here"".<br/><br/>Again to the point where all three dorks score to varying degrees on the first night! Final Rating – 8 / 10. It can't be a coincidence that every R Rated comedy worth its salt in the last 10 years had Judd Apatow's fingerprints on it.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

But it's not that easy, and this three boys are gonna have a lot of trouble and we as audience are gonna laugh over and over again. <br/><br/>What makes this movie so good? Anyone can relate to one of the characters easily. It is similar to movies like ""American Pie"" but it has some single aspects that really makes the difference. In ""American Pie"" movies sometimes there's some unfunny joke, some things that doesn't work all right, maybe a joke was too hard to laugh it and sometimes the characters are quite offensive, not funny and difficult to relate with it. One thing that is dumbfounding in ""American Pie"" is this: All of the characters are self confident, good looking boys and they're always on the run trying to get some hot chick. In the real world you really can look at Seann William Scott (Stifler) and thinks ""he could get a girl easily"". With that I point that this movie is not realistic at all. Now in ""Superbad"" you have a fat and funny boy with a incredibly taste for dirty jokes; a shy and cute boy with no skills for talking with girls without blushing; and a nerdy with a strange sense of confidence. This three musketeers on a almost impossible task. Well, the reality factor counts sometimes and in this one helped the movie be what it is: real funny!<br/><br/>In ""Superbad"" 99,9% of the jokes has some original aspect and everything works. The dumb characters and the funny conversations are well written and not a single moment is wasted or not funny. And you can watch it over and over again even knowing everything what happens and still think that this is hilarious and enjoyable comedy. <br/><br/>One thing that received the biggest amount of complains on the boards here was Michael Cera singing Guess Who's ""These Eyes"". Many thought that this scene was ridiculous and pointless and all that. Let me say this: people you are SO WRONG about that. It is one of the most funniest moments EVER. Since this is a teenager movie released in 2007 most of the teen audience (I think) really don't know the song and doesn't even know how difficult is to sing it. And one can think: Why he choose this song to sing? I sing better than he but he really was funny doing that, making the sounds of the keyboards and singing badly. <br/><br/>Between the funniest and weirdest moments are: Fogell using his fake identity with the name of McLovin; Seth being hit by a car; Fogell/McLovin hanging with the irresponsible and funny cops (played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader); the strange party where Seth and Evan were taken by the guy who hit Seth; Evan talking on the phone with Becca, the girl he desires; the singing moment. I guess everything was funny and I couldn't stop laughing. All the actors were excellent in their parts notably the three boys and the cops. Here you have comedy professionals doing their best. One of the best teen comedies I ever seen along with the John Hughes's films. It really says a lot about teenagers and portrays them with some accuracy I must say. Badass! 10/10"
"kurciasbezdalas","10","2","4","9 December 2008"," Dazed and Confused of nowadays
","This movie reminds me of Dazed and Confused, but it's better. First of all because it's funnier. Most of the jokes are about how ridiculous characters are and it's portrayed very realistic, like they were a real life characters. So most of the funny moments were conversations between characters. What else did I like was the stylishness of this movie. The soundtrack made this film different from others and direction made it enjoyable even at those parts which weren't funny (which didn't supposed to be funny). It's not only about jokes, just like American Pie this movie has a deeper meaning and the main theme of it is friendship. So it easily beats most of the teenage comedies."

The writers didn't seem to hold back themselves or be held back by anyone from including these strong humors that mainly teenagers would find hilarious. The film involves a lot of alcohol and drugs, and various rude yet funny remarks.

","This wildly funny movie about two teenagers trying to get alcohol for a party starts rather slowly - I was on the fence about it for the first 20 minutes or so - but once it gets started it never stops, supplying a steady stream of insane situations and wacky comedy.<br/><br/>What makes this particularly successful is that the two central boys, as well as the two girls they want to hook up with, seem real, at least to the extent anyone can seem real is such an absurdly plotted film. The vulnerability of the leads counterbalances the utter insanity of a nerd and two cops whose scenes are the funniest in the movie.<br/><br/>In a movie that is basically just really silly, it's nice to see how they created just enough human emotion to keep the movie from feeling hollow but not enough to clog up the joke machine. It is just a wonderfully made movie that everyone should see."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","4","30 June 2008"," If by ""Superbad"" you mean Superdirty and Superhilarious, then yes
","Since Judd Apatow took the crown of hit comedies in 2005 with ""40-Year-Old Virgin,"" his films, and essentially comedy, has gotten dirtier and dirtier, or at least more not holding back the censors and settling with an R rating. If this is indeed true, then ""Superbad"" could very well be the apex. All the stuff guys think about or talk about only with their closest friends is the heart of the dialogue and it makes ""Superbad"" all the more super.<br/><br/>Essentially a teen comedy, ""Superbad"" is about two best friends named Evan and Seth (named for the writers who based the film off their high school years: Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen of ""Knocked Up"") who are nearing the end of their senior year and are pretty much just foul- mouthed losers. Jonah Hill as Seth in particular. <br/><br/>Hill, who made appearances in previous Apatow films, gets top billing here and much deserved. His lines are always the ones that your really dirty subconscious would say if you didn't beat it down constantly and that delivery along with his goofy appearance is his specialty. Michael Cera as Evan, however, is perhaps the half of the duo that makes it all work: his soft-spoken, ""under-your-breath"" humor balances out the loud, attention- sucking Hill--a quality not typical of comedic actors but something that suits Cera really well. He also makes the more meaningful, awkward high school years truth to the whole film work effectively to take ""Superbad"" somewhere beside the bathroom to get its mouth washed out with soap.<br/><br/>The plot all takes place in one day when Seth gets invited to a party (a real party!) of a girl he has a mad crush on. To please her, he promises to bring the booze with his non-existent fake ID. Enter Fogle, the scrawny friend-out-of-pity with the quintessential nerd looks who has a fake ID that says ""McLovin'"" and it all goes crazy from there.<br/><br/>What really makes this film win you over is how relatable the situational comedy is. Even if it all gets blown out of proportion, the way the characters handle it is so true to teenage life. It's easy to label ""Superbad"" as a teen comedy, but it goes beyond that--it clears the hurdles of the trash high school comedies that infested the early half of the decade and plus, it's rated R. This is a comedy truly for best buddies to recall their ridiculous high school days. Even if you didn't do the things Evan and Seth do in the film, your friendship was similar-- everyone's was/is. So no matter how outlandish and bizarre ""Superbad"" gets, it never warrants an eye roll because the characters are so strong."

","I don't often comment on movies, but on this one I had to. This was by far the best movie of 2007 in my eyes. I didn't think it could get any funnier than Knocked Up, but I was wrong. I saw it two times in the theater and laughed the entire way through it both times. The great raunchy humor mixed with an excellent plot makes for one great movie.<br/><br/>The characters of this movie were cast perfectly. Seth Rogen, of course, was genius as Officer Micheals.

","Let me start off by saying, this movie is NOT for everyone. If you like Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, or Bill Hader, you're watching the right movie. The plot is SUPER over the top! The concept is very teen related, so it comes off appealing to the older teenage crowd. On the down side, there really is no arch to the movie; they more or less just made a few bumps in the road, and just went with the flow. Most of the scenes are over the top, and can also be on the cringier side, but it's what the movie embraces.<br/><br/>Overall, if you enjoyed movies like Pineapple Express, 21 Jump Street, etc, you're going to enjoy this movie a lot."

Everyone tries to act cool, but deep down no one really is and that contrast is shown superbly.
The three friends are on a confidence roller-coaster that should transport any viewer to their teenage years.<br/><br/>I feel this movie also single-handedly shot up Jonah Hill and Emma Stone's career. I don't remember much of their work before this, but I remember a lot afterwards. Given that it wasn't very dramatic and it wasn't set up in the best way to show acting qualities, that alone should tell you something about the quality of the script.<br/><br/>Probably the only reason people snubbed their noses at this is that they didn't take it for what it is and wanted something sophisticated."

Hill and Cera have great chemistry, bouncing insults and muttering puns at a machine-gun pace, and they get a ton of help from the supporting cast.

I just wish it could've hovered in its zone of meaningless shenanigans the whole way through, because the last twenty minutes - when the plot suddenly realizes it needs to get going - are something of a chore to push through.

","Painfully awkward, but at times absolutely hilarious, Superbad goes for both the realistic and the outrageous sides of high school comedies, blending them together in one very unique package. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill lead the film and give some quite impressive performances, as awkward as they were. Infact, all the actors do a pretty impressive job all in all, which is tough for such a majority of them being younger actors. The film at times can be often hilarious, with jokes and situations so insane you can hardly even imagine without seeing them in the film. The film's biggest problem is its pacing, sometimes fast, other times slowing to a crawl, and its the slow moments that seem the worst because not only are they mostly humorless but they are painful to watch. I'm all for emotion in teen films, but Superbad decides to make the worst of each hard situation, and the film just feels like it is carrying too much at once. In the end, Superbad is a pretty impressive comedy, that could use some work in less comedic parts, but is full of just enough laughs and nostalgic humor that it will certainly win you over by the time the credits role.

","Yes, it's funny. It's silly, it's crass, it's irreverant, and it has all the makings of a mindless adolescent farce like the ones I grew up with from American Pie to Revenge of the Nerds and all their sequels. But when this movie ended and the credits rolled I was left speechless in awe. And not just because of all the penis drawings during the credits.<br/><br/>""Superbad"" is, as you may expect from any film produced by Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, etc), on the raunchy side. So don't be surprised if you see a penis drawing or 2. But what makes this an amazing film is that despite all the raunchiness and partying and horseplay it actually delivers some powerful human and sentimental themes.<br/><br/>In the hands of an inferior cast, it would have flopped and come across as cheesy. But with these actors, each delivering a larger than life performance despite playing high school seniors, it's magnificent. I'll give you just 1 example of what I'm talking about...<br/><br/>There's a scene where 2 characters are gearing up for a sexual encounter (their first). But one of them (and arguably both) are not ready for it. Unlike all the teen romps that I grew up with, where the goal is for the guy to bed the girl, this scene makes us put the brakes on and consider: Wait... Why is the goal always for the guy to bed the girl?? And at the same time it's really funny and does not sacrifice the film's momentum. I won't ruin the ending of the scene, but let's just say it's satisfying on every level and punctuated with a great gag to make us laugh.<br/><br/>""Superbad"" is truly an evolution of the genre. It's every bit as crass and wacky and full of horseplay as all the others since Porky's, but this is the first time one of these mindless comedies dares to make us think and feel on a deeper level. Like I said, it's largely due to the great casting. Michael Cena, if you're not familiar, plays his signature role of an awkward deer-in-the-headlights kid but with a strong sense of who he is, even though nobody else seems to understand. Jonah Hill plays his best friend, sort of the antithesis: a loser who thinks he knows what he wants but he's really quite confused. Emma Stone knocks it out of the park with a great role that's quirky, cool, rebellious and responsible all at the same time. Rounding out the troupe are Bill Hader and Seth Rogan who play a pair of despicable yet loveable cops whose combined IQ is around the same as their blood alcohol level.<br/><br/>This flick has it all. It's definitely for mature audiences in terms of language (at least the unrated cut I watched), but ironically it has some great messages for teens and younger viewers, if you can see through the tomfoolery. There aren't many films I can compare this to, but if you've seen ""Easy A"" with Emma Stone (somewhat tamer than this), I'd say ""Superbad"" has the same vibe. A seemingly silly teen comedy that packs a serious punch under the surface."

Superbad isn't a terrible movie, but it's essentially a more profane American Pie with less nudity. Rogen appears as the same character in the other two movies, but with a different occupation, this time a cop. Michael Cera (George Michael from Arrested Development) is the standout in the movie, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is appealing as a character somewhat similar to the MILF guy from American Pie. Jonah Hill, an Apatow regular, does his best to try and one-up Seann William Scott in the annoying category. The amount of profanity in this movie doesn't bother me, though it is probably excessive for the average movie fan, but the plot offers absolutely nothing new, and if you've seen the previews, you've seen (edited versions of) all the jokes. I was hoping this would be an improvement over the quality of comedies that have been successes lately (i.e. I Know Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, Wedding Crashers), and it probably is, but only slightly."

I probably would have enjoyed ""Superbad"" much more if the two adult policemen were not present: their existences as characters were completely idiotic. They drank beer and did donuts in the parking lot, shot their guns into the air, completely disregarded any semblance of the law, willingly gave minors alcohol, and were utter failures at their job.

While the same humor is used, it lacks character emotion for the viewer to care, gross moments that are meant to be funny but dragged out four minutes too long, and an over abundance of bitching and moaning.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan, (Michael Cera) two best friends who are in their senior year of high school who have their plans for being roommates in college ruined when Evan gets into Dartmouth and Seth does not. When both their high school crushes invite them to a party and ask them to get alcohol their quest begins. With freak occurrences and their dependence on Evan's annoying Dartmouth bound friend, Fogell they engage in one of the wildest nights of their lives.<br/><br/>The grotesque humor as funny as it is, is used so much that the film overdoses like a drug user and loses its target audience. As it will relate to the young adult audience, it has potential to become a film icon like Old School and Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. As you watch it more, the film may become funnier with each viewing. But I'm afraid the script is a little everywhere and the characters are ultra annoying to watch.

It's two weeks before graduation and two high school seniors and lifelong best friends who are presumably named after the film's screenwriters - the foul-mouthed, out-going, and sex-crazed Seth (Jonah Hill) and the somewhat introverted, stalwart, and more cautious Evan (Michael Cera) - are facing the possibility of never seeing each other again when Evan and a third named Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) get accepted to Dartmouth while Seth's college plans are an uncertainty because he didn't get accepted. To make long stories short, Evan and Fogell are going to be rooming together at Dartmouth, which certainly makes Seth feel a little left out, like his best bud is bailing out on him. But ""Superbad's"" story gets underway when the two get invited to a party, where two girls - the cute Becca (Martha MacIsaac) and Jules (Emma Stone) - both of whom Evan and Seth are smitten with, respectively, are going to be. So, Seth and Evan are put on alcohol duty. Since, obviously, they're underage, they have to get Fogell (who has a fake ID) to go get the booze at a liquor store. Sounds easy enough, right? (If he doesn't get carded at the cash register first.) But a series of unusually comic events throw their plan into chaos, and wondering how they're going to get the booze for the girls they like, and save the party. On a side note, Fogell gets swept up with two police officers (Rogen himself and Bill Hader) who also proceed to show him the night of his life and recapture some youthful shenanigans themselves. ""Superbad"" is definitely not a movie children should see. With enough adult humor, profanity, and alcohol - all involving teenagers - you can bet this is a show for mature adults. Like I stated earlier, the film's greatest strength lies in the intelligence of its screenplay. From seeing the actors' performances, you understand the frustration the kids go through to simply have a good time before facing life's uncertainties as college freshmen and then later, as adults. Rogen and Goldberg's writing captures all of this perfectly, and the comic timing of the two lead actors in a number of comic scenes is nothing short of brilliant. The jokes fly fast, so does the adult humor and profanity, but ""Superbad"" is a super-cool teen flick, and bound to be yet another fun entry into the teen market.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Beloved Reader, please glimpse at the star rating below. Yes, I may be just one critic. And this one critic may have given Superbad half-a-star away from the almighty 5. That is because this movie is a rare movie. It is not 4.5-star-worthy in same way as, say, Collateral. It has achieved that rating in the context of other Comedies. In that case, it has gotten that rating for three simple words.<br/><br/>It. Is. Hilarious.<br/><br/>First off, if you believe the rumours, this started off from the minds of two 13-year-olds. Doesn't sound promising, does it? But when one of them is Seth Rogen (Knocked Up), you know you're safe. Then there were the trailers and other assorted advertising. You could not be blamed for thinking it was another Animal House, or Porky's, or American Pie. Yet, with Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) producing, this is more than a rehash. No, that would be plain lazy for these pros.<br/><br/>There are a few comedy classics with recurring gags. Back To The Future had Calvin Klein. The Big Lebowski had the Rug. Groundhog Day, well, had the whole 24 hours. And one could suppose that Superbad's recurring joke is the Cops. Drunk, incompetent, imbecile cops are something we've seen before. But when two cops flee from sirens that aren't they're own? In such a naturally comical way? That deserves some kudos.<br/><br/>As with the cops, we've probably seen the buddy-coming-of-age-flick-with-added-crude-jokes before. But not like this. This clichéd sub-genre of comedy has been kicked in the man-parts. That's both figuratively and literally. That is because, even in the fantasy scenes, it stays true. The daydreams of Seth (the brilliant Jonah Hill) as he prepares to steal liquor. Sure, they are beautifully over-the-top. But it stays true to the paranoia most teenagers have in that situation. Jonah Hill adds those subtle shuffles and shifty eyes. To which, makes you chuckle lightly, before exploding with laughter.<br/><br/>All of this adds to why it's so good. One would not expect a film such as this to be good. Deep down, you may go in, and think you will see the same B.S. The same, tired frat-boy jokes you heard years ago cut-and-pasted together. Not here. What starts as a laugh-out-loud farce, turns slightly dark. It starts with conversations of Orson Welles waistline expanding after Citizen Kane. Then it flows to an awkwardly funny car crash. All of which leads up to a climax that suits the previous events. Sure, some may say it is too neat and tidy. But it is fitting to the journey of the guys.<br/><br/>The characters of Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are so magically written. Some of you may carp about them being 'generic'. If that is the case, something has gone amiss. That is there are guys like Seth and Evan out there. Hell, you were probably best friends with them back in the day. To add to them, there is Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Or 'McLovin', as he prefers to be known. He is the mirrored version of Seth and Evan. He knows that his attempts to be cool are embarrassing. Yet, that doesn't stop him.<br/><br/>What separates Superbad from the rest of the pack lies on one thing. Real Humour. It doesn't rely on canned laughter. Nor does it rely on forced one-liners. It uses humour in situations that could really happen. Fantastical daydream, or not.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 Superbad is one Gem of a movie. It may not be a work of 'art', like Citizen Kane (to which was so hilariously name-dropped here). But, if you want your laughs thick and fast, for 2 hours-straight, then here's your answer. As long as you go in with this warning. There will be too many fantastic quotes for you to remember.<br/><br/>For movie news, check out www.obsessedwithfilm.com"

","I've never seen a movie that made me laugh this hard. Maybe because one of the main characters is exactly the same as a good friend of mine from back in high school, even down to the drawing of male genitalia. I had to see it again because i missed so many parts from laughing so hard. My hands never left from covering my mouth. People say the plot is unoriginal and all this stuff. Don't listen to them. This movie is nothing short of hilarious. I have yet to meet an actual human being that has seen this movie and not thought it was one of the funniest movies they've ever seen. It takes you, well at least me, back to the days of high school."

","I wish I had this ****load of fun in my High school. The chemistry between both the guys was good. The script is hilarious n hits bullseye 80% of the times. The movie hardly looses its momentum at any point and it is fun throughout. The fat guy really takes the lead all the times and has done a great job. His body language, dialog delivery everything is just fun to watch. All in all a gr8 movie n the release time is also perfect since most of the kids are going to college at this time n they can easily relate to the desperate n funny measures being taken by the teens to behave like adults. So this movie makes it a total of 3 good movies this summer: Bourne Ultimatum, Live free or Die Hard n Super Good"
"sullibrandon","7","3","8","22 August 2007"," Hilarious, but a little Cliché and Lazy
","I'm sorry to report that Superbad is a clear step backward in terms of character and story from Apatow's previous stuff, although, admittedly, it was only produced by him, not directed. Superbad is one big long hilarious sex joke from beginning to end, but once all the thin layers are stripped away, there's not much left to distinguish it from other films of its ilk.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill is Seth and Michael Cena is Evan, two high school seniors who are on their last week of school and want to go out with a bang. So they enlist the aid of a friend who would make the nerdiest of nerds look like Brad Pitt - Fogell, played squeakily excellently by newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse.He has just purchased a fake ID, and the plan of the three is to use it to buy alcohol for a party so they can get girls drunk and sleep with them. Fogell goes to the liquor store and is knocked out by a thief (whom we never see again), causing the clerk to call the police in to look for the robber. Can you say, ""contrived plot point?""<br/><br/>Aside from the three main characters, everyone else is a tired stereotype, from the stupid cops of Seth Rogen and Bill Hader (played with enough pizazz to overshadow their cliché-ness), to the naïve liquor store counter girl who accepts a clearly highly suspicious fake ID, to the girls merely existing so that the main characters can (or cannot) have sex with them. True, most of these are laugh-out-loud hilarious, but for me that didn't overshadow how uncreative they were. In conjunction with this qualm of mine, I also didn't appreciate how everybody except the three main characters seemed to have lost their brains on the way to their parts. Films like ""Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" succeeded because all the characters were three-dimensional real people, not stereotypes. Neither Jonah Hill nor Michael Cena carry enough charisma and clout to make us believe these are actually real people. Jonah Hill plays the exact same part he played in Knocked Up, only without the drugs. On top of all this, the movie is false in its claims to authentically portray the boy high school experience because of how, suspiciously, the entire high school is populated by 25-year old drop dead gorgeous women. Much has also been said about the F-word being dropped at least three times a minute  but so what? What movie doesn't have the F-word these days? This doesn't make it good. It's not like it was some kind of huge risk for them to use it. This isn't the 70's people, it's the 21st century, and when the F-word is used a lot it's not some reason to be impressed by bravura film-making.<br/><br/>Finally, my biggest beef with the movie is its faux brotherhood undertones. Yes, Hill and Cena do share wonderful chemistry, but the ""conflict"" between them (each of them are going to separate colleges at the end of the year) is barely mentioned three or four times, and it seems merely added for the purposes of giving the film an Apatowsian flair. It's competently done, of course.It's nowhere near as developed as the emotional heart of Apatow's previous two theatrical outings, where the drama was sewn into the whole in such a way that if you removed it, the entire thing would fall apart. In Superbad, though, it seems more of an extra doohickey than something that was needed. <br/><br/>Despite all my criticisms, I'm giving this movie a good recommendation simply because of how hilarious it is. Both Hill and Cena hit each comedic note perfectly, and Hader and Rogen as the cliché cops add just the right amount of ridiculousness to make their inclusion forgivable. The most hilarious aspect of the movie comes in the running joke that Fogell changed his name to McLovin when he bought a fake ID. This joke runs throughout, but through intelligent script-writing it never loses steam and always draws a hearty belly laugh. The McLovin' joke alone is worth the entire price of admission, and in a movie with literally a laugh-a-minute, that's saying something. Some moments in the movie also (probably purposefully) recall classics like American Pie, which really helps the movie's appeal, because it throws into contrast how lacking American Pie's comedy is in relation to Superbad's. The writing is simply much more talented and does a heck of a lot more with the material. I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire thing, and though at the end of the day it lacked a certain heart and soul that prevents me from giving it an extremely high rating, it does bring the laughs.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm being a little too unfair on Superbad. After all, the director is some guy named Greg Mottola who must be feeling like the luckiest guy in the world right now, with the reigning king of R-rated comedy producing his flick. Why should I place the burden of Apatow's success upon this filmmaker's shoulders? The reason is that Superbad was billed as ""from the guys who brought you Talladega Nights and The 40-Year Old Virgin."" With a title like that, it's obviously wanting very badly to be the next Knocked Up. But if Apatow wasn't attached to the project, you can bet it wouldn't be half as successful, and probably even lower in the critical ratings, too. It was a clever advertising campaign, to be sure, but it only causes me to be suspicious if Superbad actually has any inherent value. For now, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt  it's not as good as the other two hilarious comedies of the summer, Knocked Up and The Simpsons Movie, but it is a great fun-filled teen sex comedy romp that is still above average."
"WarriorAlien","9","3","8","21 August 2007"," Amazingly funny and surprisingly honest.
","I like ""smart"" comedy, if you know what I mean. And, as a fan of that type of comedy, I know that it's an improper label. Most people think ""smart"" comedy is pretentious, dry, and over your head. Not so. The real ""smart"" comedy is the ability to send a decent message despite the texture (ie. sexuality; profanity, and basic vulgarity). By this criteria, anything from Clerks to The Life Aquatic to The 40-Year-Old Virgin could be considered smart. Superbad should be, as well.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Michael Cera (who got his experience playing this awkward style of character on Arrested Development) exemplify the idea of a comedic duo in their roles as two Grade 12 students looking for booze and love. While their repertoire may not have been as extensive as David Spade's and Chris Farley when they pulled off Tommy Boy, Hill and Cera converse so well on screen that you forget you're watching actors do their paying work. Their conversations, especially in the early part of the film, seem as genuine as any obscene chat you've had with any buddy of yours in the hall. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, as the extraordinarily geeky yet paradoxically cool Fogell (a.k.a. McLovin) plays uncomfortable as well as any self-conscious high school nerd, notably in the good portion of the movie when he's joyriding with police officers Michaels and Slater (screenwriter Seth Rogen and rising SNL superstar Bill Hader), who steal the movie in regards to their out-of-code behaviour and personalities. Hader owns a particular scene in a bar where, increasingly intoxicated, he explains to the simultaneously scared and wondrous Fogell why one should never pick up women in bars. Their forceful comments during the climactic party-crashing are enough to earn their way into IMDb quote books for good.<br/><br/>As noted in the opening paragraph, though, Superbad has a message. Evan's encounter with his drunken crush at the final party provides a firm moral dilemma not usually encountered in your average teen sex comedy, and Seth's drunkenly confessed insecurities hit home for more than a few of us. More than anything else, the film's epilogue reinforces the knowledge every high schooler should realise: not all friendships can last beyond graduation. Hard to believe this was written by students all the way back in Grade 9.<br/><br/>See it, and stay for the first half of the credits. I will not reveal why."
"loco_the_infamous","8","3","8","20 August 2007"," Great cast, great jokes.. a great comedy classic!
","This movie truly shows how the Highschool world is like. The way they talk and what they talk about. The jokes and lines are just hilarious and gut-busting. Im 17 years old and my first thought when I left the theater was this is so realistic. It's like I was watching my school, the only non-realistic thing are the two cops. Which they are both extremely hilarious. Seth Rogen films are always fun and entertaining. The characters bring their own creativity and humor to the screen. Definitely a movie to be seen. I give it a 10/10 because most comedies these days are ridiculously stupid, but Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg always come through."

","This film is HILARIOUS. I can't even begin to describe how hard I laughed at this piece of pure comic genius. It wasn't deliberately immature (i.e. American Pie, Dude Where's My Car?, Road Trip) or insanely perverted and crass like all these other teen movies you see all the time like ""Not Another Teen Movie"". This movie was smart and freaking funny at the same time. The Seth and Evan characters' awkwardness allowed for some great dialogs (the dick issue, the health class comment, the period issue) that truly showed how stupid high school teens really can be. It's great and I hope everyone sees it at least twice before it comes out on DVD."
"LeninzTomb","10","3","8","19 August 2007"," ""Engage!"" Believe all the hype surrounding this movie!
","I had been anxious to see ""Superbad"" since I first saw the trailer for it on April 6th, when I saw ""Grindhouse."" And that wasn't even the R-rated trailer that got this movie famous on YouTube.com. The movie was hysterical! ""Superbad"" offers great, nay, excellent gags from Rogen and company. The characters are all believable, and it seemed that the actors portraying them were practically custom made for their respective roles. I saw a little bit of my own friends in both Evan and Seth. That's partially why this movie has been so successful. Despite that it's a laugh-till-you-cry comedy movie, it's also got great substance, because it's also about two young men who want to remain friends, even when they'll soon be separated by attending different schools of higher learning. But before they're off to college, they have two goals: 1) Get the booze & 2) Get the girls! The police officers (Bill Hader & Seth Rogen) also added a nice twist to the storyline. Their shenanigans supplied a considerable amount of the laughs in ""Superbad."" Just picture two armed members of the LAPD drinking beer and doing donuts in a vacant lot: what's the worst, I mean funniest, thing that could happen? Oh, and let's not forget ""McLovin."" After ""Superbad"" ended, I realized that McLovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), stole the show! I'm certain that because of this movie, he'll be swamped by offers left and right to be in movie after movie. He might be the next Jon Heder, who broke out into mainstream film with ""Napoleon Dynamite."" In summation, if you want to laugh a lot, nearly to the point of waking up the next morning with a sore abdomen, watch this movie! It's the funniest movie I've seen all year, which is saying plenty because I've seen ""Knocked Up"" and ""Jackass Number 2"" among others."
"annoman","9","3","8","19 August 2007"," Perhaps the most crude, vulgar, profane movie of all time... and one of the funniest, too.
","We've all been there  ""there"" being high school  and we've all encountered that certain awkwardness when dealing with such things as partying and, well, girls. 'Superbad' is a movie about that uncomfortable space  the space between cool and un-cool, fun and sex, and, essentially, friendship and all that comes after. The team that brought us 2005's '40-Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up' back in June has again raised the bar for future R-rated comedies with this raunchy teen sex romp that immerses itself in crudity and profanity, so much even, it surpasses the level of vulgarity and reaches an impossible gauche nirvana. The film's dialogue is shocking, shameful, outrageous and offensive, and comes at an alarming rate, never-before seen and you know what? It's hilarious! 'Superbad,' written by 'Knocked Up''s own Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who executive-produced 'KU,' makes 'Fargo' seem like a daycare nap time movie and turns Borat into a boy scout, with its aggressive, foul-mouthed approach. Yet despite its obnoxious script, it somehow manages to win over its audience with its genuine portrayal of high school life and the sincerity of its two main characters, Seth and Evan.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill plays Seth, Evan's dirty-minded best friend who used to have a condition, ""shared by 8% of all kids"" we're told, which caused him to draw unlimited pictures of the male sex organ. Evan, played by 'Arrested Development''s Michael Cera, is the straight-faced good-hearted guy whose sarcasm mediates Seth's smuttiness. Seth and Evan are socially inept high school seniors with the looming days of college initiating their separation. All Seth wants to do is hook up with a girl before he goes to college, whereas Evan has his eyes, and hopes, set on a relationship with his longtime crush. When the two boys are invited to the biggest party of the year, at which Evan's crush and Seth's target will be ""wasted,"" their world takes a turn for the lucky. That is until, in their mindless attempt to be ""cool,"" they're stuck with the responsibility of providing the party with its alcohol. That presents a huge problem. Insert: McLovin. The ""25-year-old Hawaiian organ donor,"" known to his classmates as Fogell (played by riotous newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse), offers to do his only two friends, Seth and Evan, the favor of their life by buying the alcohol with his brand-new false ID.<br/><br/>The movie is sharply filmed, for a comedy or otherwise, and its unadulterated editing makes its subject matter feel fresh and authentic. Much like 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up,' 'Superbad' is laden with pop culture references and rings the bell of high school renditions in the vein of Linklater's 'Dazed and Confused.' The insight of producer Judd Apatow, director Greg Mottola's appetite for a retro-80's feel, Jonah Hill's potty-mouth, Michael Cera's deadpan sarcasm, and, well, McLovin, make 'Superbad' the funniest movie of the year and an instant classic for the coming ages. For the 18 to mid-thirties male demographic, there's perhaps no funnier, more vulgar movie ever. However, those who don't fit that demographic might want to take their earmuffs, or maybe even skip this one altogether."
"pyrocitor","7","3","8","19 August 2007"," Surprisingly, the title doesn't reflect the film's quality
","There are many films which need to be seen in a certain context, with certain expectations, and with the realization that certain qualities which would normally add quality to a film will most likely be absent, without making the film any less enjoyable. Superbad is a prime example of all of these afformentioned traits - astonishingly foul mouthed, remarkably stupid yet surprisingly likable and endearing for all of its seemingly negative foibles. What might have been reduced to a generic and exploitive teen sex comedy ended up as... well, not too far from it, but one with surprising heart and enough caustic one liners to take its simple premise, and end up with an unreasonably solid film.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe what makes Superbad so enjoyable, considering it appears and feels like yet another trite teen comedy one can only shamefully admit to having viewed, but for whatever reason, the delicate balance between raucous and sentimental clicks, making up for any lapses in logic the plot may demonstrate. The story is perhaps the most familiar in all semi-romanticized teen pop culture: a duo of socially inept friends attempt to procure alcohol for a wild party in order to win one night stands from the objects of their affections, and in the process, an unspoken separation anxiety for the following year at separate colleges comes out. But despite the rank familiarity of the tale, somehow screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg manage to present a surprisingly touching as well as vile and hilarious (if not always realistic) portrait of the decline of teenage years and the nostalgic bittersweet twinge left behind. While it is true that the film may have little to say on the subject of high school that hasn't already been explored by countless films before, the voice in which the tale is related is a genuine one (one is left to wonder how much of the story is based on the screenwriters' actual lives...) and one which near anyone can relate to in some degree, or at least share a bawdy laugh with. <br/><br/>Another boost to the film's quality was the casting of mostly relative unknowns, who may be familiar faces from other similar comedies, but not well known enough to achieve 'name' status - much like the high school personas they inhabit here. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera's oddball chemistry makes for a surprisingly likable and highly relatable lead duo - these are guys everyone has gone to school with, sat in class with, bumped into in the halls and seen skulking off in the corner at a party. Providing great comedic support to an already highly comedic pair is newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who takes the oh so stereotypical nerdy sidekick role and somehow manages to squeeze fresh comedic potential out of it. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader, playing a pair of somewhat out of place party animal cops also manage to raise laughs unreasonably beyond the potential of their premise. Unfortunately, the performance lows are the already minimal female parts, who, unlike the believably crafted male characters, generally come across as contrived and often simply reduced to simply eye candy, though Martha MacIsaac and Emma Stone as the lust objects of the lead duo manage to give charismatic enough performances despite their disappointingly poorly written roles. It would seem keeping with the autobiographical note of the film that like their male protagonists, the screenwriters still aren't familiar enough with women to write plausible parts for them. <br/><br/>Yes the film is fraught with repetitive, stupid comedy and profane one-liners whizzing by, and yes it does reduce the essence of high school to drinking, sex, and drinking for the purpose of procuring sex, but the emotional heart and soul of the picture resonate strongly enough to make the film surprisingly endearing, providing an oddly charming inner core to the profane exterior. Superbad could be described as a sort of feel good film for recent high school graduates, or those reflecting back with a nostalgic tear on the crazy carefree days of their youth, or it could be described as a raucous, profane and gut bustingly hilarious take on the teenage dream, or at least a romanticized version of it - the reality being, the film somehow manages to seamlessly blend the two, distributing heartfelt sentiment with a cheery smile and an unapologetic innuendo, making the end result far more enjoyable than it had any right to be. <br/><br/>-7.5/10"

Don't complain when you don't like it, because you're not part of the targeted audience.<br/><br/>Now if you are in your late teens or 20s, there is no way you can't like this movie. Non-stop laughter is the best way to describe the movie. There is literally no moment during the movie where you aren't laughing or wiping the tears away from your eyes because you just got done laughing. It is just that funny. It's hard to catch all the jokes because the audience is probably still laughing from the last joke.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so great is that it is an accurate description of what a lot of guys go through during their HS years. And why shouldn't it be, considering the writing of the story began when the writers were teenagers.<br/><br/>If there is a movie than can fit more laughs in 110 minutes, I have yet to see it.

Just seems like the low reviewers didn't see the movie. Great movie."
"Buddy-51","8","3","9","8 September 2007"," another triumph from the ""Knocked Up"" team
","Filmmakers Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg make lowbrow comedies for highbrow audiences. With films like ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" ""Knocked Up,"" and their current gem, ""Superbad"" (directed by Greg Mottola), they have begun, in their own quiet way, to re-write the rules of the modern sex comedy, making films that, despite their R-rated blueness, are just a tad more insightful, a little more nuanced, and a trifle more literate than most films in that genre.<br/><br/>The characters in their movies may seem at first blush to be mere photocopies of the nerds and losers familiar to us from all those post-""Animal House,"" pandering-to-youth comedy hits of the late 1970's and 1980's. Yet, there is something rather different about these individuals, a difference that it is not always all that easy to put one's finger on. They seem somehow more reflective and self-aware than their earlier counterparts, more able to step out of their skins and see themselves for who and what they are. It's almost as if these characters have had the added advantage of seeing themselves reflected in all those earlier movies (one imagines they've spent a great deal of their childhood reveling in ""Revenge of the Nerds"") and of extracting important lessons from those films to help them chart their course through life.<br/><br/>The storyline, in and of itself, is hardly original. The screenplay by Rogen and Goldberg chronicles the misadventures of three teenage super geeks determined to go to any lengths or suffer any humiliation to be part of the ""in"" crowd at school. With only a few days left before graduation, Seth, Evan, and super-nerd Fogell - an outcast even the outcasts can feel comfortable ostracizing - decide that the time has come to take some drastic action if they hope to have any chance of losing their virginity before high school ends. Thus, Seth cooks up a scheme to smuggle booze into a graduation party being thrown by one of the hottest girls on campus. It is the expected setbacks they encounter as they go about the business of achieving ""coolness"" that provide the comic energy for the tale.<br/><br/>As they did in ""Knocked Up,"" the writers capture the way people in the real world actually speak. The dialogue may be crude and vulgar, but it is also sharply observant and wickedly funny as the characters lament the unfairness of life and reveal deep-seated concerns and feelings about themselves and each other. What's nice is that the characters in this film not only sound like people we might encounter in everyday life but LOOK like them as well. Even the ""beautiful"" people in this film aren't drop-dead gorgeous, just believably well put-together and attractive.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are so authentic and convincing in the roles of Seth, Eric and Fogell, respectively, that they have us securely in their corner from the very first moment they appear on screen. Rogen and Bill Hader (""SNL"") also have a good time playing goofy cops, although their characters aren't as finely drawn or interesting as the three main characters, and the scenes with them do tend to drag a bit.<br/><br/>It is crucial to point out that, amidst all the blush-inducing, foul-mouthed hilarity, there's an incredible underlying sweetness to ""Superbad,"" particularly in the final two scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>Together, this team of talented filmmakers is making it fun to go to the movies again."

","I can't believe I'm explaining this, but there are some (only about 5%) who actually missed the point, so I thought I'd explain... (SPOILERS) <br/><br/>This movie (like all Rogen/Apatow films) brilliantly uses the stale old ""American Pie"" format to illustrate the confusion and awkwardness of male teenagers when it comes to sex. Through all the hilariously crass dialog at the beginning, it becomes obvious that guys are taught by society to treat women like objects. This much is true. BUT, the movie is totally about seeing through the hype and having a real relationship.<br/><br/>By the end, Evan's character has his conscience win out and decides that a drunken night with the girl he has liked for years will only make things worse in the long run. In Seth's case, he admits that his quest to get a hot girl drunk enough to ""do"" him is only a result of his crushing personal insecurity, and not what he ultimately wants to happen. Even ""McLovin"" is redeemed by not being angry when his moment is interrupted. Instead he learns that even the ""super-cool cops"" were awkward losers in high school and there will be time later on for sex.<br/><br/>When they walk off together as normal (and virgin) teenage couples, it should be obvious that they chose healthy relationships over their original horny fantasies."

At this point, we're not even sure if we care to see the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>We are not religious, definitely not conservative, and we don't live in a small town -we're from Los Angeles. We have played on hockey teams since we were teens, are avid snowboarders, hit clubs, bars, gone to raves, and even experimented with mind-altering substances. In short, we've seen, heard, and experienced a lot in our teen, college, and post-college years- but yet we both thought this movie was raw, vulgar, and unfunny. The constant vulgar language didn't add to the movie and got old really fast, and it seemed like a weak attempt to get laughs.<br/><br/>I know they are trying to make it seem ""real"", no model-type actors, real situations, and I give them props for that, but I think the writing was very weak and the plot was just plain stupid. (And no, I'm not against random plot movies- my favorite movie is ""Friday"".) It seemed like they were trying to take a movie like ""American Pie"", but give it the shock factor of ""Kids"" or ""Bully""- which by the way were actually GOOD movies.<br/><br/>My co-workers were raving about this movie and saw it in the theater. I'm glad I waited until it was available On-Demand, but I still don't think it was worth the $3.99 I paid. In short, save your money for better newer movies, such as ""Knocked Up""."

I did not finish the movie as it was painful to watch. It's interesting to see where the actors and writers of this film are now, however. I enjoy Jonah Hill's acting when he stays away from these kinds of roles as is true of Michael Cera. I did not realize that Seth Rogen had written this until after I viewed it.

"MBunge","5","2","5","14 October 2010"," Definitely not super good
","This is an intermittently amusing teenage sex comedy that never knows when enough is enough. There are some genuine laughs here, but it's so long and so scattered and so over-the-top that it simply wears out its welcome.<br/><br/>Ostensibly the story of two high school friends faced with separation as they finish their senior years and will be attending different colleges in the fall, Superbad is really just a rising tide of dirty words, disgusting humor and awkward situations. Seth (Jonah Hill) is the fat friend who talks like he knows what's going on but lacks all but the most basic social skills. Evan (Michael Cera) is the quieter, nerdier friend who can safely interact with others but lacks the confidence to do so. When they're asked to get the booze for a big house party, Seth sees it as their chance to finally get laid and drags Evan along with him. They enlist the help of a third-wheel friend named Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and his bizarrely bad fake id to get the liquor but just about everything goes wrong that can go wrong, leading to two strange odysseys involving menstrual blood, property damage and sexual lubricant.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, this film pretends to be about how to inseparable friends have to face up the finally standing on their own in the world. Every so often the movie literally stops and has the characters explain this alleged theme to the audience. Honestly though, it's all just an excuse for bad language and bad behavior. If these filmmakers were actually interesting in telling this story, they wouldn't spend an enormous amount of screen time on a wish-fulfillment digression where uber-dork Fogell falls in with two cops (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) who act like bad improv comedians moonlighting as police officers.<br/><br/>However, if you like obscenities and outrageous acts, you'll find enough in Superbad to choke a horse. This is one of those films where its creative profanity and ""I can't believe they did that"" attitude is the main drawing point. I'll admit I laughed several times at that stuff, but after a while it got old and there's nothing else here to keep your interest.<br/><br/>Superbad would be a great movie to show during a party where everyone has a little bit of a buzz on and no one watches it for more than a few minutes before doing something else. Sitting through the whole thing sober is not that satisfying an experience."
"random_avenger","6","2","5","25 September 2010"," Superbad
","Even though in my opinion Judd Apatow's output as director and producer has been quite uneven, there are funny movies to be found in his body of work. His 2007 production Superbad directed by Greg Mottola tells the story of three high schoolers who are about to graduate in a few weeks. Wishing to have a great time before moving out to different colleges, Seth and Evan (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) manage to get themselves invited to a party hosted by girls they like, provided that they bring plenty of alcohol with them. Easier said than done; all their attempts at buying liquor go wrong in unexpected ways, leading to a series of more or less unfortunate events involving the duo's geeky friend Fogell, also known as ""McLovin"" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).<br/><br/>At first the movie doesn't seem too great; the crass sex dialog and obsession about getting wasted feel like they have been done in hundreds of high school movies already. Luckily the story picks up later on when the guys get their epic quest for booze started. The references to movies and other pop culture products are amusing and the funk and rock music on the soundtrack is very groovy, but the best jokes are delivered by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as the laid-back cops Michaels and Slater, who just won't let anything distract them from having a fun night while on duty. During the party scene at the end, the movie feels like it's again dragging and trusting the teen sex comedy clichés too much, but ultimately the ending turns out alright.<br/><br/>Rogen and Hader overshadow the main actors quite heavily, but I also liked Hill's performance as the chubby and superficially bold but secretly insecure Seth. Mintz-Plasse's Fogell learning to have fun 'in a manly way' is fairly amusing too. However, the other actors don't succeed quite as well; so far I haven't really been impressed by Michael Cera in the admittedly few roles I've seen him in, and Superbad is no exception. He just seems so uncharismatic that a movie based on his screen persona just isn't going to be very strong. The actresses playing the girls (Martha MacIsaac, Emma Stone et al.) don't manage to make their characters very memorable either. Still, the story's drama element about Seth and Evan's lasting friendship is alright and has its place in a movie like this, even if the adversities in their bromance come across as a bit by-the-numbers.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, Superbad shouldn't let down the fans of other Apatow productions, and there are many entertaining jokes for everyone else too; particularly Seth's penis drawings are pretty creative and worth seeing, if that kind of humour is your thing. The movie may not a comedic bullseye, but it's an adequately crass entertainer anyway."
"Electrified_Voltage","4","2","5","7 September 2010"," I like some of Judd Apatow's productions, but honestly don't get what's so great about this film!
","Released three years ago, this comedy was a huge hit, and I can't remember when I first heard of it, but it was a while ago. I was obviously in no hurry to watch it, but finally decided I was going to do so recently because of Michael Cera's co-starring role in it. This got me curious, since I had yet to see him in anything good, and could see that ""Superbad"" was a very popular comedy. Previously, I had seen Cera in ""Juno"" and ""Year One"", and while the former is far more popular than the latter, I was not impressed with either film. Still, since this R-rated 2007 comedy was such as massive success, I still intended to give it a chance, which I did. It seems most people who have seen this movie like it a lot, but I most certainly do not.<br/><br/>Seth and Evan are two unpopular high school friends who are nearing the end of their senior year and will be attending different colleges, meaning they will soon be separated. One day at school, their friend, Fogell tells them that he is getting a fake ID, meaning he can buy alcoholic beverages. Seth's love interest is Jules and Evan's is Becca, and after Fogell tells the two boys about his fake ID, they both promise their love interests that they will buy booze for a big party which they have surprisingly been invited to. With his new card, which says he is 25 years old, Fogell goes to the liquor store to make purchases, and almost succeeds before he is assaulted by a robber! When police arrive, they seem to fall for Fogell's fake ID, but when Seth and Evan see that there are police at the store, they think their friend has been busted! They soon find another way they can get booze for their party. While these two are on their mission that night, Fogell has a blast with the two incompetent cops he met at the liquor store, Officer Slater and Officer Michaels, who still seem to think he's 25 years old! <br/><br/>After seeing Michael Cera, who plays Evan here, in three movies, I've come to the conclusion that I don't like him as an actor. I can't remember exactly what I thought of his performance in ""Juno"" (though it certainly didn't stand out), but thought he was rather bad in ""Year One"", and didn't think he was any better in ""Superbad"". I haven't seen Jonah Hill (Seth) in any other lead role, but was not too impressed with his performance here, either. However, this movie's main problem is that it's usually not funny at all. Some parts did make me laugh, including Seth's rant to his Home Ec teacher and the questions Officer Slater and Michaels ask the liquor store cashier, but I usually kept a perfectly straight face. Watching the two main characters talk about sex, vaginas, penises etc. was boring, and there are a number of memorably lame parts, such as Seth talking about how he loved to draw penises as a kid and how he got in trouble for it, Francis (the guy who takes Seth and Evan to a different party where they can steal some alcohol) getting beaten up, Seth getting period blood on his pants, etc. The scenes with Fogell out with the two crazy cops also didn't usually amuse me. I also didn't care for the characters and thought the premise was pathetic, one about high school students on a mission to get liquored up underage and have sex.<br/><br/>Many modern comedies are extremely raunchy, and this 2007 release is definitely one of them. Don't get me wrong, I'm perfectly willing to laugh when this kind of comedy film is actually funny, like I did many times while watching ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", another Judd Apatow production, which I thought was VERY funny overall, and even the 2008 Apatow-produced ""Step Brothers"", as much as many people hate that film and probably have good reasons. However, I really don't think ""Superbad"" is very funny at all, even if most viewers would disagree with me. It's a lot like ""American Pie"", with a very similar premise, which is not a good thing, but I found this 2007 romantic high school comedy to be worse than that 1999 one, though they're both overrated. When I finally watched ""There's Something About Mary"" for the first time earlier this year, I thought it was perhaps the most overrated comedy I had ever seen, but that 1998 Farrelly Brothers hit may have just been topped!"

","WOW, this movie was so funny and well acted. It was so well written and honestly quite entertaining. I read many great comments about this movie and didn't get the time to watch it when it first came out, so one day I was just bored and decided to watch it on my CPU..it was great! I think that 3/4 of the people here who write negative comments on this movie either (A) have no sense of humor and then i completely understand, or (B) just don't like the actors in this movie. There are so many funny moments/scenes in this movie, and the characters are developed well and the jokes are target-on. It was funny because all of the F-bombs Seth (Johna Hill) was spilling out, same with Evans and Fogell aka McLoving. McLoving sold this sh*t hard, he was hilarious and big-ups to the officer (Seth Rogen)<br/><br/>This movie overall honestly explained a very typical time in high school whether it be your senior year or sophomore year. It is all about proving yourself to other in an attempt to either get laid or just fit in. Hands down one of the funniest movies of that year. As a rewatch 07/20/18' and multiple years later, Superbad remains a great and hilarious time watching comedy. Filled with many subtle jokes and clever gags that did not noticed on initial watch, the film has seemed to age well."
"GreySphinx","4","2","5","23 March 2009"," There's a total of about 30 minutes worth of good movie in there.
","Most negative reviews here complain about things like excessive profanity or the stupid and completely irrelevant dick story. Nevermind that; those were honestly the BEST parts of the movie! Unfortunately, that says a lot about the film as a whole.<br/><br/>For starters, the narrative is completely retarded. The reason I hesitated to see this movie for so long in the first place is because the premise was practically non-existent. ""Huh? Two guys in high school want to buy alcohol and get laid? They make Hollywood MOVIES about that kind of stuff nowadays?"" You know, it's sad... there are plenty of struggling writers out there who are pitching ideas based on new and imaginative concepts... giving the audience some credit, thinking they're expect fresh and imaginative ideas. Nope. Apparently the public actually wants to see a movie about the daily life of a horny teenager. What's next? ""Okay, okay, I totally have a killer idea... let's make a movie about a guy, right, who -- get this --- wakes up at 2pm every day, eats a few frozen pizzas, takes one good sh*t, watches some TV, and falls asleep masturbating to Internet porn. Killer, amirite??""<br/><br/>Second, the fact that the movie has almost no interesting plot means it has to rely on quirky characters and Tarantino-style quotable dialogue. Okay, so Jonah Hill is a pretty good re-incarnation of Chris Penn and Michael Cera, well, he's the quirkiest thing since Amelie. And that skinny third kid... come on, we've all had friends like that. So kudos on that department and they have quite a few flat-out hilarious scenes. If you wonder which ones I'm talking about, check the Notable Quotes section for this movie and it will be whichever scenes are quoted IN THEIR ENTIRETY.<br/><br/>But that's about it!... and it's not enough. I think what happened is Seth Rogen was having a drunken conversation with his friends one day, had some good laughs, and then realized that what just transpired was movie-scene worthy. So I think he started with a couple of funny scenes and then tried to shoehorn them into some painfully-generic plot just to get us from one joke to another (think Family Guy). I mean how else can you explain the hilarious albeit 100% UNNECESSARY AND IRRELEVANT dick-drawing story? Seriously, what point did that serve in the movie?? It came practically out of nowhere, accomplished nothing, and was never mentioned again. But hey, the audience laughed, and that's enough, right? Seth, there's a show called Robot Chicken based entirely on funny short scenes/clips. You'd do best writing for them.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and another thing Seth: write yourself a little cameo if you have to, don't give us a pain-inducingly annoying character midway into the movie. The movie pretty much jumped the shark the minute those two idiot cops showed up. They are introduced in what I thought was going to be another short humorous scene (and it was solid enough) but after that, they just don't go away! And you really want them to, but instead they become the worst and most tired running joke of the movie. Ehck.<br/><br/>In short, while a few of the scenes are really worth watching (on hulu.com or something), spending 2 hours is just way too much an investment."

It's almost like he's trying to hard to be a young Vince Vaughn with all the fast talk. The scene with the cops was far too long. I found myself texting way to often during this movie. I think this film would have been better with a little more editing and less of the Hill character. I did enjoy Mclovin when he wasn't around the cops.

","If you're going into this movie looking for a better version of the ""American Pie"" trilogy, stop right here. ""Superbad"" is not going to give it to you. Seth Rogen is one of the most overrated people in Hollywood and he can't really write. Thanks to Judd Apatow (a somewhat mediocre director/producer) and The Apatow Company's newly-found clout combined with the studio's publicity department, ""Superbad"" somehow did really well at the box office (as did the equally mediocre ""40 Year Old Virgin"", and the somewhat better ""Knocked Up"", thanks to good acting). <br/><br/>Not coincidentally, the two main characters of Superbad are named Seth and Evan (after Rogen and his writing partner Evan Goldberg.) Jonah Hill, playing Seth, couldn't act to save his life. For 2 hours, all he/his character does is rant and yell. Michael Cera, playing Evan, is a bit better, but not much. The men of the hour in ""Superbad"" are newbie Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fogel aka McLovin, and SNL's Bill Hader as Cop #2 (Seth Rogen plays Cop #1 - and he wisely trimmed his usual Cabbage Patch Kid hair for the role). Plasse plays the quintessential geeky high school misfit (who, like Finch of the American Pie movies, has a wild side that is uncovered over the course of the movie.) The best scenes are the ones with Plasse and Hader, particularly the great liquor store sequence - the chick who plays the cashier and the Mexican employee are EXcellent. The rest of the movie is filled with Kevin Smith-style filth (only the storyline is nowhere near as good as any of what's in Kev's films.) Nearly all of the humor is very forced and exaggeraged - a beautiful case in point being the party sequence where the tone-deaf Cera sings to a room full of coke addicts, and when Hill gets (oooh!) ""period blood"" on his pants while dancing with the fiancée of the guy throwing the party. I just about puked when the party guest put his finger on Hill's pants to see what that ""curious red stain"" was. YUCK. <br/><br/>Now, let's address the issue of the chicks. Could they have gotten two UGLIER, less-appealing girls to play Becca and Jules?! The actress who plays Jules almost seems lesbionic (not that that's a bad thing at all, but it was definitely miscasting.) <br/><br/>The best aspect of the film is the relationship of Seth and Evan, and how they deal with the impending separation as they go to different colleges. There are some touching moments - especially the ending. But other than that, plus the scenes with Hader and Plasse....""Superbad"" really doesn't cut it."
"tom-2606","6","2","5","16 February 2008"," Decent but not great
","Definitely not as funny as hyped. There were a handful of hilarious scenes, but overall pretty much the same adolescent humor one finds in all of Apatow's movies (and I am a fan of his movies). Not much new ground here.<br/><br/>McLovin was great and some of the other characters were really funny, but many of the scenes, especially the ones with the cops, were just boring filler. Also the writers seemed to be trying for a world record in profanity with every other word being the f-word or something similar. When writers use profanity in every line it shows they're just being lazy. Especially in this context, it works in a gangster movie, but not in a dumb teen comedy.<br/><br/>Lastly Apatow could use a better editor. All of his movies drag on for too long. This one was no exception. Overall a decent flick, but not great."

And of course the perfect comic timing by all the actors.<br/><br/>It also hits me how much they worked with details in this film. All the clothes and every set seems so well planned to fit in to the ""kinda 70-style, but still today"" atmosphere.

The first hurdle to take is the fact that they are under 21 and want alcohol really bad. More hurdles are to to be taken, so don't turn away just yet. And so the film starts and rolls on.

It could not have possibly dragged on any longer. 115 minutes of this? Dear GOD. The 30 something party was kind of funny, if you can recall ever being at a sketchy party like that. Afterwards, I decided to look it up on IMDb and am in total shock over the critical acclaim or how this can possibly be anywhere near the Top 250. Amazing."
"BJBatimdb","6","3","10","28 September 2007"," Funny in places - but needs its mouth washed out with soap
","I was a bit disappointed with this movie. The trailer was very funny. Unfortunately, they should have let the trailer-makers edit the movie because some of the lines and scenes that were so sharp in the trailer fell a bit flat in the film in their slightly longer versions. <br/><br/>Superbad would still be a superior movie to something like American Pie EXCEPT for the fact that it's just so pointlessly, grossly, disgusting in places. I KNOW these are high school kids; I KNOW they MAY talk like that to each other, BUT THAT ALONE DOESN'T MAKE IT FUNNY! A smart writer should be turning that foul-mouthed rubbish into something witty and insightful, not just repeating it verbatim. And having a running gag about a guy getting period blood on his leg is just not amusing unless you're drunk, under 16, or - apparently - a teen-flick maker in Hollywood today. Have some restraint, for god's sake guys!<br/><br/>I have to look at the common link with The 40-Year-Old Virgin - Judd Apatow. Like Superbad, that movie also really demeaned itself by indulging in some truly repulsive language and imagery early on, and therefore never really rose above that to be what it should - and could - have been: a clever, original, side-splitter. <br/><br/>Learn the lesson Judd - there are very few worthwhile comedies that can recover from the random, gratuitous and wholly unamusing use of the C word. After that point, the whole movie is always going to be scrambling to try to make up for itself."

Superbad is one of the funniest and greatest teen comedies of all time.There were times when my sides were hurting because I was laughing so hard, and that rarely happens.The film takes place in 1998.Evan and Seth are two lifelong friends who are about to be separated when they go to different colleges.Evan is calm and quiet while Seth is profane and obsessed with sex.The two never go to high school parties but they plan on it when they get invited to the last one before graduation by the girls that they are in love with.They get their friend Fogell who has a fake ID to buy them alcohol for the party,though his ID has a weird name on it(McLovin) he gets the booze but then the store he goes to gets robbed and these two cops come.Seth and Evan think Fogell got busted and go look for their own booze but end up at another party with some crazy people.Meanwhile Fogell and the cops go wild on a road trip.The whole movie shows the misadventures of the three and their attempt to get alcohol for the party.The trailer does not even come close to the hilarity of this film.If you like teen comedies, go watch Superbad now!"
"Chris Knipp","8","3","10","19 August 2007"," Revenge of the nerds: the next generation
","The starting point of this movie is a theme that's come up before--it's basic to Brian Robbins' silly and stupid but entertaining 'The Perfect Score' (2004): two best friends in high school are going to be separated because one got into a good college and the other didn't. As summer approaches a couple of the cool ""in"" girls ask them to supply the liquor for a party and they think they have one last chance to lose their virginity before they go away. <br/><br/>The friends are the bushy-haired and overweight Seth (Jonah Hill) and the taller, lean, silky voiced Evan (Michael Cera). They talk dirty, but they don't know what they're talking about. Mottola's low keyed road comedy 'Daytrippers' appeared nine years ago and he's since been working in TV. He's now joined the team of Judd Apatow, who produced the very popular '40-Year-Old Virgin' and the current big summer hit 'Knocked Up.' 'Superbad' partly grows out of the late nineties TV series Judd Apatow produced, ""Freaks and Geeks,"" of which Seth Rogen, star of 'Knocked Up' (and a cast member here), was an important part, as writer as well as actor. 'Superbad' is the brainchild of Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who conceived it together when they were in their early teens in Vancouver.<br/><br/>""Freaks and Geeks"" focused on a high school world where nothing was ever fair, where outcast status linked stoners and bad students and smart kids who weren't social -- as symbolized by the almost-romance between dumb dreamboat Daniel (James Franco) and the sensitive outcast and mathlete Lindsey (Linda Cardellini). ""Perfect"" guys and girls are who we'd like to identify with, and that's why big stars are so often gorgeous. But they aren't who we really are: ""perfect"" people aren't real.. In movies geeks and nerds usually aren't real either; they're stereotypes. But 'Superbad' gets away from that. Seth and Evan are a source of comedy, but they aren't unreal. They're just not aggressive like the campus macho men -- the types who're always beating up on undersized Sam (John Francis Daly), Lindsey's little brother in ""Freaks and Geeks,"" and who spit on Seth and warn him not to come to the cool girls' party. <br/><br/>Seth and Evan do plan on going to the party anyway, helped by their nerdy pal Fogell (hilarious newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who's just acquired a fake ID that says he's a 25-year-old organ donor from Hawaii named simply McLovin (no first name). Fogell's going to buy alcohol. The babes (AKA ""ladies,"" using the Player name) are going to get sloshed and get laid by mistake, and as Seth says, ""We could be that mistake."" Fogell gets clobbered at the liquor store by a holdup man, then taken in tow by two very wayward and unserious cops. Seth and Evan get mixed up with a dodgy guy who takes them to a more dangerous party. The way to the cool girls' party is as convoluted as Harry and Kumar's trip to White Castle. <br/><br/>'Superbad' isn't necessarily funnier than earlier teen or college comedies, the 'Harry and Kumars' and 'Dude Where's My Cars,' but it has a humanistic arc they lack. Like 'Knocked Up,' it leads off with a stream of foul language and winds up with sweetness and doing the right thing. It excels in celebrating the male friendships. It dares to speak of male love and depict it as something abandoned on the way to growing up, like Seth's drawings of penises--which he confesses to Ethan to having done obsessively as a little boy and which are shown in a phantasmagoric panorama in the middle and in the closing credits. The joke of these virgins locked in male-male bonding is that they can't deal with a babe when she throws herself at them. In a world of 40-year-old virgins it's no surprise Michael Cera was recruited from a TV series called ""Arrested Development."" Apatow says Seth Rogan really lives like the character he plays in 'Knocked Up.' <br/><br/>In its blend of dirty talk and sweetness Apatow's and his posse's comedies are something different for which the current audience is more than ready, and his productions are beginning to multiply like prairie fires. It's great the way Apatow keeps gathering contributors and remaining faithful to them, and lets actors improvise freely. This is likely to wind up being not just a body of work, but a new school of American screen comedy, not unlike earlier productions of the kind but more fertile, almost a rival to the Eighties youth movies. And this success is deserved. There's a movement and energy in 'Virgin,' 'Knocked Up,' and 'Superbad' that shows the team know what they're doing. It's not all perfection, however. 'Knocked Up' seems like wishful thinking on several levels, with the smart girl accepting the nerd; and why is abortion completely skipped over as an option?. The physical business in 'Superbad' is crude, and not really that funny; the cop sequence is pointless and false--it too, wishful thinking..<br/><br/>There is nothing sinister or revolutionary about the guys' language. It is a great exaggeration to think Seth & co. are so much more sophisticated or deviant in their sexual lore than earlier generations: society has just granted them license to use in public the bluntest language about what they, like their predecessors, still barely understand. But the language, post-Kevin Smith as it is, is a great source of relieved laughter. Something that was always there is now okay to speak about -- like two straight guys who love each other.<br/><br/>NOTES: I got some of my information about Apatow & Co. from Damon Wise's piece ""Crowning around"" in 'The Guardian,' August 11, 2007. 'Superbad,' by the way, has a terrific opening title with silhouettes of Evan and Seth dancing."

If you're a seventeen year old pervert, with not much intelligence, you'll LOVE this movie. It's just another curse-word-filled teen sex movies which drive me insane. How this movie made it onto the IMDb Top 250 is beyond me. Apparently if you make a movie with lots of cursing for no reason, and sex, you can make millions, because non-intellectuals out there (95% of the population) will drink it up, get drunk on it, and throw it back up.

"johnnyboyz","4","2","6","30 April 2009"," It would seem that what amuses most, disgusts me.
","I suppose it's not surprising Superbad has hit the nail on the head in certain circles and become so popular. Here is a film that takes the fears of a specific age-group and spins them around onto their heads by turning it all into comedy of the farcical nature. Young adults old enough to see it in Britain with its '15' certificate and 'R' certificate in The States are able to witness the things they're truly afraid of get moulded into acts of would-be pure hilarity for their own amusement as three hapless male individuals of varying size, stature and type are lumbered with the 'fall guy' tags.<br/><br/>But for everyone else, Superbad is exactly its title and anyone who thinks otherwise is either lying or trying to come across as one of those people who understands what the youth of today demand – that or, they've realised this is generic film-making and have smirked a few times; thus allowing a recommendation. In short, Superbad is complete garbage. Its passive approach and disgusting humour shouldn't really appeal to anyone older than 18; I mean, what goes through someone's mind when they're being treated to a montage of pencil drawn phallus' and thus, probably laughing their heads off? Incidentally, what goes through a screenwriter's mind when they presume everyone will find it funny in the first place? I'm not sure if it was the drawing of the phallus'; or the stained menstrual blood on the trouser leg; or the repetitive spitting onto people; or the alcohol-driven vomiting (which happens many times); or the visual re-enacting of sex acts behind a girl's back that disgusted me the most. Others will come away asking themselves which of the above they found funniest, and that is a frightening, frightening testament as to how low we may have sunk.<br/><br/>Superbad is the sort of picture that forces you to lower your self down a few notches as you try to comprehend these characters, their actions and their beliefs. If you're not down with the idea that 'girls exist purely to be slept with and ogled at' and that 'parties are the be all and end all of good recreational time spent' and that 'alcohol exists to be over-consumed', then you're simply not going to 'get' it. The film announces both its intentions and overall tone in a convenience store very early on. Two of the three leads in Seth (Hill) and Evan (Cera) mosey around, talking the usual trash talk to do with attempts at getting girls to sleep with them before the film pretty much lost me after five or so minutes. I am additionally surprised these people have even heard of people like Orson Welles and The Beatles.<br/><br/>The film's primary study is about trying to tap into fears and insecurities the sorts of people on display in the film might have. But do I think someone trying to buy alcohol whilst under-age is funny? No. Do I think gags about possessing condoms and lube is particularly worthy of a laugh? Not at all. Do I think the manner in which one character describes how he positions certain parts of his body within certain pieces of clothing at all humorous? No, no and no. Will the people that laugh now and give the people that write this junk their fame think it all that funny in years to come? Of course they won't.<br/><br/>So along with Even and Seth, the latter of whom spends the whole film shouting at everyone, you've got a guy called Fogell (Mintz-Plasse), whose alias 'McLovin' provides some of the film's more would-be non-sex or bodily function related gags, too bad none of the McLovin jokes are funny either. These three undergo a hapless night out which kicks off after the liqueur store Fogell is in trying to get drinks from is robbed and two of the most inept police officers you'll ever see, in a film, show up. Seth and Evan think he's been busted, Fogell goes on a brief night out with the cops and everyone gets involved in all sorts of slapstick nonsense.<br/><br/>The film is a brief and unwanted glimpse at what it was like to be a specific age during which nothing but the usual things on display here existed in your own universe. It is a sad take on a generation of males, all of whom are portrayed as they are in this piece. There is supposed to be some sort of social class antagonism unfolding, what with the banter about one person getting into a 'better' college than the other one but it isn't developed at all, whereas the 'frienship coming apart at the seams' narrative which opens up towards the end is limp and forced – I didn't fall for it in 2003's 'After School Special' and I'm not falling for it here. Superbad is a mess, made popular only by the youngsters hungry for another Kevin Smith (whom I additionally don't particularly like) inspired, crass take on youth life of a male in crisis and critics out for cheap laughs, whilst desperately attempting to seem 'down' with today's youth. It's the American version of 2004's Sex Lives of the Potato Men narrowed down into a 12 hour time-frame and with a little more talking about sex rather than indulging in such acts. Such a statement ought to be enough to steer anyone clear of this mess."

"bowmanblue","7","1","2","27 November 2018"," The clue is in the name ;o)
","I first watched 'Superbad' and I didn't like it much. In short: totally forgettable. It was only as the years went by did I realise quite how much of a 'cult following' it had, so I decided to give it another go. I have to say that it gets better each time I watched it. I can only assume I was in the mood for something a little more serious and 'high-brow' when I initially sat down. However, now I know what I'm getting, I'm quite happy to watch and rewatch it every few years. Think 'American Pie' only less intellectual!<br/><br/>It's difficult not to mention the (sort of) 'ground breaking' 'American Pie' film when talking about 'Superbad.' Any story that centres around young High School-age lads who are on a quest to - er - 'get better acquainted' with members of the opposite s3x in a short period of time, will always draw comparisons with the 'Pie' franchise. Here, we have three boys (Jonah Hill as 'Seth,' Michael Cera as his best mate 'Evan' and Christopher Mintz-Plasse stealing every scene as 'Fogell' (or rather 'McLovin' I should say). They are the archetypal nerds who never really know what to say around girls and are reduced to working out ways to 'trick' the fairer s3x into liking them during a graduation party before they all leave for college (that's 'University' to us Brits!).<br/><br/>Naturally, their plot doesn't go to plan and what follows is everything from singing (badly!) in front of drug dealers, to throwing Molotov cocktails at police cars - so you typical night out when you were about 18. It's all in very bad taste and if you're in any way offended by s3xual-related gags, swearing and generally 'adult' situations and humour then you should stay well clear. However, if you're in the mood for something pretty low-brow then you'll definitely find it here.<br/><br/>I liked the relationship between Seth and Evan. Yes, it's hard to make stereotypical 'nerds' that different from any other depiction you've already seen, but they certainly have chemistry and you do feel as if they would be the type to hang out together in real life. They're flawed and not totally 'heroic,' but then aren't we all? In short - they're relatable. However, as I mentioned it's Christopher Mintz-Plasse who is the real star of the film. His character gets separated from the other two early on and has his own little adventure with a couple of... well, not exactly corrupt, but also hardly 'untouchable' police officers, played by Seth Rogan and Bill Hader. Somehow, everything about this completely mismatched pairing of cops and nerd works and is a true joy to behold. As I eluded to, it helped cement 'McLovin' as a term/name we all know and love.<br/><br/>Personally, for me 'Superbad' is up there with those few films that I really didn't like on first watch and yet I totally changed my opinion after time ('Anchorman' is another, curiously). I'm not sure if this experience resonates with anyone else, but all I can say is that it's dumb, rude and - yes - super 'bad' ('bad' being slang for good in today's youth - so I'm told)."

But the comedy used in the film made me really hope that what is seen in their high school doesn't happen in real life and hopefully not all teens are like these two.

College boys fixated on sex, asked to get alcohol by gorgeous girls for a party, followed by an hour of Laurel and Hardy pratting around, running around the city, cocking things up. Well, that's all there is to it.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, but the idea that idiotic dorks, drooling immaturely every ten minutes over stunning girls who are out of their reach, who actually turn out to be good guys who get the girl in the end, doesn't really work.

"samseescinema","4","3","12","20 August 2007"," Superbad has the feeling of being absolutely effortless
","Superbad reviewed by Samuel Osborn<br/><br/>Like Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad has the feeling of being absolutely effortless. It's a Judd Apatow requirement maybe that no joke should be choked out by its characters. Honesty and chemistry seem to be the only ingredients to his enormously profitable formula. He sits in the Producer's chair for Superbad, letting Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg use their ten year old script and Greg Mottola direct it. But Apatow has ushered in his own era of comic productions in Hollywood. They're low-brow in their premises but entirely human and wholly sincere in their execution. Superbad is no different, pulling focus on two outcasts trying to wiggle somehow into the exclusive social hierarchy of high school before they scoot off into their separate lives at college. Girls are their only concern and like the boys of American Pie, Seth and Evan are looking only to get laid. <br/><br/>The simplest way to explain Seth and Evan (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) is to say they would have no problem getting along with the stoner Ben from Knocked Up and the sexless Andy from The 40 Year Old Virgin. Molded too awkwardly to exist normally in the social world, these characters are forced into situations far outside their comfort zone. Here Seth, Evan, and their twice nerdy friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) are asked to score the alcohol for a party that evening at Jule's house, Seth's big crush. Depending on the fact that Fogell somehow has obtained a phony I.D., they boast that they can buy the girls whatever they want; that they do this thing all the time when, in fact, they've never set foot in a liquor store. It doesn't help that Fogell's I.D. claims that he's a 25 year old Hawaiian named McLovin. And as any teenager knows, finding alcohol is never a simple task. <br/><br/>The boys' shenanigans drive them deep into the night and late to the party, but glorious in their possession of alcohol for their underaged peers. These peers, thankfully, actually look like their peers. By this I mean that the extras and peripheral characters look believably under the age of twenty-one. I'm so tired of muscled, bearded thirty-somethings posing as bodacious high schoolers. The students here are entirely convincing as real live students. <br/><br/>The funny thing about effortlessness is that rarely is it in fact effortless. But the effort involved is so well masked that we accept it as something easy and natural. Like the previous Apatow concoctions, casting and scripting are the main players; minutely calibrated to bubble up a critical mass of on-screen chemistry for the actors to play with. Jonah Hill from previous Apatow films and Michael Cera of ""Arrested Development"" fame are superb choices as Seth and Evan. Director Greg Mottola handles Mr. Rogen and Mr. Golberg's script adroitly and manages to funkify what could have been a pop-music mood, bringing in music from the Bar-Kays, Rick James, Curtis Mayfield and The Roots. The result is a swell continuation of Apatow and his crew's success. <br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"

","After watching such great movies as ""Crazy Stupid Love"" and ""The Help"", I recently became a huge fan of actress Emma Stone.

I watched ""Easy A"" and still was impressed, so I decided to take a gander at ""Superbad"", as I am up for a ""teen loser comedy"" every once in awhile. The verdict? A complete and utter waste of time.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Superbad"" sees two teenage losers played by Michael Cera & Jonah Hill trying to party it up together one last time before heading to different colleges after graduation. Typical teen hijinks involving sex, drugs, alcohol, and cops ensue.<br/><br/>The trouble with this movie is that it doesn't add anything new to its genre. There is nothing I saw here that I haven't seen in other similar flicks. While it is billed as ""from the creators of Knocked Up & The 40 Year Old Virgin"", this film can't hold a candle to either of those efforts. It is extremely vulgar, incredibly crude, and the jokes really aren't even all that funny. At it's core, this is a gross-out movie trying to pass itself off as something more (which it isn't).<br/><br/>Thus, if you came here for Emma Stone (like I did), it isn't worth it in the slightest.

The American Pie series is targeted at retards so when a film delivers realistic characters in a sub-genre where writers don't even bother to make the effort people freak out. I'm sure that Seth Rogen would be the first to tell you that Superbad has no business being rated higher than Children of men. Every generation needs a film to define it's youth and I guess this one is it. Too bad that it was written ten years ago."

","Hilarious and smart teen comedy, without a doubt one of the funniest of the year. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill play two high school seniors who are best friends. When invited to a cool chick's party, they try to get their über-geeky friend, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, to use his fake ID (on which he is now infamously renamed ""McLovin"") to get them some alcohol. From there, everything goes awry. It's really a laugh-a-minute movie. The previews and commercials ruined a few of the best jokes, but there is no shortage of laughs anywhere in the movie. It also manages to be fairly touching, without devolving into schmaltz (a problem that the film's producer Judd Apatow has yet to solve in his own films). The awkward dialogue is wonderfully convincing, and completely recalled high school for me. Very enjoyable, and one that I hope to enjoy very often in the future."

","This is a bad imitation of 70's and 80's teen party films. Ironically they used some great tunes from that era as background. <br/><br/>In one scene Bill Hader (as police officer) whacks the high school bully in head with baton and makes fun of the bullie's hairstyle saying, ""Nice Mullet,(expletive)!"". The bullie's (long, straight, pony tail) hair style was NOT a ""mullet"" (a style Rick Springfield and Lionel Richie made popularin the 80's). <br/><br/>Michael Cera, is expressionless, unsexy, can't sing, and lacks energy. How did he get the lead?! Jonah Hill played his role well as did Christopher Mintz-Plasse as the geeky friend. I hear he's like that in real life. This genre goes all the way back to ""American Graffiti"" and the ""Porky's"" series. This attempt falls flat because of some bad casting and several lame gags and story lines. <br/><br/>The whole inept-police-partners schtick is not very funny because Seth Rogan and Bill Hader don't have the physical comedy chops. The film doesn't hold up to an ""American Pie"" or a ""rat pack"" movie like ""Wierd Science"" or ""Pretty in Pink"" or ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"". This has too much criminality and not enough funny."

","Ah, to be young and free. It was a simpler time when the pursuit of booze and babes was enough to drive a young man right through to adulthood. Alright, so this wasn't my personal youth experience but it is the premise of director Greg Mottola's SUPERBAD, a new breed of teenage sex comedy. Here, partying and getting naked with girls are exposed as a thinly veiled act of desperation to prove how grown up one is. The kids are speeding down a hill, screaming their excitement to the sky, but can see that they are also getting closer and closer to everything they're afraid of, waiting for them at the bottom. Before they know it, high school will be over and Seth and Evan (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera), best friends since they were five, will find themselves going in separate directions to different colleges. While one raucous night finds them trying to score alcohol to impress the girls they each want to get with, it is what they learn about each other, their futures and themselves that will end up defining the night they thought would simply be the night they got some.<br/><br/>Whether Seth and Evan are trying on pants and debating what exactly is ""too tight"" or discussing the injustices of men having to hide their erections in shame from the rest of the world while buying drinks at the corner store, they are always hilarious. You could put these two in practically any scenario and the laughs would flow. They are drastically different but compliment each perfectly. Seth is loud and foul. Nearly every thought that comes out of his mouth is about sex and he is completely oblivious to the world around him. Meanwhile, Evan is mild mannered and meekly composed. He is constantly muttering sarcastic quips that most don't hear and is acutely aware of his surroundings. The two are inseparable but one gets the impression their friendship is based more on its history than what they have in common. One thing they do have in common though is awkwardness. While one covers up his insecurity with obnoxious remarks and the other barely hides it at all, they both have each other to be themselves with. The beauty of their performances lies in the conveyance of the recently rising knowledge that the friendship that makes them feel safe is also now the friendship that is stopping them from going any further.<br/><br/>Written by KNOCKED UP star, Seth Rogen and long time friend, Evan Goldberg, SUPERBAD is at times genius in its subtlety. This is no easy feat considering how outrageous it is most of the time. Loosely basing Seth and Evan on themselves (sorry fellas but the names give it away), they manage to pinpoint the moment these boys become aware of their co- dependence. The two characters are so well drawn that you never want them to leave the screen. Only they do to make room for a third friend, Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Fogell is somehow even more socially retarded than Seth and Evan and is himself a funny enough secondary character despite his entire existence being based on one-off joke that is given away in the preview (McLovin!). It is the direction his character takes the film in that is an unnecessary distraction. Fogell/McLovin spends his night riding around in the back of a police cruiser with two of the worst police officers ever to walk the beat (played by Rogen and Bill Hader, whom I would sooner never see on film again). The cops are such screw-ups that all they do is make every scenario they're in worse than it was before they got there. With most of their humour falling flat and not coming close to measuring up to Seth and Evan, they have a similar effect on the film itself. Filler is rarely fun and here it exposes the writers' insecurity regarding their own abilities.<br/><br/>So this is the story of how Seth Rogen is both his best friend and worst enemy at the same time. Alongside Goldberg, the two have stated publicly how they never want to grow up. While that gives them a particular insight into the pivotal crossroads Seth and Evan, the characters, find themselves at, it also makes SUPERBAD, a movie about maturity which is meant to be immature at times, less mature than it actually should be. For the most part, SUPERBAD is surprisingly mature, while still maintaining its youthful glow. Seems to me that Seth and Evan, the writers, could stand to learn a thing a two about evolution from the characters they created in their own image. Growing up isn't all that bad and it can still be freackin' hilarious."

","I saw Superbad yesterday with my boyfriend, I have to say that I was absolutely not interested in seeing Superbad, it seemed like just a typical Revenge of the Nerds type of film that would probably have some lame jokes. But I wanted to see it with an open mind, so I thought just to let go and have fun. This also seemed like it would be a cult classic down the line somewhere. Superbad starts off as it would seem to be another American Pie type of film where it's nothing but sex jokes that could at times be a little obnoxious, I was giving up hope, but then Superbad quickly picked up and turned out to be overall a great movie that is sure to be another teen sex comedy classic.<br/><br/>Seth and Evan are two high school boys who are about to go their separate ways after graduation. They are pretty much the losers of the school and are dying to get an awesome reputation as well as a couple of hot girls. Seth gets invited to his crush's party, but when he mentions his friend, Fogell, is getting a fake ID and now he is the one who has to get the liquor. Well, Fogell gets the ID, his name is now McLovin' and is supposedly 27 years old(even though he looks like he couldn't be more than 12 years old), he manages to get away with buying the liquor, but right at the worst moment, the place gets robbed and now he has two cops who just wanna party with him. In the mean time Seth and Evan are on their own and end up at a gangsta's party where they get in big trouble trying to get alcohol, but it's a question if they can make it to the party and still be the awesome guys that made the party a memorable one.<br/><br/>Superbad is a great movie and one of the best comedies of the year, no doubt. McLovin' and the cops truly made this movie memorable and had such great chemistry. I really loved their scene where the cops want to ""make it up to McLovin'"" and drag him out of the party like he was a wild animal. You'll see what I mean when you see the film. The film starts off kind of stupid, but really warms up and ended up being a great film to watch. I can't wait for the DVD, I would recommend you seeing this film if you are looking for a great comedy.<br/><br/>7/10"

","The problem is simple. This movie has been being reviewed for a while now and everyone said the same thing, how hilarious it was. The truth is that is a funny movie, no doubt, and a lot of the humor here has not been used before, which made it fresh and original. However, as I felt it started off with a bang, it just slowed as it went along. A lot of the jokes take a huge setup and fall very flat. Its not that there bad ideas, they just don't feel like they were executed that well. I honestly believe that reading all the reviews made me not enjoy this as much and really just hyped it too hard.<br/><br/>But by no means is it bad. It was funnier than most movies nowadays and different. My favorite parts about these guys were how real they were. I loved it when they finally get to the party they've been trying to get to all night, and still have enough in them to have a great time. Seth is a jokester and the life of the party and Evan plays the nice guy but not a nerdy guy perfectly. These true to life moments really made this film for me and reminded me so much of my high school life. And for that I gave the movie a 7.<br/><br/>All in all, it's definitely worth seeing and you should enjoy, just don't overload your expectations cause you might be disappointed. In my opinion, Knocked Up was the funnier of the two."

","Bill Hader and Seth Rogen were undoubtedly the funniest thing about the film. You know you're in for a laugh once they're in front of the camera...which is why the movie would have been better off evolving around them instead of the three annoying teens. If you want to see Michael Cera funny, watch him in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, now that's an amusing role. But in Superbad, he's actually more embarrassing than funny. Even more so is Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Jonah Hill was supposed to be the funniest of the three, which he was, but I just didn't feel the script had much to offer him. They were funny once in awhile, luckily not completely devoid of funny lines, but you know there's something wrong when the supporting roles are way more funnier than the lead roles in a comedy film.<br/><br/>Better than your average teen/comedy movie, but not as funny as people claims it to be, though - Moose finds this film worthy of an 8."
"imdbbl","Null","1","3","25 September 2010"," Not superbad but definitely not that great either
","Superbad came out over 3 years ago but I guess it's better to watch something later then to never watch it. I heard a lot about and it is clearly THE film that launched Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, Emma Stone and it kinda revamped the comedic genre and gave super stardom status to Judd Apatow, who served as producer.<br/><br/>It revolves around two co-dependent high school seniors (Hill and Cera) who set out to score alcohol for a party, believing that girls will then hook up with them and they will be ready for college. But as the night grows more chaotic, overcoming their separation anxiety becomes a greater challenge than getting the girls.<br/><br/>To tell the truth, I was a bit disappointed by Superbad. Maybe disappointed isn't the right word because I wasn't expecting something that great, after all, great comedies are few and in between but since there was so much talk about it and since it was so well received by the critics, I was expecting something at least one notch above most comedies.<br/><br/>Now, I'll admit that Superbad has some truly hilarious moments but these are undermined by the usual raunchy jokes and the very flimsy story lines. When it works, it really works but when it doesn't, it stinks. For instance, the bit with the 2 cops, played by Bill Hader and Seth Rogen was so silly, so over the top, it just wasn't funny at all and worst then that, it went on for way too long. The acting was actually pretty good, and the entire cast did a good job with Jonah Hill really standing out.Now, don't get me wrong, Superbad is a perfectly nice film to watch if you want to have a laugh but it is far from having reinvented the genre.<br/><br/>6/10"

They have another friend named Fogull who has a fake ID which they plan to use to buy alcohol to take to a party where they hope to have sex before they go to college.<br/><br/>The two main characters are good. Seth is your basic loud fat guy who gets worked up pretty easy. PRetty funny character actually. Evan is your typical more easy going goody goody skinny guy who thinks things out more.<br/><br/>Now for Fogull. I really could not stand this character. He is a total nerd who when he speaks he makes me want to punch him. Totally obnoxious character and I really truly hate this character and whenever he is on screen.<br/><br/>There are some major flaws with this film. For one, these two police men pick up Fogull and then take him around to different bars which does not add anything to the plot in my opinion. Basically they just want to give reasons for Fogull and them to be on screen. These two police officers are not funny at all and they really drag out a lot of lame jokes.<br/><br/>Also the ending to this film does not bring everything together. If anything it leaves the door open for a sequel which would not really surprise me if it would be made. However watching this film for me at the end of it did not feel like a complete ending.<br/><br/>I must say the highlight of the film as far as being the most funny is when Seth reveals his childhood problem of how he would draw a part of the male anatomy in different styles of pictures. Pretty creative.<br/><br/>SO there are some funny parts but a lot of lame and annoying characters which detract from the film. Also the ending is bad.

Nowhere. A teen sex comedy is a teen sex comedy, period. This movie goes way too far in its desperate attempts to sway the viewer into thinking it's something deeper. It isn't. It's a parade of unlikable teenagers on a quest for booze and sex with a nice little moral at the end to make us feel like we weren't wasting our time. At least the aforementioned movies didn't kid themselves about their intent.<br/><br/>This isn't a terrible movie, but it's certainly not very good. There are a few genuine laughs along the way.

","""Superbad"" works very well primarily due to its realistic, not overly simplified main characters (talking about the adolescents here), and in particular as a result of the spot-on casting. The photography and the script are very good, too. This comedy succeeds in the washed-up teen genre because it has great acting, mostly convincing, colourful dialogue, and for the most part avoids the kind of overly goofy, animated buffoonery that is the hallmark of teen-movie rubbish such as ""Animal House"" and ""American Pie"".<br/><br/>The only criticism I have is that the film falls apart a bit in the last half-hour, which seems to be a disease that befalls just about every (U.S.) comedy: the ""I love you"" dialogue between the two male leads was embarrassing, unfunny and unrealistic. The other (minor) problem is the cop pair: they're funny early on, but by the time the two hit Seth with their car, they'd already become too exaggerated, too lacking in credibility in a movie that doesn't require that kind of nonsense to get laughs. The laid-back, unforced dialogue works better than some of the more visual gags.<br/><br/>The stand-outs are the fat kid, McLovin, and Emma Stone who plays Jules. Emma is drop-dead gorgeous and utterly charming, making her flirtation(?) with Seth all that much more absurd hence interesting."

However, behind the pervasive crudeness there's an inventive story that will keep you entertained with all of the twists and turns that it throws at you. There's even an actual point to the story, neatly wrapped up in the closing scene. Not your usual sex comedy, to be sure.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have excellent chemistry together and can also carry the story on their own when called upon. Also particularly memorable are the police officers played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. There are no mis-steps in casting, which is a 'make it or break it' area for any comedy.<br/><br/>I can't recall much that was noteworthy about Greg Mottola's direction but there were a few nice touches. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is a real high point. It's filled to the brim with vintage funk and rock, well-chosen throughout.<br/><br/>But the most important thing about this film is that it's often hilarious.

","Seen this for the second time this week tonight and it still held up brilliantly. Both times, I have literally had sore jaws from laughing and smiling so much and tonight I actually laughed more than I did the first time, mainly because the characters are so believably funny and entertaining in the way they have been written. The only thing that bogged down the film for me -and I can't believe it- was that it focused at times, too much on dialogue that failed to move the plot along or the characters. Sometimes it was like watching a conversation going very slowly from start to beginning, but flapping its wings very intensely, so much so that it gets tiresome. This, and just a lack of that special something is what makes the film a high 9 rather than perfect 10.<br/><br/>This aside though, Superbad is a fantastic comedy and hails up there amongst the best contemporary comedies to grace the silver screen. I recommend this to everyone... well maybe not everyone, but for anyone looking for a series of relentless laughs on the most touchy of subjects revolving around memorably written characters, this is for you."

However rating this movie as if it's an all time classic makes me doubt the integrity of the so called ""professional"" critics. It's a typical high school movie.

","I mean, it's not the worst comedy ever made, but Superbad is incredibly overrated. Go ahead. Mark this comment as not useful. It won't change the fact that I find Seth Rogen to be utterly annoying and, most importantly, not funny.<br/><br/>The story itself is standard, focusing on the (not entirely true) reasoning that when kids go at parties, they drink, and when they drink, they get laid. <br/><br/>The script makes an effort in innovating in vulgar language, sex references and dick jokes, yet, it doesn't really focus on the most important aspect of a comedy: being funny. The scenes with the cops and McLovin are boring and drag for too long and they go around in circles, not really going anywhere. The only moral from that particular subplot is that hanging out with cops is cool.<br/><br/>As for the main storyline, most of the story is a bromance with very little fun factor. However, I did enjoy the ending, which had a clearer and more interesting lesson. But the somewhat comedic numbers don't feel natural or sincere, and they're not even over the top nor slapsticky enough to steal some primal chuckles.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the movie doesn't have its moments (the Thai last name ""Phuck"" was hilarious), but these are so in between mean jokes, mumblecore dialogue and boring drama, that you don't really enjoy it. The entire sequence with Seth and Evan at a college party is painfully realistic as how horrible some college folk are with minors, and thus, not enjoyable.<br/><br/>For this movie to be considered ""generational"" is rather scary. Again, it's not ghastly, but I honestly expected something better. And, no matter how much some will hate me for saying this, Seth Rogen sucks."
"francescabaines","Null","1","4","20 April 2009"," Possibly the best comedy I've ever seen
","I got this film on DVD a month or two back, and it's now one of my favourites. It's so funny. Seth, Evan, Fogell (""Mclovin"") and the two police cops were hysterical. The other minor characters that appeared throughout the whole film had their moments as well. There was a particularly gross-out scene (but with hilarious if crude reactions) and a couple of dodgy references, but in all, it was very enjoyable and I could easily watch again. <br/><br/>If you're feeling rather down, just watch this and it'll cheer you up. It certainly did that for me. <br/><br/>I'll give this a 9/10 overall"

","When I first saw the trailers for Superbad, I thought ""Oh great, yet another American Pie."" And I wasn't too wrong; it's crude, it's rude and it's about teenagers. But instead of making the same old jokes about having sex with mothers, or listening to RUN DMC, this film branches out and through the medium of graphic verbal detail of the female anatomy, this film is brutally honest - much like Clerks was. In truth, we all talk like Seth or Evan in one way or another, or we all think like them at least. From describing the woes of erections in class, or the fact that your last girlfriend had a perfect ""upper body"" makes you liable for a lesser quality girl in the future. I could honestly relate to everything those guys said. Needless to say, Superbad is not for everyone. It is definitely a guy's movie. You wouldn't take a girl to this film for your first date, unless you knew she'd like it. Even then, there would be a couple awkward moments, like debating the Oedipus Complex over lunch.<br/><br/>In summary, Ferris Beauller's Day Off defined our desire to get one on ""the man"" before we got too old, the Breakfast Club defined our angst against our superiors and Superbad defines our desire to Party Hard and the teenage sexual psyche. This film, at any cost, should be remembered.<br/><br/>And to add a spoiler for the review, Van Halen plus a burning cop car equals the most awesome thing EVA!!1"

","Seth Rogen and friends have made some good movies but I think they really outdid themselves with this one. I don't see them ever making a movie this funny and this enjoyable again. Maybe close, but not like this one. I feel like it really speaks for our generation way better than movies of the 90s did. The characters are lovable and we can easily relate to them. They actually seem like kids instead of adults playing kids. We see them learn about themselves and grow on screen. They also all have their own humor. I think Jonah Hill is very genuine in this movie and I can't get enough of him. Michael Cera is just so awkward you can't help but both laugh and cringe as you watch him, it's great. There are some other hilarious performances. Actually, just about everyone who we see on the screen adds to the essence of this movie. One of the best teen movies/comedies ever. I suggest that everyone give it a chance and enjoy it as much as me and my friends do."
"varundelpiero","7","1","4","26 January 2009"," Apatow Productions strikes comedic gold yet again
","To classify SUPERBAD as a teen sex comedy is to do a fresh and funny film a great disservice. SUPERBAD, helmed by Greg Mottola of the Apatow gang, while creating a funny and somewhat raunchy (but not over-the-top) comedy with numerous laughs, manages to bring the characters into the focus and keep them there; not an easy task for a movie of this kind.<br/><br/>Michael Cera's deadpan and sarcastic approach to his character never seems to get stale, and Jonah Hill provides the ultimate opposite, forming a dynamic and funny duo. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is perhaps the most hilarious of the three, as the now infamous McLovin. Seth Rogen is also quite good as the dysfunctional police officer. My biggest gripe here is that the film is too long for its nature (~110 minutes). A more stern film editor may have opted to omit some more superfluous scenes involving the police officers, while concentrating more on the central duo/trio.<br/><br/>SUPERBAD is meant to bring back high-school memories to persons of any age who have had similar experiences, and does so in a relatively tasteful and nostalgic manner, getting most of the key elements right. Not quite comedic genius, but more of a coming-of-age tale. Comedy itself is rather subjective in nature, and a lot will undoubtedly depend on the viewer. Another gem from the Apatow gang. A solid 7/10 and 3 stars (out of 4). Should just about appear in my Top 300 at 277. Recommended."

You take your average teen flick about the geeks of a high school during last days of their senior year trying to get laid before they head off to college. Yes a tried and true formula. It probably gets a few laughs. But this movie adds the weird and surreal twists into plot that makes the jokes a 100 times funnier. I couldn't guess where the movie was going and I didn't see the jokes coming. I laughed out load (LOL for real) about 30 times. The real strength of the movie is the three main characters.

","One of the few movies in general that I not only had to see the weekend it came out in theatres, but also had to buy on DVD and watch numerous times over and over again, many times with friends.<br/><br/>It's truly a comedic masterpiece, but not in the stupid, mindless way most films about teenagers are. It's funny because people can really relate to the characters, either seeing themselves or their friends in them. The acting in it is amazing, it introduced a whole new generation of quality comic actors, most notably Michael Cera, whose role as Evan is sweet, charming, and endearingly awkward. However, the audience favorite--admittedly, mine too--was Christopher Mintz-Plasse as McLovin, the ubergeek who infiltrates the adult world by essentially being in the right place at the wrong time. The comedic timing, however, is immaculate. Superbad is worth watching...over, and over, and over again. I also recommend getting the extended version DVD, because the extended features are almost as hilarious as the movie itself."

Sorry people but this is not a very good movie, and anyone who thinks it is 'hilarious' has a very simple sense of humor and is easily amused.

Otherwise, if you have a functioning brain, this movie is just stupid and a waste of time.

"luke-346","7","1","4","14 January 2008"," A new breed of teenage comedy! One of 2007's finest!
","Every now and then Hollywood tends to knock out a comedy about teenagers that causes a stir, ruptures a spleen and sticks with a certain generation, whether it be ""Animal House"","" Porky's"" or ""American Pie"" and 2007's offering is no different. Superbad is quite possibly the funniest film of last year. It continues the tired theme of young men talking about getting ""laid"" and being sex crazed, adolescents pining for alcohol, nerds being singled out by bullies, girls as sex objects and figures of authority being outrageously stupid. Whilst championing the stereotyped desires of your average male pubescent Superbad utilises coarse antics and dirty language to great comedic effect with its well written characters and illogical dialogue. The average film goer will know this type of film inside out and I believe, this time, that to be acceptable as comedies of this nature need to rely on audience preconceptions in order to maintain a good level of comicality. Films like this help to prove that originality isn't necessary and that sometimes reinvigorating well worn ideas with modern themes can be a good thing - and it is not often noted in comedies as being so (more so sub-horror genres).<br/><br/>Providing you switch off and ignore the lack of ethnic characters, its sexual stereotyping and its general societal inaccuracies then you will enjoy this film - or you could pretend that you're 15 and phrases like ""sexual stereotyping"" aren't even on your radar yet. Ultimately Superbad isn't new, it isn't a film that pushes boundaries or reinvents the genre Â– instead it is a film that complements its contemporaries and brilliantly so. It is no surprise that this film did so well with teenage audiences and that so many adults found it repulsive."

It's all the more stunning since that story - three losers try to get laid before they go to collage - is as old as Catherine Zeta-Jones' husband. Still, the script is fresh and funny. Vulgar at some times but it never crosses the line to getting annoying. The actors are great (especially Rogen himself who shines as a member of an extremely idiotic cop team) and make the characters come alive.

Newcomer Mintz-Plesse steals the show, he brings some of the picture's best laughs. He is extremely likable out-through the film. This comedy was one of the biggest hits in the summer of 2007 and the reviews were surprisingly good for this kind of film. ""Superbad"" could have been a really bad movie if they didn't have the right director for the coming of age comedy. But Mottola's does an fine job with his second film, which he cares enough for the characters in the movie by making them as real as possible with memorable roles.<br/><br/>The Single Disc DVD Version of the ""Unrated"" Cut is actually four minutes longer than the R-Rated Theatrical Cut.

Michael Cera, whom you probably know from the sexually frustrated teenager in love with his cousin in 'Arrested Development', is equally as good and does a nice job of displaying his acting talents. The rest of the cast is all great including Seth Rogen, Bill Hader, Emma Stone and of course the actor who played McLovin who was a constant scene-stealer.

"DICK STEEL","9","1","4","17 October 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Superbad
","Superbad is Supergood!<br/><br/>Many have been lauding high accolades on this teen comedy to be the best thing since American Pie, and guess what, it's true! Before you roll your eyes at yet another teenage and/or sex comedy, with desperate nerds hatching diabolical plans to get laid, Superbad comes across as a breath of fresh air really, given that it has a cast of unknowns, thus free of any expectations to deliver, which thankfully it does.<br/><br/>What it doesn't have in raunchy sex scenes, it more than makes up for with its trash talking, especially from loud mouthed Seth (Jonah Hill), who has possibly the best lines in the movie, though coming close to a scene stealer is Christopher Mintz-Plasse's Foggell aka McLovin with his uber-nerdish demeanour. Together with Evan (Michael Cera), the trio play best friends who, being nerds, have only one another to hang out with, until they get themselves invited to a party only through providing the false hope that they can deliver the booze.<br/><br/>And the trio branches off into two story arcs before converging for the finale, when Seth and Evan left Fogell to fend for himself when the latter goes for the jugular at a booze shop. It's difficult to judge which of the two arcs was funnier, though I'd go for Fogell/McLovin's as it had the inclusion of two zany beat cops played by Bill Hader and Seth Rogen (from Knocked Up), and it has some of the most insane scenes with the antics that these two cops can conjure. Seth and Evan's storyline however centered more on the dramatic aspects of two friends facing the prospect of separation after graduation, and leaned extremely close to homo-eroticism at certain points. But I digress, it did have a definite hilarious scene in a party they gatecrash, which involves, what else, bodily fluids in the most unexpected of manners.<br/><br/>But it's not as vulgar as you think it is, save for gratuitous pictures of the penis in all shapes, sizes, forms, with a limit only the imagination can put a finger (heh) to. It's akin to oral sex - that is, the extremely rapid fire use of the F-word - with attempts at actual horizontal action constantly doused with cold water. The gems are in the dialogue and in both Jonah Hill's and Christopher Mintz-Plasse's fleshing of their characters. To top it off, it actually had quite a coherent story, and an ending which you can read either way, and it'll still work.<br/><br/>Fused with plenty of physical humour, crass dialogue and plenty of rude pictures (stay while the credits roll), Superbad will definitely bring out the guffaws, one way or another. Oh, and watch out for that super-retro opening credits too!"
"carlinop","10","1","4","6 October 2007"," Great Movie and Great Comedy
","If you have not seen this film yet, your life is missing another great comedy along with many of Judd Apatow's productions. This movie has one of the funniest scenes in movie history dating back further then the Marx Brothers.<br/><br/>This upbeat new age teen comedy really speaks to what it was like growing up as a teen, with great play on words which most find offensive but to me, it means someone has no sense of humor and takes life to seriously. This movie is the pinnacle of the summer movies of 2007, and by far takes the cake. I<br/><br/>If this movie doesn't make you feel better or your day feel any better you have robbed yourself with a closed minded view of the world and you were obviously depraved of comedy as a child."

","I am not a big fan of teen comedies; most of them are just plain stupid. I thought American Pie and There's Something About Mary were pretty bad. I had heard the great reviews on Superbad and just had to see this. Both my wife and I laughed throughout, but I was almost on the floor. <br/><br/>Sure, some of the situations are unbelievable, but you could say that about a lot of classic comedy. Sure, there are some dead spots (the whole subplot with the cops gets a bit strained at times). But I can't remember laughing almost continuously, loud and hard in such a long time. I know I missed a lot of throwaway lines, and look forward to seeing this again when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>By the way, I am 53, and while I'm not a grandparent, I could be. Anyone who remembers high school after the mid-60s can relate to this movie. See it!!!!"
"DKosty123","7","1","4","7 September 2007"," Seth, Evan, & McLovin Come of Age
","This is an R rated movie but it is funny enough that some teenagers have gone to it at least 5 times. While I have only seen it once, I think it is better than some films of this type but am not sure if it rises quite to the high 8 plus rating it has right now.<br/><br/>The film starts a little slow with Seth (Jonah Hill) picking up Evan (Michael Cera) at his house & checking out his mom (played by a shapely Stacey Edwards). The actor who plays Seth is actually about 25 years old, but the only time it shows to me is in a scene where he is huffing & puffing on the high school track trying to run. The rest of the time, he is believable as a high school senior. His swearing in the early sequences is a little over the top but does set the tone for later events. <br/><br/>McLovin(Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is actually 19 years old in real life & Evan is just slightly older. As for the girls, Becca (24 yr old Martha Mac Isaac) is older than the other actresses but really looks younger & hot. The youngest actress(Jules / Emma Stone) gets the black eye from Seth but she looks older than the others. <br/><br/>Getting away from these facts, the cast fits the story & acts very well together. The 2 cops (Bill Hader & Seth Rogen) are only slightly older than the rest of the cast but they play their roles well too. Their roles make the plot possible. <br/><br/>Seth & Evan get invited by their to be girlfriends to a party at the to be girlfriend of Seth. They even get Seth $100 dollars to buy booze. They find out McLovin is getting a fake ID so they give him the $100 to go & buy the booze at the Liquor store.<br/><br/>The store gets robbed, McLovin gets punched by the robber, the cops come to investigate, & this sets off an incredible chain of events which eventually the guys get the booze to Seth's girlfriends party. The events get quite funny. In fact, once the film gets past it's slow opening it has a good pace reminding me of Tom Hanks ""Bachelor Party"" from the 1980's in pacing.<br/><br/>The difference is this is a coming of age story of our males & 2 females. McLovin manages to get his fantasy alone too, but his story kind of gets dropped before the ending. I could see a sequel to this here as Evan & McLovin are supposed to be roomers when they go to college after this movie takes place.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the movie a bit of a soft-core teenager comedy with a lot of funny moments. Seth takes quite a bruising in this movie as a lot of things seem to collide with him throughout the film. It is a fantasy story as the girls the guys are dreaming about are also interested in the guys. Wow, when I was a teen I wish it had been that way for me. <br/><br/>There is a spot in the film where the continuity of where Evan is jumps out of place as he suddenly appears at a party with no explanation where he had gone in the previous sequence or how he arrived back at the party he was running away from in the previous sequence. That sequencing is the reason I only rate it a 7."
"Robert_duder","7","1","4","7 September 2007"," Dirty, vulgar, inappropriate...and also pretty darn funny
","I won't rave about Superbad. I honestly didn't feel like it had the clever dirty wit of 'Knocked Up' or even '40 Year Old Virgin' and yet it had a certain charm and there was NO doubt that everyone I watched this with in the theater thought it was downright hilarious. For me it wasn't quite that funny but it certainly had it's high points. I felt like maybe director Greg Mottola and creators/writers Seth Rogan, and Evan Goldberg maybe tried a little too hard to create something they had hoped would be a classic teen sex romp comedy and I guess they did just fine since that's exactly what most are saying it is and will be. Most are even comparing it to the original American Pie which I think is true honor. The unknown cast was a great idea and they do a terrific job, and the film certainly has some memorable enough moments. A lot of the things that others seem to find so hilariously funny seemed to me to be a little recycled and seen before type comedy but there was also a lot of very funny physical comedy and one liners and probably a lot of realistic teenage moments as well. One of the most clever and endearing parts of this film is the way that it is presented. It would appear as though the film takes place in the seventies with music, and the opening scene disco dancing against flashing colors and the cars and some of the clothing but it is a modern day film where they carry cell phones and visit malls and it kind of makes the film sort of timeless and baby boomers and teenagers today can enjoy the same.<br/><br/>The cast is headed by two basically newcomers. Jonah Hill is the portly, wild haired youngster playing Seth and he is damn hilarious. He is dirty mouthed, wild eyed and horny and his one liners and sarcasm is just awesome. He also does some really terrific physical comedy getting hit by a car twice, hit with a bat, beat up and more!! Hill is sure to be a star and his career will get jumpstarted with this film. His co-star and conspirator in the film is Michael Cera. Although he has had a varied career this is really his first starring role. He has a much more pure and innocent nice guy role than Hill's wild character. Still they have awesome chemistry together and they balance each other nicely. Both of them will fare well in the future. I hope they team up again. Making his movie debut as the third muskateer is Christopher Mintz-Plasse as the hilariously geeky Fogell or better known as the infamous 'McLovin.' Even though he plays the stereotypical thick glasses 'geek' he actually turns out to be the coolest dude in the movie and he has a great role and plays off his co-stars very well. He could hold his own film as McLovin. Rounding out the cast as the hilariously inappropriate and over the top cops Slater and Michaels are co-writer Seth Rogan and the hilariously bizarre Bill Hader. They're the cops from hell but they keep the hilarity rolling and together with 'McLovin' (Mintz-Plasse) they are an amazing comedy trio. They just might be the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>This film will never impress too many critics or audiences if you go into it thinking this will be deep or important in ANY way. The film is incredibly shallow and only redeems itself as a complete (and very funny) joke in the end. It never tries to be emotional or important or even show any sort of moral. It's just a raunchy adventure to try and get booze for an underage party so they can get laid or so they think. The language is extreme, there is drug use and booze everywhere but it still manages to be a funny, well written comedy that will likely move into it's place with Animal House, and American Pie which is no small feat. If you can go into a movie and put your brain aside and not be offended than you'll see this cute little dirty movie for what it is. 7/10"

It will be a cult classic, that is for sure, and much more hysterical and realistic than 40 yr old Virgin or Knocked Up! Good Job Seth!!! The parts with the police were a bit lame but added character. The most impressive part was how amazingly real the dialog was... you could tell all of the actors either had great chemistry or have worked together previously. And Sophia Bush is gorgeous! I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of humor and likes genitalia talk. Seth Rogan should make more movies.

","I must admit, I didn't have very high expectations for ""Superbad"" going in to the film. I still had a bit of a sour taste in my mouth from ""Knocked Up"", and based on that I thought the people involved making this pseudo-series of films were just trying to ride the wave of success that ""40 Year Old Virgin"" created and milk as much money out of it as they could.<br/><br/>And things weren't looking good at the start. It was pretty much all ""penis jokes"" for the first 20 minutes, and personally I think they could have done better than that. But from that point on things really turned around, and I ended up really liking the film. Some of the scenes and lines will LIVE FOREVER, without a doubt in my mind (i.e. the scene with Becca and Evan in the bedroom). I think they went back to a more 40YOV feel, and that was a very good idea.<br/><br/>The only other complaint I had was with the ending...I thought it was a LITTLE too cheesy and not very realistic, but hey, I'm a nit-picker. So yeah, the beginning and end could have been a little better, but a good chunk of ""Superbad"" is some of the funniest stuff I've seen in a while. Definitely worth watching..."
"colonel_green","8","1","4","4 September 2007"," Another winning film from Apatow's crew.
","""Superbad"" is a notable production in that it was first imagined when its writers were 13, and wanted to see if they could write a movie; based on the finished project (which, sure, has undergone numerous reworkings in the intervening years), I believe the answer is clearly 'yes'. ""Superbad"" has the plot of a typical teen movie, pitting two unpopular nerds and their reluctant acquaintance against the whole world in a desperate attempt to acquire the liquor to facilitate their receiving some action from the chosen ladies (who are far out of their league, at least in one case; this is a recurring thing in Apatow films, especially considering that the Seth character in this film is modeled on co-writer Seth Rogen, who was in a similar situation in ""Knocked Up"").<br/><br/>Like its Apatow kin, the film manages to mix crude humour in with genuine feeling, and does not mock (at least, not without love) its characters or deny them some dimensionality. In particular, I enjoyed the handling of the two main female characters who are the object of so much desire; neither fills a standard teen movie stereotype (no cheerleaders or prom queens here), and the expected roles are in a lot of ways reversed.<br/><br/>It's not a great or significant film, but then, you weren't expecting that kind of production from ""Superbad""; this is a great bit of fun, if you can take the swearing."

This movie is smart, funny, well casted and not your average ""American Pie"". I'm nearly 40 so I don't usually go for this type of movie but all the hype and some of the actors involved, peaked my interest. I would say this is a combination of Dazed & Confused, Napolian Dinamite and American Pie and it's about 100 times funnier than each of those! I loved the characters. McLuvin and the cops almost steal the show, the are sooo funny. This movie gets my thumbs up for sure so even if you are a skeptic you should give it a chance. I plan on taking others to see it as well real soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"The_Orenda","7","1","4","3 September 2007"," Well thought up.
","One of the better teen adventure comedies in some time, Superbad delivers the goods on many things, as it touches on every subject that deals with teenage life, and then some. The script begins innocently enough, but once Fogell enters the beer store, all bets are off as one strange twist after another has you laughing and wondering just what the heck is going to happen next. And no matter what's happening to poor Seth and Evan throughout, our thoughts are still on the officers and Fogell.<br/><br/>Seth and Evan are invited to the year-end party at Jules and also mention they can provide the booze too! Their hopes rest on Fogell, whose fake ID makes him McLovin, a 25yr. old organ donor from Hawaii!<br/><br/>Many of the twists the poor kids go through are just strange. When the girl just shows up and starts dancing with Seth. Or when Evan gets stuck singing Burton Cummings with the addicts. Or the strange bum (""Hey McMuffin!""). But aside from that and the funk soundtrack, Superbad always has you watching to see what happens next. The movie is no advocate for teenage drinking. It's quite the opposite, and despite the cops' antics and track covering, you'll learn never to spit on one. No matter how strange and adventurous the movie may be, the endless talking also brings out the inevitable feminine side between the Seth and Evan in another strange but hilarious moment in Superbad. It's a good movie and one for the times."

","At first I didn't know what to expect from Superbad. It seemed like a good movie from some of the commercials and from other commercials it seemed like it would suck. Then once I got to the movie theater I really thought that it was great. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill have tremendous chemistry in this movie. The whole story is really about nothing, which was easy for me to get into it. The best parts have to go to Fogell. The entire Fogell character stole the movie. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader also showed some great chemistry as the cops. The entire movie was down right great. It was funny, disgusting at points, but all together it was a killer movie to have been made."

","It was really hard to know how to rate this movie. Had I not read lots of reviews and known that it was going to end up being a somewhat good movie, I may have left early. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie attempts to cram in as much offensive language as possible. The pornography references truly, truly offended me. However. Beneath all the shocking language, there truly is a heart. I found this movie to be surprisingly touching and sweet. They did ""go"" a few places I wish they hadn't. Every time I think I've seen it all, Hollywood adds in something new and more offensive than I've seen before. I can't help but wish they'd toned down the porn stuff and the language. Without it, there is still enough funny material for a good movie. So, I do recommend this to people who can get past the offensiveness, as I said, after the first half hour or so, it improves somewhat and there really is a nice story and a (gasp) good message in there."
"IamtheRegalTreatment","7","1","4","17 August 2007"," Thru Hell and Back
","Superbad is an unbelievable comedy about the lives of three high school seniors right before graduation who are trying to get laid before they go off to college... but wait, I've heard this plot before. But this is a new century for this American Pie, and Superbad fully succeeds in its attempts to create humor and entertainment like the classic would have wanted.<br/><br/>The new line of comedy from which Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and Steve Carell are all a part of has been killing at the box office as of late, and if you haven't hopped on this bandwagon yet, you're long behind. Even though all these movies have the same main cast of characters, each one is different and unique to a specific degree. Superbad has a special entity which derives differently from such titles like Knocked Up or The 40 Year Old Virgin. This movie was much more for teens, whereas Knocked Up was for slightly older partiers and 40 Year Old Virgin was for middle-aged men but could also include all ages due to its humor. Thankfully, these men have worked Superbad in very well to their line of titles.<br/><br/>Superbad has whatever the average teen would want to see: brief nudity, sexual situations, comedic punchlines to use on your friends, etc. Everything from A to Z to McLovin has been covered and Superbad leaves little left for you to need.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was very entertaining. The plot was constructed well and everything tied in together nicely. The ending was decent but I would have liked more significance in terms of letting us leave it to our imaginations... don't worry, no spoiler. I would give this movie a solid 7 as a comedy. It could be better in a sense that it attracts more of a diverse audience, but as a comedy it does not disappoint. Well done Seth, well done."
"onepotato2","6","2","15","18 August 2007"," Funny but... (not a comedy milestone)
","It's been a summer of successful advance marketing campaigns for disappointing comedies. <br/><br/>Superbad is certainly funny, but I had hoped for a movie that suggested or heralded the next era in comedy, as I had with the Simpsons movie. The P.R. machine hinted at something special. Instead it's just a comedy. The Simpsons Movie wasn't a comedy milestone & neither is this. It mixes humor with off-color language very well (Noone's gotten a hand-job wearing cargo-shorts since 'Nam!) But to deliver ""special"" as it promised, the movie might need a less trivial plot, a shorter running time, a plot that went productive places, fewer cop scenes, a more daring pretext (other than just setting a record for F-bombs), and leads that are enjoyable to identify with. I'll forget Superbad in 2 months, in a way I'll never forget Rushmore, which WAS a comedy milestone and covered similar ground. <br/><br/>The 'superbadness' of the title refers to the McLovin' storyline more than the other two lead characters, who have much more typical story arcs. Superbad tries to parlay Evan's ""first time"" into a sentimental, not a ""superbad,"" moment. Without a hook this storyline is the least interesting and forgettably conventional. Who cares if Evan wants to 'respect' Becca? This isn't a movie I came to see for a hackneyed message & she's a drip. He'll forget this dingbat a few minutes after he leaves for college. And he'll have to abandon his square ideas about females (or come out). Only closet-cases talk like this about girls in high school. That aside, Michael Cera, as Evan, continues to find ways to make bumbling, adolescent awkwardness funny & endearing. If you missed his role as George Michael in Arrested Development (He was amazing) this is your chance to see that technique. Not since Benjamin flopped at ""playing it cool"" with Mrs. Robinson has someone been this good at being casually awkward. Dustin Hoffman was great but I think Cera is better. Really! He is unbelievably good at embodying high-school self-consciousness. You'll enjoy his performance of ""These Eyes"" under duress in a room full of cokeheads.<br/><br/>But I worry about where a young likable actor can go when he has so mastered a certain type of small character. I hope there are good roles in his future, but I bet Hollywood will either ignore him or require him to play this type of character 20 more times. They certainly won't know what to do with his atypical looks. A challenging role like Sandler in Punch Drunk Love, that requires him to be funny & shy but deliver depth, would be great. I hope we can see something like that.<br/><br/>Less funny, but memorable is the movies conclusion which makes you recall how awful it was to say goodbye to your buddies."

There were kid actors in this movie reacting to the so-called ""adult"" content (a little girl is shown perverted penis drawings). I say ""adult"" which is to say ""immature"" or rather 'not adult' but only ""adult"" in the sense of how much obscenity the so-called adult brain is supposed to be able to tolerate? Nevermind, just don't swim in the sewers. Don't swim there on a rainy day either, you want to swim? Try an open place with sunshine, perhaps the ocean, a lake, or a swimming pool--you know some place appropriate so that you might actually enjoy yourself.

"russ-emmerson","9","1","5","4 October 2007"," What a great film
","As a growing fan of Seth Rogan and having hugely enjoyed Judd Apatow's productions to-date, it was with some trepidation that I went to see Superbad. I was concerned because of the obvious parallels to the likes of American and various 'right-of-passage' films out there.<br/><br/>I was far from disappointed. This film is wicked and manages to tap into the bizarre mix of teen confusion and angst (which inevitably only becomes hilarious when we are old enough to look back at it!) that equals outrageous and unbelievable moments of comedy. I remember watching Napoleon Dynamite and thinking that anyone who can't sympathise with this character either never went to school or was simply the arsehole who never knew (and never will know) better. I like American Pie(s), but NapD had the feel of reality. Superbad takes it to a whole new level; I can't speak for the girls out there, but I never knew a boy who wasn't even moderately obsessed with porn and the prospect of getting laid. The point here isn't my own scary nostalgic look back at my teens, but rather the chance to look back once again and think, hell I am so glad that is all done with.<br/><br/>Seth and Evan really are you and me... at last. Well done Seth (Rogen) and Evan (Goldberg). I don't think I will promote this film as a guide to teens - hell I am a parent myself now, but it is a ray of hope to those of us who have been there and done that - we were not (ever?) alone!"
"Det_McNulty","7","1","5","25 September 2007"," Seth Rogen Has Successfully Placed His Signature On American Comedy History
","I was always anticipating Superbad, but I never expected anything near to the quality of film-making and cinema experience I received. Coming out of the cinema with a huge grin on my face made me realise that a ""teen flick"" can be a winner, something which seemed impossible. Technically speaking, it is almost impossible to create an even decent ""teen flick"", given that to class Superbad as such a thing would be dismissive. For example, the '90s classic Dazed and Confused is often classed as a teen movie, but it is much more than that, considering the film studies the social-trends of a forgotten era which gave birth to modern teen culture. It is nostalgic viewing for many, just like what Superbad will grow to be in the years to come.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen has been having a victorious time throughout 2007; kicking off the summer with Knocked Up and ending with Superbad, he is establishing himself as one of the finest actors and script writers working within modern comedy. Deservedly, this is something the talented comedian has been working for, and now maintains a place within comedic history. Seth Rogen wrote and starred in Superbad, and on viewing the picture you will observe his talent as both a writer and actor.<br/><br/>Superbad does not exactly carry a narrative structure, something best suited for a film of its kind and so should not be used as a criticism. Essentially, the film follows the day of three high-school friends who have been invited to a party on account of them providing the alcohol. It is that simple on the surface, but the film turns out to be significantly more intelligent than just teens looking to score and get wasted. Not only does the picture place some moralistic ideas into the dialogue, but it speaks to its audience with an easy-to-relate-to style.<br/><br/>If you ever did or are experiencing the high-school lifestyle then Superbad will be an instantly recognisable achievement. The film is crammed with themes which the viewer can relate to and sums up the series of gauche events encountered throughout adolescence. Filmed in garish colours and through exaggerated techniques, Superbad epitomises retro cool and certainly does not value discretion. Everything works perfectly against the outlandishly preoccupied sex jokes. Written with a bravura tone of angst and rebellion, the nerdy comedy fuses with the energetic and welcoming characters. The screenplay is crafted on a torrent of clever hilarities, which progressively become slightly more subtle (if that is even possible for Superbad) as the film develops. Moving at a consistently fast pace, the film refuses to let the viewer have room breathe; it is at these moments that the viewer will most likely realise the timing of the film. And although these moments are a sign of thin wearing, the picture manages to pick its momentum up again, due to the rapid-fire and constant barrage of jokes.<br/><br/>The film is going to undoubtedly propel the careers of the three protagonist actors. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have become relatively well-known over the last couple of years for their work within American comedy. Nonetheless, it is supporting performer Christopher Mintz-Plasse (in his debut role) who outshines the rest of the cast. The casting of him as Fogell a.k.a. McLovin is too good to be true, as he personifies the character entirely and crafts a role which will forever be quoted and loved. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader also star as the two off-beat, lazy cops; the pair work together with an amusing ease, proving that the chemistry depicted is not forced but completely natural. In fact, this goes without saying because the whole cast combine flawlessly.<br/><br/>Overflowing with memorable scenes (which should not be spoiled) and relentless entertainment Superbad continues to be a riot long after the credits have rolled. Superbad is something truly spectacular and was an intrepid business risk worth employing. Its success is overwhelming, but once seen it is easily understandable."

In that respect it's a dumb teen comedy like American Piebut it's much better, and in a peculiar way, more moral. Warning: lots of swearing, lots of kn*b gags, and some very crude dialogue, none of which I could repeat here. The two lead characters (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) are great. So are Bill Hader and Seth Rogen  star of Knocked Up and the film's co-writer  who play immature, out-of-control policemen. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, as the lead characters' geeky sidekick McLovin', is best of the lot."

","Another great movie produced by Judd Apatow and Apatow productions,Superbad is about two teenagers,Seth(Jonah Hill) and Evan(Michael Cera) who are approximately two weeks away from graduation but problems arise for the two best friends as they are invited to a graduation party by Jules who tells them to provide alcohol. Evan and Seth then find out their friend Fogell is going to get a fake ID and they tell Fogell that he can come with them to the party if he gets them the alcohol that they need to get for the party but then Seth and Evan desert Fogell as they think he is apprehended by Officer Slater(Saturday Night Live's Bill Hader) and Officer Michaels(Seth Rogen) but in actual fact, the officers befriend him. Superbad was good but in my opinion,Knocked Up was the better and more hilarious of the two movies and Seth Rogen's performance was better in Knocked Up than in this movie Superbad but either way, both performances were die-hard hilarious."

Its a movie you can watch a few times and find new things to laugh at as well . This movie should most definitely be in everyones DVD collection as a keeper. I would not recommend this movie for children under 14 as some of the sexual language is harsh and profanity is abundant throughout.

"jzappa","8","1","5","16 September 2007"," A Teen Sex Comedy, But Honest. We Call That A Paradox.
","Not only has the film been advertised incessantly with scenes of Jonah Hill in 1970s outfits and music from the '70s and '80s, but the film opens with a very funky '70s-style opening sequence with funk music. Then, the story begins, and the first thing that happens is a cell phone conversation, involving very up-to-date cell phones. At this point, you are taken quite aback. As the story progresses, you realize the acutely contemporary condition of teenage partying and sex among teens. What time period does Superbad think it's in?! The '70s motif confuses me to this second. It's something that can easily sever your tractor beam to the movie as the audience. However, this acutely contemporary look at the sphere of teenage sex and parties that I speak of is quite stunningly honest and poignant.<br/><br/>The greatest charm of Superbad is how it laughs with us, as everyone knows that sex is not at all the way one thinks it's going to be like, yet our main characters, played by very brazen and loud Jonah Hill, nervous straight man Michael Cera, and iconic geek Christopher Mintz- Plasse most certainly do not know that. To put it very simply, it's the long-hoped-for antithesis to the American Pie films, which treat not losing your virginity before high school is over like the end of the world that nobody should be made to think that it is. They're tailored for an even younger audience than Superbad is, heroicizing wham-bam-thank-you- ma'am guys and girls that are too cool to give certain people the time of day, and romanticizing that naive yearning for sex when we're in high school. Superbad is quite hilarious and comfortable because of its honesty with the subject, not any sort of shallow perpetuation of fitting-in mentalities in pre-teens turning into teens.<br/><br/>The boldest highlight of the movie, one of the funniest and most enjoyable things I've seen in a movie lately, is the plot strand involving Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as two cops who have no inhibitions with rebelliously fudging the law for their own good time and bringing the character well known by even those have yet to see the film as McLovin, played with a stunning dose of gawkiness by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, along for the rest of their shift, letting him do things like fire a gun and have beers with them, all leading to the message the film sends pertaining to people even older than those who will be seeing this movie and understanding the virginal naiveté of the characters. The film just hits a lot of notes that most teen movies of now don't bother to send, and in fact oppose.<br/><br/>The script, written with great wit and both an ear and a memory bank for teenage dialect and mindset by Seth Rogen himself and Evan Goldberg, weaves the film along very gracefully throughout, clocking a day in the life, up until the tacked-on ending, which may just be a product of the intimidating demands of studios and audiences that feel deserted or confused without a film that ends like nearly all the rest of the teen movie bunch. Don't forget what it was like to be a teenager, before we wanted to admit that maintaing strong friendships is more important than partying and sex."

I was a bit skeptical about seeing this movie because it at first seemed like one of those typical high school/college-aged comedies. To my surprise, the movie did have quite a bit of this excessive kind of humor, but I somehow enjoyed it because of the directing and acting. It went overboard and was exaggerated in many ways, but it wasn't absolutely stupid-type humor in movies like Dodgeball or Anchorman.

"grandenchilada","7","1","5","29 August 2007"," Almost Super
","Superbad is an unlikely love story between two mega nerds, Evan and Seth, played by the fantastic Michael Cera, who is a young master of the excruciatingly gentle deadpan, and by Jonah Hill; physically, the only true heir to the great Zero Mostel, and in this movie an unbridled monster of male teenage need. The filth that comes from this young man's mind, let alone his lips, is heart-stopping. I'm all for freedom of expression and particularly freedom of sexual expression, and freedom in comedy, where nothing is sacred, and long live Lenny Bruce and all that, but the obscenity in this movie becomes a bit tiresome after a while. There are the seeds of subversion in this extremely explicit, and sometimes funny, talk of sex, but how effective can subversion be if it becomes monotonous? I wonder whether Superbad does in fact reflect the culture or is it just that the writers have dirty minds? Are kids today so truly influenced by porn and so obsessed with sex? Or is Superbad setting the pace? Still, even though I confess that I found the relentless barrage of vulgarity a bit off-putting, I welcome that a mainstream hit movie will make all those Bible thumpers call for the apocalypse. The obscenity is a slap in the face to the hypocritical virtuousness of an immoral God-fearing president, and as such, bring it on! What Superbad makes clear is that the culture in America is permissive in everything but in deed. For a teenager, it is faux liberty. Porn is abundant, but real sex is not. Booze is abundant, but it can't be had if you are a teen, (and still they do get sloshed); adulthood is thrown right in front of your face, and it is a scary thing. Superbad explores the dark side of the nerd's angst, and by God, this is the angsiest trip since Gregor Samsa turned into a roach. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg wrote this script when they were teenagers, and it shows, even though it has been massaged into something more substantial. The movie is great and most funny at exploring the tribulations of the teen mind. In the surprisingly tender coupling of Seth and Evan you have the division between civilization and barbarity. Evan, the one with the moral conscience, is a sweet bumbling loser with genuine decency. There is quite a disturbing scene of a sloshed young girl being extremely sexually aggressive with him. The moment of truth has arrived, and Evan is mortified and terrified, not only because of the act itself but because of the moral implications of taking advantage. The lust and fear verging on panic of women is a constant in Apatow's male buddy comedy as is his insistence that real sex and intimacy make men very afraid. Seth, on the other hand, is a monster of selfishness and his hysteria is palpable, as is his hurt at being abandoned by his friend. The best parts of the movie are when you see these two in action, whether they are parsing the mysteries of sex as if they were Talmudic scholars and particularly when they have a spat. They have a true relationship, a dependency that staves off loneliness and fear, and Hill is wonderful when he is wounded. Most reviews I read talked about the sweetness of the movie, so I was rather taken aback by its depiction of bully behavior, which is a constant in teenage life, and in this movie, practiced by adults as well, since in the Apatow universe (and therefore possibly in America) no man is ever really a mature adult. The more puerile parts, like a too long subplot involving two irresponsible, childish cops and Fogel (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), the biggest nerd ever to hit a movie screen, are intermittently funny but they distract from the meatier conceit of male bonding in the time of hysteria. I love that this motley bunch of Jews, white nerds in a totally white universe, sway and jive, or try their best, like superbad black guys. That's another subtle dig at a culture that is desperately in need of macho cred. Apparently, nowadays only ghetto talk provides that and the actors and writers know there is nothing funnier than a white nerd trying to pass off for a badass mofo. The funky music score, by the way, is excellent. The movie redeems itself by ending like a love story, with a tender (platonic) love scene between the two friends, who go on to face their respective rites of passage on their own, lost in a mall, as befits the new romantic comedy in America."

","I am certainly not a prude, however gross out films for purely comedic effect fall flat in my opinion. When it's a teen comedy it can be more so. That being said this movie rises above the vulgarity of off color language depicting two dependent best friends showing that (in the end) doing the right thing is more important than pursuing what your adolescent fantasies involve.<br/><br/>That it gives credence to doing the right thing,IMO, makes it a better film. Not that it's not gross enough to be ""the best movie a 13-yr old has ever seen"", but it is filled with memorable characters who mimic real life types and situations as well as the obligatory absurd characters such as the two cops. It's not likely to be a comedic classic on the level of ""Animal House"", but it is funny, gross, and..., meh, sweet? How many comedies can you say that about? Kind of like if Me, Myself, and Irene were a teen comedy...but different. Glad to clear that up!"

","I didn't except to like this movie as much as I did. It was hilarious. I have already watched it twice in theaters. I just think it is one of the best comedies ever made. I had an aching stomach after leaving this movie from laughing so hard. The reason I wanted to see this movie was because it had Michael Cera in it. He is one of the most talented actors out there.<br/><br/>The movie's plot is simple. Vulgar and obnoxious Seth(played by hilarious Jonah Hill) and his best friend, the shy and sweet Evan(played by funny and adorable Michael Cera of Arrested Development), are both headed to different collages and are very upset about it. So, when they are asked to bring alcohol to a party by their crushes, Jules(Emma Stone) and Becca(Martha MacIsaac), they set out to get the drinks for them so they can get them drunk and get laid.<br/><br/>Forgell, a.k.a. McLovin(Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is how they are gonna get the alcohol. But when he is buying it, he is punched and the store is robbed. When the cops(Seth Rogan and Bill Hader) arrive, he hangs out and gets with them.<br/><br/>The performances are all very good. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have great chemistry and are believable on-screen best friends. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who has never been in a film before, pulls this role of hilariously and I hope to see more of him in the future. The cops are also very, very funny. Another thing I would like to mention is the female characters, Jules and Becca. They are very likable unlike a lot of girl characters in high school movies. They are pretty and nice, and not snobby.<br/><br/>The whole movie is hilarious, gross, and slightly sweet. I really recommend it if you want a great laugh. It is an excellent comedy for boys and girls."

This is one movie that I will definitely watch every time they rerun it on cable in the future. It had its completely gross-out teen moments, but those were grounded by its hilariously absurd and witty (also gross) conversations. Michael Cera was great, and most Arrested Development fans should find his performance here just as entertaining as his take on the George Michael character he played on that show. He is absolutely awkward and downright hilarious. Jonah Hill is the funniest he has ever been, confidently spouting out uproariously funny lines at every hot girl in sight."

Superbad starts with some cheesy and ''gruesome'' (How a lady next to me referred it as) jokes which couldn't have been said better then by Jonah Hill and Micheal Cera.

","If the term, ""a teenage sex comedy"" is mentioned in human conversation, some glory-hounding tight-end, whether they be a clergyman, politico or parent, gets irate, damning the film before seeing it because it exploits (often true) the raging sexual hormones of bright-eyed adolescents and making it a definite no-no for all ages. With its title inviting obvious and lame jokes from movie critics, ""Superbad"" does exploit, but does more and better than (God helps us) the transparent ""High School Musical"" movies to display kids growing up.<br/><br/>A smart but socially defective pair of tadpoles, carnal-crazed blob Seth (Jonah Hill of ""Accepted"" and ""Knocked Up"") and reflective, philosophical stick Evan (Michael Cera of the under-rated sitcom, ""Arrested Development"") seek copulation sessions with first-class ladies to lose their virginity and have good reps before going to separate colleges: nice girl next door Becca (a sweet Martha MacIssac) is in Evan's sights while Seth wants to ""hump"" future Ford Model Agency candidate Jules (Emma Stone). By a stroke of good luck in home-ed class, Seth gets the job of booze courier to Jules's pre-graduation soirée (NOTE: Underage alcohol drinking is WRONG). Evan helps out and is invited as well. <br/><br/>So does Fogell (rookie Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a squirrel-brain nerd who's euphorically naive to his ""nerdiness"" and fawns over tarty-like Nicola (an underused-by-time constraints Aviva). He irritates Seth more than usual with his fake ID alias; the pleasantly subversive ""McLovin'"" will be immortalized in comedic film history after this review is composed.<br/><br/>For the geeky trio, however, the journey to the ""sweet spot"" is harder than it supposed to be. Hilarity ensues and, boy, does it ever.<br/><br/>Smutty and profane as it is, ""Superbad"" is anything but (lame, but original joke), with an ace, Shakespeare-like script by longtime chums Seth Rogen (lead player of the hit ""Knocked Up"") and Evan Goldberg, who wrote the first draft when they were thirteen (!) and competent direction by Greg Mottola (""The Daytrippers""). Like the maltreated-by audience, double-feature treasure ""Grindhouse"", the film is in love with the 1970s, the decade where films got loose with sex, violence, drugs and vulgar lexicon, with its' funkadelic soundtrack and silhouette dancing intro sequences (provided joyfully by the two leads). Even Sony Pictures, the film's distributor, resuscitated the old Columbia Pictures animated ""curtain opening""; the iconic torch lady morphs into a fading sunset, after a blinding flash.<br/><br/>Hill and Cera come off as a teenage version of the protagonist duos that infest the films of Kevin Smith (yes, the film is a love letter for him, and I wouldn't be surprised if he liked it too), but green-eyed Mintz-Plasse, who got the role after spending time on Myspace.com, is a scene-stealer esquire, having an aura of honest awkwardness. Like the madcap Jason Mewes in Smith's oeuvres, Mintz-Plasse's damn real and damn proud of it.<br/><br/>The ladies give depth to their roles, being crucial to the tale. Though some may find the injection of two gonzo cops (Rogen and ""Saturday Night Live"" member, Bill Hader, who perfectly echoes earlier player Dan Aykroyd) to be a worn-out visit, the two ""Lost Boys with badges and guns"" are essential and a barrel of hearty chuckles.<br/><br/>It may be a stretch, but ""Superbad"" might be the greatest teenage sex comedy around, examining the tempestuous link between friends who have to be to survive in the jungle of high school and see carnal knowledge as a way out of the hole of social exclusion. Every generation, past and present, has their nerds, geeks...you get the idea...who don't fit in because they go left when everybody's goes right (I know since I was a geek in high school, but an angry one at that). Sexual intercourse seems to be a way out, but adolescence, let alone sexual innocence, isn't forever and must be cherished before it's gone, and relating to the opposite sex is a mandatory duty, if one wants to have sex. Besides, the fact a geeky boy is the future boyfriend/husband of a high class woman is undeniable. Otherwise and sadly, there'd be more school shootings. <br/><br/>Unless you're never were geeky or were but too chicken crap to admit it, ""Superbad"" is required viewing."

"w-10","7","1","5","19 August 2007"," Well done.
","Out of all the ""teen"" genre movies that come out, I will have to say that I was quite excited for this one. I'm not usually one who likes to go out and watch teen raunch movies, mainly because most of them I find dumb and usually depict really stupid archetypal characters with a one dimensional face to them. The premise as most of these movies go is that this story takes place in the span of a day. The usual plot containing a party that these""losers"" are so inclined to attend, that they put themselves through so much just to a)get the girl, so that they can get laid (because they've never been laid) and b)feel popular for once. I think most of us can relate to that feeling. I'm pretty sure if most of us can think back to a time in high school, that was all that we could think about. Thankfully most of us have grown up since then.<br/><br/>What I really liked about this movie was that it didn't take itself to seriously. It places it's characters in really awkward situations and lets them behave almost as if most of it was unscripted. I'm sure they had a script but they seem so naturally awkward that it reminds me a lot of how socializing in high school actually was, AWKWARD. They don't say the right thing most of the time, they're not perfectly rehearsed. They basically speak as though I was watching my friends and I having a conversation in high school. <br/><br/>Now; I read some people bitching about how this movie is degrading to women. What I would like to say to that is that at the end of the movie, the main characters perception of sex changes. Which I hope rings true for a lot of people. I remember being so misinformed in high school about sex, that although the main characters are excited and on a mission to get laid, you sense the fear of having sex for the first time as well. I liked the fact that they did not portray the young girls as victims or stupid. They portrayed them as very level headed, and as teenagers are bound to do, they made some bad mis-educated decisions. What I liked was that it showed the 2 main characters displaying different opinions on what their first time should be like. What I also liked was the fact that they gave the girls in this movie a chance to voice their opinions on sex as well. That they learned that they need to treat each other with respect and that sex isn't something you do just when you're drunk because you don't want to remember how horrible it might be is a very good mature perspective to take. It's something that young people now a days need to know, because whether we like to admit it or not, a lot of youth now a days are really misinformed about sex, and what their first time will be like. I thought the movie handled the issue quite well, considering it could have just been crude and raunchy. That is not to say that this movie attempts to be profound or moralistic, but at least these are characters that are real-with real behaviour, real feelings and real life experiences."

"TheMovieDiorama","6","1","6","13 May 2019"," Superbad may not be as substandard as its title suggests, but it isn't exactly a drunkenly good time.
","""Superoverrated"" would be more appropriate. Now, before everyone leaps to the defensive fence and starts abolishing my opinion, comedy is subjective. Superbad, in all its hormonal teen angst, will more than likely appeal to its target demographic of heterosexual males. That's not to say no one else can enjoy it, that's just the primary audience. I don't fit into that classification, which is why for most of the runtime, I found myself rarely relating to these buffoons. Two high school seniors are drifting apart as they continue on with their education and lives, to which they plan to have one booze-soaked night of boyish behaviour so that they can retain their friendship.<br/><br/>Sex, drugs and alcohol. The three definitive elements found in most male-orientated teen comedies that have seen a popular rise ever since a certain pie got penetrated ('American Pie' if you didn't know...). However, what makes this one slightly more approachable is the cleverly executed arc that develops from this tricky friendship. When one friend doesn't get into further education, but the other friend does, it is sure to cause a rift. Seth and Evan present that scenario with a hint of humanism. When they're not attempting to steal alcohol or pressuring each other to illegally purchase liqueur, their bond can be rather expressive.<br/><br/>Then incomes Fogell ""McLovin"" with his ridiculously amateur fake ID, to which the narrative seemingly splits apart and loses focus. A sub-plot involving two police officers (probably the funnier storyline...) and showing ""McLovin"" that cops can be fun, boisterously takes over the main plot. The spiky friendship between Seth and Evan dissipates and the supposedly infamous Rogen/Goldberg script nosedives into ""comedy"". As usual, I counted the amount of times I laughed, sniggered or smiled at the onscreen hilarity. You ready? Twice. Mostly from Hader's performance. But again, I have to reiterate, comedy is subjective and this type of hilarity doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>What probably helped in my resistance to Superbad was the inclusion of Jonah Hill, an actor that I've never admired or even wanted to watch. As per usual, shouting every line of profanity in a monotonous tone and generally having a face that looks like a slapped bottom. Every time he was on screen, his character just made me sweat. No idea why, but I was uncomfortable with Seth as a character. The hyperbolic yearning for the female anatomy is never funny and is the complete opposite to relatable. Cera doesn't get off lightly either with his usual awkward persona. The constant barrage of camera shots that explicitly stares at female breasts is borderline objectification. Puberty is a wonderful thing, but so is subtlety. Mottola may have failed to grasp that on the odd occasion. And do not even get me started on Mintz-Plasse, otherwise we will be here all day.<br/><br/>The most effective aspect to this comedy, aside from the infrequent witty lines of dialogue that everyone loves to quote, would be the final fifteen minutes. A surprisingly poetic representation of overcoming separation anxiety and that sudden click into adulthood. Mall escalators, you just saved Superbad from being, well, super bad.<br/><br/>For the most part, when it's not focussing of sex jokes, the story is well formed and delivers some genuine moments of school life. But unfortunately it contains three lead actors who I generally dislike, mostly non-relatable scenarios and comedy that mostly misses for me. So whilst it didn't work for me personally, I can appreciate it is a well-made film that others have embraced. Phew, this review felt like presenting a defence case!"

While not hitting the heights of the previous movies still has more laughs in it than a lot of movies out there, and is certainly the funniest teen movie since the American Pie trilogy.<br/><br/>The plot sees Seth and Evan setting about trying to loose their virginity before heading off to separate colleges. Seth plans to get the girls drunk and then find one that will sleep with him. Evan gets caught up with this, although he has one girl in mind, Becca, a girl he has a crush on. Seth agrees to buy the drink for the party, and for this he uses another friend: Fogell. Fogell has got himself a fake ID, calling himself McLovin, and they plan to use this to go buy the alcohol.....<br/><br/>I won't say anymore about the plot, but what follows is simply some of the funniest scenes this year. We get 2 of the most untrustworthy cops ever seen, more willing to break laws than enforce them. Evan and Seth get side-tracked into a different party, which leads to a hysterical sequence involving blood on his pants... Evan finds himself having to sing for some hard men, and Fogell becomes best pals with the cops!<br/><br/>Rogen,who co-wrote the movie, and appears as one of the cops, knows that for a movie like this to work, for the gross-out moments and humour to work, you have to have characters that are both interesting and fun, and this movie is full of them. Even the female characters, who don't get as much screen time as the guys, are fully developed.<br/><br/>But the real secret of this movie, is that it covers something you don't see often in movies, and that is the relationships between teen boys, who are best friends and growing-up and maybe apart for good.<br/><br/>The young cast all do very well, but the 3 main leads, Jonah Hill (Seth), Michael Cera (Evan) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Fogell) are all brilliant.<br/><br/>Overall a truly funny movie about teen boys that will have you in stitches."

","I went to see this movie on a whim with a coworker and her boyfriend. I went in not really knowing what the movie was about, just bits of info on it i had read in magazines and such. I found this movie to be amazing. The whole experience was great, from the energy of the audience, the dialogue, even the credits were great.<br/><br/>I felt this movie perfectly portrayed the sexual and social awkwardness of being a teenager, being in Highschool and growing up. Having just graduated Highschool this past June, Those experiences are still fresh in my mind so I could sympathise with these characters immediately, even though they were all guys and I'm a girl.<br/><br/>A good friend of mine went to see it soon after I did, he had more expectations going in than I did and he's the kind of guy the characters sort of portray in the movie, but he said the title of the movie said it all for him; SuperBAD. I asked him why he didn't like it he responded, "" the whole movie was them looking for beer"" which is almost true but Then I reminded him Seth Rogan wrote this with his friend when he was just 13. and he shuts up.<br/><br/>conclusion: this movie is Superbad ass."
"alan_v35","Null","1","6","13 September 2007"," Porkys and American Pie have nothing on Superbad
","The teen sex comedy is back and in the fine tradition of countless, tasteless classics, Superbad picks up the fallen torch and uses the light from it to look for a way to get laid. The movie is not original or deep, but it is pretty damn funny. The young performers are great and actually look the parts they play and show some real acting ability. Hill is a regular part of the Seth Rogan mob that is ruling Hollywood comedies these days, while Sera is in his first big screen starring roles after years of TV work on Arrested Development. The real shock here is the teenager, Christopher Mintz-Plasse who is on-screen for the first time and is great.<br/><br/>The story here is simplicity, itself. It's two weeks to high school graduation and Seth (Jonah Hill) desperately wants to share some carnal moments with a girl, preferably Jules (Emma Stone). His best friend, Adam (Sera) has romantic aspirations for Becca (Martha MacIsaac) and the key to these dreams seems to be Jules' party for which they have offered to come up with the booze  a tricky offer when you are three years underage. The key to their plan is the hopeless, Fogell, (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who has just bought a new fake ID, and gave himself an attention-grabbing new name to go along with it. The simple plan of having Fogell buy the booze and arriving at the party as heroes and stepping into the waiting arms of their intoxicated fantasy girls for an evening of new pleasures doesn't go as smoothly as they planned (obviously) and soon all three are off on a series of misadventures that include two police officers (Hader & Rogan), an armed robbery and a couple vehicle-pedestrian accidents.<br/><br/>This movie is not for everyone. This is an adolescent comedy from the same minds that came up with the 40 Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. It's similar in mindset to Porky's and the American Pie series. If you enjoyed these movies, then Superbad will be a couple hours of groaning, giggling and loudly laughing at the high school antics that we were never dumb enough, desperate enough, or unlucky enough to engage in when we were in high school. Or so we claim, anyway.<br/><br/>This review was first posted on realmoviereview.com"
"MaximumCheese","10","1","6","9 September 2007"," Best teen movie I've seen.... ever?
","Superbad is destined to become a classic. Although, as other reviewers have said, it is a ""loser trying to get laid"" movie, it is a lot smarter and a lot deeper. Instead of the ""losers"" being unrealistically good-looking (as with all ""losers"" in movies), you have Seth and Evan, whose plights are a lot more believable. You have Seth, who is slightly overweight, sports a jewfro, and has a penchant for drawing penises, and Evan, who is the all-around socially awkward nerd. Fogell, an incredibly awkward dweeb with a squeaky voice and tendency to act like a ""gangsta"", is the duo's sidekick. Together these three spin a wild tale of life in high school, driven by choice funk and classic rock tunes. Seth's character carries the movie, with a loud mouth and an almost poetic ability with insults. One of my favorite moments of the movie was when Seth confronted Fogell about his fake ID which only had one name: ""McLovin."" All in all, I'm very impressed with how a generic and ancient cinematic concept can have such a new and refreshing twist."

","You won't even realize there's a moral to the story until long after you left the theater! Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse do an excellent job of being the kids you went to high school with. The beauty of this movie is that, as vulgar as it can be and as gross as it can be and as absolutely hilarious as it can be...it is one of the most accurate portrayals of high school life ever to make it to the big screen. Not since Fast Times at Ridgemont High has there been a movie that tells it like it *really* was.<br/><br/>Seth and Evan (Hill & Cera) are those guys that were on the fringe in school. Not so nerdy that no one would talk to them, but definitely not one of the ""it"" kids. The plot, such as it is, keeps them on the move throughout the entire movie. Second Act Sag? Not here, baby.<br/><br/>And what can I say about the sublime McLovin? The casting department struck gold with Mintz-Plasse as the supremely nerdy but altogether lovable Fogell. You'll laugh so hard at his time spent with the police, you'll need some Motrin and an ice pack by the time you leave the theater.<br/><br/>Well written, well acted, and beautifully shot, this movie is 114 minutes of pure fun."

Sure, there's been some movies worth watching in the last few years, but this leaves them standing in the dust.

I can see kids in ten years talking with each other saying ""that's like what happened in Superbad!"" I recommend you don't drink any beverages during this movie, because you'll be spitting most of it out within the first ten minutes. It doesn't try to be more than it is, and I think that's what makes it so great. I don't recommend taking the kids out to see this movie, but it's pretty much a movie anyone can enjoy."

","Being a late high school comedy comparisons are naturally with American Pie (the first 2.... everything after that was rubbish) and the like but this is much cruder, much more foul mouthed, the characters are more realistic (apart from the cops obv.).... and a lot funnier as a result.<br/><br/>It's not just for teens /early 20's either... hell I'm 32 and roared my way thru it. Can still remember the using fake ids for booze, the parties etc, the hormones.... this film just nails it.<br/><br/>First comedy in a while that had me consistently laughing out loud.

"iKramerica-1","9","1","6","5 September 2007"," They understand the mind of the loser better than anyone...
","First, this movie is mostly fantastic, though slow in a few places, but will be a classic. If you don't want to read on, at least take that away and go see it.<br/><br/>Now, for a bit more depth...<br/><br/>The director/producers understand guys. They may not understand girls that well, but they understand guys. This movie was painfully funny in places because I knew those guys in highschool, I was those guys sometimes in highschool. Just like 40 year old virgin and knocked up, beneath the ""filth"" is truth about how not everyone is cool, not everyone can just have the world open up to them, how people can ""miss the boat"" in various stages of life, and yet how you can still try to work it out somehow and make the best of it. <br/><br/>Superbad is basically a more realistic take on the ""weird science"" model, and I had a good time with it.<br/><br/>And while yes, this movie could have been PG-13 without the over the top vulgarity, it was fine as a vulgar R because that IS how a lot of kids talk and act. Not all kids, no, but a lot of kids do, so why not just show THAT guy? Didn't you know THAT guy in school? I did. Seth (the character) is THAT guy. Evan wasn't really comfortable with the language, nor was McLovin, but they hang with Seth, so that's life. Should we not make a movie about THAT guy because he's vulgar? That's censoring life. Seth doesn't kill anyone, or intentionally hurt anybody. He doesn't glorify violence. So what's so bad about it? That he's a stupid kid with a potty mouth? Horror!<br/><br/>I think people who are offended by the reality of how some 18 year old loser behaves need a reality check themselves. Seth's behavior was psychological- obvious COMPENSATION for a life he never experienced. His reaction to his fear of girls and the unknown future was through swearing and pornography, because he didn't have any real life experience to go on. I mean, on more than one occasion, when presented with the reality of the things Seth talks about, he himself freaks out and nearly pukes. That's why it rung true, real, to me. It wasn't as gratuitous as the critics make it out to be. Seth was a real person. A real, really vulgar person.<br/><br/>But he ""learns"" a lot about life in 24 hours, and learns his lesson at the end, that girls worth dating may not really be into that sort of thing, and to just chill out. Unlike American Pie, these kids grow up versus just ""gettin' some"" and it rings a heck of a lot truer.<br/><br/>And of course, there's totally room for Superbad 2, where Seth visits McLovin and Evan for a weekend in college... ;)"

","In the opening rift between our heroes Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hil) on their drive to school, it is transparent from their explicit, crude, hysterical exchange that these graduating seniors want desperately to get laid before heading off to college. Theirs is a noble pursuit. Well, at least the honest pursuit for our geeky duo. Like the characters of ""Superbad"", the writers share their names, Seth Rogan (of ""Knocked Up"") and Evan Goldberg. Seems that ""Superbad"" is somewhat biographical, which lends insight. Amidst all the movie's outsider teen angst and exaggerated sexual bravado, Director Grag Mottola's ""Superbad"" is ultimately about growing up and lasting friendship. Mottola strikes a unique balance and tone. ""Superbad"" is definitely not for kids with its graphic language, sans any explicit sex; however, it is amazingly bitter sweet. For the creators of ""Superbad"", they ignored any conventions of taste and their story is boldly sentimental and personal. ""Superbad"" has an authentic ear for male teen speak. Smart and shy Evan expresses, ""Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and stuff That's the world I one day want to live in."" Yes, that would be a perfect world. There is a lot of funny stuff in ""Superbad"".<br/><br/>Evan (Cera) and Seth (Hill) are childhood friends, who are about to graduate from High School. Evan and Seth also face separate futures. Evan is going to Dartmouth in the fall. Seth, unable to get in, will attend State college. These final weeks of High School for them represent their last chance to ""score"" before heading to college and their new lives. Evan and Seth are uncool geeks, though in a charming way. Evan is the tall smart silent dork, who is sweet on Becca (bubbly and cute Martha Maclsaac). Seth is the smart ass overweight kid, who has a non-zero chance of getting laid on his own, and is such a drama queen about not getting any. Seth hooks up with pretty Jules (spirited Emma Stone) in home economics class. Her parents are out of town, and she is throwing a party. Jules would be indebted if Seth can obtain alcohol from her party, ""You scratch our back and we'll scratch yours."" Classy Seth replies, ""Funny thing about my back it's located on my"" Suddenly, all relies upon Evan and Seth's buddy Fogell (very funny Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who has a fake Hawaii driver's license as organ donor McLovin. For those who have seen the trailer, the classic line is: ""Yes, I am McLovin."" However, something ridiculously goes wrong at the liquor store, and officers Slater (Bill Hader) and Michaels (Seth Rogen) are called to the scene. From this point high jinx and debauchery abound.<br/><br/>Rogen and Goldberg's storytelling takes apparent tangential and hysterically tasteless turns, but there seems to be a point to the chaos. The telling betrayal is not about girls and sex, rather it is about friendship. To that end ""Superbad"" works, because of its strong performances and Mottola's natural direction. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are amazing comedic partners. Although, they have their bitchy moments, their underlying love for each other in spite of themselves makes ""Superbad"" strangely poignant. Cera has a comfortable charm and innocence even in Evan's most uncool moments. He has a great line while pulling himself together,"" Calm down She wants to suck on your"" We have a genuine affinity and familiarity for Cera as Evan. Hill as Seth has the funnier lines. Hill is an amazing dorky smart ass. He also wisely tempers Seth's vulnerable side, and shows Seth's human side when he lets his guard down. Christopher Mintz-Plasse practically steals the movie as ""McLovin"". Mintz-Plasse has a nerdy ease and brilliance. What he does is play Fogell as a good kid, who just wants to be cool. As Fogell, he finds that he is cool, when he isn't trying so hard. He has a hysterical scene where he dances with hot Nicola (Aviva).<br/><br/>The ending of ""Superbad"" got me. No worriesthis does not give anything away. With all the hilarious raunch, the message is that things happen when they happen, and given a choice good people will do the right things. I did not expect that from ""Superbad"". It is a laugh out loud expertly written movie, well worth seeing. ""Superbad"" is the smart, funny movie of the year."

","Film preview: SuperBad Starring: The cast is a talented ensemble of A-Grade comedy actors in Johah Hill; Seth Rogen; Michael Cera; Bill Hader and Chris Mintz-Plasse Director: Greg Mottola A fantastic new film will be hitting South African cinemas soon and it's called SUPERBAD. What you will see will rock your comedic foundation like never before. This film is the ultimate in crass, toilet-humour; hormone-driven, supercharged American comedy at its best. That's right guys, this piping-hot crude release from Sony pictures has exactly what it takes to thrill you, chill you and leave you in absolute hysterics. As the title of the film suggests - you gotta come get some! <br/><br/>SUPERBAD is an awesome flick, which has its origins with the producers of The 40-year-old virgin. Better yet, the screenwriters who brought you the inimitable Da Ali-G show - Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, have come together to produce this sparkling little gem of a film. You simply know it's going to be awesome - with a behind-the-scenes pedigree like that. It's America's most successful form of modern-day comedy and it will tear it up when it hits SA screens. With a modest budget of $20 million (USD) and takings in excess of $50 million (USD) in its first week of release in the US, this film has already scooped up significant profits. Essentially, this is the story of two socially inept teens about to graduate from high school. Evan and Seth are about to live life apart from one another as they move into college. Evan is the quintessential spineless gentleman - smart, sweet and terrified of women. Seth on the other hand is obsessed with sex and is what we'd call blatantly vulgar."
"KUAlum26","9","1","6","30 August 2007"," An Epic tale of a quest for booze and sex
","According to co-writer and co-producer(who gets to be a part of his own flick as Officer Michaels)Seth Rogen,the script for ""Superbad"" was a collaboration that had been worked on and ironed out over a decade ago(which,if Rogen's bio is correct,means he and his pal Evan Goldberg started working on the screenplay of a movie about high schoolers when they were still in JUNIOR HIGH school)and producing it into a film was something they had long strove for. If so,I believe the payoff will be to their liking.<br/><br/>Lifelong buddies Seth(Jonah Hill,a familiar tag-along of Rogen's,going back to ""Freaks and Geeks"" and most recently in the also hilarious ""Knocked Up"")and Even(Michael Cena,a part of one of my all-time faves ""Arrested Development"") are facing the end of high school and the very grim possibility that they will enter into the adult world as virgins. Being relatively normal boys,they think of almost exclusively girls,movies and music(and almost in disproportionate and descending order). To make matters worse,while Even has managed to get into DArtmouth while Seth has opted to try ""Local"" college,so their partnership seems to be about to be dissolved. To this end,they seek to lose their virginities with their respective girls:Seth's is Jules and Evan is Becca. They reason,to that goal,that if they can get their intendeds sloppy drunk at one of the major ""Senior parties"" being thrown,they will achieve this goal. Enter Fogell(Christopher Mintz-Plasse,a natural!),a whispery slight lad they hang with,who possesses some of the same delusions as Seth and Evan(and has a few of his own),who becomes their confederate in this mission. He becomes the point-man in their endeavor,and his owning of a fake ID from HAwaii that identifies as merely ""McLovin"" becomes both a comedic gem and a trigger point for the action that ensues from there.<br/><br/>The story takes place over the course of a little over twenty-four hours,and while actual events that take place(i.e.an armed robbery,cops who flout their authority and lack a fair amount of maturity themselves,getting physically hit by automobiles,taking a ride with an unstable stranger,potential date rape)in this story should not illicit laughs in normal conditions,they are handled with the right amount of delicacy and absurdity to make it clearly funny(albeit somewhat uncomfortable)in this film. Rogen and SNL member Bill Hader(as Officer Slater)are the perfect foils/accomplices as the morally challenged cops,and the girls the boys pair up with(the only name that sticks in my mind is Aviva as Fogell's lust target)are not easily pigeon-holed,which makes them dynamic characters to match the vibrant uncertainty of their suitors. Director Greg Mottola either is on the same wavelength as the writers and actors or has decided to quietly guide this project,but it works smoothly all the same. To me,this film was strictly OK in the first thirty to forty-five minutes but picks up energy as the action increases(namely,at the point where the liquor purchase occurs through to the next day). Some great lines and a general ability to tie together rude,crude and lewd obsession with a gentle sense of missing one's naiveté and youth. I feel like adults who remember their teen years(rather than kids still in or not far removed from their high school years,who will probably like this movie for the more obvious reasons) will in all likelihood TRULY appreciate this movie,since there's a real sense of dumb nostalgia that is celebrated here. To this thought,I'm in some disbelief of the fact that two pre-high school guys could've written this movie(or at least not in the finished form that we see),but then again,this might've been an evolving opus. Irregardless,while I feel like this film is more of about an 8.5,but I decided to round up,since there's so much energy and likability with the principals that you can't help but give this one a bump. While going for liquor and/or sex may not SEEM to be an epic adventure,anyone who can remember when it was so(or can appreciate it in the present)will love this movie."

This movie began with tons of humor thrown at you in your face one after the other and you laughed so hard, you couldn't gain your breath back to hear the next joke because popcorn was still stuck in your throat. Even though Judd Apatow, (Director of Knocked up and The 40 Year Old Virgin) was only a producer in this film, it still had all of the same humor from prior films with this cast. It was basically the same cast with a few new faces. This movie is definitely worth seeing. It has it's moments that are hilarious, but also has it's moments which it is so crude, it's not even funny. I love crude humor, but not this crude. At some points it was just plain dumb, but they managed to keep you in the theater when another hilarious part comes up. Still worth seeing.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","1","6","28 August 2007"," Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen should be behind every comedy
","Superbad...wow. Not only does it take the cake as best comedy of the year, it definitely ranks among the greatest comedies of all time. It's so good that anyone who takes it for what it is and doesn't analyze it bit for bit will enjoy it. On display here is masterful comic acting from all of our stars, not to mention an irresistibly sweet story with lovable characters, all out fun situations, and a night both the characters and audience will never forget.<br/><br/>Seth (Jonah Hill; Knocked Up) and Evan (Michael Cera; Arrested Development) are exact opposites. Seth is sex crazed and cocky, while Evan defines sweet and nice. Despite this, the two have been best friends all throughout high school. Now, as their senior year winds down, they realized that they need to throw one party to show everyone that they're more than losers, and to get in their respective crushes' pants. What ensues is the pursuit of alcohol through their idiotic and geeky friend Fogell, better known as McLovin (Chris Mintz-Plasse). Their adventures will lead them through crazy parties, ideas involving detergent containers, and two cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen, both of Knocked Up) who seem a little too immature to be cops.<br/><br/>You can't say enough about the acting, as everyone is stellar, with Chris Mintz-Plasse and Bill Hader stealing the show every time they're on screen...but this doesn't downplay the talents of Hill, Cera, and Rogen, as all three have great comedic ability. Cera finds ways to make the All American nice guy seem irresistible to women, the audience included, with his shy stutters and uncanny ability to make a simple short line hilarious. Hill's character has been seen before, but it's a breath of fresh air to see how he does it...I noticed a lot of lines that probably weren't meant to be funny, but Hill does things as simple as yelling to get us to laugh. Both of our leading men are absolutely great and have a bright future ahead of them. Chris Mintz-Plasse, or as I will refer to him for the remainder of this review, McLovin, is awesome. Despite this being his first movie, he, much like Hill, turns the simplest line into one of the funniest moments of the film. The guy is simply priceless in the most memorable comedic character of recent memory. Bill Hader and Seth Rogen...wow. Hader is simply hilarious as Officer Slater, and I'm now a huge fan of this guy, much like I am of Rogen. At first, it seems like Rogen plays the same character all the time, but I feel a difference in each character. He has a way of giving us a distinguishable characteristic in each of his characters.<br/><br/>Of course, Rogen doubles as a co-writer with Evan Goldberg (Seth and Evan...see the connection?). They wrote the film when they were a mere 14 years old, but it's brilliant comedy helped along by the new King of Comedy Judd Apatow. But when you think about it, it makes sense...teenagers writing a teen comedy. Why didn't anyone think of that before? Rogen and Goldberg write some of the best jokes I've ever heard, and just like The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, they range from layered and intelligent to childish, vulgar, and just plain stupid. Lastly, I haven't forgotten our great director, Greg Mottola. Motolla keeps us entertained for the entire duration, which is thankfully shorter than Knocked Up. There are so many subtle things in the movie that you can definitely see are from the director's mind. Motolla is just a part of this crowd after directing Cera in a few episodes of Arrested Development, and Rogen in Undeclared.<br/><br/>Superbad contains some strong and explicit jokes that aren't appropriate for most viewers. Anyone under 17 should wait until they're old enough to understand...or risk getting kicked out by the theater staff.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Probably the biggest surprise for me with the movies released this year so far was that a comedy was the best film I had seen, the award going out to Knocked Up. Not since The 40 Year Old Virgin had I laughed so hard at a movie before, and Knocked Up had more than enough outrageous moments to make it shine. But now there's a new comedy out and not only does it prove to be superior to Knocked Up but it manages to be one of the funniest comedies released, period. My friends, welcome to the masterpiece that is Superbad.<br/><br/>This comedy follows three seniors who could easily be labeled in the ""Loser"" section or whatever you'd call the low class of students. There's Seth, who's basically the outgoing leader of the pack who tends to talk a load of smack about just about everyone. Closest to him is his high school friend Evan, who basically fills the shy guy part. And finally, there's Fogell who you'll come to know as McLovin; think of him as the idiot who will crack you up in all his scenes.<br/><br/>But back to the plot, which starts off with Fogell talking about how he'll get a fake ID which Seth's ""love interest"" Jules asks him to buy booze for her. Before long Evan tells his dream-girl Becca about the scam and he becomes involved too. This then climaxes to a collection of totally outrageous events that hold our heroes from getting to the big senior party. But regardless of the point in the film, Superbad delivers tons of laugh out loud, crude humor that is sure to quench your thirst for great comedic entertainment.<br/><br/>The story and series of events in the movie is more-or-less an American Pie meets Harold and Kumar path. You've got some guys trying to get to salvation ala Harold and Kumar and hopefully get into a girls' pants ala American Pie. The movie also goes for a Knocked Up approach by being longer than most comedies, stretching to be just under two hours. While the film does have it's share of dull moments, the longer runtime ultimately brings about more laughs.<br/><br/>While many comedies tend to struggle with keeping the laughs consistent while keeping things interesting, Superbad manages to pull this off with ease. And it's not just the pacing and laughs it does well at, the film also does an excellent job in making you love each character. While Michael Cera's character is likely to get a lot boos, Jonah Hill and Mintz-Plasse manage to create two extremely likable characters, especially Plasse. There's also guest actors Seth Rogan (Knocked Up) and Bill Hader (Hot Rod) playing two totally hilarious and crude cops added for good measure who also turn out to bring about a fair bit of laughs.<br/><br/>In regards to characters, it's hard to really beat Superbad, because each one feels complete, even if a few could be dismissed as ""panzies"". Like Harold and Kumar and American Pie before it, Superbad makes the main characters and even some of the smaller ones all feel complete and believable. This is also something many comedies tend to miss the mark with, and it's nice to see that this movie made the characters so great.<br/><br/>All told, Superbad is definitely the best comedy released so far this year. It puts movies like Hot Rod to shame and manages to surpass the stellar and almost as likable Knocked Up. This is a movie that just about any comedy fan can love, even watching just the first five minutes can make you a fan. Thanks to great characters and constant laughs, Superbad manages to step up and earn itself a spot among the best comedies you'll ever see."

","This movie is about love and the ABSURD ways we find ourselves defining and pursuing it. It was in fact gross but still realistic which of course is what makes it so shockingly absurd. The combination of this and some very funny actors is what makes the movie so hilarious. This movie should not be mistaken for a typical raunchy teen quasi-American Pie film. If this was so, the hero of this film would be Mclovin for being the only one to achieve the goal the three had set out to accomplish, but his character was actually the lost soul of this film. Throughout most of the movie he finds himself under the companionship of two police officers who serve as the embodiment of what happens when we fail to understand the essence love. Ripping through the city, clinging to their memory of being young and wondering what went wrong, their journey is a chaotic spiral of destruction ending in the three of them staring at the burning vehicle which was the only thing keeping them from being completely stranded...lost. McLovin fails to see the illusions in their teachings and seals his fate as he unloads one of the police officers' pistols into the burning wreck. We feel a sense of victory when McLovin finally achieves his goal and we feel a sense of regret when they are interrupted. Our sense of regret should come in that we realize he'll never understand love. He's doomed. The others, on the other hand, never set out to do what they had hoped. The scene with Becca was hardly sexy. It was a satirical depiction of how distorted the concept of love had become to them. She utters ""I want you to be my first,""...as physically driven as she seemed, all she really wanted was for him to care for her. He knew this from the beginning, but still felt that it could only be achieved through sex with her that night. At this point the viewer is still unclear as to whether he is rooting for the couple to seal the deal which means that the distortion depicted is real...its absurd...its sick. Alas, what better than a spray of vomit to save the day. The sex doesn't occur, and our couple are both are on the path to becoming heroes-which they fully become when they meet in the mall later. They begin to rebuild their relationship on different terms, through mutual respect and genuine care. They have found a deeper understanding of themselves and of love."

","SUPERBAD was just hilarious. At first, I thought it was going to be another cheap ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" movie. I think the casts of Superbad should just be insulted if they ever hear that. This movie deserves the number one in the top two hundred and fifty. It played about the same time as I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and beats it.<br/><br/>I will tell you what this movie had that I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry didn't have. They do not lack the ability to be unintentional I think is the word I am looking for. Superbad was just unexpected. Everything went unorganized, but funny. Even the simple flashlight thing the police officers did made me go ""WTF"" but still made me go ""LOL"" at the same time.<br/><br/>This movie really doesn't have a plot. Actually, they do. The whole movie, they go through a lot of crazy situations to get alcohol for Juel's graduation party. Then in the end, everyone ends up getting laid or almost getting laid except Seth. But, who knows what will happen on the way home while Seth and Evan are on their way home?"
"Matt_Layden","8","1","6","23 August 2007"," Hill's Fast Comedy Style and Cera's Awkward Timing Make For Comedy Gold
","With only a few weeks of school left, two losers are invited to a party being thrown by a girl. They decide not to tell their even more of a loser friend about the party, until he mentions getting a fake I.D. Now they are able to buy booze for the party. The rest of the film follows their antics in trying to get booze and to the party.<br/><br/>Superbad was, much like Snakes On A Plane, a much hyped film on the internet. A red band trailer (uncensored) played on the internet and people left right and centre thought it was hilarious. With the success of Knocked Up, another Apatow production, Superbad looked to be not only a hilarious film, but a financially successful one as well. Now that the film has arrived, it seems to have lived up to that hype and better both 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up.<br/><br/>While I haven't seen Knocked Up yet, I stated that the 40 Year Old Virgin was the funniest movie of the last couple years and now you can put Superbad right beside it. With the comedic writing style of Seth Rogen, who also has a starring role and Apatow as the producer it was hard for this film to fail, considering the current high ride these guys are on right now. Add to the mix Jonah Hill and Michael Cera as two unknown leads with comedic style just waiting to be seen and you have one funny movie.<br/><br/>Hill's fast pace comedic style reminds me of Vince Vaughn and he fits perfectly here in the Apatow crew. Cera's comedy style is clearly in his actions and awkward pauses. Any fan of Arrested Development can see the same style here, which plays off very well with Hill's fast style. The third wheel Fogal, played pitch perfectly by Christpoher Mintz-Plasse, has a style that we've seen before, but taken to another level. Yes, he's a nerd that even nerds find nerdy, but Plasse takes that role and made it his own. It makes one think if they wrote it like that, or he simply took it over. Both Rogen and Hader play the not too old to party police officers who take Fogal, who's actually best known as McLovin, for a ride. With the trailer playing it up big on these two guys and the whole McLovin joke, one would expect it to run it's course fairly early. Yet these three make it fresh and funny with each scene.<br/><br/>While it is certainly not original by any means, it earns points for taking a tired genre (highschool kids wanting to get laid and drink booze) and make it relatable to all generations. Something that films from the 80's can't do with kids these days, but Superbad is able to do with the older crowd. It may be the whole retro feel the film has to it, from it's party styles to the clothes our two characters wear.<br/><br/>While Hill get's most of the good lines, Cera is the one who gets most of the laughs. His awkward sex moment plays as one of the funniest scenes. It's weird that they are both out-shined by Plasse. Who gets a little too excited in one scene when he has a boner. While both leads have had small fame before hand, with Cera on the hilarious Arrested Development and Hill as 'the fat guy' from recent comedies; it's easy to see this film as their breakthrough roles.<br/><br/>Much like Virgin, and I'm assuming Knocked Up, Superbad has a message. Yes, in this raunchy vulgar comedy there is a message about being yourselves and letting some things go in life. You can see these messages coming from the start, but that doesn't effect the film in any way.<br/><br/>There are too many moments of hilarity to pick just one. Whether it's Cera awkward singing or Hill's leg being used as a tampon, every scene is just as funny as the one before. The comedy doesn't really let up and is consistent all throughout. With Virgin running a bit too long and Wedding Crashers third act failing horribly, it's hard for comedies to stay consistently funny these days. Superbad doesn't have this problem and if you're a fan of the comedies I mentioned earlier, this film will not disappoint."

","I was pretty skeptical going into this movie as I always am with movies like this but I must admit this movie had me laughing from beginning to end. My only rule for a comedy is that if it makes me laugh it's good no matter how stupid it is. You can see the obvious influences of this movie are movies like Dazed and Confused, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Can't Hardly Wait, and American Pie. In terms of laughs this movie hangs with and probably exceeds them all. I can not look at Jonah Hill and keep a straight face, that guy should be a star for years to come. Every generation has a few movies that are quoted and quoted over again and I believe this will be one of those movies much like ""Dazed and Confused"" was for me. A great time at the movies."

Two Thumbs up!!!"
"mOVIemAN56","8","1","7","28 August 2007"," Dirty, very dirty but did I mention it is absolutely hilarious
","I must admit I wasn't expecting what I got out of Superbad. Seth Rogen is one of my current favorite actors in the comedy genre and I knew he would perform well and bring some laughs but as for the rest of the cast I was hesitant. Jonah Hill was completely unknown to me and I only knew Michael Cera as the cute, innocent kid from Arrested Development. I was very skeptical if they could bring the laughs that I desired. To top off my hesitation to watch this was the fact I am not a big fan of teen oriented comedies. But I gave it a shot and was on the floor laughing.<br/><br/>The story follows two seniors who are about to graduate from high school and who wish to do something 'superbad' before they graduate. Both seek to loose their virginity at a party a fellow student is having with the girls of their dreams. They are told to bring the large amount of beer required and both seek off to obtain. What follows is their zany adventure to obtain alcohol and make it to the party all with the help of their friend Fogell a.k.a. McLovin who has an interesting connection with two local police officers.<br/><br/>I must admit I was dead wrong about every question that arose in my head when I saw the previews. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are both more than capable of bringing tons of laughs to the screen. Even when opposite of more experienced stars like Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. Cera turned out to be more funny of the two though he is actually the quieter one. Hill got annoying a few times in which I had to turn away in disgust but was fine 90% of the time. I guess it was his whinny voice, it just got on my nerves. <br/><br/>The movie really did bring back my high school days and some of the crazy stuff that went on during it. Everything was quiet believable, maybe a little hard to come by but nothing seemed impossible that was portrayed in the movie. I guess that made the film even funnier. Everything made sense (unless you count the crazy cops). It really brings back great memories of times of innocence back when we were seniors in high school. Anyone wanting to get back to those times and remember high school memories way want to check this out.<br/><br/>Now the film is really dirty. They say f*** around 190 times and most of the time it's uncalled for or at least most parents would say so. There are sexual innuendos at every turn and sex is usually the reason behind most jokes. Heck the plot is based on getting laid. Therefore I would definitely say if you are a parent don't take your kid to this if they are under 16. They won't get it and they'll just learn a lot of words they shouldn't be saying yet. For everyone between 16-30 I think they'll find it hilarious. I don't know about older age groups though.<br/><br/>Superbad is funny though it is extremely dirty. It is one of the funniest films I've seen in years. It is a new teen comedy classic that outdoes almost every other comedy coming out nowadays. The film does drag a little in the middle. For about 15 minutes I didn't laugh but other than that the jokes are none stop. Everyone contributes to the comedy and makes you laugh at least once. Just a great comedy in my opinion and hope you feel the same way. Just go see it, give it a chance and you may very well just like it. Look at me. I was very hesitant and found that I loved it.<br/><br/>4/5 stars"
"raysond","Null","1","7","24 August 2007"," The raunchiest teen movie yet and it lives up to the title
","Words can't express how happy I am that ""Superbad"" exists. The first time I saw it left me with a wide smile grinning from ear to ear after I walked out the theatre. Probably the best thing to come along all summer. ""Superbad"" is another comedy that comes to us courtesy of Judd Apatow,the director of ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"",and ""Knocked Up"",the other great comedy of the summer of 2007. He was also behind the successful ""Talladega Nights"",last summer's comedy smash starring Will Ferrell. This time around Apatow only produces the film;the movie is expertly directed by Greg Mottola,who helmed many episodes of Apatow's short-lived Fox sitcom, ""Undeclared"". The real reason why the film ""Superbad"" has an ""R"" rating? Where ""Knocked Up""(which was also ""R"" rated) was sweet and occasionally profane,""Superbad"" is raging dirty and persistently foul mouthed and this was why this film is full of it including some strong language,not to mention scenes of heavy drinking and some graphic content and sexual references-all involving teens. Written by ""Knocked"" star Seth Rogen and his buddy Evan Goldberg,this was a movie that basically captures all the awkwardness of the teenage experience,and yet still manages to be as screwball and hyper-exaggerated as a Mad magazine layout. However,director Greg Mottola is visiting familiar territory here which is the high school hijinks movies which has been a staple of other teen-oriented movies from ""American Graffiti"" to ""American Pie"".<br/><br/>Here everyone is reliable and the situations rarely feel strained which makes ""Superbad"" a cut above every other teen farce film you'll see this year and is above most of the teen-oriented movies that I have seen not to mention one of the funniest high school movies since the original ""Porky's"" and to an lesser extent ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High""(or to an lesser extent ""Superbad"" pays homage to those teen comedies from the 1980's and 1990's). ""Superbad"" is both upfront and deceptive. The movie's raunch factor is so high and in-your-face that the gags depicted are too intense,but it helps with the hilariousness that ensumes. But there's more meaningful issues and amid the potty humor and outlandish sex jokes concerning female body parts. But it also delves with the joys of growing up as well and facing the prospects of adulthood. But let's not forget,the movie is flat out funny as all get out. But there are also some scenes that are as just as hilarious as they get and you'll be laughing out loud at some of the mischief these kids get into just to be in the crowd and crash the party and not to mention getting next to the hottie of their dreams. A smart as hell not to mention extreme vulgar,sidesplittingly funny that is one of the most enjoyable I had in ages and just to let you know this film has scenes of drug usuge too all involving teens. The funniest film you'll will see all year."
"peternickson","Null","1","7","26 August 2007"," Brilliant script
","This is the wittiest film to come out this year. The jokes are original and the script excellent. Don't be fooled by the trailers though, this isn't another teen movie in the vein of American Pie. Here, the main story is about male bonding. The plot is good, however it is the closeness between the two main characters that makes this film unforgettable. Breaking from the preachy ""what's the moral of this story"" norm, by the end of the film nothing new has been learnt by the main characters  it is the viewer who has learnt (or been reminded) of how close friends can be. The film is a snapshot of their relationship, which feels genuine and real."
"cultfilmfan","10","1","7","25 August 2007"," Superbad
","Superbad is a new comedy about teenage best friends Seth and Evan who will be graduating high school in a couple days and later going their own separate ways seeing as they both got accepted to different schools. Seth and Evan are very awkward and shy with other students and in particular the girls. After hearing about a party on the last day of school they make a plan along with another friend named Fogell to buy alcohol with a fake ID and bring it to the party and to later hopefully end up with one of the girls they each fantasize about. On the way to the party things go terribly wrong and Seth and Evan end up having one of the most wild nights of their life and an end of a school year that they will never forget. Superbad is about teenagers and the way the film is marketed it will clearly draw in the teenage crowd even though this film is not suitable for anyone under 17 because of the graphic sexual language and situations featured in this movie. The film was written by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg who apparently wrote the film as teenagers themselves and now years later their script has been made into a movie. Superbad really worked for me for many reasons. First of all I found it very honest and accurate and depicting teenagers and their way of talking and behaving during the high school years. It was so precise in it's attempt to do this that in ways it reminded me of my school days and some of the people I knew and grew up. And as for anyone who doesn't think this is how teenagers talk or act, then they certainly didn't go to a public or high school like I did where this behaviour is so common that it's almost a cliché. I also liked how the film covered the awkward parts of school and social situations as well as dealing with the opposite sex. The way Seth and Evan were so close to each other and avoided all other people to be with each other is probably also more typical of teenagers than most people would realize as well. Some younger people watching the film might wonder if Seth and Evan are homosexuals, but they are not and the film just shows how close they are and as a result of being so socially awkward they have alienated themselves from other people and just focused on their friendship alone which I mentioned above is not all that uncommon. The acting and strong writing also made the movie great because it all played out like a classic comedy that one would (even though they probably shouldn't be) watching as a teenager and like many of the classic teen comedies from especially the '80s such as the John Hughes films or even Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Porky's or from the 90's Dazed And Confused. This film will instantly become a cult hit and a favourite for years to come because of it's great comedic performances, writing and downright hilarious situations these characters are put in. The dialogue while very crude and raunchy is also very well written and believable as well. Not to mention the fact that many films about teenagers cast people who don't even look like teenagers (usually because they are a lot older) and this film has perfect casting. Superbad made me laugh, kept me entertained throughout and reminded me of some of the pleasant yet awkward times of my own years at school. This film along with Hairspray and Knocked Up (featuring some of the same personnel as this film) is one of the most entertaining and fun times I've had so far this year at the movies. And it is one of the best films of the year and destined to become a cult classic and rightly so."
"cruz3","9","1","7","24 August 2007"," You may laugh so hard that you soil yourself
","Without duplicating much of what is already posted, Superbad is a great ride. Jonah Hill hits a number of clever and vulgar high notes. Michael Cera does George Michael from Arrested Development, with a dark twist. The new guy - Christopher Mintz-Plasse - steals many scenes with his Stephen Hawking-as-a-drunken-teen looks and dialog. Seth Rogen and a whole cast of characters pop up and help keep things moving while the movie drags a little during the middle. Anyone with memories of friendship, the awkwardness toward the opposite sex, struggles to obtain alcohol as a minor, and about 50 other high school rites of passage will get a kick out of this. Think the 40 year old virgin meets Sixteen Candles."

","I've had the pleasure of seeing this gem a couple of times and I must say it is a terrific comedy with big heart.It takes tremendously smart writers,a smart director and clever actors to pull off a film that on the surface is so brutally honest and vulgar yet underneath carries a real universal mature theme that I found quite simply, f'n beautiful. I've seen it with a couple of different audiences and I could sense some people a little uncomfortable and offended at points, but that's the beauty of Superbad.It never at any point apologizes and consistently remains profane,clever and silly,yet strangely poignant.It also peppers in some hysterical quotes (e.g ""pubic salad with Seth's own dressing"") and some brilliant arcane references (""Jason Stone...who looks like f'n Zach Morris!"") .The side subplot with the cops was definitely a little over the top and zany,but I thought what the hell,it is a comedy after all and they were indeed hilarious(""prepare to get f***** by the long dick of the law!""...gold).Smart audiences who cherish their youth,appreciate friendship and enjoy a solid mix of raunch with razor sharp wit will surely be endeared by this fantastic flick.A comedy classic."

The actors representated their roles really well, Jonah Hill was quite good for a leading role, and Evan and McLovin were very good.<br/><br/>I can't remember a movie when everyone were so into it,the crowd was laughing non stop, cheering for the characters and gave it an applause at the end of the movie.

It's that type of movie that comes out once every couple years that you tell all your friends they have to see. I think it appeals mostly to the younger part of the population. Can't really see a 45 year old laughing at a lot of the jokes.<br/><br/>What makes the film really funny is the fact that that's exactly how a lot of conversations go for the younger crowd. The difference is the movie puts a really funny spin on everything. I was in tears more then once in this movie and my cheeks started hurting a couple times from smiling.<br/><br/>Definitely going to see this again before it leaves the big screen."
"DonFishies","9","1","7","20 August 2007"," An accurately vulgar and hysterical representation of high school woes
","After being disappointed by Knocked Up (only in terms of it not completely living up to the legacy I built up for The 40-Year-Old Virgin), I was a little hesitant to get as hyped up for Superbad. Yes, it looked downright hysterical, and yes, everywhere I looked someone was praising it for its comedic excellence. So rather than prep for another disappointment, I held hopes up at a moderate level (and excitement to see it even higher), and I came out finding what is probably the funniest comedy since Virgin.<br/><br/>Superbad tells the story of Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera). Both are in their dying days of high school, and have been best friends for as long as they can remember. With change on the horizon for both of them, they look to make the best of things, and attempt to make something of themselves with the girls they have been pining for. After hearing that Jules (Emma Stone) is planning a party for that very night, Seth and Evan are thrown into a day-long odyssey that will test more than just a few of their limits.<br/><br/>Yes, it does sound like every other high school comedy with the average kids wanting to lose their virginity before the inevitable trip to college, but there is something sweet and endearing at play here as opposed to the typical comedies of the American Pie form (and just about every 1980's sex comedy). Even though the characterization of anyone other than Seth, Evan and their sometimes friend Fogell (newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the one you may know as McLovin) is very one-dimensional, the film gets across the needed messages about friendship and morality. Yes, the trailer may suggest just one long party of a movie without any embedded implications or significances, but when it comes down to it, there is a certain maturity that runs through the movie that is completely lacking in any typical high school related comedy (exceptions including Dazed and Confused, Rebel Without a Cause, the heavily overrated American Graffiti, The Breakfast Club, Fast Times at Ridgemont High and not too many others). It helps itself to overcome the borders of the genre, and truly plunge itself into 'instant classic' territory.<br/><br/>What also sets it apart is the genuine authenticity of it all. Anyone who was not the most popular kid in high school can identify with the anxieties and desires of these characters, and if you were anything like me, can probably see a bit of themselves in them as well. Even when the film borders on being beyond raunchy, it still breathes an aura of reality and accuracy that is almost completely missing from the commonality of the genre.<br/><br/>What it does not share with those other mature offerings is its vulgar and witty attitude that runs non-stop throughout the film. For any Virgin or Knocked Up fan, you will be right at home with the vivaciously crude dialogue. And much like that movie, even the most offensive of jokes comes off as downright hysterical. There is not one moment in the film where I had more than a few moments to collect myself before laughing again. The punches come furiously, and often, within only mere seconds of each other. Whole pieces of dialogue flew by without me catching them because just about everyone was laughing too hard. Even at it's most genuinely passive or dramatic moments, the jokes keep flying out, and never seem to stop. And much like those two films, you will be quoting the movie endlessly right after watching it. I was a little frustrated with the fact that some of the very best lines in the movie were already in the trailer (and even more in the R-rated trailer), but thankfully there was plenty left just for the film.<br/><br/>What the film also shares with those Judd Apatow-produced productions is the general feeling of clunkiness right in-between the second and third acts. I noticed it after watching the Unrated Virgin, noticed it almost blatantly while watching Knocked Up, and noticed it rather subtly here. They all seem to share the problem that there needs to be a lull between these two acts where nothing seems to happen, and the whole film slows down as a result of it. Granted, it is far shorter an amount of time here than it was in the almost draggy Knocked Up, but it is here nonetheless, and takes away from the lasting effect of the film. Thankfully, the jokes continue to pop up during this time, so not everyone should get bored or antsy waiting for the movie to finally continue moving.<br/><br/>Acting wise, the film is solid. Hill and Cera play off each other brilliantly, and while they are not quite the odd couple, they do make a great mismatched pair. They handle the most lewd pieces of dialogue with class, and handle the deeply meaningful scenes so subtly that you can barely notice the fact that these kids are swearing at breakneck pace. Mintz-Plasse, although nowhere near as crafty as either of them, practically steals many of the scenes he is in. He has a very obvious easiness with the material, and I can see this guy becoming another potential wonder of the Apatow crew (granted he can overcome his almost instant cult stardom).<br/><br/>Supporting turns from Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as two unorthodox police officers weaving in and out of the boys' odyssey are fairly well done, if not slightly stretched out too far. I liked what they brought to the film, but I think they should have been in it a little less.<br/><br/>Despite a few minor problems, Superbad is the comedy of the summer, and possibly the best comedy since The 40-Year-Old Virgin. And even with its unrestrained dialogue, it can successfully enter among the greats as being one of the most legitimate depictions of life in high school.<br/><br/>9/10."
"cadfile","8","1","7","19 August 2007"," Ode to the horny nerd
","It seemed like ""Superbad"" stole stories from my life. If you are in high school and a nerd, sex pretty much consumes your entire being. It just seems so much fun and you want to do it, but you are a nerd so it won't happen unless you go to college or get the woman drunk.<br/><br/>One of your friends, the loud mouth king of the nerds, has a fool proof plan. You're so convinced it will work that you plan on what it will be like and anticipate it to the nth degree. Then when your potential paramour practically puts her boobs in your hands your moral center shuts everything down. You make excuses that you like your friends too much and it is no big deal.<br/><br/>That's why I liked this movie. It just seemed so real and so funny at the same time. There was various body fluids flowing, liberal use of all kinds of curse words, and some bits of homoeroticism. This film makes American Pie seem like Dawson's Creek.<br/><br/>My favorite part was a small one. After a class, Evan, played by Michael Cera, and his lust goddess Becca, played by Martha MacIsaac, are talking in the hall. It is the classic awkward ""I like you but am too scared to really say it"" talk. Becca throws Evan a lifeline - making it very clear that she wants him to ask her out, without saying the words, and he misses it completely.<br/><br/>There were some bits that were over the top but it was a comedy and not a documentary.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the movie is that it gave away a lot of the most funny bits in the trailers and cast plugs on the talk show. One real funny bit was available in full on the official website. These clips didn't give the whole movie away but did take something away for me."

","After reading man great reviews for this, I had high expectations, and this didn't live up to it. However, this is a very funny movie with a lot of great scenes, and something that many teen movies don't have..a heart. The main characters Seth and Evan are actually very likable, despite their flaws. Seth is the profane, sex starved fat kid and Evan, along with also being sex starved, is the shy and nerdy kid. When popular girl Jules asks Seth to the party, he claims he can get alcohol with his new fake I.D., when their acquaintance Fogel was actually getting one. The whole movie is about obtaining alcohol and getting to a party, but their are many problems along the way. Evan and Seth try to steal the beer, while Fogel is taken by 2 police officers to the party after being involved in a robbery.<br/><br/>""Superbad"" is obviously written based on true experiences, because so much of the writing sounded like true to life situations. The movie had me constantly laughing, but sometimes I couldn't bring myself to laugh at all the vulgarity, and I like vulgarity, but this was sometimes over the top. The characters were all really good, especially Fogel aka McLovin. Occasionally the two cops (Bill Hader, Seth Rogan) are annoying because they are just too stupid, but they mostly made the movie more enjoyable. When you go into ""Superbad"" expect a funny, good movie, but don't put your expectations really high (like mine).<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 110 mins. Rated R for nonstop sexual content, violence, language, nudity."

"Cineanalyst","3","0","4","22 November 2019"," Only Ordinarily Bad
","I panned ""Superbad"" in my review of ""Booksmart"" (2019), a movie that's essentially a gender-reversed, politically-correct updating of this teen party flick--not that there's much novelty in a coming-of-age comedy of drinking and sex played to pop music and full of gross-out and otherwise juvenile humor. Anyways, I don't like to dismiss movies I haven't seen in years, so I reviewed ""Superbad,"" and it's just as bad as I remember. Unfortunately, it's only ordinary bad, rather than super such, whereby one would've been afforded more laughter at its expense instead of the unreliable intended gags. Why, then, the picture begins by cribbing its title and opening-titles sequence from the blaxploitation film ""Foxy Brown"" (1974) is beyond me. What does that have to do with this generic piece on sex-crazed, middle-class white kids plus, seemingly more obtusely, two white cops. Bafflingly stupid.<br/><br/>Sure, I chuckled here or there at a few of the other stupid jokes, but most of them are duds. I couldn't care less whether the friendships are mended in the end, or whether the boys hook up with their dream girls--not only because the conclusions are obvious--but also because it's a thin veneer of a plot put onto a picture that follows the chaotic rhythm of partying. And, this is where ""Superbad"" is especially, well, bad. Looking back at this, there's a considerable amount of dead space; it isn't propelled forward by the soundtrack in the way ""Booksmart"" is, or as with, say, another Michael Cera-starring party picture, ""Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist"" (2008). ""Booksmart"" also benefits from some creative filmmaking, including drug-induced fantasy sequences and underwater photography. Other than Jonah Hill considering a few possible scenarios if he tries to steal liquor in one scene, there's nothing here that's not pedestrian. The camera views and cutting are entirely straightforward. To cite another film that ""Superbad"" references obliviously, the ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) of sex comedies, this isn't."

"daniel-389-59760","Null","0","2","20 May 2016"," A Bromance of Epic Proportions
","I do not believe that Seth Rogan intentionally meant to project the repeatedly veiled themes used throughout the film. I have no objections with the LGBT lifestyle, but I do take issue with is when writers like Seth Rogan write films specifically geared toward impressionable teenagers and uses ""comedy"" (if you want to call it that) to advocate date rape and ""bromances"". <br/><br/>The story focuses on the relationship of two men - a latent homosexual (Seth) and a cuckold (Evan). I would bring up McLovin, but I truly believe his character was one of the few who were likable. Without McLovin, this story would have been an extremely dark comedy, like the movies Happiness (1998) and Welcome To The Dollhouse (1995).<br/><br/>SETH:<br/><br/>Latent homosexual, Jonah Hill's character, (Seth) who is positively the most flamboyant, insecure, co-dependent, woman-hating, bro-loving obese manchild spends most of the film projecting himself as some kind of clever badass. He advocates date rape, obsesses about cocks, treats his friendship like a marriage, and several other horrible qualities that absolutely no man on earth should ever willfully possess. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill's obnoxious role in this film is the epitome of all that is disgusting and warped. I can't say with certainty if Seth Rogan wrote this character based on his own self or if the character of Seth is a collection of experiences. Seth Rogan wrote a character that shares his own name. Call it a coincidence or call it vanity.<br/><br/>The latent homosexual themes surrounding Seth are grotesquely obvious throughout the entire film. While some of these moments are absolutely hilarious, there is no denying the sad and lonely world that the character of Seth lives in.<br/><br/><ul><li>He had an obsession with penises, drawing them and looking at them, collecting them, hiding them in a lunchbox, and often drew them in an exhibitionist fashion (in the classroom). He continues the classroom exhibitionist behavior when he pretends to hump, lick, and ejaculate on Jules during home economics.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>He degrades virtually every woman in the entire film - Evan's mother, his home- economics teacher, Jules during home-ec, Evan's crush, Becca, the drunk girl who danced with him at the party, the girl who had breast reduction while he and Evan waited for McLovin outside the liquor store, and the list goes on.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>He obsesses over McLovin and Evan sharing a dorm at Dartmouth college. This is the most telling of all indicators. There is no logical reason as to why he should have cared at all that his two friends were sharing a dorm. It simply makes no sense. Sure - he can be jealous that they're going to a better school than he can go to, but why even make a sub-plot over the dorm?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Once Evan finally establishes a normal relationship with Becca, Seth ""matures"" and no longer projects animosity towards women or his friends - a subtle admission of defeat.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""We were supposed to go to college together. We talked about it while we were kids."" This entire scene is probably the most obvious moment in the film that Seth isn't just a co-dependent friend - he comes off as being territorial, entitled, and full on heartbroken. He's holding laundry detergent bottles full of beer, crying about girls, crying about how Evan is going to ""leave him"". Interestingly enough, during this argument between Seth and Evan, both officers Slater and Michaels engage in a flashlight battle and things quickly escalate. Officer Slater runs Seth over with his car, and then forces Seth and Evan to hold hands as he taunts them with his gun. While this is going on, Officer Michaels gives McLovin a cigarette and tells him to ""suck it long and hard"". Surely this is just for comedic value and nothing more than coincidence at best - right?</li></ul><br/><br/>EVAN:<br/><br/>An extremely effeminate, masochistic, stuttering cuckold who spends a majority of the film pacifying his friend Seth while he attempts to establish a normal relationship with Becca. Evan and Becca seem to be the most moral of all characters in the film, and they truly seem to long for one another despite Seth's attempts to degrade, sabotage, and insult both Evan and Becca's evolving relationship.<br/><br/>The saddest part of Evan's motivation throughout the story is that he allows Seth to instigate and antagonize a variety of unfortunate events that directly impact Evan's ability to establish a relationship with Becca. It is more than obvious that Evan does not want to get Becca drunk in order to have sex with her, and he mentions (several times) that he does not want to degrade Becca's innocence - despite Seth's repeated attempts to influence Evan.<br/><br/>Evan is such a pacifist regarding Seth's insecurities that he actually hides the fact that he is sharing a dorm with McLovin. This truly reveals Evan and Seth's awkward ""friendship"". Again - I see no reason why this ""room mate"" issue was written into the story. Seth could have simply been jealous that he couldn't get into Dartmouth, but instead Rogan goes a step further by adding a sub-plot involving Evan and McLovin sharing a room. Why does this bother Seth? How did Evan know that it would bother Seth? Is there more to the story that Rogan intentionally left out while at the same time intentionally including sub-plots that focus heavily on latent homosexual behavior?<br/><br/>OTHER OBSERVATIONS:<br/><br/>Bill Hader's character, Officer Slater, tells a story at the bar about his ""whore wife"" who had a gang bang on their wedding night. He also reveals that he was cuckolded and could hear his wife having sex with multiple men. Immediately after Officer Slater tells the gang bang story, his partner, Officer Michaels says that he was one of the men who had sex with Officer Slater's wife. This is an interesting parallel shared between the characters that is worth noting."
"Screen_Blitz","9","0","1","12 April 2016"," Funny, subversive, and surprisingly authentic take on high school life
","With Judd Apatow in the producer's chair, and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg as the writers, comedy fans are almost guaranteed for a hilarious, raucous experience. This comedy directed by Greg Mottola sets a funny and surprisingly realistic take on life as a high schooler and the utter debauchery that teenagers engage in to have the time of their lives while their days of drinking and partying like animals are numbered. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera play Seth and Evan (named after the writers), two high school seniors who have been the best of friends for a long time and are dealing with separation anxiety as they are anticipating their last school year together before moving off to separate colleges. With no party plans on their agenda, Seth and Evan are invited to a party hosted by their crushes Jules (played by Emma Stone) and Becca (played by Martha MacIsaac). But there is just one thing: they need booze. This is a problem since the fact that they are not 21 but luckily they get help from their geeky friend Fogell (played by Christopher Mintz- Plasse) who obtains fake IDs to mask themselves as of legal age. However, their mission to get to the party with booze becomes difficult when they face seemingly endless array of difficulties including Fogell's run-in with two amateur cops Officer Slater (played by Bill Hader) and Officer Michaels (played by Seth Rogen) who slow their plans down.<br/><br/>Teen comedies typically come in two different categories, one is a comedy where teenagers are involved in situations that are plausible in reality but typically don't happen outside of Hollywood films. Then there is a small minority of comedies that veer closer to reality, and this film sits more toward this category. This film written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg who were only 13 years old at the time they wrote this, blossoms an insanely funny, clever, and unlike most comedies, an authentic take on high school experience thanks to its smart script. The plot sets a fair demonstration of just about everything a high school boy fantasized about when it came to making his way into the popular crowd, ranging from losing his virginity to the girl of his dreams, to getting his hands on booze, to going to a party for a wild night of drinking, sex, and dancing to loud music; many thing teens and adults can relate to. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are both hilarious as their characters, and have plenty of funny (and vulgar) dialogue for the most of their time on screen. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is also quite funny and equally likable, especially during his moments with Seth Rogen and Bill Hader playing police officers. Their comedic chemistry together hits home and serves as a pinnacle of endless laughter as much as Jonah Hill and Michael Cera, plenty of vulgar sex jokes typical for the Judd Apatow fare here and there, most of the hit well while a few are a bit misfires. While these actors are funny, they also show a fair side of sweetness and smarts, particular when they come to clever terms with the girls of their dreams. <br/><br/>Superbad is super-funny, super-smart, and show Jonah Hill and Michael Cera at arguably their comedic talents. This movie makes a good pick for any comedy fans looking for a funny and subversive experience in a high school setting. Of course, this film is probably not for everyone, particularly those who don't bode well with raunchy humor and vulgar- filled humor by teenagers. Otherwise, this film is worth watching."

","Superbad (2007): Dir: Greg Mottola / Cast: Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse; Emma Stone, Seth Rogen: Surprisingly hilarious teen comedy that despite its preference for toilet humour, it is done with wit and intelligence. It transcends those thoughts and actions of our youthful desires. Greg Mottola's film stars foul mouth Jonah Hill and timid Michael Cera who risk much to achieve booze for a party in hopes of bedding a couple of girls. Setup stems perhaps from experience but structure is basically one failed booze steal after another until it reaches a surprisingly acceptable conclusion. Hill is terrific in his foul mouth demeanor as he sets his sights on one goal and risks much to achieve it. Cera is more reserved yet also discovers young love. Christopher Mintz-Plasse pretty much dominates the film as nerdy Fogell whose fake ID contains the name McLovin. Bill Hader and Seth Rogen steal scenes as two inexperienced cops out to relive their youth, and see the opportunity through McLovin. Emma Stone plays the standard yet well played inspiration of Hill. Martha McIsaac plays her best friend whom Cera is smitten with and who Hill dislikes. Director Mottola avoid sentimentalism and creates a film that plays both for theme and hilarity. Trash humour and a theme regarding that mischievous youth in us but also long term friendships that are there when things go from bad to super bad. Score: 9 / 10"

","Superbad is a really funny movie which one can enjoy with their friends. The movie focuses around three high school seniors who want to make it big on their one last high school party and win girls over. The trio: Seth, Evan, and Fogell are shown as the unpopular kids in high school who've had a bad luck getting girlfriends or getting invited to high school parties.<br/><br/>The movie is very different from the different movies of the same genre. For example, American Pie and all its sequels stick to sexual jokes for comedy whereas Superbad has pure slapstick comedy. The writers have done a great done writing the punches and the plot of the movie also moves along progressively which is missing in movies like American Pie or the 40 Year Old Virgin.<br/><br/>Overall, all the performances are hilarious and the characters are likable. Michael Cera plays the role of Evan and does complete justice to the role with his great comic timing in the form of awkward pauses and social anxiety. The goofy police duo excellently played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader adds an extra dimension to movie. Christopher Mintz steals the show with the character Fogell/McLovin. Jonah Hill plays Seth and just like his high school movies, he does a great job with his character. Seth and Evan's deep friendship is beautifully portrayed in the movie which is different from the usual comic routine of the movie. Emma Stone also makes an appearance in the movie and is a treat to the eyes of the viewers."

Evan is a bright young student whose outward sweetness belies his suffocating fear of heading off to college without his lifelong best friend Seth -- a hormone-driven mischief-maker who wasn't accepted to the same school as Evan. But Evan and Seth both know that college is a place of personal reinvention, and that if they are able to make that first leap together they will have forged a bond powerful enough to last a lifetime. Meanwhile, Evan and Seth's friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) acquires a hastily rendered fake I.D. that instantly endears him to a pair of truly irresponsible cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen). Penned by co-star Rogen in collaboration with former Da Ali G Show co-writer Evan Goldberg, the semi-autobiographical SuperBad was produced by Judd Apatow and directed by Greg Mottola -- who previously helmed episodes of Undeclared and Arrested Development."

This kind of unsentimental character piece needs a small tight focus so all of the nuances of the characters shine through. Michael Cera was great, and most should find his performance here just as entertaining as his take on George Michael.

It's about two best friends that try to get booze for the big party after high school. The problem is how they get the alcohol and what they do to get from point A to point B. When I first saw it, I didn't believe the hype. Yet the more I saw it, the more it made me laugh out loud. Its a rare occurrence to hear dialog this realistic with characters we care about from start to finish while keeping it consistently entertaining with the substance provided.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great late-night comedy with lots of genuine laughs and an honest film with a lot of heart. The casting is great, the jokes work, and the writing is superb. If you're with a bunch of friends and you want to have a fun night, pop this movie in and they'll thank you later!"

","The first time I heard about this movie, I had no idea what it was about. All I ever heard of it was that it was ridiculously funny, and after seeing it 500 times, I realized it was literally the most hilarious movie of all time! I like the part of when Fogell changes his name to McLovin.Hilarious! However, the cops in any scene was what made me laugh until I cried! The actors playing the cops are amazing; Bill Hader is my favorite actor of all time, and Seth Rogen is just awesome. Together, they make an unbelievably funny ""dynamic duo."" Jonah Hill is also great; him calling Fogell ""Fagell"" is funny. Michael Cera is adorable as always, playing the same shy teenage kid we all know and love."

","""Superbad"" is a really fun movie in which we watch two co-dependent high school seniors who spend one day to take as many alcohol as they can to go to a party and become famous. With this fame they want to start their sex lives and have some experience before they go to college.<br/><br/>In this movie we have a really hilarious interpretation's made by Jonah Hill and of course Michael Cera. I liked very much this movie because of the interpretations of the actors and because of the plot of the movie which reminded me a little bit the movie ""Project X"" which I found it equally great.<br/><br/>I have to say that I recommend this movie and if you see it with your friends as I did then it will be better."
"EddyIMDB","9","0","1","5 January 2014"," A Surprisingly Beautiful Tale of Friendship/ The Funniest Movie I've Ever Seen
","2007's Superbad meets the classic criteria of an Apatow production; it's a bit longer than the typical R-rated comedy, the film's writers (Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, not Apatow) try to mix raunch humor with some sort of message, and it has a cast of familiar faces including Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen. This film is hilarious. The entire film mixes immature and crass humor with a level of intelligence. The jokes alone make this film worth a watch and worthy of a relatively high IMDb rating. However, Michael Cera and Jonah Hill actually do some heavy lifting when it comes to acting. The unlikely duo play lifelong buds who have to deal with something very common to the American teenager: life after college and the changes that come with it. While McLovin and the immature cops (portrayed by Rogen and SNL's Bill Hader) make us laugh in the movie, Cera and Hill make us think about the life of the American teenager and make this a very good film."
"darius_suciu","Null","0","1","8 November 2013"," Very good comedy
","The movie was really great one of the best comedies I have ever seen. It really deserved a even higher score. Very good actors Nice script This is a movie you must see.Superbad is a teen movie. It also will draw comparisons to American Pie, in it's ""losers try to get laid"" themes, and occasional gross-out comedy. But the comparison is unfair - Superbad is a funnier, more subversive and more importantly genuine movie than American Pie or any of it's awful sequels were. The three central characters have a believable, likable relationship, that the film takes time to establish. Cera, Hill (who deserves special praise, for turning what could have been a really unlikeable character into a sweet, if loud-mouthed and crass, teenager) and Mintz-Plasse bounce of each other perfectly. The movie creates some funny situations, and more importantly, hilarious dialogue throughout. Aside from one comedic misfire - an overly long (and poorly judged) gross out sight gag involving a pair of trousers and a dance - Superbad had me laughing constantly. It's sweet, it's funny as hell, and it's established a load of new talent."
"GTeixeira","7","0","1","8 September 2013"," Much better than the usual teen comedy
","I always heard a lot of buzz about 'Superbad', apparently one of the best teen comedies of the last few years. Yet, as pretty much every film in that genre, the plot is merely a bunch of teens obsessing over partying, alcohol and sex (no drugs this time around, thankfully). How could this be any different?<br/><br/>I finally saw this film, and it was a somewhat pleasant surprise. The dialogue is the true highlight here: it is not forced, flowing easily and being funny without trying hard (Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are often hit-or-miss, and in here they succeed more often than not). It manages to be crude at times without upsetting, particularly in the cop scenes; however, some of the buddy dialogue between Jonah Hill and Michael Cera towards the end tends to get overly sappy and not funny at all. <br/><br/>There is not too much buffoonery like in 'American Pie' or other teen comedies (thankfully); even when there is, it is rarely overdone and tends to be overshadowed by the witty comedic remarks that accompany it.<br/><br/>The cast is mostly good. Having known the actors from their more recent films, I knew a bit what to expect. Michael Cera (whose acting capacity seems reduced to awkward teenagers, and not fun ones at that) wasn't good, but actually very irritating. Jonah Hill was surprisingly funny as a stereotypical tough-wannabee nerdy guy, and actually compensates for Cera (strange how Cera got all the buzz for 'Superbad', though considering how pretentious Hill ended up now him receiving it could have been worse). He also makes for some rather funny visual gags.<br/><br/>Christopher Mintz-Plasse is the one true stand-out from the cast (making it more surprising how he is the one with the weakest post-'Superbad' career), and the whole police spoof (cops played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) was hilarious (even the visual gags where good); the best part of the film to me. Emma Stone is excellent too, one of the few who managed make it big while keeping her talent, while the other girls (Martha MacIsaac and Aviva) make the little screen time they have be very worthy.<br/><br/>Easily one of the best teen comedies I've ever seen, it is good to see some of these actors before they made it big. The easy, laid-back and unforced dialogue by a mostly very funny cast is what makes this stand out."

All those actors are great and complete this brilliant comedy, the story is meh (thats why I took one star off.) but it is executed so perfectly that that doesn't even matter.

They are the SUPERBAD who would do any thing to get the girls of their dreams. And its their last chance so.... just enjoy d show..!!. Also Christopher Mintz-Plasse is outstanding as the third musketeer. It has all the teenage questions and anxieties with the funny twist. It has all the elements that a fun filled teenage comedy should have. The whole movie is awesome. My favorite of all time.

"thewillt08","10","0","2","15 August 2013"," SuperFunny
","It's no secret that I hate Michael Cera. Everything about the guy annoys me. His look, his voice, and especially the characters he plays. Despite the fact that all he plays is the awkward guy in a crowd but I have to admit it, the guy is really good at what he does. He was put on the map in Arrested Development. I didn't see Juno but I heard he was good. He stole the show in This is the End and he was a riot in Superbad. I finally saw Superbad after hearing so many good things about it and I loved it. A group of nerdy teenagers try to impress girls by getting alcohol for a party on a Friday night. Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and McLovin star as the group of High School seniors trying to get some action before they go off to school.<br/><br/>So, Michael Cera was really good but Jonah Hill deserves most of the credit. In the first act of the movie Jonah Hill is the fountain of funny. Everything he says is hysterical, especially in the store. Bottom line is that the first act of this movie is great. You can tell this is a Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg movie. This movie is straight up dirty. Hill tells a story of how when he was little he had a habit of drawing penises all day. The story of him and the little girl and the Christian principal was a riot. It was funny how the story went from bad to worse to extreme. As somebody who just graduated from High School it was very easy to relate to these characters as I myself feel like Michael Cera in this movie. <br/><br/>Let's talk about the wildcard in this movie, McLovin. McLovin isn't his real name obviously but it is the greatest fake name ever. I can see Rogan sitting in a room with his writers and saying, ""how about the name McLovin"" then doing his crazy laugh. Fake IDs are a stupid idea to begin with and this was the worst I have ever seen but then again that's the point. McLovin was about to get the run and, bam, the liquor store gets robbed and cops come in. Rogan and Bill Hader play the cops and these two with McLovin are one of the funniest trios I have ever seen. McLovin fits right in with the cops and they are too stupid to realize he has a fake ID. These three have one crazy night and it brings a great time and funny moments.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of Bill Hader either. I feel like he over acts in his roles and tries too hard to be funny but when he is with Rogan he is hysterical. He and Rogan play off each other so well and one isn't trying to beat the other one comedically. I also like how Seth Rogan is able to write himself in as a minor character and not take too much of the spotlight. The second act of the movie consists of Cera and Hill at another party trying to reclaim some alcohol and that entire sequence drags on way too long but the scenes with McLovin and the cops saves it from being a disaster. <br/><br/>Needless to say, the third act of this movie is so satisfying. The loose ends are wrapped up and all the characters get their just deserts. Throughout the movie we see tension between Hill and Cera with the future and their situation on girls. There are some problems and disputes that aren't resolved. Hill and Cera bark back and forth throughout the entire movie and they sort of have their fallout but it gets interrupted. The movie touches on problems Seniors in High School have but they aren't really resolved. The scene at the end with Hill and Cera before they go to bed does a little but I wanted more.<br/><br/>Like I said the second act is what hurts this movie the most as I felt it dragged too much. McLovin and the cops had a million different antics with the bar and the gun and whatnot while Hill and Cera are bunkered down in a house party. The scene when Cera is singing is hilarious but other than that I hated everything about it. I can't hate a movie for not doing what I thought would have worked but I just didn't like the second act too much. <br/><br/>Overall, Superbad is super funny. I laughed a lot in the beginning; it is a perfect movie for a guy my age. This movie will be over the heads of people around 14ish but that's why its rated R. Any normal person in High School or above will love this movie and laugh with every viewing. This movie is absolutely funnier in numbers as comedies usually are. Laughter tends to build off itself and others but I watched it alone and still laughed. Superbad gets the WillyT Comedic Crest for being endlessly funny and enjoyable. As a movie as a whole I got to give it the WillyT Honorable Mention. This was a good movie and I will watch it time and time again but I can't get over the plot holes and boring second act."
"ashleybrownmedia","9","0","2","11 July 2013"," Brilliant.
","It was summer 2007 and I went to the cinema with some friends thinking that we were about to see a horror film called 'Superbad'. Bear in mind that Cera, Hill and Rogen weren't that famous (at least in the UK) then - I had no idea what was coming.<br/><br/>Raunchy comedies about teens/young adults looking to get laid are nothing new. But just occasionally comes a film which has a bit more to it, a film which is as deep as it is 'gross-out' and funny. In the 1990s/early noughties we had 'American Pie' and now we have Superbad.<br/><br/>It takes place in the run-up to a big party (being hosted by the stunning Emma Stone) and a pair of losers are looking to get booze so that they can get their possible dates drunk and go from there. Their friend Fogell (who becomes McLovin) agrees to help them - but of course, as with all comedy, what must go wrong will go wrong. But unlike many comedies it never gets tedious.<br/><br/>Whenever I watch the ending I always wish there could be a sequel where the two characters are at college, but then again sequels often ruin good films."

"jcbutthead86","10","0","2","18 June 2013"," An Brilliant And Hilarious Teen Film. A Modern Comedy Classic From The Judd Apatow Group.
","Superbad is an hilarious Teen film and a modern Comedy classic. An amazing mixture of great laughs,great direction,a wonderful cast and a hilarious script,Superbad is my favorite Judd Apatow film and easily one Apatow's best films.<br/><br/>Superbad tells the story of teenagers Seth(Jonah Hill)and Evan(Michael Cera),two High School seniors and best friends who are on the verge of graduation who are invited to a High School party and have to get beer and alcohol. With the help of their friend Fogell(Christopher Mintz-Plasse),Seth and Evan have to deal with growing apart,dating their High School crushes and getting into hilarious and bizarre situations in one crazy night.<br/><br/>Superbad is a brilliant and funny laugh a minute Teen Comedy that is an instant classic from the moment you watch,an hilarious Comedy that follows the great,grand tradition of other great Teen films like American Grafititi and Dazed And Confused taking the laughs and heart of those two films and mixing them with ingenious laughs of Animal House. The first five minutes of Superbad set the tone for the rest of the film where in Superbad there are jokes and laughs that are just non-stop and like many of Judd Apatow's films mixes raunchy Humor and wild,over the top characters with honesty and great depth. The great laughs and moments in the film are driven by the characters and their dialog which are in the real world but the characters and dialog is so wild and over the top you would think that Superbad took in an alternate reality that is very stylized and any that can happen will happen. Although the film has a lot of Comedic dialog,Superbad also has a lot of Slapstick and physical Comedy that is done so well that the great Slapstick Comedy will have you in tears because of the absurdity and wild crazy insanity of each moment. Superbad is great Teen film because like some of the best Teen films the characters while over the top are real and seem like true and accurate depictions of Teenagers and the dialog which is how Teens talk and even though there is sexual related dialog and some sexual activity there is no nudity in the film. Another reason Superbad is great Teen film is that there are no typical Teen movie conventions in the film,there are no popular and evil Stock Teen movie characters such as Jocks,Cheerleaders or other Teen stereotypes in the film because Superbad is told from the outcasts P.O.V. I'm so glad most of the typical Teenage conventions are pretty much gone,not mentioned and nonexistent. What I also love about Superbad is that this film takes place during the course of one day and night because when a film is set during one day anything can happen in one day that can change a persons life and in this film the things and events that happen in this film wild,funny,unpredictable and very surprising. The screenplay by Seth Rogan(who also co-stars in the film)and Evan Goldberg is fantastic and well-written and has memorable dialog that will be quoted for years. The three main Superbad characters Seth,Evan and Fogell are great Teen characters we can relate to because when we watch the film we feel we knew the main characters in High School because they are outcasts who don't necessarily want to be popular but just want to date their crushes and be liked before their High School days end. All three characters do wild and crazy things but they are likable and have multiple-dimensions that make them rise above who and what they are. At 114 minutes the film Superbad moves at a great pace and the film has a wonderful energy that never slows until the end and you are glued to the screen because you never want the film to stop. The ending of Superbad is funny, wonderful and sad because when you watch the film you going to wonder what will happen to the characters Seth and Evan and Superbad leaves the viewer with a lot of questions. A great ending.<br/><br/>The whole cast does excellent jobs in their roles. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are brilliant and hilarious as Seth and Evan,with Hill and Cera bringing laughs,depth and great chemistry. Christopher Mintz-Plasse(in his film debut)gives a funny and excellent performance as Fogell AKA McLovin,Seth and Evan's friend. Bill Hader(Officer Slater) and Seth Rogan(Officer Michaels)are funny,delightful and over the top as the cops who have fun with Fogell. Emma Stone(Jules)and Martha MacIsassc(Becca)are fantastic and beautiful in their roles as Seth and Evan's love interests. Aviva(Nicole),Joe Lo Truglio(Francis The Driver),Kevin Corrigan(Mark)and Clement E. Blake(Homeless Guy)give fun performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Greg Mottola is wonderful,with Mottola always moving the camera and giving the film a great energy and visual style. Great job,Mottola.<br/><br/>The score by Lyle Workman is great and memorable and reminds me of the scores from the 1970s. A fine score by Workman. The soundtrack also has great songs by The Bar Kays(Too Hot To Stop,Soul Finger),Rick James(Bustin' Out(On Funk),The Four Tops(Are You Man Enough),Ted Nugent(Stranglehold),Van Halen(Panama),Curtis Mayfield(P.S I Love You),The Notorious B.I.G(Big Poppa),Motorhead(Ace Of Spades),K.C And The Sunshine Band(Boogie Man)and more. Great soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Judd Apatow,Comedy films or Teen films,I highly suggest you see Superbad,an hilarious and funny modern Comedy classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

"canadian58","10","0","3","27 March 2013"," A teen party movie full of wit and heart.
","Most all teen party movies follow a trend- booze, sex, nudity, no plot, pathetic attempt at humor. Superbad is the exception. Given its premise, this movie is witty, hilarious, and even touching at times.<br/><br/>Three high school seniors trying to get alcohol for an underage drinking party so they can hook up with the girls they like. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera make the perfect best-friend pair, Seth and Evan, as they are about to graduate and go off to different colleges. This party is their last chance to score with their crushes. Fogell is their only hope for getting booze, as he has a fake ID in which he is named McLovin, a 25-year-old from Hawaii. Of course, everything that can go wrong does.<br/><br/>I'm not much for these teen party movies, as they are all the same, unfunny, gross, a waste of time. I caught Superbad on TV, and I'm glad because I wouldn't have picked it up otherwise. <br/><br/>It is full of sexual dialouge, f-bombs, and drawings of penises, but to my surprise the sex was very minimal. No nudity, but it's not needed, unlike most other movies in this category which need lots of boobs just to get people to watch them. Superbad stands on its own with clever humor, great acting, and a wonderful story of friendship. 9/10"

The movie is also undeniably lengthy, some scenes or story lines are just too long, like the cop road trip with McLovin for example.

","Nerdy high-schoolers attempt to get in with the hip crowd by promising to supply booze for a party. The cops played by Hader and Rogen are funny, particularly in their first appearance as they investigate a robbery. Other comic highlights include the whole business with the fake ID and the somewhat disturbing segment about young Hill's obsession with the male organ. While it has many amusing moments, it goes on much too long for a comedy. The filmmakers attempt to make the scenes of male bonding touching, but they are rather contrived and lame.

","I am not as much of fan of this high school themed movie as I am of Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but Superbad does a good job of fitting into the realm of the other two. It is about the end of high school and not knowing what the future will bring. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera star as Seth and Evan, two high school best friends who know that they won't get to see each other in the future after high school. Hill and Cera are believable in these roles and give us characters that we can all relate to. Along with them is a future movie icon who will always be known as McLovin. McLovin gets a fake ID made so that he can buy booze. This movie fits the realm of other great Frat Pack movies being fun for everyone, many laugh out moments, and appearances from familiar faces such as Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. This is a must see for fans of the Frat Pack."

","Superbad must be my favorite of all of the raunchy sex comedy films. It is undeniably funnier than 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, and surprisingly, it hit a bigger note with me as far as heart. I mean, the first half of the film the film portrays some very gross and sex related comedy, and I have to say, it had me laughing uncontrollably. The second half of the film is not as funny as the first, but as the film ends, it portrays the heart it had from the beginning. The film did have flaws of course, while some of the cop scenes were hilarious, their gags got old as the film started to end, but thankfully we always had the Seth-Evan relationship to keep the film going. All in all, this film is funnier than Mottola's Adventureland, since it is more raunchy, but both films to me are very successful accomplishments. Superbad is Superhilarious!"

","Superbad Review Directed by: Greg Mottola<br/><br/>Three epic guys in one epic movie!<br/><br/>If you read the title of this review and smiled, laughed, or chuckled, then it's either you're weird, funny, not boring, have a sense of humor, or you're awesome. Why would you be awesome, because you watched Superbad. Forget The 40-Year-Old Virgin, forget Knocked up, forget You Don't Mess with the Zohan, forget Zombieland (on second thought, don't forget Zombieland), and forget Borat, Superbad is the real deal. Now it might take a little bit time for it to grow on you (First time I saw it, it was meh, second time I saw it with a bunch of friends, it was bad(mostly because they didn't laugh so I didn't want to look like and idiot), but the third time, Best Movie Ever). And if you know the name ""Judd Apatow"" who worked on 40-YOV, Knocked up, Zohan, and Pineapple Express, then you will love this movie. Let's jump right in. -------------------------------------------------------SPOILER LINE------------------------------------------------------ Our main characters are a threesome (no, not that kind of threesome). It's an ensemble cast with three main characters. From my Juno review, you know I'm a big fan of Michael Cera (Year One, Juno, Youth in Revolt) and he plays another awkward character, Evan. He's the guy who wants this girl but he's too awkward and nice and stuff. Jonah Hill plays another character, Seth. Now Seth can get on your nerves if your nerves are easily got on (did that make sense? No!). He whines and b*tches every single second of screen time in the first two acts of this movie. But if you look at it in one point of view, that's the joke. His rants, an F-bombs, and verbal abuse are what makes him funny. If you don't find that funny, then better stay away from this movie. He's also an extreme pervert and if you know (from what I heard, haven't seen it yet) the film ""American Pie"", you know what sex talk you're getting into. If American Pie is to the 90's, Superbad is to the 00's. And the last and definitely not the least is Fogell AKA McLovin. He is the part of this movie that squirmed itself into pop culture and made this movie so iconic. He is the reason why this movie is so epic. He makes this movie even better than he already is. Basically, he gets a fake ID full of ""strategy"". He makes his age 25, instead o 21 like everyone else. He poses as a Hawaiian Organ Donor. And last but not least, he named himself McLovin. No first name, just McLovin. How badass is that? The supporting cast is just as good. Let me focus on two of my favorite characters in the movie. Probably the dumbest cops you'll ever encounter, Officer Slater and Officer Michaels. Officer Slater is played by Bill Hader and he definitely makes this movie better (w00t! I rhymed thrice!). Their first scene in the movie is found in those video dictionaries beside the word ""LAUGH YOU ****ING ASS OFF"". His on-screen chemistry with Officer Michaels played by the equally hilarious Seth Rogen (Monsters vs. Aliens, Knocked Up) is fantastic. Not only do their personalities collide but their personalities also contradict that of a cop. And when combined with McLovin's presence, these altogether create some of the most hilarious scenes in any comedy you will ever watch. One epic guy with two epic police officers. There's also Jules and Becca, the two girls Seth and Evan want to beep respectively. They're the typical high school girl but in the third act of the film, we finally get some depth to Jules. Becca however, well she's drunk for 20 minutes so that's depth for 5 minutes. They don't hurt the film and Jules in the third act was hilarious. The Becca and Evan scene however was just awkward the first two times but watching it alone was hilarious. Now, what is the story of this movie? Not much, it can be broke down into this: Three guys are graduating high school and they want to get laid before college. The only way to do that is to buy alcohol for Jules' grad party and get them whacked out of their minds during the party. But when disaster strikes and Fogell is separated from Seth and Evan and joins in with the two cops, chaos and hilarity ensues. Pretty basic story. Pretty hilarious movie. The acting in this movie is decent. Nothing Jack Nicholson or Morgan Freeman but believable enough. And besides, who goes to a comedy to look for Oscar-winning performances. The direction of the movie is awesome. The soundtrack increased the movies enjoyability. 70's and 80's music that blend with the visuals to create something special. Speaking of visuals, this movie depicts high school life to getting beer whilst underage life perfectly. The cinematography and lighting are a bit wobbly and ??? at times but nothing too bad. Now for the genre, Comedy, obviously. This film isn't really a drop out of your seat hilarious but it is LOL worthy and a few scenes with McLovin and the cops are ROFL worthy. You won't get bored. I don't get people who got bored by the middle act. It was never boring. This might be awkward to watch with your parents or you younger brother or sister. I suggest watching this movie with people of the same age. This is rated R for a reason. Sure, I'm 13 but I'm mature enough to know that underage drinking and ****ing is bad. But I do caution your younger kids, they might think since McLovin did it, it must be cool. No kids, not cool. Overall, I give Superbad, an 80% awesome. Trust me, that's not low (P.S. If you enjoy drawings of male genitalia, I implore you to watch this movie)"

","Superbad is the gold nugget of teen high school comedies that has sorely been missed since the American Pie days of the late 90's. I was anticipating this movie during the last couple weeks, having seen hilarious bits and pieces from the trailers and online ads, but I had no idea it was going to be the definitive high school movie of this generation.<br/><br/>What makes Superbad so super-badass is it never for a second relents on its brash and lewd mentality and humor. Written by Seth Rogen (The Knocked Up dude) and Evan Goldberg, who supposedly been writing this semi autobiographical yarn since their high school days let their inner teens pour out in all its uncensored glory. The script is written in such crudeness, its almost ridiculous that they got away with it, yet not once while sitting in the theater did I get offended or feel it was ever unnecessary. Probably because this kind of language does exist in today's high school world, and even if it's a bit exaggerated, coming out the mouth of lead actors Johah Hill and Micheal Cera its sounds almost sophisticated.<br/><br/>Even though it was only produced by Judd Apatow (Director 40 year old Virgin, Knocked Up) he seems to be the iGeneration's/millennial's John Hughes; recently standing behind hit after hit of teen and adult comedic movies. His device of choice; the realism and awkwardness of the coming of age (or in 40 year old virgin's case, the awkwardness of never have came of age). Apatow, who started this type of writing during his tenure on ""freaks and geeks"" and ""undeclared"", has discovered that some of our most hilarious moments come through the nervous and awkward situations of our adolescence. Seth Rogan and Evan Golberg continue in this vein as their lead characters (named after them) suffer through the utter painful events of trying to hookup with their dream girls at a party and be recognized as somebody's before high school is out.<br/><br/>It is so straightforward in its motives, and dialogue so disgustingly witty that you hardly notice the absurdity (and immorality) behind its non stop hilarity. I mean Evan and Seth's whole motive is to get two girls drunk enough so they can hook up with them. Not to mention two cops who offer a horrifying portrayal of what being an officer of the law is truly about. Handled incorrectly this movie could have set off a lot of bad reaction, yet this movie is so unfalteringly funny with such endearing characters its hard to take it all to serious. It excusable cause at its core it is a movie about the value of friendship and how it is as important as any other relationship you may have in your life. So see it with a good bud, and don't be afraid to tell him/her you love 'em, even if their name is already McLovin'."

","I really really enjoyed this film. I found it very funny and highly entertaining which is all I have ever asked for from a film. So the situations are so totally out there that they will never actually happen but its a film!! One of the great things about films are all the impossible, stupid and down-right bizarre situations are completely possible! I'm a fan of Michael Cera and though I have only seen Jonah Hill in this I enjoyed his performance. Its a light feel good film that you can watch time and again. As for the people bashing the characters of Seth and Evan for being ""gay"", I think they're reading a bit too much into the relationship and seeing things nobody else is seeing. Guys say they love each other, especially when drunk! No homo-erotic tones and if there were, so what? As for the language, the f-word is thrown around quite a bit but no more than I have heard in my everyday life while I was in school. Its what people say a lot, get used to it, dears...... The film is funny, entertaining, a bit silly but that makes it all the more endearing"

","Although this is a teen movie, and yet another teen ""gross out"" movie, I'm in my 50s and enjoyed it very much. However, I will add a warning to that: my wife and I first rented the video, and couldn't watch it because it was too graphic and gross, but I ended up seeing the ""sanitized"" version on TV which I liked very much. It all goes to prove that you really don't need the extremes to be funny. <br/><br/>It also proved that not much has changed since I was a teenager. The story line is simple and basic: the nerdy kids who are going to be graduating from high school and going their separate ways are looking to have a booze-fest party, and get lucky with some girls in their class. <br/><br/>What distinguishes the movie, however, is the characters themselves, who essentially start together, then go their separate ways in the night of partying at unexpected places, and eventually linking back up in the end. Their journeys are hilarious, particularly that of ""McLovin"" who creates this identity on a fake ID and ends up spending this night in the company of two totally inept cops. <br/><br/>It ends up as a fun adventure, with a lot of laughs, nostalgia for those of us who are older, and of course, a happy ending after all the uncertainty of the boys big night out. It remains unique however, and shouldn't be compared to ""American Pie"" of other teen movies of this genre due to that, but if you like those, you'll like this."
"pushfrog_2000","4","0","1","27 January 2010"," McLovin carries the film, but only so far
","Coming into the movie, I thought I'd be watching a funny modern rendition of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" splashing over a plausible, probably-inspired-by-real-events buddy flick -- as so many of my friends had claimed it to be. Instead, what I got was a movie that had more foul language than meaningful dialog, misogynistic sex jokes that leave little for the female audience to appreciate, and several moments where the movie could have really soared, but instead fell flat. In essence, what I got was a poorly executed potential of a comedy.<br/><br/>McLovin was the saving grace. He was unabashedly geeky, and made it farthest with a girl -- which was a victory point for everyone, since he was the underdog amongst underdogs and also the most respectful of girls (despite him being mesmerized by his crush's thong). Every scene that had him in it, no matter how zany or fantastical, was hysterical.<br/><br/>Seth and Evan were boring, forgettable characters. Although knowing some people like them in real life, I could not relate to the characters at all, and was more than a little bit put off by them sexually objectifying all the women, even the moms.<br/><br/>So, as a comedy, it fell flat. However, as a social commentary, I think it's perfect. We live in an age where the police are considered villains or jokes, where spitting on people and making plans to date-rape is ""cool"", where best friends can't properly express their feelings towards each other without being labeled ""gay"", where criminals are allowed to get away, where pretty girls can be as insecure and unsure as the nerds, and where the adults are no more grown-up than the teenagers.<br/><br/>For that, I will cherish Superbad. Because as sinfully unfunny as it was, it's a wonderful documentary of life in high-school, 2007."
"zibonk_416","8","0","3","13 January 2010"," Absolutely accurate (to an extent)
","We all must admit that somewhere somehow in our teenage years we have had an experience like this one. Maybe our experience didn't contain every single ridiculous event that was shown in the movie but we can all agree that at one point we have had one of these how are we going to pull this off moments. The preparations that teenagers go through simply for one night of drunken shenanigans I found to be very accurately portrayed in this movie. Jonah Hill provides an accurate depiction of a teenager who has only the simplest of ideas in his head; parties and girls. His friend played by Michael Cera plays the role of the more responsible yet still slightly immature teenager. What really struck me as realistic was the addition of McLovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse)who rounds out the group of friends as the one who is a member of the gang but at the same time excluded from the group.<br/><br/>However realistic the movie might have been in terms of portraying teenagers getting ready for a big night out, Seth Rogan couldn't help but add his dash of unrealistic humour to the mix. The notion of two on duty cops knowingly taking someone underage around with them on drunken adventures, while hilarious, is incredibly improbable in the real world. All in all the mix of realism combined with the continuous hilarity that ensues throughout the movie, creates an incredible comedic masterpiece."

","Superbad has a ton of memorable things about it. For instance, that Mclovin guy. Everyone talked about him for a long time. Now I thought this was a great movie, but it's not the best Judd Appatow has been involved with. And this gut has done some excellent films. <br/><br/>2007. What a year for Judd Appatow. He directed Knocked up, his best film, he did Superbad, and he did the ridiculous but funny Walk Hard. In 2008, he did everything. Though not everything was that great. A couple of cheap comedies and one fantastic one(Forgetting Sarah Marshall). In 2009, he came out with Funny people, which I thought was disappointing and slow but still very funny. and he also did Year one, which I didn't like.<br/><br/>I love it when Appatow directs a film. That is Judd Appatow at his best. In most of his films, he usually adds a heart of some sort. He didn't even direct Superbad, and it had a heart. Judd Appatow is involved with so many movies now days. It's tiring. Only cause most of them aren't that great. <br/><br/>Superbad is for the most part. It's the story of Evan and Seth(Michale Cera and Jonah Hill, both characters based on Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the writers of the film). Evan and Seth are two dorks on the verge of graduation. Both have one goal on the last party of the year: sex and boose.<br/><br/>But they most likely aren't getting in. Because they are... well, dorks. So when Seth is asked by his crush(played by the very good Emma Stone) to pick up some liquor for the party, him and Evan take the chance cause they believe that they can get laid.<br/><br/>But how will they get it if they are underage? I'll tell you how. Their friend Fogell (played by at a time newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse)gets a fake ID and tags along with them. Except when the liquor store is robbed, Fogell, AKA Mclovin is taken with the cops(played greatly by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) and they also go on a journey of some sort.<br/><br/>This is a hilarious film. Can I say it's art? Well, I am close actually. This is a comedy with a heart, but a dirty mouth. Oh so dirty. I went to see it with my parents when it came out. Awkward. So Two years later I finally got around to seeing it. Personally, I think this isn't The Best film Judd Appatow has been involved in. But it is a very good film.<br/><br/>Superbad: A-"
"tee_i1","9","0","3","14 November 2009"," My favorite movie.
","To start off, this movie provided the viewers with the most hilarious and crude jokes ever. It stared Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as the three main characters, who were friends in high school and were about to graduate. These characters desired to lose their virginity before entering college, but unfortunately they were out of luck.<br/><br/>I love how these three actors performed their roles throughout the film. With absolutely perfect acting, they are the ones who brought fame to this film. My favorite character in the movie was Jonah Hill who played Seth, a high school senior. His style of talking and reflecting the way a teenager interacts in order to fulfill his desires was just unimaginable. His acting skills were just fantastic. The second character in this movie was Michael Cera, who played the Evan, Seth's best friend. He pretty much had the same desire in the movie but stayed quiet and looked for the right time to make a move. Just to impress the girl he liked, he requested to buy her alcohol for the party. I was really fascinated by the dialogues delivered by the characters. It was mostly profanity, but in a funny way. Although the dialogues contained profanity and curses, the characters set them in the movie the way they should be set in order to attract viewers. The lesson I learned from this movie is that a teenager should not engage himself/herself into activities that would cause him/her risking his educational career that would lead to problems later on in life.<br/><br/>This movie is a good example of a complete entertaining story and is a memorable drama. It is as interesting as one would expect a comedy picture to be."

"garydiamond","8","0","3","4 January 2009"," A superior teen comedy.
","I thought I'd grown out of these kinds of films the moment I turned twenty. Juvenile jokes and binge-drinking plot lines surely get old after a while - something to be enjoyed thoroughly at the time and discarded in favour of more ""mature"" pictures later on. I know I certainly feel this way about American Pie, and I only saw the first two of those.<br/><br/>Every so often though something like this turns up and puts a fresh spin on what is a faded and often cliché-laden tale. Something which comes close to being more than just another teen comedy which plays out with complete predictability and forces the more experienced movie-goer to grind their teeth at the same old archetypes being played out by actors who really can't. Superbad is one of those.<br/><br/>The plot is convoluted so much that it becomes part of the humour to see where it'll detour to next. This isn't a bad thing - for those who usually find this genre to be stale, it keeps you on your toes. Luckily this doesn't mean the story becomes so wacky it doesn't have a heart because it does, and there are actually some subtle lessons about not making mistakes that'll stay with you your whole life here, especially towards the end. It's a good balance and with any luck will prompt more than a few ""I've been there"" moments from viewers.<br/><br/>For those who seemed to think that the movie was expletive-laden - and worse, full of profanity to cover up poor writing and acting - think again. Yes there is a little, but so what? I've never met anyone of the age portrayed in the picture who doesn't cuss a little, and here the characters are witty and amusing when they're supposed to be. I can't often say that about members of the target audience.<br/><br/>Of course, having a likable story and witty jokes is one thing. Having a decent set of actors is quite another. Fortunately, the trio of Hill, Cera and Mintz-Plasse, a cast of relative unknowns, prove they can handle their own and bring spontaneity to their roles. I would wager that some of the more hilarious moments were partially ad-libbed, that the leads took an idea and just ran with it to see what happened, with the best takes ending up as part of the end product. Their interpretations of goofiness and the attempts to be more than just outsiders feel surprisingly realistic, and since they're not Hollywood gorgeous it makes for compelling viewing. Our three would-be heroes are backed up with panache with similarly memorable performances by Seth Rogen as one of two wayward police officers and Kevin Corrigan as the aggressive party host who doesn't suffer ANYONE gladly.<br/><br/>The overall impression I walked away with is that life often leads you down some unexpected alleyways when you're just searching for a good time, but if you keep an open mind and trust your moral instincts you'll turn out fine. The fact this is backed up with a really well-chosen multiple genres soundtrack, some excellent non-sequitur twists and a couple of the most hilarious slapstick moments in years (Fogel getting decked is just one) means I've already seen this twice and plan to see it again at some point.<br/><br/>A consistently humorous teen comedy with a heart of gold? Yeah, I thought they stopped making those too."

The characters in it are actually funny and well liked for a change and may even remind you of someone who you know in high school. Although it might drag on in places you can guarantee that Jonah Hill's brilliant comedic role was what saved it from being a total dud .

","Before watching ""Superbad"" I really expected little but I decided to watch it anyways because of all of the hype it generated on IMDb.<br/><br/>Then MTV somehow viewed and gave it's trust by trying to promote it like the new ""American Pie"" or new teen comedy that could generate new rules for the genre.<br/><br/>That lowered my expectations and I didn't felt like watching it. Things got worse when it got such a quick transfer to HBO.<br/><br/>And my opinion didn't change just after 15 minutes of viewing... I must say that I'm not a teen by any means but I've watched the groundbreaking teen comedies from the 80's and 90's and that's why I'm not easily offended and I know what to expect... but after 15 minutes all I could resume from the movie were cursing, not funny and grotesque sex jokes, and stereotype characters. I thought: ""what a waste of time!"":... but I can say I was wrong.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses you can feel a vibe that tells you that it's a new classic and will generate a cult. I can't explain why but it truly delivers extremely funny moments, some hilarious acting, and best of all; situations that make you think ""I wish I was a teenager again!"".<br/><br/>The acting is truly hilarious and the three main characters deliver truly memorable moments... that McLovin' is just the best character and probably the new Jason Biggs.<br/><br/>The idiotic cops were something to consider... With such stupidity and the typical funny display of white trash, you can't help but laugh.<br/><br/>There are offensive jokes sure, but what comedy does not have them? Here most of them work...<br/><br/>I didn't like that the movie displayed the two sides of behavior: good and disastrous. You can either feel sympathy for the good ones that take the good moral decisions or go with the flow and follow what will make you ""Popular"".<br/><br/>Watch this movie ONLY IF YOU ARE IN THE MOOD for mindless offensive comedy that won't make you a better person but that will make you forget about daily life.

"paudie","7","0","3","11 November 2008"," A step up from ""Pie""
","Comparisons with American Pie are inevitable but in my opinion Superbad is the better of the two films. That's not to say that it isn't full of male teenage obsessions, bad language and sexual references. It certainly is. However in my opinion the film's intentions are in the right place while the American Pie series went for the ""gross out"" option a bit too often.<br/><br/>The plot is familiar. Nerdy teenagers are worried about their lack of sexual experience as the end of high school approaches. An unexpected opportunity presents itself as they are invited to a ""cool girls"" party. The catch is they have offered to supply the alcohol for the party. They believe obtaining the booze will almost certainly result in them reaching the ""Holy Grail"". Their attempts to get alcohol lead them into more and more outlandish situations as the evening progresses.<br/><br/>Perhaps what sets this film apart is the genuine attempt to deal with the teenage male relationships. The two main protagonists have been best friends forever. However one of them will be going to an Ivy League college, the other won't. The underlying tension both of them feel is dealt with well in the film.<br/><br/>One negative point for me was that I thought the incompetent cops (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) had too big a role in the film. They are funny in the robbery scene but after that they almost become the main characters and I felt this just dragged out the film.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill strike the right note as the best friends. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is very good as the kid so nerdy even the nerds are embarrassed to be seen with him.<br/><br/>Some of the humour is very broad and aimed at a mostly male audience but the film would be enjoyed by most people."

In the 1980s, we had ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" In the 1990s, we had ""Dazed and Confused"" and now in the 2000s, we have ""Superbad."" This is one of the funniest movies of the decade though I do not find it to be as funny as Apatow's other projects (40-year-old Virgin, Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah Marshall). It is also a great breakthrough for Michael Cera, Jonah Hill and many other up and coming stars. I highly recommend this film to any fans of Judd Apatow."

","As high school movies go, this is actually pretty good. A simple, fun, and occasionally, but thankfully only occasionally, contrived story. The movie, in general, is a little too much in love with itself, and whoever edited it let certain scenes run too long. I could've especially done with a little less of the cop duo towards the end - Bill Hader and Seth Rogen over-improv many of their scenes.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much that when it comes to the movie, however there's a bigger issue that rubs me.<br/><br/>Since ""Apatow Inc."" now comes out with like 4 movies every year, each with basically the same cast and similar shtick, it's almost impossible to view ""Superbad"", or any of his other movies for that matter, independently of the whole lot. And that's kinda too bad 'cause due to the volume and basic sameness of these films you can by now pretty much tell from a mile away where the joke is gonna come from in almost every scene. <br/><br/>I thought the Farrelly Brothers overdid it with their pace of ""same comedy every two years"", but this guy is relentless. He's in the year three of his big time Hollywood movie career, and already he's got like 12 movies. Take it easy, dude, the whole thing is getting kinda old."
"Polaris_DiB","8","0","2","14 September 2008"," Their last true moment
","Judd Apatow has become a big household name in a relatively amount of time, as he's written, produced, and directed seemingly dozens of movies over the past couple of years, most of them widely respected by critics and really loved by fans; and yet, nothing with his name connected to it yet has really impressed me that much until Superbad. With a plot that sounds like American Pie but concerns that go far beyond it, Greg Mottola and crew begin what first seems to be another smart-ass teenager flick, but lead it into some tender and relatively unexplored territory of male friendship in contemporary times.<br/><br/>Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are Seth and Evan (non-coincidentally sharing names with the two writers), high school buddies essentially tied to the hips in a strange alternate dimension where kids are allowed to enter classes, talk to buddies, and leave pretty much as they will. They want sex; they are leaving for college soon and to separate schools, nonetheless; and their friend Fogell has acquired a fake ID just in time for Seth and Evan to accept an invitation to a party. Unfortunately, they're also klutzes, and Fogell himself is somewhat of a joke with his fake ID dubbing him the now famous and over-quoted ironic tee-shirt du jour, ""I am McLovin!"" But that's all the set-up. Then the movie actually gets good.<br/><br/>Y'see, due to some strange circumstances, poor decisions, and a little of the old bad timing, McLovin ends up under the wings of two police officers (Seth Rogan NEVER having been funnier, and Bill Hader), Seth and Evan end up with a creepy guy taking them to a party way beyond their maturity, and a lot of distance between them and their goal of being the ultimate saviors of the party. As they wander over the empty nighttime streets in a strange alternate Universe where no parents are ever around to recognize them, they are forced to confront their impending maturity while dropping their witty facades and coming to terms with their friendship and reliance of each other. And there's hilarious drinking and sex talk, too.<br/><br/>The ironic thing is that where Seth and Evan's story is really much more of the point of the movie, and a lot more intimate, it's McLovin's guidance into adulthood by two cops that simply want to reclaim their childhood that is the more remembered and talked about segments, and my own personal favorite. It's a wish-fulfillment fantasy culminating in free shots and a burning police car, and it all feels a bit more satisfying than the longing separation look shared by the actual leads during the final scene of the movie. On the technical level, however, it's the main relationship between Seth and Evan that makes Superbad just a little more interesting and lasting than escapist entertainment meant to make a buck and be forgotten.<br/><br/>The movie is a little strange in that parents, true authority, boundaries are practically nonexistent except as a means of making a couple snide jokes. The world Evan and Seth and Fogell live is really not the real world, but that's kind of the point: it's their last chance to essentially trip and hop fences their way to their desires before it's time for them to grow up and gain pesky things like responsibilities. Everyone has their last great summer and such. It's a staple of the American coming-of-age story.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"brando647","8","0","2","19 August 2008"," Who cares if it's vulgar? This movie was awesome!
","Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg bring us one of the funniest teen comedies in years. Yet another Judd Apatow produced film with the usual cast and crew providing us with one of the funniest movies of 2007. Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are best friends on the verge of graduating high school and they are given the opportunity to gain some popularity AND score with the girls they've adored for years...all they need to do is supply the booze for Jules's (Emma Stone) graduation party. The movie plays out over the course of one night as they try to score the alcohol by any means possible while everything that could go wrong, does.<br/><br/>This movie is hilarious! I've been a fan of Apatow and crew since their first feature and now we have a film co-written by one of the funniest actors in modern Hollywood (in my opinion), Seth Rogen. For the sensitive types out there, do yourself a favor and find entertainment elsewhere because this movie is definitely vulgar (though not to my desensitized mind). Curse words and sexual comments pretty much fill the nearly two hour running time (if you have the extended edition, which I recommend). Despite the excessive vulgarity, you can tell the movie doesn't rely on it for its comedy. There are a LOT of genuinely funny moments in this film and that's mostly due to the performances.<br/><br/>This film gathers a lot of great comedic talent in one place. I haven't seen much of Jonah Hill before but I thought he was great in the role of Seth, and Michael Cera subdued comedy was a perfect counter to Jonah's loud, angry rants. Christopher Mintz-Plasse makes his film debut as Fogell (aka McLovin) and his scenes are some of the best in the movie. As soon as he's joined by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as the cops who pick him up, the McLovin subplot almost becomes it's own movie and you wish there was more. I would seriously love to see this group come together for another film (though not necessarily a sequel to this movie). Great comedic performances, a perfect cast, and a raunchy teenage sex story (with some heart, though some wouldn't believe it) come together to once again prove that Apatow and crew are on top of the Hollywood comedy scene."

","To be frank, I was expecting this to be yet another garbage-level teen romp flick. However, given the strong reviews from critics, I thought I'd check it out. Wow, what a fantastic surprise this movie turned out to be. The script is very cleverly done and the performances are outstanding.<br/><br/>The movie is basically about three high school seniors who are trying to get laid before starting college. The only problem is that they're closer to nerds than jocks. The most ambitious of these three figures out that a great way to score is to promise to bring alcohol to a party. And so begins their underage quest to acquire liquor ...<br/><br/>What is incredible about the script is that the characters and situations are entirely believable. Yes, lots of extreme things happen in the story, but they are acknowledged as such and flow beautifully with the way the characters are conceived.<br/><br/>The performances of the three main actors, along with the two police officers in the movie, are excellent. In fact, the five of them carry the entire movie. They deliver some hilarious lines in way that sounds like they really believe what they're saying! They're all so interesting and fun to watch that it's a shame that we only get them for one movie.<br/><br/>This movie is for mature teen audiences on up. If you're looking for an intelligently written and funny movie, definitely check this one out."
"cwarne_uk","7","0","3","11 August 2008"," Funny with (thankfully) few redeeming factors
","This is easily the best film I've seen from Judd Apatow's stable. Crude, but not dumb, and with plenty of laughs. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera provide most of the highlights. Hill in particular is funny for the whole movie, a feat that John Belushi often struggled to achieve. The only major fault is that it goes on too long, the last 20 minutes feeling drained - this is a fault it shares with ""Knocked Up"". As a comedy this is much better than ""Juno"", it also feels much more real than that overpraised cute fest. If you think that a comedy's main function is to make you laugh, then this was the best American comedy of 2008."

","I am two generations removed from the high school seniors in this movie, but seeing the movie reminded me of the famous quote of Jean-Baptiste Karr, ""plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose"" (the more things change, the more they stay the same). The language now may be cruder and the sex more upfront, but the staples stay the same: friendship, sex, profanity, booze, awkwardness, social classes, porn, impending life changes, and so forth. All the modern innovations don't seem to have changed the equation much, if this movie is in fact representative.<br/><br/>Even though the language is pretty raw, the thing I liked about it was how comfortable the kids were with it, like it was just the way they expressed themselves and there was nothing particularly wicked or immoral about it. All three of the main characters are quite likable.<br/><br/>The movie is too long - the scenes with the policemen were the least effective and could have been pared down a lot.<br/><br/>If my high school experience is any indication, the penis drawings are *way* too creative to have been drawn by any male high schooler. Whoever drew them really got into it - makes you wonder about such a person.<br/><br/>If the math teacher is at all typical, then I can understand why many people give up on ever understanding the subject. His statement that, ""'i' is an imaginary number, it doesn't really exist"" is worthy of rolled eyes and despairing glances. Why did nobody ask why it was being discussed if it does not exist? <br/><br/>I really liked the opening credits and they led me to expect more than I got which, I admit, is one of the better entries in the genre (which is not all that much praise). I just felt this movie does not live up its hype."

","Every teenage boy's fantasy is covered in this critic proof imbecile comedy that is crammed with gross-out humour, foul language and superbad taste. The fact that writers Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg have created their two nerdy lead characters in their own image (by calling them Seth and Evan), alerts us that much of the mindset belongs to their own fantasies. Superbad is like a 113 minute wet dream. Apart from perpetual sketches of penises, firm breasts and uncontrollable male urges, there are irresponsible cops (Seth Rogan plays one of them) who delight in drinking on the job, dousing their car with alcohol and shooting at it after setting it alight. Whether or not this sends desirable signals to youngsters is debatable.<br/><br/>Superbad is like a downmarket, vulgar version of American Pie. It was eight years ago (in 1999) that the first American Pie movie was released, and it is not surprising that the tenor of the new gross-out teen movies in which virginity is something to be trashed before college, is presented in a more blatant and upfront manner. If the mostly young male audience at my screening is any guide, this is a hysterically funny experience.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it did not hit the mark where I was concerned, but I am not the target audience. Nevertheless, I question the validity of explicit language in search of a reaction and I wonder whether excessive alcohol, drug use and juvenile behaviour is especially funny.<br/><br/>What does work - and what is well done - is the portrayal of the friendship between fatty foul-mouthed Seth (Jonah Hill) and dorky, super-polite Evan (Michael Cera), who are about to be separated when they go to their respective colleges. Christopher Mintz-Plasse in his screen debut as super-nerd Fogell makes an entertaining wild card, whose unexpected collusion with the two cops, is a total surprise.<br/><br/>I thought I would put a little treat in too, you can watch the whole movie here www.moviestatus.com/movie-reviews/superbad-movie-review.html"

","A stunning and hilarious comedy from the crowd who brought us ""Knocked Up"" and ""40-Year-Old Virgin"". It also brilliantly showcases some emerging talents in the form of Jonah Hill and Michael Cera.<br/><br/>Rogen/Apatow/Evan's latest offering is right on the money, in this story about a couple of high school loser geeks trying to make some kind of impact on their dreary lives as they prepare to head out to college.<br/><br/>It's loosely based on Rogen and Evan's own experiences in high school, and charts new territory in the teen comedy drama despite being set against the well-worn backdrop of a ""the last big party before graduation"".<br/><br/>The comedy is razor-sharp, and evokes Kevin Smith's early outings like ""Clerks"" and ""Mallrats"". But there's also a 'mainstream-iness"" about it last seen in the original ""American Pie"".<br/><br/>Hill and Cera are charmingly gormless as the leads, and they do a sterling job of balancing the film's comedic elements off against a fairly serious theme about the separation anxiety we all feel as we approach the end of high school.<br/><br/>Director, Greg Mottola has also teased out very good performances from the rest of cast.<br/><br/>All in all, an instant cult classic.

","So ye, last night i was bored enough to choose this movie, also knowing i disliked Juno, and Knocked Up, 40 YO Virgin had it's moments so ye, why not give it a try, yet after the first 20 mins, i found myself going towards the same way as the previous movies mentioned.<br/><br/>Superbad brings nothing new to cinema, the story is poor, although the scenes are somehow realistic as they explains well, how going out at night can be, and how dumb of people you can find outside.<br/><br/>OK as for the movie, Jonah Hill from pretty much the start of the movie until the end, he uses the same expressions which doesn't take long to get old and boring, plus well he's funny, but not that funny.<br/><br/>As for Michael Cera, i like his character being always polite and stuff, yet there's some moments less solid about this as well, first his character isn't even funny, and then at some parts he starts to become some sort of ""outlaw"" which motivates a little bit, but then goes back to what it was.<br/><br/>For least but not last Christopher Mintz-Plasse, he brings a fresh air to a really boring part of the movie and his entrance in the movie is probably the only one that made me give the most honestly laugh all the entire movie. My hopes go up as am waiting to see if this guy can start being funny, yet i was wrong again....<br/><br/>The whole move is cheap and poor, just like Knocked Up, let alone Juno... Ellen Page is more than that.<br/><br/>Long story short, don't watch this movie alone, or you will either give up, or find it really bad, the movie is funny enough to entertain but hardly funny to make you laugh, or perhaps if you like basic verbal stuff and that you will explode laughing.<br/><br/>Pick a good moment to watch it, with friends, on a party, if you are in a mood to laugh at anything that comes up, just if your not in a good mood, don't expect it to put you in that good mood....<br/><br/>Superbad is more like Super poor."
"Silverhawkins","10","0","3","1 May 2008"," Superbad is quite honestly THE funniest American comedy.
","I just wanted to step up and give this comedy the credit it deserves. I've read so many incredibly negative reviews on here, and they are in my opinion completely unjust.<br/><br/>First off, realise that the film is about a day in the life of three college kids (16-18 year olds) trying to buy booze to impress the girls at the party they are attending that evening, so if that plot already sounds ropey to you, you might want to avoid the film. However, if you've ever been that age, or even better, if you are roughly that age now, this film will relate to you so closely you'll love it. I'm 20 now, and i think this is the funniest American film i've ever seen. Yes, almost every joke is a sexual reference, or equally comic sexual discussion from the three hugely awkward and sexually frustrated main characters, and the film is littered with slapstick. However, the dialogue is delivered to perfection, every possible funny line is hilarious, and the art of slapstick has really been nailed by the whole cast. I've seen it nigh on ten times and i still laugh.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by the perception that this might just be YET another teen movie, it's head and shoulders (and torso) above any others produced so far."
"LagerLagerLagerShouting","8","0","3","29 April 2008"," McLovin!
","This gross-out coming-of-age comedy from the American Pie stable is absolutely hilarious from start to finish. The reason why it works so well is because of the realistic characterisation, they are not stereotypes but people anyone who has been to high school can relate to. Also the narrative is densely plotted, leaving space for all manner hilarious mishaps. Disguised under all the brilliant comedy is a delicate message about friendship and its connotations and that makes the chemistry between the characters more believable. Also the supporting cast is great, particularly Christopher Mintz-Plasse making his debut as McLovin, every scene he was in creased me up. A great teen comedy, with hilarious one-liners, a more complete film than Knocked-up and Virgin.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Actually this one stands out from the crowd. As a 40 year old I found my self laughing quite a bit and I must be honest and say I don't know what age group this was aimed at because the script seemed to be something that could appeal to anyone from the age of 12 to 60. Some of the jokes have a shock value but they are funny never the less. It has the geek will probably prevails element but there was no sign of the usual High School Addonis character who usually gets his come up-pence at the end of the movie which was refreshing. <br/><br/>If this film was made in the UK it would be filled with Political correctness and over bearing in your face multiculturalism mixed with lame jokes aimed at 12 year olds by a director and scriptwriting team who would assume the audience are thick. Quite simply Britain couldn't make this kind of movie without completely messing it up.<br/><br/>I liked all the characters from the main geeks, the cops and the would be girlfriends. No one was annoying.<br/><br/>While the storyline is semi predictable the intelligent script makes it something I would certainly recommend if your in need of a laugh."
"Rob_McZombie","9","0","3","21 April 2008"," Brilliant comedy about friendship.
","Teenage years are a fuzzy and confusing time. The greatest reflections on teenage life are the ones that manage to capture the almost total isolation teenagers feel in their lives from the rest of the world, teens view the world through narrow eyes. This short sighted vision inevitably leads to concentration on certain factors that become less important as time goes on. In those hectic and unpredictable years the biggest issue focused on is almost universally sex. You could be fooled into thinking this movie is about the frustration and desire concerning sex, but you'd be wrong. The movie uses the quest for sex as a gimmick to keep the plot moving forward but ultimately the movie is about the friendship between the two main characters and it is this saving grace that really elevates Superbad above the usual teen comedy. The sub-plot that follows McLovin on this eventful night has almost been overshadowed by a catchphrase but it's the dorky cops who make that element of the film shine so brightly, in a typical teen comedy authority is something to be dodged and in a brilliant twist they've turned that on it's head, with genuinely fantastic results.<br/><br/>Superbad is a brilliant comedy, with some fantastic one liners and some excellent turns from the players, but what makes it brilliant is the ease which we can all relate to these two best trying to have a good time."

","As a guy who spent a good (well, maybe not so good) few years trying to get drunk and being baffled by girls, Superbad was always going to entertain. The mighty McLovin really reminds me strongly of one of my more unfortunate friends, and Michael Cera's affable but girl-blind loser was just exactly like the rest of us. A laugh-out-loud-funny film with sweet rather than overblown performances at its heart and some excellent set piece situations that are still honest enough to resonate with your own pathetic life (especially if you've ever responded to a girl throwing herself at you by being paralysed like a deer in headlights!), Superbad is a top drawer film."

"gavin6942","6","0","3","24 March 2008"," The Spiritual Successor to Can't Hardly Wait
","High school seniors Evan and Seth (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera), who had spent their years pining for girls but never chasing them, are about to graduate and go their separate ways, worlds apart. But before they go off to college, it's time for that one last high school party. The booze, the women and more... they are ready to become adults.<br/><br/>Let me lay it out there: ""Superbad"" is the spiritual successor to ""Can't Hardly Wait"", which is the spiritual successor to ""Say Anything"". This is a blessing and a curse. The blessing is we have the same concept that works time and again: the end of the high school years and a big party where the losers and nerds have to redeem themselves. Lloyd Dobbler (John Cusack) did it with Ione Skye, Ethan Embry's character did it with Jennifer Love Hewitt. Now Seth and Evan have that chance with Becca and Jules (Emma Stone). And this formula always works. (Also, these films tend to have good music. ""Superbad"" really taps the Bar-Kays, which is a wise move and a dang fine opening song.) The bad? Each reincarnation seems to be weaker, a copy of a copy (like ""Multiplicity""). I liked ""Superbad"", but it didn't have all the iconic moments ""Can't Hardly Wait"" had. And before that, ""Say Anything"" will always be remembered for the boombox scene with Peter Gabriel. Even the best scenes of ""Superbad"" are disposable, and some of the best jokes (drunk cops, for example) are nothing new. The only really great parts are the rambles between Evan and Seth.<br/><br/>As a side note, I have to call attention to the girl who played Becca and state for the record how hot she is and how I feel she has a strong future. She's like the younger Alysson Hannigan, which we needed. And by being cast in the remake of ""Last House on the Left"", her acting career is cemented so long as they are able to make that film half as powerful as the original (a difficult task).<br/><br/>I highly recommend ""Superbad"", though if you're looking for a 2007 teenager movie, ""Juno"" should really be your primary choice. And if you like Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen, I cannot say that this is better than ""Knocked Up"". Maybe marginally, but only because this has more repeat viewing value. And I do fear that future collaborations will simply diminish... Judd Apatow is a ticking time bomb (though still strong as of July 2010)."

","I am 58 years old and when I watch teen comedies it's with a certain curiosity about how it's different today in high school. Despite stereotypes of the Sixties, back then teens wanted to look and act as adult as possible. In the suburbs at least, you dressed sharp. The main thing was to be ""cool"" and act like you were more sophisticated than you really were. We drank and smoked pot at parties and danced to the Stones and swore and got into arguments about Vietnam. But we were never candid about really personal things, like sex. You were hip, man, but dignified.<br/><br/>A lot has apparently changed. For one thing, the idea of boys taking home economics these days is really amazing. I think ""Superbad"" is a terrific movie with great dialogue and some uproarious scenes. To wit:<br/><br/>The liquor store fantasy scenes.<br/><br/>Fogel's new license.<br/><br/>The drunk fat kid crashing into Jules.<br/><br/>Fogel's ""arrest me"" request.<br/><br/>Carrying booze in a detergent jug.<br/><br/>The mom's-cleavage gag. ""I am so jealous ...""<br/><br/>I also really liked the shanghaied-to-a-weird-adult-party scene. This was so real-life I was actually startled. Period blood on his pants! And everyone wants to see it! And her boyfriend is outraged! I thought the guys were doomed. And those sing-for-us cokeheads  so bizarre it had to come from someone's real experience. You would never see something like this in a previous teen-sex comedy.<br/><br/>The only letdown was the two cops. Come on. Those scenes in the middle of the movie should have been rewritten or cut. Imagine Fogel protected under the wing of two bad-ass Clint Eastwood types with street scores to settle and you can see where it should have gone.<br/><br/>""Superbad"" gets props for being original and taking chances. It also has an essential sweetness that separates it from ""American Pie,"" which is not a bad movie but suffers in comparison to this one. Let's have more, Judd."

","The latest release from the Apatow stable, Superbad is their take on the teen rites-of-passage story. Two weeks before graduation, best buddies Seth and Evan face the dissolution of their long-standing friendship when they head off to different colleges. Seth's vulgarity and Evan's shyness keep them at arms length from the girls they are interested in, but as graduation looms and the chance to score at a party comes up, the two friends set out on a quest for alcohol and (hopefully) sex. Dragging along their nerdy friend Fogel, their well laid plan unravels into a series of misadventures and as the night continues it becomes clear the issue here is not girls, but what two best friends are going to do when life pushes them apart.<br/><br/>Make no mistakes here, Superbad is crass, rude and occasionally over the top, as most teen comedies are, but it keeps both the central characters planted firmly in reality. Seth and Evan are wonderfully portrayed by Jonah Hill and Michael Cera; I challenge anyone who was a teenage boy not to see at least some of themselves in them. The dialogue between them is funny and real; there are few moments where the humour is forced or unnatural. While the subplot of Fogel's adventures with two inept cops are over the top, they don't detract from the very real story at the movie's core. The movie's conclusion is perfectly in-key with this sense of reality, and is genuinely touching.<br/><br/>Superbad, for a crass teen comedy, has a warm heart beating inside it. While comparisons with American Pie and Porkys are bound to be made, Superbad is really in a class of its own; it's a funny, entertaining and above all fond homage to the writer's teen years, one that when it isn't tickling you with its well-observed humour it's showing you its soul - something most teen comedies don't."

Of course, what's funny to an adolescent isn't that much of a crack up to an adult. So you should see the film and decide for yourself.<br/><br/>It would be fun and interesting to see how this movie might turn out by giving it to a group of film students to re-edit."

","From the creators of The 40-Year-Old Virdin and Knocked Up (out the same year) I was expecting this to be another great teen comedy similar to American Pie, but this wasn't what I had in mind. To me it was a bit too random, and more like trying to copy American Graffitti, i.e. all events happening in one night. But there are still some good chatty and giggly moments to be had. Basically best friends Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are nearing their last weeks at high school, and they are never seen at popular kids' parties, but they get lucky. Only thing they need to do, with the help of their nerdy friend Fogell (introducing Christopher Mintz-Plasse), with his new fake ID (with adopted name ""McLovin"") is get plenty of alcohol to bring. So the action starts when Fogell first steps into a liquor store, cops Officer Slater (Bill Hader) and Officer Michaels (Knocked Up's Seth Rogen) come along and say they'll drop their new friend ""McLovin"" at the party, but they want to prove themselves just as fun and youthful as other teenagers, and Seth and Evan are going everywhere they can think of to get the alcohol, including other parties with some pot smokers, thugs and other threats. Eventually they all make it to the party, and with the alcohol they obviously all hope that it is also the opportunity to lose their virginity to their selected girls, which eventually give up on in the end. Also starring Martha MacIsaac as Becca, Emma Stone as Jules, Aviva as Nicola, Joe Lo Truglio as Francis the Driver and Kevin Corrigan as Mark. Like I said, a good film, I personally don't know if it deserves four our of five by the critics. Good!"
"ExpendableMan","8","0","4","29 January 2008"," The best teen movie since American Pie
","Having covered middle age and young adulthood with the wicked one-two punch of The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, Hollywood's current reigning comedy overlord Judd Apatow turns his sight on teenagers. And although this isn't quite as good a film as his pregnancy misadventure, Superbad is more of the balls out laugh marathon that Knocked Up was billed as. Focusing on three teenage friends taking the long route to the graduation party, it is a very funny but also rather sad film that portrays eighteen year olds in a much more realistic way than usual. Producers/directors/writers take note; the average adolescent male doesn't give a toss about the prom, the big game or dating the geeky-but-hot girl, he just wants to get laid and is liable to do just about anything bar you know, talking to a girl to do so. Superbad knows this and while the overly familiar plot is hardly going to score points for originality, it certainly racks them up when it comes to the execution.<br/><br/>Granted, the few female characters are little more than sketches, but our central trio of Seth (Jonah Hill), Evan (Michael Cera) and Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) are brilliantly written and performed. Seth is rotund, foul-mouthed and aggressively insecure, Evan is quiet, vulnerable and the most level headed of the three while Fogell is so nerdy he'd even get kicked out of a Stargate convention. Every scene where they're together fizzles with chemistry, the lads bickering and trading some killer lines and it's very easy to believe that they've been friends since childhood. Not only that, but their insecurities are profoundly believable and their tendency to over-examine everything girls say to them makes them all likable leads.<br/><br/>It's therefore no surprise that Seth ropes them all into a plan to get in the girls good-books by using Fogell's newly acquired fake ID to purchase alcohol. All they have to do is go to the nearest convenience store, pick up a few bottles and then head back. Simple right? Well things get rapidly out of hand and soon the narrative splits in two, Fogell spending most of the evening with the two most unprofessional cops in America (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) while Seth and Evan, believing that Fogell's been arrested, try to find alternative sources of booze. Several near disasters later and they find themselves at loggerheads which is where Superbad's real soul emerges. The overlying story may be about their relationship with girls, but it's really about the friendship between Seth and Evan. With college looming ever closer they know their days of raging hormones will soon be over and what's more, they'll be separated as they head off to different schools. Their break-up and inevitable make-up is incredibly touching in it's sincerity and should speak volumes to anyone who ever had to go to University and leave their best friend behind.<br/><br/>So Apatow once again knows how to do heart-breaking sentimentality but what about the comedy aspect? Well, after Knocked Up's intelligent relationship commentary, Superbad is a bit more low brow but man is it funny. The storyline fires out a rapid succession of smutty humour and is utterly remorseless in its assault, an early penis-drawing flashback being one especially gut churning highlight. It's a good thing too, you'll be crying with laughter so much that no-one will really notice if you start blubbing when the heart-wrenching ending rolls around.<br/><br/>In some respects this is the sort of film that Kevin Smith would make if he ever made a film about his adolescence, but with the added bonus of not having to put up with Jason Mewes for the entire thing. It has familiar cast members, an easily-relatable scenario and a script packed to the rafters with pop culture nods and foul mouthed humour, but lurking beneath it all is an honest paean to awkward outsiders in every secondary school. If you spent your teen years as captain of the football team, smoking behind bike sheds, banging the school bike and calling the kid wearing Metallica shirts things like ""Mayor of Loserville,"" you should probably avoid this film. And go fist yourself. But for everyone who still looks back on secondary school with fond sentimentality and secretly wishing they could have brought a few more mates out with them, this is the best slice of Pie since the American one."

","Superbad, a 2007 teen sex comedy, chronicles the adventures of two high school seniors on a quest for sex and alcohol. The film showcases the main characters, Evan and Seth, as the typical high school losers who are joined by their sidekick, Fogell. After Evan and Seth are invited to attend a party by the popular girls of their dreams, they engage on their quest to obtain the alcohol for the party.<br/><br/>Superbad hits all of the cultural landmarks of classic teen comedies yet it also display refreshingly original humor. The film is consistent with teen sex comedy themes: high school seniors on a quest for sex, the majority of films in this genre surround the party scene and friendship transcends."

There are so many laugh out loud moments, it really is one of the best teen comedies out there. The guy who plays Fogell or McLovin is fantastic, he really really plays the character well and i found him very funny but having said that all 3 of the boys played their characters well.

They really captured the awkward nature of high school situations, while at the same time adding that ""movie magic"" to give it a funny kick. The movie follows a bunch of high school seniors around as they try to organize and prepare for a graduation bash. From getting fake ID's, hooking up with girls, to crashing ""adult"" parties, these guys have quite an adventure! Overall a really great movie that you will surely enjoy.

","This movie is hilarious. It has memorable lines and memorable characters.

They really made a great movie.<br/><br/>This is definitely not one for the kids. They should have called this Supernaughty. There is lots of sexual references and there isn't a minute that goes by when there not swearing or talking about sex. I am very serious about the kids not seeing this.<br/><br/>Three high school students get invited to a graduation party. They are asked to bring the alcohol to the party. So they use there friends fake ID to try and get the alcohol but it doesn't turn out like they had planned.<br/><br/>Something that may get people saying ""What thats it?"" is the ending.

","A charming little flick about high school filled with extreme vulgarity - a porkies/fast times update. I liked the way they avoided treating the kids as one-dimensional. That scene where they were building up the courage to go by liquor rang very true. The whole cop thing was pretty silly. Evans low-key approach was a perfect counter punch to Seth's frenetic insanity. And McLovin really stole the show. I remember when Porky's came out and had it's famous 'dick pulling' scene and how that was the height of vulgarity. This movie is in the same vein with its vag-tastic voyage humor. It is what it is and it does it well. Don't expect anything more."

Those who complained the movie was misogynisitc, again missed the point and probably did not watch it to the end. <br/><br/>The crudeness which is hilarious, is also complemented by much more subtle humour, coming especially from Cera, as well as well-timed slapstick.<br/><br/>The characters are believable teenagers at the mercy of hormones.<br/><br/>Watch this film, if you think you are smart enough to understand.

","Three teens, all awkward in their high school ways, try to ensure a wild finish for their senior year by procuring alcohol for a party. A night's worth of adventures ensues.<br/><br/>It was hard for me to put a star value on this movie. As much as I liked it, I saw some flaws that needed to be addressed to propel this movie to an 8, or maybe a 9. First, there are pacing issues. Some of the scenes suffer because it's clear to the audience what will happen, and the scene takes too long to achieve the goal. This bit of trimming could make the movie feel a little more tightly bound. The second problem is an odd one. I'm not opposed to cursing at all, but the incredible quantity of it hurts the movie in a specific way - it hurts the sense of realism.<br/><br/>Aside from these flaws, I can honestly say that this clearly beats Knocked Up, and is roughly as funny as 40-year-old Virgin, though with some of these drawbacks that lower my rating."

","Superbad reminds me of a 1980s teen movie, like Animal House, Porky's, 16 Candles, or even Weird Science. Some of the scenes are very funny, such as Seth's fantasies of how he scores the liquor, or the outrageous flashbacks and story-tellings of any of the characters, and things like people drinking green beer, lighting cop cars on fire, or bizarre penis drawings. But after hearing so much about, I felt let down. Yeah, it was pretty funny, and I'm sure many people were able to relate to it. But in the long run, it doesn't hold a lasting appeal for me. I might bust it out every once in a while, but its not something that reflected my high school years, and hence won't be reflected upon much after the second viewing."

Then again I'm not a fan of anything Producer Judd Apatow has put out from his own film Knocked Up, to the films he either wrote or produced Walk Hard, Talladega Nights, Fun With Dick and Jane, Anchorman, Kicking and Screaming.

"EUyeshima","6","0","3","4 January 2008"," Frequently Hilarious Teen Comedy Somewhat More Inconsequential Than Expected
","I have to agree that this 2007 comedy is ribald and frequently hilarious, but I'm not quite as taken as others by what they see as a paean to male bonding and friendship. That's because there is too stark a contrast between the over-the-top hi-jinks that prevail over most of the running time and the almost whimsically co-dependent way the relationship between the two best friends reveals itself to be. My expectations ran high given that filmmaker Judd Apatow produced the film, and as he proved with ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"", he can bring unexpected heart into the most absurdly comical of situations. However, this delicate balancing act is what seems missing here since he let director Greg Motolla take over the reins this time. Aspiring to be more like ""American Graffiti"" than ""American Pie"", the result is a film with plenty of laughs but fares less in terms of lasting emotional resonance. <br/><br/>From a script penned by best friends Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (based on their own awkward adolescent years), the movie has a slim premise  chubby, potty-mouthed Seth and shy, geeky Evan are best friends about to graduate from high school and go to different colleges. Evan got accepted to Dartmouth, while Seth is going to the local community college. Seth, however, has a twist of good luck when he is partnered in home economics class with Jules, one of the school's coolest girls, who invites him and Evan to a big graduation blow-out at her parents' house. So hopped up by his sexual fantasies about Jules, Seth volunteers to take her food allowance and buy liquor for the party. Evan goes along with the shenanigans because he has a crush on Jules' best friend Becca, a good girl who actually likes him. Getting the alcohol is not easy because it means bringing nerdy Fogell into the mix since he has a fake ID that says he is 25, lives in Hawaii and his name is McLovin (just one name please). Needless to say, everything that could go wrong does, and the story splinters between Fogell's adventure with two irresponsible policemen and Seth and Evan's search for alcohol when they think Fogell has been arrested.<br/><br/>A spirited cast displays crack comic timing. Jonah Hill, already familiar as one of the slacker housemates in ""Knocked Up"", plays Seth with hormonally-driven brio, while Michael Cera (the put-upon son George-Michael in ""Arrested Development"" and now shining in ""Juno"") makes Evan a quietly affecting dweeb. In his film debut, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is a hilarious scene stealer as Fogell. Rogen (with a Fu Manchu moustache) and SNL's Bill Hader display a playful rapport as the police officers who show Fogell how to have a good time, and among the three actresses playing the girls the nerd brigade desires, Emma Stone is a particular standout as the sensible Jules. The drawings reflecting Seth's obsession are hysterically funny, as is the entire liquor store episode. It's too bad that the film feels overlong at nearly two hours, but I do applaud the sheer audacity and emotional transparency of the last scenes.<br/><br/>Plenty of extras come with the two-disc Unrated and Extended DVD set in a format that will be familiar to anyone who has bought the DVDs of Apatow's megahits. An entertaining though surprisingly vituperative commentary track is on Disc One with the cast and crew split between LA and New York. Disc Two has all the other extras including deleted scenes, a gag reel and the familiar line-o-rama clip (which shows quick alternative takes with different variations on lines improvised by the actors). There is also a thirteen-minute making-of featurette, video diaries, audition tapes, a short about the dancing opening title sequence, and video footage of early table readings going back to 2002 with different actors. The rest of the extras are targeted to true die-hard fans, such as videotape of a prank pulled on Hill related to his phobia of snakes and a half-hour series of clips called ""Cop Car Confessions"" with various actors in the back seat improvising with Rogen and Hader in the front."

The same movie will have thought provoking moments as well have moments that are so over the top, that they annoy.<br/><br/>Well in this case its mixed with the teen movie formula, there's always the fat guy, the super nerd, the guy who's a semi-nerd but is actually going to become cool (most of whom are virgins), underage drinking, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.<br/><br/>What Jude does is add a slight twist to the genre, which is sometime satirical, sometimes slapstick, sometimes just plain funny, and at others just plain irritating or boring.<br/><br/>The acting is fine from the entire cast, especially good is Mintz as Mclovin, even the girls who are unfortunately not that hot have done a fine job (another example of accurate representation no 25-35 yr old hotties playing teens here).<br/><br/>The background score was ordinary enough to be missed.<br/><br/>Direction, cinematography etc don't really matter that much with such subject matter and was pretty standard.<br/><br/>The humour was subtle sometimes and over the top on many others, the abusive language had novelty value in ""40 year old"" but has completely lost its charm here, the one liners are OK,ITS MUCH MORE ABOUT THE WHOLE DIALOGUE HERE THAN ONE LINERS.<br/><br/>There are some really good scenes like the liquor store, and the entire Mclovin Cops saga, but there were many ordinary scenes like the gangs, and couple of the ending sequences.<br/><br/>THE MOVIE DOES FEEL KIND OF SPACED OUT MUCH LIKE KEVIN SMITH'S MOVIES, In fact SOMETIMES I GET THE FEELING THAT I AM INDEED WATCHING A KEVIN SMITH FILM.<br/><br/>Which bring us the MOST IMPORTANT PART EXPECTATIONS, I really didn't know that this movie was once in the ""Top 250"", if had watched this movie with those expectations needless to say i would have been very disappointed, i watched it expecting merely good hence i enjoyed this movie, I'm sure PEOPLE OTHER THAN FANS WILL REALLY BE DISAPPOINTED IF THEY WATCH WITH VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS.<br/><br/>Fans and people who like such humour as shown by Steve Carell, Jude, Kevin Smith, will really like this movie others may enjoy it if they don't expect too much,THOSE THAT LIKE STANDARD AND SIMPLE COMIC FARE (like me) HAVE A VERY HIGH CHANCE OF BEING DISAPPOINTED (luckily i wasn't).Im not that sure girls will like this movie either.<br/><br/>Watch with due considerations.<br/><br/>-s some really annoying/gross/boring scenes, weak stereotypical end, NO REALLY BIG FUNNY SCENE.<br/><br/>+/-s humour gets a bit spaced out sometimes,not exactly short in length.<br/><br/>+s the entire Mclovin Cops sequence, good acting, SOME REALLY GOOD DIALOGUES.<br/><br/>total 7/10 ( but thats only because i didn't expect much and it met my expectations, i wont lie that I'm tempted to be dishonest and put a low rating just to pull down the overall ratings, I CAN ENJOY THIS HUMOUR FOR A CHANGE ONCE IN A WHILE BUT GIVE ME SIMPLE HUMOUR ANYDAY)."

Even ""Porky's"" from more than twenty years ago felt more adult than this movie.

","Those with a penchant for the highly crude will probably faun over SUPERBAD. Perhaps I'm becoming too much of a prude or simply don't find crude behavior for the sake of just being crude funny. I grew up during the Jeff Spicoli phase when FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH (1982) was the epitome of the upcoming culture clash between my parents' world and the emerging one that I would inhabit during my early adulthood. True, there was crude behavior in Fast Times (the ""how-to"" lesson on oral sex stands out still today), but it was liberally sprinkled throughout with plenty of simple laughs.<br/><br/>With Superbad, the F-word is used more times than in any other film I've ever seen. And it's true that some teens do talk like this, but that doesn't mean we need to hear it in every sentence just for shock value or to prove some linguistic point (whatever that might be ...maybe to set a record?) What gave this film its pull (in my book) was the plot surrounding two youths ready to graduate from high school and having to deal with their impending separation as they prepared to go to different colleges. They were Seth (Jonah Hill, KNOCKED UP) and Evan (Michael Cera). Both are hiding their feelings about the upcoming separation and deal with it by arguing and trying to buy booze for a party where two girls they like are headed. Mixed amongst them is an extreme geek named Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who has a fake I.D. with a fake name: McLovin. No first name. Just a last one ..from Hawaii. And he's an organ donor. But they have what they have and must get their alcohol quickly. They send Fogell/McLovin into a liquor store where he is promptly assaulted by a robber who cold-cocks him and steals all the cash in the till. Waiting outside are Seth and Evan who then see a cop car pull up and are freaking out. Will Fogell/McLovin go to jail for this? But the cops are waste cases themselves. Officer Slater (Bill Hader also of KNOCKED UP) and Officer Michaels (Seth Rogen, SHREK THE THIRD) take young Fogell/McLovin into their confidence and into their squad car; they agree to take him home with a few stopovers. This trio is often waylaid by their own stupidity, blazing through every red lighted intersection, breaking up barroom brawls (after which they order thirteen beers ...to go), and generally not giving a crap about serving or protecting anything but their own butts.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Seth and Evan are trying to get some booze  any booze!  so that they can get to the graduation party and the girls that await them there. Seth battles multiple hits from automobiles and finally lands up at another party where he has to deal with being exposed as a ""man-gina"" and swiping alcohol via detergent containers. Evan just wants to get to the party which sparks angry retorts from Seth.<br/><br/>Eventually the two do make it to the correct grad party and peel off with their respective sexy gals. Seth wants so badly to lose his virginity that he drinks himself into near oblivion, while Evan discovers that having sex for the first time with a drunk girl isn't all its cracked up to be.<br/><br/>The party is quickly wrapped up as our two unenlightened cops show up and break up the party (""We assume you all have guns and crack."") Thankfully the cursing slows down toward the middle and end of the film allowing one to actually focus on how the story unfolds rather than how it's verbalized. The hysterically funny ending is both cringe-worthy and guffaw appropriate; two boys acting like two girls (""I can say I love you!"") Your enjoyment of Superbad will depend on how much you enjoy letting your mind revert back to a more primal state versus something funny because it IS funny and not designed to gross you out or shock you."

","Superbad 2007, 118mins, 15 Director: Greg Mottola Cast includes: Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Bill Hader, Christopher Mintz-Plasse<br/><br/>It's really been Judd Apatows year, the comedy guru steered Knocked Up to #2 in the US domestic charts bettered only by the pirate fuelled adventures of Johnny Depp and co. on it's opening weekend. Then several weeks later Superbad hit theatres this time with Apatow producing, the magic still hit home the feature managed to take $32 million on it's opening weekend alone, on a mere $20 million budget. Both pictures also drew great reviews marking a mammoth year for Apatow, and based on Superbad he probably deserves mucho credit. The film depicts two pals Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) very different people in one grossly over dependent friendship. Seth is foul mouthed and obsessed with sex, Evan is more controlled and a lot less crazy about intercourse. Both are socially outcast but when invited to the last big party before they graduate the boys and their nerdy tag along Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) acquire a fake I.D and attempt to get a massive booze haul, so as to impress the girls they like and try to lose that one thing all teenage boys want to see the back off. Their virginity. The film is set really into two stories that off Seth and Evan which eats up two thirds of the screen time, and that of Fogell and two lovable but inept cops played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. The two are conjoined at the beginning and at the end, but the middle section splices between the two. The film is written in the same crude but clever manner that films like American Pie and The 40 year Old Virgin (another Apatow product) big hits in recent years. It's nice to see a teen comedy that whilst containing all the same elements of the genre, also has a heart, soul and some extremely familiar situations and gags. Films like Road Trip, Pledge This and Van Wilder only maintain half of that equation and as a result are only ever half as good as Superbad indeed in the case of the Paris Hilton DTV movie, they can be a lot worse than even that. The performances are all excellent, Hill can be a tad irritating at times but it's well tempered by Cera's always charming turn. The two share great chemistry, the audience truly believes in their 10 year friendship. As Fogell Christopher Mintz-Plasse really gets the majority of the laughs, he's not a character with any real emotional core but his hilarious I.D (he names himself only McLovin) and his antics with Rogen and Hader are just about the funniest things in the film. Speaking of that duo they're also very good, particularly Hader as the more unstable of the two. One of the key problems the film has is it's lack of development with any female characters. The two chicks the lead duo are after are good looking and pleasant but nothing more. The young actresses do fine with the material I expect they where given, it's just the material itself feels light in the load. The jokes are usually amusing with several laugh out loud moments interspersed within the movie. Obviously a few gags don't work (a sequence involving a young child drawing dicks didn't do it for me) but generally the observations made by screenwriters Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen are funny, witty and surprisingly affecting and familiar. Within the Summer it was released I found only The Simpsons Movie funnier. At two hours director Greg Mottola lets the film drag on 10 minutes to long, but to make the emotional points he needs the man is right to take the picture past the standard 90 minute runtime for this sort of fare. Some parties have read into a gay subtext within the production, I didn't pick up on that, just that these where two friends very close to each other. Seeing as the film also points out that both guys are going to different colleges, the film also deals with the partition of this friendship. Some of the conversations surrounding this are really well done and tug a little at the audience's heart strings. Superbad has a few flaws but none are fatal. The film is funny and emotionally engaging which is what it really needs to be, and thus some of the dud jokes and 2-D characters are easy to forgive. The film offers enjoyment and a little more, which is much more than most of it's over stuffed genre can muster. It ain't Supergood, but I'd certainly give it a watch."

","I know I will get a lot of heat for saying so, but Superbad isn't as funny as everyone says. A film is truly hilarious to me if I can go in there alone, sit by myself, and still laugh out loud. For me, seeing funny movies with people makes them more funny. I only saw Superbad with one friend, and I never found myself laughing very hard save the drawings of the genitalia (I use genitalia to avoid getting pulled over by the administrators). That was truly hilarious...but besides that, the film consisted of a bunch of just funny scenes.<br/><br/>Maybe my expectations are too high. I love these kinds of movies. I love movies that use the f-word, bathroom humor, what have you that also have good scripts. For example, I am a big fan of Kevin Smith, but found his movies to be superior to Superbad.<br/><br/>See this movie with people, crazy people, a lot of crazy people, and maybe Superbad will be the awesome experience it is supposed to be.<br/><br/>7/10, I won't deny that the characters were awesome, namely McLovin and the cops."

","I like Superbad for the following reasons: <br/><br/>1. Superbad is uncompromising in its look at what it can be like to transition out of High School. The roles of the girls and boys in the story are anchored in exceptionally balanced, three-dimensional characters. In these characters, there are redeeming qualities and flaws that range from subtle to glaring. However, Seth, Evan, Fogell, Jules, Becca, and the two cops are all different people at the end of the movie than they were at the beginning, and the story is told in a way that the audience understands.<br/><br/>2. The profanity. Words are tools, and the dialog of Superbad builds the expression of not only the thoughts and the characters, but also of what the collective culture of the characters is. This is not a movie for someone to get caught up on what it is young people say. This is a movie for people who appreciate what young people mean.<br/><br/>3. Quid Pro Quo. Just as Juno is to Knocked Up and Mean Girls is to...well, pretty much the whole genre of High School Boy Geeks Overcoming Oppressive Jocks Movies, Superbad is begging for a response to be made from a female perspective.<br/><br/>That would be the movie to threaten the establishment.<br/><br/>sincerely, <br/><br/>Dave"

","This movie was so well written and honestly quite entertaining. I think that 3/4 of the people here who write negative comments on this movie either (A) have no sense of humor and then i completely understand, or (B) Used to draw penises themselves when they were younger, wet their pants when they were younger, couldn't get laid in high school, got spit on by a bully, and cannot get past the fact that a movie actually talked about it. The reason that Seth Rogen wrote this movie was to possibly humor his own problems as a kid in high school. I mean granted it is improbable that he drew cocks as an 11 year old. This movie overall honestly explained a very typical time in high school whether it be your senior year or sophomore year. It is all about proving yourself to other in an attempt to either get laid or just fit in. God only knows that most people have gone through this, maybe even later in life."

","Superbad is a story about two friends with separation anxiety. this is their last night as high school kids, it's time to seal the deal with their girls.<br/><br/>To start off, the beginning of the film really sets the tone for the rest of the film. when it first starts you are immediately drawn into the acting and comedic performances. the movie immediately tells you that Evan is a slightly shy, but all around gentlemen. you also find out that Seth is freakishly horny teen with the need to get a girlfriend for the summer. Once about 1/5 into the movie you find out that Fogell (McLovin) is a out-going wannabe ladies man, who uses terms such as ""gangstas"" and ""homies"".<br/><br/>To put it simply this movie is a very good teen movie, and possibly the best one ever in my eyes. Many people compare this to American Pie, this surpasses American Pie by quite a bit. On the comedy balance beam, this BARELY out-weighs ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", but i don't compare the two because to me they are like brothers. Both written and produced by the same people, with the same type of comedy.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anybody with a smart sense of humor and in the right mood for a Judd Apatow film.<br/><br/>""I am McLovin"""

Undoubtedly funniest in it's first act, Superbad becomes less personal and hilarious when the more plot-oriented, hi-jinks-ensuing second act, and tender third come into fruition. This isn't to say the material and great performances do not feel funny and fresh throughout. Merely it is to say that what could have been one of the funniest comedies to arrive in many, many moons trades in some superbly honed charm for a more emotionally satisfying and typically well-rounded experience."

","Okay, first off let me just say that this is a film that many will love and many will hate. I myself am very picky on comedies. When I first saw the trailer I thought ""Another typical-cliché'd teen comedy"", but man I was wrong! This is a movie that doesn't use childish potty-humor or the vastly overrated ""kick-n-the-nuts"" crap to get you to chuckle. Yes, it uses profanity, what did you expect. It's humor is very funny due to it's witty duologue. It has two important elements: Heart and Humor.<br/><br/>The story is about to somewhat geeky, horny seniors in high school, smart-ass Evan(Cera) and the charming Seth(Hill) who want some action before they walk across the stage. They both have a crush on two girl's, one who happens to invite Seth to her party. He promises he will get them alcohol. So this is where the third member comes in, Foggel(Mintz-Plasse) aka McLovin' who just happened to get his weaselly little hands on a fake ID. From here on their well-planned out scheme gets blown way out of proportion.<br/><br/>I haven't seen a comedy this good in a long time. It holds it's style and is funny throughout the whole movie, their are some uncomfortable parts, but they are short and don't hurt the story. It's, in my opinion, the ""Animal House"" of this generation, and it is will definitely be at the top of my ""Funniest Movie"" list."

"alissonwonderland","9","0","2","29 November 2007"," Entertaining and Candid
","To preface this I HATE teen sex comedies. I think movies in which I am supposed to cheer on some insensitive teenage boy gets laid, as masculinity is defined by how many women you sleep with, are pathetic and pointless. However this was far from the average teen comedy and it was written with warmth and care for all the characters. The dialogue was realistic (sorry if crassness offends but honestly people have always been crass it's a fact) but the point was even though these boys were obscene their sexual behavior wasn't.<br/><br/>So how is this movie the nonstandard teen sex comedy? First of all, like I said, the characters are likable and relatable. Casting Michael Cera was a wonderful choice to play Evan as his character is the awkward yet adorable one. The dialogue shows how inept these boys are sexually and that makes them much more interesting. I remember my male friends speaking to each other like this when I was seventeen and several of my male friends who are my age (early twenties) felt like this was an exact representation of their teen years. Secondly, the film does not act like sex is something people can do and be detached. The humor is in how vulnerable all parties are in sex. It exposes the true awkwardness of most people's first sexual encounters and the characters redeem themselves not by ""getting laid"" but by being good friends. That being said, this is a very old fashioned comedy, were it not for the cursing this is eerily similar, to the screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's. Thirdly, the girls are smart and realistic. They are independent and funny. They are welcome additions to this film but they do not have too much of a personality because I think the writers focus was to celebrate being boys and a real definition of what being masculine is, immature, funny, but lovable. It is rare to see a film that addresses issues these kinds of issues.<br/><br/>Also, since the film combines screwball elements and realistic dialogue makes it quite engaging. The film is hilarious and honestly it takes a lot for me to laugh out loud and this film did that quite often. Please go to the quotes page if you are in doubt. I would suggest everyone see this film as it is hilarious."

","I have to say, I only watched this due to the rating it had got IMDb. I am not normally into comedies, particularly ones that involve American teenagers coming of age sort of thing. The last similar one I watched was American Pie, which although I can understand why people did find it funny, it was not for me. This however was surprisingly hilarious and at times had me laughing out aloud. I would say that men more than women would prefer this film as for me part of the humour was looking back to me male teen years and thinking 'Yes, thats exactly right.' and cringing with embarrassment. In hindsight however, these incidents were funny. The film manages to hit home very well the awkwardness of situations which are of your own doing, and the one track mind of being an adolescence. Throw in some bizarre behaviour by some of societies so called respectable members and the story never really slows down. But for me it has to be the one liners throughout the film, the ones that I have made up my mind to remember but am never able to. I found it so good I was able to watch it twice in 24 hours due to my wife wanting to watch it the next day."

Also, since it has ""George-Michael"" in it from Arrested Development, I assumed it might be worth watching for that alone (the reason most people saw Licensed to Wed - for the Office cast members). When browsing the local movie choices at a dollar theater, it was one of the choices, so I looked at an online review source and noticed it had many good reviews. Now I was intrigued. Also, I noticed this was directed by the Coen Brothers. Maybe this movie is a sure thing? Upon seeing it, I was totally stunned. This may be one of the top 5 teen movies of all times! Sure, it still has a few tired premises, but does it so well that you don't notice so much. The best part is that this movie is SO funny. It packs more laughs per minute than anything I can think of. The only weird thing about this movie is that I have not heard more about it. Had this film been promoted a little more, it would surely be the Porkys of this decade, no question. Had this been an 80's movie, it would have been right up there with the best from Hughes! This is highly recommended, well, unless you are a stodgy old person."
"ibetnoonesthoughtofusingthisname","8","0","1","30 September 2007"," Superbad - a review
","With more profanity in the first twenty minutes than you could shake any number of sticks at, Superbad gives the initial impression that it's quite happy to work on the same level as films such as The 40-year old Virgin and, more recently, Knocked Up. After all, the producers remain the same and some old cast members rejoin them for another outing, this time under the direction of Greg Mottola. The film follows the story of best friends Seth and Evan (played by Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) during their final days of high school. They are invited to a house party and agree to buy the alcohol in an attempt to impress the host and her friend. Enter Fogell, the school's super nerd who has just acquired a very unique ID card. The trio set out to get their hands on some booze, which they are convinced will earn them the admiration of the girls at the party. However, things are never that simple. Fogell  or ""McLovin""  is caught up in a robbery at the local 7-11 that sends him on a trip with two highly incompetent cops. So do you come out with a head-full of new insults? Well, of course. It's a prerequisite for the Borat generation. But that's not all you come out with, which is what separates Superbad from its predecessors. The relationship between the two protagonists, Seth and Evan is put under strain when they learn they will soon be attending separate colleges. They both have to come to terms with the impending separation after years of co-dependence. The film won't be to everyone's taste, especially with some of the taboos it sets out to break and a common theme of hedonistic pleasure-seeking. You might also get a sense that you have seen something like this before. The concept certainly isn't fresh; echoes of American Pie and Porkys are rife. However, the friendship is so well-portrayed between the two lead characters that it gives the teen comedy a fresh appeal. By the end of the film, you can't help but dismiss all the bad language that's exchanged as simple bravado. Underneath all this bravado lies a very poignant buddy movie that is a joy from start to finish."

","Superbad manages to be both enjoyable and touching, and not in the creepy-uncle sort of way, either. If you can stomach the 186 instances of the f-word - and I'm sure most of you can - you'll never stop laughing. It's hysterical. I'm not going to put it on the level of classics such as Airplane! or Young Frankenstein, but coming from a thirtysomething who's not the intended audience, it's badass in its funniosity. It's a movie in which high school seniors talk like high school seniors and act like high school seniors, not a movie like Porky's, in which guys with receding hairlines pretended they hadn't yet grown pubic hair.<br/><br/>First things first - I'm changing my name to McLovin, because it's THAT hardcore. When chicks hear my name, they may give me an askance look, but they're really thinking, ""Hm, that is so hawt."" I know this because Fogel (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) wound up scoring, sort of, on the basis of his new name. That's right, pushed-up glasses, dorky haircut, stammering, it all means diddly if you have one and only one name. Why else did Madonna get so much action back in the day? Or Jackee'? Or Cher. Or Fabio. Yes, I'll be the thirtysomething, Dilbert-like Fabio. Chicks dig that.<br/><br/>Fantasy aside, here's the basic plot. Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are longtime buds who are nearing the end of their high school existence. They expected to go to college together as well, but it turned out that Evan was hella smarter than Seth, so although the former got into Dartmouth, the latter could do no better than a state college. Moreover, it's the standard end-of-school party time! Seth wants desperately to hook up with Jules, who's hosting the party. To get into her good graces, he tells her that he and Evan will supply the shindig with booze. (Everyone's underage, in case that wasn't clear.) Meanwhile, Evan has the hots for Becca, whom he respects - Evan's one of those quiet, sensitive types, always tripping over himself not to be impolite while being awkward. The boys now have a quest - use Fogel's newfound fake ID - he's suddenly a 25-year-old Hawaiian named McLovin! - to buy a metric crapload of liquor for the party.<br/><br/>As with Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, everything goes wrong. Fogel's separated from Evan and Seth when the liquor store is robbed, and the other two wind up at a soirée where, among other things, Seth winds up with a nasty liquid on his pants. Plus there are two ribald, hell-raising cops who smoke, drink, shoot their guns in the air - on duty. Aw, yeah. ""Can I shoot one?"" asks Fogel. ""I don't know,"" replies Officer Michaels, ""can you?"" On one level, this is pure raunch, with sex and cursing (and even some mild drug use). Lots of sex references that might squick you out if you're of a certain age and can't handle teens even thinking about fornication. (You probably haven't read this far, then, bailing when the ""f-word"" term was used earlier.) But even so, the profanity seems somehow natural, almost organic - this is how kids talk. Not all, surely, but some portion. It's not as if they're all being presented as child prodigies who harbor mean streaks, they're merely acting as typical teens might.<br/><br/>On another level, though, there is deep meaning in the relationship between Evan and Seth, two friends who have grown to be completely dependent on each other over the years, so much so that they're in denial about their future - Evan will be rooming with Fogel at Dartmouth, a fact he's kept from Seth. Seth is arrogant, loud, obnoxious, and not particularly bright or gallant, and Evan is his polar opposite in nearly everything. Neither one exudes machismo or toughness, although Seth puts up a good front. Their sweet, platonic relationship comes off as sincere to its very core. This is not a cheap dichotomy thrown together for laughs; you get the feeling Seth and Evan really care for each other and that each feels he'd be hopelessly lost without the other. It's a bittersweet feeling.<br/><br/>But that's all below the surface. Revel instead on the entertaining performances by the bombastic Hill and the reserved Cera - these guys act as if they've known each other all their lives, the chemistry's so good. Also no slouch is the inimitable Mintz-Plasse, who's a bit like DJ Qualls' character in Road Trip: geeky and yet appealing as all get out."

","The title says it all. This movie is superbadass. You know, in as far as movie standards go, Superbad is not a masterpiece, or even something to speak about with more than a chuckle. With that said, though, I had a great time with this flick. It is tough to be a hard-R without any nudity for a film of its kind these days. The shear abundance of cursing and innuendo make you feel dirty enough. How writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg came up with some of the situations shown, or the ridiculousness of what these characters say, is beyond me, but the genuine way in which it is all delivered is true to the spirit of that time on the cusp between high school and college. These kids are the dorks always being pushed to the background and they have one opportunity to turn that all around. The journey they take to finally get there, though, is a ride you won't believe.<br/><br/>A lot is being said about this being a Judd Apatow film. A few of his regulars are on hand, Rogen, Jonah Hill, and Martin Starr; it has a more intellectual way of getting the laughs that usually come off as being funny with no transition to the story in lesser fare; and above all else, it is a story from the heart about the bond of friendship. The movie is not, however, directed by Apatow; instead, the man is Greg Mottola. Now I am not slighting him in the faintest here, but I don't think it would have mattered who directed it. There aren't any huge set pieces or inventive camera tricks. As far as these types of films go, it is the writing that supersedes all. The thing about 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up is not that they were directed by Apatow, but that they were written by him. When it comes to Superbad, the script is just too funny to be able to be harmed by the man behind the camera. As long as he keeps the film rolling on these actors, the writing will carry it to the promise land. I give all the credit to Rogen and Goldberg for that, and hope their second feature, Pineapple Express, will be as goodI mean these two started writing both films in high schoolthat's impressive.<br/><br/>If anything needs mentioning besides the screenplay, it is the wonderful acting. All the awkwardness of high school and sex come across with truth and candor. Michael Cera's delivery is just insane. His looks of innocence and ability to let the words come out as if they are of the moment and genuine reactions sell it every time. The chemistry with his character's best friend, played by Hill, comes across well and the two have a witty rapport. All the scenes you saw in the trailer were alternate versions, the real footage is much funnier and much dirtier; these two definitely enjoy playing off one another. Through the reality of all the anxiety of going to the one graduation party they have been invited to and the responsibility bestowed upon them to bring the alcohol, we are given some situations along the way that are more or less unreal. From the leg used as a tampon scene; the getting hit by a car, not once, but twice; the singing of ""These Eyes"" with a bunch of cokeheads; the nice cameos from David Krumholtz and Kevin Corrigan at a messed up party; or anything that happens with the town's wonderful law enforcement, the laughs never stop. Unfortunately, it does feel long and drawn out overall, I can't remember a lull in the story, but the pacing just dragged a bit. By having it fire on all cylinders yet still feel a bit sluggish, I must put blame on the inexperienced Mottola. Maybe pointing the camera isn't all that needs to be done to make a great script pop.<br/><br/>What stands out above all else, though, is the debut of Christopher Mintz-Plasse. The kid is total geekfrom nerdy glasses, boyish haircut, ghetto speak, and nasal voice, McLovin is total cool. He handles the role splendidly as he is trucked around town by the best cops ever, played by Rogen and Bill Hader. These three are priceless throughout their travels, right down to the wonderful finale of their story arc. Mintz-Plasse shows how even the dork can make it happen with a little confidence and a couple beers down the hatch. Hey, he did out Breathalyzer Rogen in the squad car. There was no stopping the laughs when these guys were in front of the camera, but then there were few breaks otherwise as well. While not as intelligent or lasting as Virgin, it was a better and raunchier time then the overly sappy and romantic Knocked Up. This film is not for your teenage kids, though, it is for you people in your twenties and thirties looking to remember back in the day when you were as awkward and helpless as these sad souls. All you can do is hope that when you look back at your past, you took the plunge and made a name for yourself as these kids did."

","Superbad is another one of those crude comedies in the tradition of Knocked Up, The 40 Year old Virgin, and American Pie. The story was written by Seth Rogen (yep that guy from Knocked Up) and his friend Evan Golberg. By all accounts it seems based on their lives in high school, and yes it is very vulgar, but that doesn't stop the movie from still being hilarious.<br/><br/>Two teenagers Seth and Evan (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) who have been friends forever are finally graduating from high school. After Seth is invited to a graduation party by Jules (Emma Stone) the girl he's been wanting to get with for a long time, both he and Evan are suddenly on a mission to provide alcohol for the party. Evan is of course not sure at first, but when Becca (Martha Maclsasc) the girl of his dreams tells him she's going to be there, he gladly accepts.<br/><br/>With the help of their nerdy friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who's getting a fake ID that will make it possible to get the alcohol, the plan is set. However, things quickly start to go wrong when Fogell returns with the fake ID with the hilarious one word name McLovin, and an absurd date of birth. It gets even worse when Fogell goes in to buy the alcohol and is assaulted by a robber who punches him and robs the store. The troubles just escalate when Fogell finds himself suddenly hanging out with two goofy police officers (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader in two hilarious roles) who were called to the crime scene and are glad to take Fogell where he needs to go, but maybe just not right away. Seth and Evan, who believe that Fogell is about to be arrested, panic and take a ride with some sinister individual who takes them to some seedy house party where some dangerous individuals are at. Do the three finally get to their destination? Do Seth and Evan hook up with the girls of their dreams and lose their virginity? I'll not spoil it.<br/><br/>Of course the story isn't just about the three guys troubles with getting the alcohol for the party. It is also a story about the friendship between Seth and Evan. You see the two have been friends forever, and after graduation, Evan will be going to some big out of state college whereas Seth will be going to a local school. Both have issues on the subject, and both are frightened of what life will now be like without the other. The movie may be profane, and there are a lot of vulgarities to back this up, but it also has a heart. The underlining theme though, through all the crudeness, still falls back on true friendship.<br/><br/>The acting was very well done, and the story, though unbelievably over the top, never lags. Both the writers (Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg) and the director (Greg Mottola) manage to make this one of the better comedies of the year. I found that I liked it a little more than Knocked Up (another good comedy), but that is just one person's opinion."
