"ajmclean_2","10","53","61","28 March 2005"," Excellent thought-provoking film done with super editorial work and world-class acting by Ed Harris & Cuba Gooding Jr.
","The fact that the movie is based on a true story contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie. The story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out. In one moment you think that something happens to Coach Jones or Radio. Well it does, but certainly not what you'd expect.<br/><br/>The film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by Ed Harris & Cuba Gooding Jr. are some of their best in my opinion. The ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right. Well I guess that was what Michael Tollin & Mike Rich were trying to do. First-class movie.<br/><br/>Esbj√∏rn Nordby Birch. Denmark."

","'Radio' tells the true life story of a high school football coach who befriends a severely mentally retarded young man (whom they nickname 'Radio' because he loves listening to the radio so much), lets him hang out with the team, and, thereby, changes not only the boy's life but the lives of just about everyone in the South Carolina town in which they live. When Radio's behavior on the sidelines begins to serve as a distraction during the games, some of the less sympathetic, die-hard football fans of the town make an effort to downplay his role or eliminate his presence altogether.<br/><br/>Set in 1976, 'Radio' is a thoroughly predictable, sentimental heart tugger that will have people either gagging on the syrup or crying in their popcorn. For all its heavy handed manipulation, however, 'Radio' turns out to be a pretty decent little film due, primarily, to the superb performances by Ed Harris and Cube Gooding Jr., and to the fact that the movie doesn't overplay its hand as often as it might. In fact, it wisely underplays much of the conflict, allowing the moments of quiet subtlety to predominate. As played by Harris, Coach Jones is a solid, decent, caring man who can't help but give his love to a fellow human being who needs it. Harris' soft-spoken strength makes us believe in the goodness of the man. The film does an effective job conveying the incredulous reactions of many of the otherwise well-meaning town folk, as even Radio's own mother asks Joe why he is doing what he's doing. The scenes between Jones and this woman, lovingly played by S. Epatha Merkerson, are some of the finest in the film. The movie also isn't afraid to confront the issue of whether the people of the town - and that includes Jones himself - aren't actually being patronizing towards Radio in their treatment of him, and whether he isn't more of a 'mascot' for the team than a bona fide member. Gooding Jr. slips effortlessly into the role of Radio, making him a compelling figure even though he has virtually no lines of dialogue in the movie. Alfre Woodard is excellent as the caring but nervous school principal who sees Radio's presence on campus as a potential threat to student safety, but who has enough faith in Jones to give Radio a chance to prove himself. It's nice to see Debra Winger in a movie again, although her role as Jones' ever-patient, ever-supportive wife, doesn't give her much room to strut her stuff as an actress. <br/><br/>There's no denying that 'Radio' is a humanity-of-man type film that could easily set the teeth on edge with its Goody Two Shoes philosophy of life. Be that as it may, 'Radio' turns out to be a warm, uplifting film that even Scrooge would probably like."

","I really enjoyed Radio and think it was one of the nicest movies I have seen. I think it a movie for everyone and teaches many lessons about life. I was also amazed to find out that the move was based on a real man. With all the tough road blocks Radio came across he continued to move forward even though the future was uncertain and he didn't have the mental capacity to understand much around him! I thought that Cuba Gooding Jr. played a tremendous role and should win an Oscar for this. I felt for him so much and it made me cry because of some of the hell he went through. I also thought Ed Harris played an incredible role as the coach. This movie really moved me and made my laugh, cry and ultimately feel good at the end! What a movie!"

","This is one of the best films I have ever seen! How anyone can knock this movie just befuddles my imagination! First of all, Gooding's and Harris's performances were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. That is the only way I can describe the acting: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off; then you see Gooding, and his performance was magical. As for the plot, since it was based on a true person, it goes where the lives of the characters go. For all the action buffs, it might be a little slow, but then it's not an action film. I definitely give this movie a 10. It deserves nothing less!"
"callanvass","9","8","9","13 June 2010"," One of Cuba's greatest performances, in this heart-warming real life account of Radio Kennedy.
","Radio was a movie I had heard mixed things about, but because I'm such a huge fan of Cuba Gooding, I of course checked it out. I adore Ed Harris so watching him and Cuba act alongside each other was a treat to watch. Radio I suppose is a predictable piece of sentimentality, but the way it's done is wonderful. I have worked with people who are mentally challenged and ever since then, I have grown to understand and deal with them with patience, so while I was watching the story unfold, I couldn't help but feel emotion for Radio. I really don't understand how Cuba Gooding earned a razzy for his performance here, I felt it was Oscar worthy!. I really feel Radio is a nice feel-good story of a kid that's mentally challenged being accepted by the society that he is living in, and becoming a legend in his own right. Maybe people won't love it as much as I did, but if you've worked with these kinds of kids perhaps you'd understand why I got into this as much as I did.<br/><br/>Performances. Cuba Gooding gives yet again a fantastic performance. This should have revived his career, but instead he's doing many crappy DTV movies now, which is very sad with a man of his caliber of talent. He feels mentally challenged, looks mentally challenged, it really was a phenomenal performance. Ed Harris is just as good. His character isn't as hard to play, but he has a lot of heart and his character was just as important.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Radio is a great piece of sentimentality, and it's bound to jerk a few tears or two, see it.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a South Carolina town? The answer appears to be that in spite of his handicap, James Kennedy, understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a fixture in the sports scene. Also, the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience Coach Jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart.<br/><br/>""Radio"", directed by Michael Tolllin, is a formula film inspired on a true story. Yet, the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast.<br/><br/>Coach Jones is instrumental in getting the young man, who is called Radio because his passion for collecting them, involved in sports, a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life. Coming from a poor background, Radio, lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coach's intentions. Radio is seen by the school kids as a mascot, at first, then, his sunny disposition wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body.<br/><br/>The film owes a lot to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. who make a great pair as the coach and Radio. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence. He gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility to make amends for something that bothers him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, does interesting work as the mother of Radio. Alfre Woodard, another good actress plays the high school principle with style. Debra Winger, only has a few scenes in the film.<br/><br/>""Radio"", while being sentimental, will warm anyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them. Michael Tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us."

","Not much to it but a validation of small town values and the embracing of a mentally challenged young man into its heart.<br/><br/>I read some of the reviews and was surprised at some of the hostility it engendered. I felt Cuba Gooding handled the part with dignity and respect unlike Sean Penn's drooling fool portrayal in ""I am Sam.""<br/><br/>The fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more heartwarming. Sports are taken seriously in small town high school America (and elsewhere, I suspect) and I felt the portrayal of these competitive students opening their hearts to one less fortunate rang true, at least for me.<br/><br/>The coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and Radio but rather came gently to the decision himself under Radio's loving and open ways.

","I thought Uptown Girls was the most touching movies of 2003. But after seeing this movie, I now think it comes in a tie with Uptown Girls. It's perfectly well acted by Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. The story is set in 1976,football coach Harold Jones(Ed Harris) is hard drivin in pratice, he seems to have very little time for his wife and daughter(Debra Winger and Sarah Drew). But his view on life begins to change, when he meets James Robert Kennedy(Cuba Gooding Jr) who has a very slow learning process. Harold asks him to come to practice and help out a little. The two form a friendship, and Harold gives him the nickname Radio. But they soon begin to learn a lot from each other. A very beautiful film. That teaches us a lot about the human spirit. I shore hope that Cuba Gooding Jr gets nominated for an oscar."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","24","37","22 January 2007"," Almost Too Good To Be True
","This was unusual: a modern-day film which was ultra-nice. In fact, it was so nice it bordered on being too hard to believe in parts. As I watching this based-on-a-real-life story, I was thinking, ""nobody is this nice, this tolerant."" Mainly, I was referring to Ed Harris' role as ""Coach Jones."" I think they went a little overboard on his character, but that's better than the reverse: showing him worse than what he was in real life. Odd to see Harris playing the role, too, since he has a long resume of playing nasty, profane characters.<br/><br/>Anyway, I never complain about a nice, feel-good film, and it is nice to see a bunch of well- meaning, kind people. Those folks direct their friendship, love and compassion to ""James Kennedy,"" better known as ""Radio,"" a mentally slow high school kid played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story takes place in the mid 1970s in South Carolina. Gooding does a nice job with the role, too. However, like Sean Penn's role of a mentally-challenged man in ""I Am Sam,"" an hour-and-a-half of a character like this is plenty. After that, the loudness of those guys gets tiresome to hear.<br/><br/>Note: It was interesting in one of the documentaries on this DVD to find out that, in real life, in took years for ""Radio"" to make his transformation, not months as shown in the film."

"sddavis63","8","3","3","7 November 2011"," Great Performances In A Well Done Fact-Based Film
","The highlights of this film are the two absolutely superb performances by Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris. Gooding was the title character - James Robert Kennedy, a mentally disabled young man known simply as ""Radio"" because of his love for radios. Harris played Harold Jones - a local high school teacher who was also coach of the Hanna High School football team and the school's athletic director. The movie is the portrayal of how their relationship develops, with Jones taking the young man under his wing, so to speak, and making him part of both the team and the school community, fighting the efforts of many of the townsfolk and school board officials to have him removed.<br/><br/>It's certainly a heartwarming story, although it's not exactly what I'd call a tearjerker, although there are moments when tears might flow (particularly the death of Radio's mother.) There are question raised throughout the movie that are often hard to deal with. One admires Jones' devotion to Radio, but one wonders why he seems unable to show the same devotion to his own daughter. It's great to see Radio becoming gradually accepted as part of the team and school, but the movie doesn't shy away from the question of whether he isn't being treated more as a mascot than anything else - certainly a question that ran through my head on a number of occasions as we watch Radio lead the team on the the field and join the cheerleading squad from time to time. Jones' own personal motivation is finally explained as he relates a childhood experience to his daughter that illustrates why he feels so strongly for Radio. In the end, Radio's place within the life of the school is made more ""official"" and Kennedy is apparently still roaming the halls and the sidelines of Hanna High as an official 11th Grade student for as long as he wants to be one - this being based on a true story.<br/><br/>""Based on a true story"" always makes me wonder. Kennedy is real, and he's really at Hanna High and he and Jones are really friends, so there's obviously a strong basis in fact for this movie. I wondered, though, about what seemed to be the surprisingly easy acceptance of Radio among the townspeople. Although the whole community was concerned about the on-field performance of the football team, aside from one parent and one school board official, people seemed largely unconcerned about or uninterested in Radio himself - which struck me as a surprisingly bland reaction for a small southern town in the late 1960's to have for a mentally disabled young black man. But clearly it worked long term. I did appreciate that this was about much more than the football team. The football team was the backdrop for what happened, but no more than that. This was't an ""underdog overcomes"" sports story. The Hanna High team didn't have a great season in this movie; neither Radio nor Coach Jones inspired them to win anything of significance. The football team just became in some ways a microcosm of the community, as they grew more and more accepting of Radio, to the point at which Radio's presence was simply a given.<br/><br/>This is a very well done film, one of the better ""based on a true story"" films I've come across.

","I guess as I'm getting older, I'm finally learning what it means to be human. Perhaps on an emotional level -- emotional IQ is the buzzword today, right -- anyway, perhaps on an emotional level I've been as severely emotionally retarded as James Robert Kennedy was/is on an intellectual level.<br/><br/>I was flabbergasted by the movie ""Radio."" What stunned me most was its pure humanity. It hit me with its pure power the way John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"" did. And the shocking thing, to me, was that even though I saw the movie version of that classic over 50 years ago . . . I never really got it . . . I never really got Steinbeck's message.<br/><br/>You see, all this time, I thought his book and the movie were about LOVE . . . and love, which is so damn important whether in all caps or in lower case, is still such a small and unimportant emotion compared to human dignity. That's the story of Radio and that's the story Of Mice and Men. And yes, talking about OM&M I did cry in the final scene when big Lennie so pathetically says, ""Tell me about the rabbits, George."" But until I saw the movie Radio even though I never would even think of doing a cruel thing to retarded individuals . . . I never really got Steinbeck's message and I never really understood about human dignity. I like the fact that Radio learned slowly, but that the town and the townspeople learned rapidly from him. And the one line where it's said "" . . . he treats ALL of us ALL the time, like we wish people treated us half the time . . ."" Radio was absolutely nothing like I expected and everything the best movies are."

"classicsoncall","7","2","2","19 December 2018"," ""It's never a mistake to care for someone.""
","The entire time I was watching this movie I had no idea it was based on a true story and that a real, James Robert 'Radio' Kennedy exists. In fact, he's still alive as I write this, and at seventy two years old, still maintains his status as a 'junior' at the T.L. Hanna High School in Anderson, South Carolina. That just brought an entirely different perspective to watching the story, and the closing credits showing him participating with the football team and being actively engaged with the community is both inspiring and tear inducing.<br/><br/>The movie does a fine job of chronicling the way Coach Harold Jones (Ed Harris) took the young man under his wing following an unfortunate prank that members of the high school team played on him. Actually more than a prank, more like physical abuse. By degrees, Coach Jones and his assistant Honeycutt (Brent Sexton) bring the teenager around in a way that not only builds his self esteem, but allows the wider student body of Hanna to accept him as a school hall monitor and a vocal purveyor of school news with his morning PA announcements. We eventually come to learn about the coach's motivation during an emotional heart to heart conversation with his own teenage daughter (Sarah Drew), who along with the coach's wife (Debra Winger), had to often settle for a back seat when it came to Harold's attention.<br/><br/>I haven't seen Cuba Gooding Jr. in very many films, but I thought he did a very credible job in the role of 'Radio'. The nickname derived from the young man's fascination with a desk top radio given to him by the assistant coach, and it stuck. Due to Gooding's youthful appearance, you would never know that he was portraying a teenager at the age of thirty five. That he wasn't nominated in some of the major award categories for his role seems somewhat unfair, though in the same year, while nominated for Best Actor by the Image Award folks, he landed a Worst Actor nomination for roles in something called 'Boat Trip' and 'The Fighting Temptations'. I haven't seen those, so I'll have to reserve judgment.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a simple story about how love and compassion can change lives, and in quite the intriguing way, how a single life can affect the way others see the world and themselves in relation to a disadvantaged youth. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have high schoolers, especially sports team members, watch the movie and learn how their daily actions can have an impact on a fellow human being forever."
"dimplet","9","2","2","28 July 2012"," Radio is the antidote to the poison of Penn State
","As the film opens, we see Radio coasting down a hill in a shopping cart (or buggy, as they are called in the South), having a great time. And you can't help thinking: that looks like fun; why didn't I ever try that? It is also the way the Sports Illustrated story on Radio, which is the foundation for this movie, opens.<br/><br/>Yes, there really was a Radio, and still is. And there really is a town called Anderson that did something wonderful, and that makes me proud to be an American. But they didn't do it out of any sense of political correctness; this all started in 1964, when it still took courage in some places for whites to extend a hand to blacks.<br/><br/>Why did they do this? It is not quite clear from the 1996 SI article, which talks about some of the cruel childish pranks played on Radio, though not by school athletes; but otherwise there is no sense of the conflict found in the film. The film condenses a story lasting nearly 50 years now into one year, the first year.<br/><br/>Presumably, there was some conflict due to race and disability in those early years, but from what information is available that all soon disappeared. The school and the community took to Radio rather smoothly and quickly -- not the right stuff for a dramatic screenplay, or a believable one! But what caused a Southern town to do the right thing? It all started with Coach Harold Jones reaching out to Radio. <br/><br/>When one person who is respected in the community takes a fearless stand for what is right, it is easier for others to follow, and harder for the racists to get any traction. This was nothing new for Coach Jones, contrary to the movie account: as a youth he defended a disabled neighbor from bullies with his fists.<br/><br/>Now is a good time to revisit Radio, after the sickening perversion of school sports by a poisonous mix of pedophilia and money at Penn State's football program. Radio is a reminder that this is not what school sports is about. If you watch carefully, you will see that the movie is not just about Radio. It gives you a sense of what goes into making a successful team, football or basketball, the training, the discipline, the teamwork, the tactics. You see how the school and the community are involved in identity and emotions. And you see that coaches Jones and Honeycutt are trying build adults of good character out of their players.<br/><br/>No, they are not making a mascot out of him. You can see that a genuine sense of compassion, of seeing Radio as a human being despite the obscuring cloud of his disabilities, develops in those who get to know him, and in the whole community. And this is not just the film; you can see in the end footage, that this is real, and you can read about it. <br/><br/>Far from a mascot, Radio became a teacher, teaching the community to help those with disabilities, and to look beyond race. His lesson spread beyond Anderson, as he traveled with the teams and his reputation preceded him. Radio was only left off the team bus once, because they ran out of seats. Hannah lost that day. Radio was the first on the bus from then on. And they won that season, contrary to the film.<br/><br/>Radio is a moving film that provides a moral lesson for us all that continues to resonate today. Be kind to others, not because of what others might think, but because it is the right thing to do, even if it is unpopular. If you do it, others will follow.<br/><br/>This lesson is not just about disabilities or race. Think about that disturbed young man who allegedly opened fire in a movie theater. The way we treat people, especially when they are children, is important. If other children or teachers had reached out when he was a child, perhaps things would have been different. <br/><br/>Think back to when you were a child; was there some schoolmate you picked on, perhaps because others were doing the same? Do you wish you could turn back the clock and stand up against the other bullies to defend him, or make friends with him? That's what Radio is about: students (and adults) learning to extend a hand of friendship to someone who is different, who is being picked on cruelly.<br/><br/>Radio, the movie, obviously has a moral lesson to impart. It is not heavy handed, and it is not blatantly manipulative. It builds a certain dramatic tension without indulging in the exaggeration that might make it a move powerful movie. But it retains its credibility. Even if the writers have built a fictionalized account based on real incidents and variations of events, they have created a natural and believable story and dialog that seems consistent with the truth.<br/><br/>I have seen Radio several times now, and it holds up well. What might not strike the viewer at first is how strong are the performances of Sarah Drew and Riley Smith. Drew's emotional response to the death of Radio's mother is remarkable. Smith's acting is fine, but that he delivers some excellent football and basketball action, too, is impressive.<br/><br/>I watched Radio shortly after watching Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, made in 1967. It is worth noting that Radio shows Coach Jones watching All in the Family, a comedy that ridiculed racism. In America, films and TV helped shift public values on topics such as race. But Coach Jones took his stand in 1964, before all that. Ultimately, it all starts with individual action.<br/><br/>I would like to say thank you to Coach Jones, Coach Honeycutt, the people of Anderson, and most of all, to James Robert Kennedy, for reminding us what America really stands for."

","This movie made me cry so hard. Cuba Gooding Jr. delivers one of the most memorable performances in Hollywood history, while Ed Harris also plays a very caring coach who pities Radio. This movie is based on a wonderful true story of an autistic young black man who has a hobby of walking his shopping cart all around town observing the life that goes on around him. He is picked on by a high-school football team while walking past their practice one day and is rescued by the football coach, Ed Harris. This whole movie is sad and frustrating in some parts, but very heart-warming and funny in the end. Coach Jones (Ed Harris) makes Radio (Cuba Gooding Jr.) his assistant coach for the football team, and the player finally come to accept him and love him for who he is. This movie is all around amazing and should be on your bucket list, if you have not seen it yet."

During the beginning of the movie, when I saw Radio riding in a shopping cart looking silly, I remained silent, the remainder of the class began chuckling. As the movie progresses, I had feelings for Radio, he's an innocent man, though not many appreciate him. I loved how Coach Jones was so fatherly to him, and would do whatever he could to make him feel better.<br/><br/>This is one of few movies I have seen that have made me start crying. As we found that Radio's mother had tragically died from a heart attack and was gone, I started tearing up. I could feel the pain in Gooding's character as he suffered this terrible thing that has almost destroyed his life.<br/><br/>This was a gorgeous movie and helps both young and old to understand and care about those with disabilities.<br/><br/>To this day, I continue to fight those with disabilities, this teaches such an important lesson.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I avoided watching this film for a while because it had what I thought was a kind of stupid title. I now rate the film among my favorites. I should have known it would be a great one. Any film with either Cuba Gooding or Ed Harris is going to be good and this film has not one, but both of them. The film is based on a true story. Gooding is superb as the ""town dummy"", a mentally-retarded teen aged boy who is fascinated by a radio (hence the name) and the local high school football team. The kids on the team, being dumb teen aged boys, pick on him, eventually going a bit too far for the coach's (Ed Harris) liking. He disciplines the ringleaders and, to add insult to injury, gives Radio a job with the team. As time goes on, the team learns to accept him and he still does that job today, a couple decades later. I hate to use the word ""heartwarming"" since that usually means ""sappy"", but this one isn't at all sappy. All in all, a totally enjoyable film!"

Additionally, the movie was also a favorite in town as many of the local athletes, including my nephew (a former Q.B. in town at the rival school), were invited to be part of the crowd. And now, George Clooney is filming another football movie in the Upstate area of S.C., LEATHERHEADS, and we are thrilled that after answering a casting call for football players, my nephew was selected to be a player on George Clooney's team.

Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris do an excellent job of playing real people.  It's so nice that other people who aren't teachers can experience the same feelings I do as a special education teacher.  It's the students like Radio that make me go to work everyday because of the high level of care that the mentally disabled show towards others.  I'll admit, I could love this movie because I am a teacher, but this is just a wonderfully emotional movie that draws you in from the beginning.  There were a few times that I wanted to jump into the movie screen and smack around the father/son duo because of their (typical American) reaction to the disabled. I'd pay the full price to see this movie again and I will definitely own it on DVD.  The strange thing is, after I saw the movie, the real Radio was on ESPN2 because he was honored at the Clemson/Florida State game.

It is a feel good movie, sentimental, positive, uplifting.  The heroes of the movie are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), a man of strength and integrity, and Radio (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world. I guess I didn't find this movie to be ""sentimental hogwash"" as so many did, because it felt very real to me.  I know people like these. I've seen jocks who think it's fun to pick on the vulnerable. I've seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable. I've seen people who think high school football is serious business.  I've seen people who know what really is important in life.  Any of these people could have been people I knew.  I did laugh; I did cry.  I left the movie feeling good, remembering that there are people like Coach Jones and Radio in my world. If there aren't people like them in yours, you might not like the movie.

The other is in complete control of a apparently satisfying life and has no obligation to anyone.  Yet, through coming together we find the former can change a community and the latter finds a new life far more fulfilling than the past one.<br/><br/>The premise for this movie may seem overused - man helps handicapped young man.  However, Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr soon make us forget about any retreating of past plots.  Harris' character is one where all of us see something about ourselves √Ç‚Äì both the bad and the good.  Gooding, well, Gooding does such a remarkable job that we forget he is supposed to be acting.  Especially when the real Radio is shown at the end of the movie √Ç‚Äì we realize how truly great Cuba's performance was.<br/><br/>This is a movie that I enjoyed while in the theater, but now a day later realize that the message it conveys is still with me - ""do what is right and it will always work out in the end."""

After some months in the companion of Coach Jones and resistance of part of the locals, Radio becomes popular, beloved and a symbol for most of the population.<br/><br/>""Radio"" is really a very beautiful movie. In times of disturbance around the selfish world, this story based on true events is a message of friendship, hope and love for the other. The beautiful human being Coach Jones gives a lesson of sympathy and respect, bringing Radio to a normal life in society. The performances of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris are stunning, and I believe Cuba Gooding Jr. should had been nominated to the Oscar. Last but not the least, the footages of Radio and Coach Jones in the very end are touching, and will certainly shake the emotions of the viewer. ""Radio"" is a movie recommended for the whole family.

","I am disgusted and appalled by the positive reviews this movie is receiving. Not only is it hokey, manipulative, and melodramatic.  It's also shamelessly offensive.  The character of Radio `Gooding Jr.' is paraded around as a cute little stuff animal, like a puppy that's so cute you just want to take him home.'  This mentality is shameless; Radio is never treated as a human being, but as a manipulative device to draw sympathies from its audience.  Even more atrocious are the film's numerous moments, in which Radio gets hit in the head/trips/falls over/etc.  These moments of slapstick comedy had the audience howling with laughter merely purely because, `it's funny because Radio is retarded'  This is shameless, Now I do not feel that the word `retarded' is an appropriate word at all to describe the mentally disabled, but this seems to be the stance the film is taking, `Radio is retarded, but that's okay, because he's cute and we like him.'  Gooding's portrayal seems better suited for a John Water's film than an inspiring family drama.  To add insult to injury the film is incompetent on every level, Debra Winger is uninspired in the role as the `stereotypical housewives' that the very reminder of her heinous monologues insights laughter in all who see the film.  The Score by John Horner is pure sap always overlaying its tear some score over the tired cinematography.  Ed Harris is decent in a role he could have slept through, but manages to retain much of the audience's attention throughout the film.  In conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent human being, ignore this travesty of a film, read the book, but otherwise skip this dire film on an interesting character from American history."

I know that sometimes we feel self-conscious, but we got to understand that these people may have a way of reminding us that life is full of wonder and simplicity. sometimes it takes them to give us better perspective of what life is all about. when coach Jones that radio is the one who teaches us, that captured my heart because i am one myself and they have this light that shines out in the world of darkness."
"jaysaze","10","3","4","15 January 2005"," The most difficult journey sometimes leads to the highest reward.
","Radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt, in his heart, was the right thing to do. The viewer will be compelled to wonder what he or she would have done. The adversity that coach Jones and Radio both faced was both tragic and predictable. People did not understand; nor did they want to understand. But in the end, the power of circumstance forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they did before it happened. Radio is a mentally challenged youth who understands very little, besides three of the most important things the are too often forgotten as we mature: Intuition, compassion, and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the plight of the underdog who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards in the best way that he knows how. It was sad the way coach Jones and Radio met. The practical joke that terrified the life out of Radio was enough to make you want to severely punish, not only the boys involved, but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it. However, on the positive side of the scale, the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives in the kind of way that most of us believe only happens in the movies. This movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed. Ed Harris was his usual brilliance. Gooding was flawless. Radio is an inspiration."

How do you get #5 on the box office with that kind of attendance. I figured it was a fluke. Still, I was pretty surprised that more people were piling in to see Elf, Brother Bear, and Scary Movie 3 (and not surprisingly, Matrix Revolutions) rather than this one. I mean, seriously, does anyone know a good movie when they see one? Obviously only everybody who went to see Radio. The film was beautifully crafted, and you could feel each character's emotions if you tried. The plot takes some perfectly-timed twists and turns, making this film that much better. I'd give it a 9.5/10. And for all of those who disagree, wait for this season's Oscars."

That the kind of challenges in sports are larger and tougher and better, more pure than what you find in life. If you have conquered some game, you have conquered life.<br/><br/>The twist this time is that a weak soul, one that falls outside any grace in the real world is brought into the church of sports by a kindly priest.

"EagletHarbin","3","8","18","27 October 2003"," I hate this film
","Okay, this review is for everyone who complained that I only wrote 10/10 reviews. First off, the background. I like to give people the background of what I thought of the film before I saw it, so they know where I'm coming from. So...I've not EVER been a fan of this film. I saw the trailer, and said to myself, 'Wow, another 'inspired by a true story, Remember the Titans-esque, 'uplifting' film, only now we've got Cuba 'I'm an Academy Award winnner, yet I did 'Snow Dogs' Gooding Jr. as a retarded kid. Whoopdifriggingdo.' My fears stayed unabated, especially when reviews popped up on AICN, such as one proclaiming that the reviewer would rather razor blade his gums than see the film again. So, I had decided to skip 'Radio,' and just not ever bother with it. I saw RtT, as well as 'The Rookie,' (which, by the way, was written by the same guy who wrote this) and found them not too bad, and I actually LIKED 'Rookie,' but the concept to this one just seemed TOO dumb to bother with.<br/><br/>However, turns out that this story happened in Anderson, South Carolina, which happens to be my Dad's home town. In fact, if you watch the film, they talk about 'West Side,' and there's even a game against this 'West Side,' and that school turns out to be the one my father went to. He was even attending West Side in 1976, which is the time that the story took place (not the actual event, mind you, that happened in the early 60s). My Dad even worked at the only Burger King in town, so when the assistant goes out for burgers from said chain, he very well may have gotten they served to him by my Dad. So a lot of connections. My interest was piqued a TEENY bit, but definatly not enough to spend seven dollars on.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Saturday. 'Oh, we're going to a movie this afternoon,' my mom says. 'Which one?' I ask, begging that they want to take me to 'Lost in Translation,' or, even better, 'Thirteen.' 'We're gonna see 'Radio.'' I inwardly and outwardly groaned. 'Isn't there anything better out?' Yes, there is. 'No, and plus, it takes place in Anderson.' 'You're paying for it?' 'Yes.' 'Alright, then.' So once I get off work, I trundle down to the local multiplex, not excited at ALL about seeing the film, but actually excited about reviewing the film later.<br/><br/>So...to what you've all been waiting for, the actual review.<br/><br/>THE ACTING:<br/><br/>I'm going to put off talking about Cuba for a moment to talk about everyone else. AHH!!! Gah! Dangnabit, people! Alright, Ed Harris (whom I LOVED in 'The Truman Show') did an OKAY job in his part as the coach, but EVERYONE ELSE WAS TERRIBLE. Part of it was the lines given to them, i.e. 'All along we thought we were teaching Radio, but it turns out Radio was teaching us,' but the other part is that the people were just NOT good actors. From the WB wannabes playing the football players, to even the (so I hear) living legend Debra Winger was terrible. Off, off, OFF line readings. I've seen better line reading by ME, for crying out loud. (Note to actors: if I can act better than you, then you don't deserve to be on the big screen.)<br/><br/>Now on to good old Cuba Gooding Junior. Now, I like this guy, I really do. He was great in 'Jerry Maguire,' 'Pearl Harbor,' and even 'Men of Honor.' Then he decided to go do 'Snow Dogs,' 'Boat Trip,' and 'The Fighting Temptations.' UGH. I guess he decided he needed to do and *acting* film to make up for his tresspasses against the silver screen. But lemme tell you something, Cuba, this is NOT the role for you. First off, you are TOO DAMN OLD! The guy is going on 36, and he's playing a role where he's supposed to be in his twenties! The age is showing, man. I had no idea how old the guy was supposed to be until they finally told us, because he looks like an old guy already, and I knew the character wasn't supposed to be that old. Okay, he did an okay job of doing the mentally retarded thing. Not Oscar worthy, no where NEAR what Tom Hanks in 'Forrest Gump,' or even Sean Penn in 'i am sam' were able to pull off. He's just a comical 'retarded kid.' I couldn't feel sorry for him, because I kept being told I shouldn't, and I couldn't feel happy for him, because he's MENTALLY RETARDED! The movie didn't try to show HOW being mentally retarded is a good thing...but I'm getting off topic.<br/><br/>Just know that everyone sucked except for Cuba who was good but not great.<br/><br/>ACTING SCORE: 4/10<br/><br/>
THE WRITING:<br/><br/>'Radio's got a good heart.' 'All along, Radio's been the one teaching us.' GIVE ME A FRIGGING BREAK! The key to a good movie is that you don't tell us everything! And this film TOLD US EVERYTHING! And on top of it, it didn't let us SEE everything!<br/><br/>The whole premise (I think, it was very unclear) was that through something, Radio was able to inspire a football team, or a town, or something. He did not do this. The things we see him do are, in no particular order:<br/><br/>1. Go in a girl's locker room and then be sad about it 2. Get a penatly called on the team for shouting 'chickingshitchickingshitchickenshit!' at the coach (which was not as funny as you might think it would be 3. Cause a whole bunch of ruckas at the school with the school board investigating 4. Listen to a radio 5. Tear up his room 6. Talk funny 7. Give out presents for no particular reason<br/><br/>The things this resulted in:<br/><br/>1. The coach left the team, and they didn't win a championship 2. We find out that the coach is going to start paying closer attention to his family<br/><br/>Yes, that's it. No OVERCOMING RASCISM, no INSPIRING THE TEAM TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP, no REALISING THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE WERE RETARDED, none of that stuff we've come to expect from this type of film. NOTHING HAPPENED! NOTHING! I left the theatre not sure why I bothered in the first place. All we did was watch some semi-interesting events that happened, and see a coach get reunited to his family (which wasn't even shown well).<br/><br/>Overall, it felt like they wanted to make a movie about Radio, but didn't have a real point to it all, so just gave us some things to look at, and a couple of events to make the woman cry. Pathetic.<br/><br/>WRITING SCORE: 1/10 (with extreme prejudice)<br/><br/>
THE DIRECTING:<br/><br/>Michael Tollin shows us that he did, in fact, pass 'How to direct a movie TYPICALLY 101' with flying colours. HE does nothing new, he does nothing bold. He directs the film like any other director would have done it, only he's latched on to the recent 'zoom at random moments in sports events' trend, and figured out (like everyone else) that sports are more exciting when the camera in on the field instead of on the sidelines. Wooo.<br/><br/>I guess I shouldn't have expected anything astounding, but I sure didn't get it anyway. The film felt like it was shot by a group of ADs.<br/><br/>DIRECTING SCORE: 3/10<br/><br/>
OVERALL:<br/><br/>I hated this film. I'll just go out and say it, the only redeeming factor in this film was Sarah Drew, who was the voice of 'Sarah Rowe' in the CLASSIC Mtv animated series 'Daria,' which I'm afraid far too many people have forgotten. She was hot. The rest of the film...was not.<br/><br/>However: If you are:<br/><br/>A. An adult<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>B. You have no taste in film<br/><br/>Then you will LOVE this film. I know this because I heard everyone raving about how good it was, and how sad it was, and how uplifting it was, and how good Cuba Gooding Jr. was...everything the studio execs wanted them to think. They obviously were not paying any attention to what the film actually WAS, they made up their minds the second they saw Cuba going down that hill in the shopping cart. (Which, once again, was nowhere near as touching as they meant it to be.)<br/><br/>But, if you are in those categories, then you will love the film. (Chris' Mom and Dad, and speaking to you  ) The rest of you: aviod this film like the Plague.<br/><br/>OVERALL SCORE: 3/10"
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","3","5","8 October 2008"," What is more important, the dream you have of the dirt you're in?
","A simple film about humanity, humaneness, just plain life and what it should be. The question here is about the place of a mentally disabled person in our society. Is he supposed to be pushed on the side and kept there in the margin or is he supposed to be helped to find a place inside where he could be useful to himself, to others, and happy too? I guess when stated like that the challenge would be accepted by anyone. Asking the question is answering it, as the saying has it. But if we move to the South in the early integration days and if the mentally disabled person is black, what can we do? And asking that second question reveals what it is all about then? Not about the retard as some are going to call him, but about the racial difference. And that is what the film shows with great emotion and subtlety. And the coach in the film is white and he is doing just what he feels is good and that creates some kind of a stir and the stir from some white parents will be solved essentially by the high school students themselves who adopt the boy and make him their mascot one said, but that was false. He was more a mirror into which they saw the challenge of sport, the challenge it is to live up to something you have never done and don't know yet how to do. And that mirror was teaching a lesson of courage and enthusiasm to the teens or young men and they learned that lesson with style, gusto and charm. They learned how to love the one who was pulling them up from the dirt into the sky. A model in life is not necessarily a Hollywood star, but he can be just someone who could be bitter and defeated and yet finds in himself the strength and the inspiration to accept and face his limits and then step over them and climb. Yes you can climb into a tree even if you have no legs or no arms. The climbing is first of all in your head and if it is not there, you will never climb the tree even if you have twenty legs. That's what the film is about and the bigots who resist that lesson are just off the point and out of focus.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","The real life story of the relationship between South Carolina football coach Harold Jones(Ed Harris) and James Robert ""Radio""Kennedy(Cuba Gooding Jr.)is explored here over the course of the 1976-77 school year. Initially a mute,eccentric stranger who would roam the outskirts of town,listening to this broken down radio(hence his nickname),he is brought into the team and the school(After initially being mercilessly harassed and teased by some of his players)by Coach Jones,who has his own reasons for taking an interest in a person he quickly learns is disabled. As ""Radio"" insinuates his way into the lives of the students,coaches and even Coach Jones' family(Debra Winger and Sarah Drew),he becomes an almost invaluable fixture around the small southern town as well as the school.<br/><br/>There would be,actually,so many reasons to dislike this show:the story is painfully predictable,the writing starts to creak and crack when it tries too hard to push buttons(one example:when someone mentions how well Radio has learned since coming to the school,HAnna High,the response is ""No,we haven't been teaching him,he's been teaching us!"") and it is fairly vague as to much of Radio's actual life or personality,with the exception of his hard-working and skeptical mother(S.Epatha Markerson). But to do so would make me feel like a complete and total cad. The acting here,particularly between HArris and Gooding,is warm and endearing,and the show does good as long as it stays on a straight path of simple narrative. I would say,in the end this movie might suffer from a little too much of visceral sentiment here,choosing to wring sympathy from the audience like one wrings out a wash cloth. Certainly,people who are not a fan of warm,endearing heart-tuggers are probably going to reject this film on first glance.

"MeadeIndeed","8","1","1","31 December 2016"," It Deserves Better
","This'll be my first review written here, previously I've reviewed games both on my own website as well as writing freelance articles. Though seeing as how it's 8 AM and I haven't gone to bed yet (plus me being Swedish) expect some possible spelling errors and so forth.<br/><br/>Either way, in all honesty this movie deserves a far better rating than what it has received here on IMDb. Not to mention that some of the reviews that have been written here giving ""Radio"" a low score are outright hateful for no good reason. There is literally someone who basically says ""this is for those who said I only give 10/10 ratings"". So, by saying that, you mean that you only rated this movie poorly to ""prove a point""? (Worth mentioning that the same person gave the absolutely shittastic movie ""Hulk"" from 2003 a 10/10)<br/><br/>Whatever, moving on from the negativity! Really unsure of where to start with this film. It might not be this inspiring ""we shall overcome!"" movie, it might not be ""Forrest Gump"" but honestly it isn't that type of story and that's what I like about this movie.<br/><br/>I love ""Forrest Gump"" don't get me wrong, but the reason they're able to do a lot of the things that they do in it is because it isn't based or in any way grounded in reality. Where as ""Radio"" tells the actual story, of an actual person who at the time of the release was still alive and kicking.<br/><br/>To be completely frank I am very glad that this film doesn't even try to be like ""Forrest Gump"" because if they did it'd be so much worse. Imitation movies usually are (those that try to surf on the success of another film).<br/><br/>This story is about a mentally challenged individual, living in a small town in a semi-rural area of the United States during the 70's. It doesn't involve a whole town or say the world accepting this person or like... ""oh he taught us to accept handicapped people"" revelation. There is no need for it since more than anything the movie simply addresses that those who suffer from whatever handicap are people like anyone else and should be treated as such.<br/><br/>They don't make it into this HUGE thing, it's a slow process, I mean even towards the end of the film some people are still not accepting of this mentally challenged individual.<br/><br/>What I am trying to say is that it's grounded in reality and it works in its favor. The acting is very well done for the most part (gotta love Ed Harris, he makes almost any movie watchable), the soundtrack is good, the cinematography is rather great and believe it or not the comedy that's in this movie hits home for me. It's subtle, but it's there.<br/><br/>Again, this isn't a movie where a town or something dislikes this handicapped person and then this one other person is nice to him and then at the end they're all super happy and hug and go ""I can't believe I didn't accept you before but I totally do now"". Once again, it works completely in its favor.<br/><br/>It's a small town, one person finally doing the right thing in little steps, not everyone suddenly accepts the main character in the story and it isn't sappy.<br/><br/>Even being a ""strong burly man"" I can admit to having cried to this movie all three times that I've seen it and I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>In the words of Roger Ebert: ""There is no cynicism in Radio, no angle or edge. It's about what it's about, with an open, warm and fond nature. Every once in a while human nature expresses itself in a way we can feel good about, and this is one of those times."""

","√∞≈∏Àú‚Ä°. This is a movie that come from the heart. It's what life is really suppose to be about which is a family and community that comes together to help each other out. These are the best types of movies. It's NOT about hateful crap.. Some people would say things like""no one would go out of there way to help someone out that much"" like the couch did for radio. But It is not about black and white it is about heaven and hell. It is not a coincidence that the football couch felt in his heart he needed help radio. The football couch finds out that radio had no father for a long time and his mother eventually passes. God works in mysterious ways and radio probably really did need the football couchs help through life. Look how happy the real radio and couch both look as friends at the end of The movie . Helping others is key to life. Never hesitate to help someone that you really feel like you need to help. For instance I never had no mom or dad or family and was on the streets since I was 10 and I was sleeping at parks, or at schools at night times, and also sometimes my friends house whos mom also helped me with grocerys.. But it was never a permant spot to livestock my friends because of his step dad. But when I turned 18 I met a GOOD Christian guy who would walk his dog by the park and I would talk to him and he eventually decided to help me by gaining my trust. After he helped me I got a job, a apartment, a nice car, and eventually graduated collage. If he didn't help me I probably would of stayed homeless. That's why this movie hits me really deep. It's been a long time since I saw this movie and I really like it. Sometimes its not what a man does for himself but what he does for someone else. The last time I can remember a movie hitting me real deep was when I saw shawshank redemption even though I know there not related. This movie was directed good and makes you feel good after you watch it. This is a movie that touches the soul."

","The movie is based on a true story. The job of the actor Cuba was wonderful, he interpreted the character extremely well. The movie is very emotional and shows us that most people have prejudice, and when someone wants to act differently, even with good intentions, usually they need to win a battle against society. Sometimes, people need more understanding, attention, and someone to trust in order to improve themselves. Usually, people don't care about others and don't want to waste time on them.

","Radio is among one of my favourites from Cuba Gooding Jr. Radio is a truly touching, motivating and inspirational true-story, lead by a underrated performance by Cuba Gooding Jr. Many people claim Cuba's character roll execution as 'way over done' or 'just, plain, stupid.' Sorry I disagree. Cuba had to act as one character who is still alive today, who is also classified as a little 'slow'. He had to put on a accurate, un-offending performance in order to make this movie go well. In my eyes he did a fine job and the supporting actors did as well.

","I'm finally having to come to grips with a daunting reality. This reality just kind of sneaked up on me because for so long this current reality didn't exist. This reality I'm speaking of is my actual enjoyment of biopics.<br/><br/>As a young lad I had no interest in anything that moved slow, or was a drama, or was a tear jerker. I didn't want to be uneasy, I just wanted to be entertained, and I didn't want any tears jerked out of me. I guess it is a sign of maturity or getting more sensitive (blaah), but as I've gotten older I've began to like biopics.<br/><br/>As I pondered the possible reason(s) for my sudden change of heart towards dramas, I realized that they are a compelling way of detailing an historic event. Well, I like history a lot. I like to read or watch the history of events and people. Of course I didn't like history in high school because that was just memorizing dates, names, and a bunch of ""fore-fathers"" that did all this ""wonderful"" stuff. Now that I'm older and I can choose what historical events I want to know more about, history has become more interesting. Plus, if someone can depict an historical event or figure in an intriguing way, then it makes learning about that person or event that much more fun.<br/><br/>Radio was a mentally challenged young man that had no one other than his mother. For the first time in his life he found a support system and a friend in Coach Jones. The movie was about the bond forged between Radio (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Coach Jones (Ed Harris), and how Coach Jones gave Radio another family in the football team. It is really a feel good and touching story. Everyone has had trials and tribulations in their lifetime, and I think anyone that is a good enough storyteller can make their life seem interesting. Hollywood is the master storyteller. Couple that with the fact that the story is about a mentally challenged black man living in the south, then you are well on your way to an excellent movie. Plus, Ed Harris is an excellent actor, and this was the best role Gooding Jr. took after the movie ""Jerry Maguire"".<br/><br/>I may not be the best judge in the case of this movie considering my admitted bias towards biopics. But, if you are even the least bit interested in how a mentally challenged young man can be an inspiration to a coach and a team, then do yourself a favor and see ""Radio""."
"MartianOctocretr5","7","1","1","31 July 2006"," Plenty of heart in this touching story
","Radio is an unusual story, based on the factual friendship of a small-town high school coach, and a young developmentally disabled man.<br/><br/>I find it a touching film; a tribute to the versatile acting talent of Cuba Gooding, Jr. A harmless, friendless, and misunderstood young man nicknamed ""Radio"" who wanders around with an ever-present transistor radio, (hence his nickname) is ridiculed as a ""retard"" by the locals. Gooding puts his heart and soul into this role, making Radio a likable, endearing guy you would want to have as a friend. Ed Harris as the coach, does just that, befriending the young man, and taking him under his wing. The two actors portray this simple yet touching friendship that makes them both grow as people with gentle sincerity.<br/><br/>Occasionally, the film is hard to watch, what with cruel pranks played on the poor ingenuous Radio. It's a bitter pill to swallow, to see that vile and detestable element still permeates our society. Yet through all of this cruelty, and the excruciating loss of a loved one (a tearful, heart wrenching scene), Radio stands and becomes an inspiration to others.<br/><br/>The film has minor weaknesses: subplots involving the coach's family problems, such as his daughter being jealous of Radio add little to the story, and seem thrown in just for padding. They are not developed well, either.<br/><br/>Overall, a good, heartfelt and touching story worth seeing."

Radio soon earns the respect of the football players and becomes the darling of Anderson High as Hall Monitor.<br/><br/>""Radio"" is not *only* a beautiful story, but a wonderful example of the good that can happen when we care enough to invest our life in the life of another.

But in all honesty, what really pulls the movie forward is obviously Cuba Gooding Jr. who works hard to give an excellent performance. His acting is so good, that you may just forget that Gooding Jr. doesn't really have a mental disability like this. It's phenomenal.

"Brockduffield","10","0","0","14 November 2012"," Acting Has A New Standard
","So here's the deal: Radio is a great movie. The true story of Radio illustrates how a mentally handicapped man transforms from being an outcast to the inspiration of the cities football team. Now most people won't take my word for it since the only thing you know about me is my internet name on IMDb. Now Shakespeare might disagree, but I understand, I wouldn't trust anyone on just their name, because ""what's in a name?"" So give me a chance and I will prove to you why Radio is a great movie.<br/><br/>There are several aspects of the movie that obviously stand out to any audience and one of those is acting. Some people might not know that Cuba Gooding Jr. does not have autism, without outside knowledge it would be impossible to tell. In fact he is a perfectly normal, playing other roles in movies like Pearl Harbor and Red Tails. It is important that this be made clear to truly grasp the acting abilities of Cuba Gooding Jr. Mainly due to his incredible acting, Radio's true story was perfectly conveyed. Ed Harris, who played Coach Jones, also gave a spectacular performance, adapting to Radio's changing character. Throughout the progression of the movie, both of these characters relate and portray a building relationship, making it an extremely realistic cinema. <br/><br/>One of the next features that make this movie great is the directing skills Michael Tolin brought to the table. Now you probably haven't heard of him mostly because this movie was one his only big hits. But let's overlook that for now and focus on what it takes to make a great director. I believe in the case of a true story, a great director's job is to be like a chef. He is to combine an adequate mixture of true events and sprinkle in parts that are simply for the audience's entertainment. Since the story has already happened the director cannot change that part of the recipe, leaving the entertainment for him to create. Now this is not necessarily an easy job, take the simple, super-short plot of Radio as an example: The story of how a mentally retarded man journey's from complete isolation to being the main focus of an entire town. My goal for this statement is not to offend anyone but to simply establish that without the 'splash of entertainment' this plot would not make for a good movie. Therefore, I say all of this to ascertain that Michael Tolin came through, pulling a delicious pastry from the oven. He created a blend of touching emotions and 'manly' football, great for all types of audiences. <br/><br/>Now some might say that this movie is predictable or not even realistic. Well unless you have a glass ball and consider yourself a psychic then there is no way to predict the movie. I will agree that at a first glance Radio may seem clich√É¬©, and I can see how you would think that since it is based on football (and most football movies are almost all the same). But Radio is different, it includes a great story and plot that takes place off the football field and therefore as a whole the movie is extremely original. To the people that might claim that Radio is not realistic, the last scene of the movie explained clearly it was a true story. So I don't know how much more realistic a movie can be than a true story. <br/><br/>I give this movie ten stars and I hope that you agree with my thoughts that Radio is in fact a great movie, and who knows, maybe Shakespeare was wrong all along."

Although Radio couldn't do some of the things a ""normal"" person could, the things that he could do, he did well and with precision (notice him arranging the basketballs with all the logos on top). Great job, Cuba! You could see his personality change from what it was in the beginning to a more confident person with a purpose in the end.

I honestly think that people like Radio probably know more about how to express true love than me or any of the people who for whatever reason have made such critical comments about this movie. If you are looking to sit there leaving all your problems behind, don't watch this movie because it isn't about that. It's one of those rare movies that have something to teach the viewer.<br/><br/>Here's a thought... get out there and explore the world or else you critics are the true retards.<br/><br/>This is a great movie and it has a wonderful song during the ending credits by India Aire that you should listen to if you haven't already.<br/><br/>Well, my rant is done now.<br/><br/>If you've read this far, then just check out the movie. I don't think you will regret it."

","This movie is very up lifting. I had tears when i saw this movie. I loved the cast, Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. were spectacular together. Radio shows how a person who has a special need -Cuba- can be shy one minute and can be brought out of his shell the next. When Coach Joe -Harris- befriends Radio and shows him how to enjoy life he has brought a different side out of what we think can never do with a special need kid. We take for granted what ""Special"" people really can do. I was disappointed when Cuba didn't win a Oscar he was the BEST! This movie couldn't possibly have picked a better person to play Radio. Cuba Gooding Jr. gets a 9/10 in my book!"

I would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially anyone with children, since it deals with the treatment of Radio by the other students. And make sure to watch the extras. It is nice to see the real James Robert ""Radio"" Kennedy. It is also touching to see he is still a junior and so involved with the school after all these years.

"rosscinema","5","0","0","2 February 2005"," Feel good film is straight from the hip
","This is one of those films that can act as a test for viewers who want their cynicism rated because while it would be easy to dismiss this as sappy it's still a film that for the most part avoids contrivances. Story is set in Anderson, S.C. in the 1970's where we see James Kennedy (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is mentally disabled and spends his days pushing a cart around and collecting junk. Harold Jones (Ed Harris) is the local high school football coach and he meets the young man after some of his players lock him in a shed and scare him badly. Coach Jones helps him and gains his trust but after asking his name all he can get out of him is ""Radio"" which becomes his nickname.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** Radio acts as the team cheerleader and as an assistant and he slowly starts to open up as Coach Jones attempts to teach him things in his classroom. Radio's mother (S. Epatha Merkerson) isn't sure why Coach Jones is so friendly to her son and not everyone in town agrees with it either but as Radio accompanies the high school team to games he becomes a permanent fixture on the sidelines which people start to appreciate.<br/><br/>This is directed by Michael Tollin who has directed only one other film before and here he does an admirable job of making sure that viewers don't witness another story in which someone of special attention beats racism in a small town. The script really just shows how Radio opened up as a person when those around him started to treat him fairly although there is that part of the story where the important town banker (and father of the star player) attempts to change things. If anything, the film lacks any real drama which can be looked at as both a flaw and as something refreshing but I think the film is just trying to stay faithful to it's source. The casting helps to iron out the sentimental elements and with those crooked choppers Gooding smartly makes sure that his performance doesn't stray over the top. Harris is his usual pillar of strength although his real intentions are never clear despite his little speech about being a kid with a paper route. This film can be looked at as both a hit and a miss but I do think that there are enough good things happening with it to warrant a viewing so that others can find out where they stand in terms of their own cynicism."

","This movie is about a guy who's nickname is ""Radio"" that is mentally retarded. Radio struggles with life but ends up being popular,and always remembered. Radio is played by Cuba Gooding Jr.. and no other actor could play him better. One day Radio sees a football fly over the fence and gets it. But after the football players receive it they do something very mean to him. The coach works with him and makes Radio a well known normal citizen. Some parts were sad but it was all good. It has a good ending,in fact a happy ending. The thing about this movie is it is based on a true story with true characters. He gets his nickname from his love of the radio-I feel the same way ( laughs . He is also a dedicated football player and basket ball player. Henry Robert Kennedy is a reals man/person and is one of the greatest football coaches of all time. He goes down in history.

","Radio has some very good actors giving good performances. Its flaw is its story.<br/><br/>Once the movie introduces us to its main characters, it never really settles on the bad guys to provide us with conflict. Oh, for a brief while one of the football players is mean to Radio, but he learns better. And a big booster doesn't like Radio being around the school's teams, but he never really tries very hard to do much to Radio. The coach's daughter feels abandoned by her dad (who takes such a strong interest in radio). But she never really protests much. Even the school board representative pretty much makes a reasonable case for his interest. And none of the football or basketball games seem to lead to anything. There is no build up or sense of greater purpose.<br/><br/>After a while, you start to wonder where the movie is headed, because there is not really much conflict happening. And when it does end, you are left saying, 'Huh What?' [MINOR SPOILERS] When something happens to Radio's mom, who takes care of Radio? He apparently doesn't come home with the coach. Is it Radio's brother? Why don't we see him? And when the coach makes his surprise announcement, does this lead to adopting Radio? If not, what was the point of the announcement? <br/><br/>There is one strong moment, when the coach tells his daughter about an incident from his childhood that helps explain why he is so interested in Radio. Other than that, this movie is so calm as to be comatose. The acting raised my rating to a 6."

","No matter which side you argue, there's no denying this is based on real-life events --greatly telescoping them, as it turns out-- and the point it makes is valid:  ""You're never wrong to care for somebody.""<br/><br/>Anymore, its rare for a film to have anything in the way of subtlety.  The only filmmaker I can think of who consistently shows adult restraint in this way is M. Night Shyamalan.  ""Radio"" nearly flunked my '20 minute rule,' flirting with disaster as it trodded on.  Maybe it was the credible athletics, or I broke my rule, but I gave it a chance and am glad.<br/><br/>Though this movie is quite guilty of being sentimental, that in itself doesn't make it a waste of time; this reviewer is an unsentimental man swimming in a cultural sea of sentimentality.<br/><br/>There are no attention-getting devices in this movie, unless you think Gooding's portrayal of a retarded man is pandering --an open question in my case.  No, this is a grown-up movie, which should have as a warning: ""This film may be exposed to viewers which the material might find objectionable."" Get ready to not be manipulated when you watch this movie.<br/><br/>Never forget that all mainstream entertainment is done by a team with a variety of motivations.  It would be a mistake to think the main reason team members sign on is money, fame, or professional recognition.  No, real talent signs on in hopes of influencing viewers --think about that the next time you slog through a truly demeaning movie; people sweated many days just to give it that demeaning quality because they have it in for you.  In this case, a film that at first seems trite and of no consequence deserves a second look because of the cast, crew and the quality of their output.  I mean, just look at the gametime scenes!<br/><br/>So there's more than meets the eye in this storytelling.  The question becomes ""does it succeed in truly convincing viewers of the obvious?"" That would depend on the viewer.  What does it take to get a point across to you?<br/><br/>As for entertainment, the gentle pace and lack of sensational events will of course be an issue for most people.  This was a good, not great movie, but not at all deserving of the snide tone of some people's posts.  I give it *** of ****.<br/><br/>Tiny gripes:  The one-dimensional anti-Radio character, underdevelopment and 'resolution' of the coach's domestic stresses --surely a lot from real-life was left unsaid."

Ed Harris was good in his role, but Cuba Gooding surprisingly wasnt. I was having a hard time understanding why the Coach was so compassionate towards Radio. Kind of got tired of the ""Radio gets in trouble, Coach gets him out of trouble"" theme after awhile. Might have even been more interesting to do this as a documentary, with the real Radio.

","I always complain that Hollywood doesn't make any family films, and as those go, this is a fine movie!  Yes, it's sentimental...but you can't dispute that there is a real life person nick named Radio and he appears to be a well loved member of his community, as does Coach Jones (Ed Harris's character).  I thought that Cuba Gooding did a good job, and that it's unfortunate for him that this has already been done (slightly better) by Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. ( Audiences and critics aren't very forgiving of something they don't think is original.  This is different from FG is several ways, of course...it's a true story, whereas FG is rather fanciful and is based on a fictional novel. )  <br/><br/>Anyway, this is a movie you can watch with your family and  everyone will enjoy it.

","This is a good movie--that is, a good story well told. Cuba Gooding's performance is outstanding.  Ed Harris as coach Jones and Alfre Woodard as the principle are excellent as well.  The story is a heart warmer, but avoids descending into Hallmark TV Special style sentimentality.<br/><br/>It is about the importance of community, of being connected to the human community in a significant way.  The ""message"" is that the best possibilities of life are realized only in community with other people, even for those whose possibilities in life are rather limited. Aristotle, the Greek Philosopher made this same point over 2000 years ago in his ""Politics.""  The community or ""polis"" is more important than the individual, since individuals only find the good life within it. No one can live well in isolation, he said.  Everyone, in fact, benefits from everyone's contribution to the good of the whole.  This movie illustrates that point.<br/><br/>It uses various metaphors quite well: The fence itself is a metaphor for Radio's relationship with the community. ""Radio,"" a young man with severe mental handicaps,  is outside the fence, literally, and emotionally/socially.  He pushes a shopping cart past the high school football field every day, outside the chain link fence.  He has no friends, no social life at all.  The viewer sees him at first through the chain link fence, as someone ""outside,"" someone who is not part of the community. He is invited inside the fence by Coach Jones and after some time for the team to accept him, he becomes part of the community of the football team. He is not shown outside of fences after this.<br/><br/>There is sports as a metaphor for life, which is common enough in movies. Radio is not part of the football community until Coach Jones invites him in.  In the same way he is not part of the life of the larger community of the town itself.  As the football team at first rejects him but learns to accept him after Coach Jones stands up for him, so also the community at large rejects Radio until Coach Jones stands up for him at the town barbershop.<br/><br/>Radio's collection of radios functions as a metaphor also. Early on, he always has a radio to his ear, listening. It represents his connection to the outside world and his isolation from it. He can hear people talk or sing on the radio, but not interact with them, in the same way that he can see and hear the community where he lives, but is not a part of it. Increasingly, as he becomes part of a real community, he no longer needs the artificial connection of the radio.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a worthwhile movie, not an epic, nor even a great movie, but a good one, and a good illustration of Aristotle's point about the good life only being possible in the polis or community."

The James Horner score was also pretty good but it sounded like a lot of the other scores that he'd composed.  A lot of the minor actors and parts, though, weren't as good as they should've been.  Radio's mom, played my S. Epatha Markeson, seemed to baby Radio a bit too much, but then again I don't know much about the actual story.  The actress who played Coach's daughter also seemed to be a little forced in her role too.  Plus, look out for the scene with Radio, his mom, and Coach where Radio asks them both to dance.

","Ed Harris stars as high school football coach Harold Jones, who takes in a mentally retarded African-American man, who probably missed out on school back when the south was segregated, even though it wouldn't have made a difference in his case. His daughter is played by Sarah Drew, and until now there were two kinds of people who knew who she is: Recent theater buffs and Daria fans who know her as the voice of Stacy Rowe. Like a certain IMDB user from North Carolina, I saw it strictly for that reason. The movie is unfortunately predictable, but not necessarily intolerable. Cuba Gooding Jr. doesn't overplay James Robert ""Radio"" Kennedy the way you'd expect an actor to do in such a role. His gullibility in the face of high school pranks is easily expected, and just as painful to watch. There's no mention of how his father died, so unless you actually read the Sports Illustrated article this movie is based on(which I didn't), you can only guess that since it takes place in South Carolina, he might've been lynched by the Ku Klux Klan. Harris' speech to Drew on why he's the kind of person who helps the unfortunate is also mumbled. I'm going to have to use the closed captioning device when I rent it on DVD. I also wonder if Debra Winger(Coach Jones' wife) coached Cuba Gooding Jr. in playing retarded people since she did so in 1993's ""A Dangerous Woman,"" even though I have nothing to base this assumption on. Still, it's no ""Forrest Gump,"" but at least it's not as appalling as having to sit through Juliette Lewis in ""The Other Sister."""

"ilovedolby","Null","0","0","12 November 2003"," Gooding and Harris manage to pull off noteworthy performances.
","The new film `Radio,' although saturated with sentimentality and clich√©s, is a heartwarming winner of a movie! I fell in love with it for so many reasons. One, I actually liked its conventionality, perhaps because I was seeking something light, yet mildly meaningful. Two, the film had a beautiful score by composer James Horner. Lastly, great performances from Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris. 	`Radio' was inspired by the true story of James Kennedy, a mentally challenged, African-American man from Hannah, South Carolina. In the film, James (Gooding) pushes a cart with a radio and a few other possessions around the town. When he passes the high-school football field, he is noticed by Coach Jones (Harris). Jones is curious about the young man as he constantly stares at the football players as if he wanted to be one.<br/><br/>One day, Jones offers James the opportunity of helping out the team with various activities. Also, Jones notices that James' one true passion seems to be for a radio in Jones' office. Jones lets James take it and the young man soon becomes known as ¬ëRadio.' Although unappreciated at first for causing a few fumbles at games and yelling out plays, he becomes an inspiration for many in the community. He teaches them to see the person inside, rather than the flaws on the outside. There are so many standard ideas in `Radio' that it would not be surprising if many elitist critics completely shun it. To them, I say get off your high horse! You have to loose yourself with a film like this and appreciate it for what it is. Harris plays Jones in a traditional format-he's the coach who has forgotten he has got a family. The film takes place in a small town where the ¬ëlocal yokels' meet at a barbershop to discuss the win or loss. What is more? Everyone eats Burger King¬Öall the time it would seem. My point is that simplicity can be the best course of action for a movie.  It was not necessary to go over the top with `Radio' and try to cover new ground. It is lovable for what it is. The score composed by Horner is wonderful. Along with the resonant voice of India Arie, the music adds an emotional kick to the film that few other film composers can grasp like Horner. Point in fact, if a director wants to drive his audience to tears with music that pulls at their heartstrings, then hire Horner. His work on such films as `Glory,' `Apollo 13,' and `Titanic' are equally engaging. Gooding and Harris manage to pull off noteworthy performances. Gooding provides a whimsical, yet heartfelt projection of the real Radio. Harris's performance is an expectation that you can always count on as excellent. We admire his portrayal of Jones and his love for Radio. Radio and Jones become the equivalent of a father/son dynamic. As such, you find yourself loving both of these characters for their willingness to help each other learn something greater about themselves. The most important aspect to take away from `Radio' is that showing a little bit of love and attention goes a long way. Jones says at one point, `Radio treats us all the time, the way we wish we treated each other half of the time.' I admire that notion. I admire because it is a part of the fabric of every human to offer care and respect, although it does not always happen. Either way, the simplicity of that notion, as well as the genius of it can not be denied. ***"

"KyleTheGent","Null","0","0","2 November 2003"," Radio comes in loud & clear
","Radio, inspired by a true story, delivers a powerful message and is undoubtedly correct. The problem of the matter is it continues to lecture the message throughout the entire movie.  It becomes more tedious and tiresome faster than an overplayed new hit song, you guessed, on the radio. It's sounds so good the first few times, but after that you lunge to turn the station.<br/><br/>The story begins in South Carolina in the mid 1960's. A severely handicapped man (Cuba Gooding Jr.) spends his time routinely pushing a shopping cart around town, innocent as could be, listening to a radio. Also, he especially likes to watch the high school football team practice, the T.L. Hanna Yellow Jackets.  Football is life to Coach Jones (Ed Harris), as he prepares his boys for the upcoming season.  His passion for the game is so eminent that he practically has no time for his wife (Debra Winger) and daughter (Sarah Drew). His days are spent at the practice field and nights reviewing film or developing strategies.  The coach gradually notices this man watching their practices, and is intrigued to say the least, but has no rhyme or reason to become acquainted with him.<br/><br/>Ironically, that is until 9 of the high school boys play a dastardly cruel joke on this handicapped man.  The so-called leader, Johnny (Riley Smith) must seem to think he is superior in every way to this man as he relentlessly plays gags and pranks on him throughout the movie.  Coach Jones hands out proper punishment to his team, and begins to form a friendship with this man, who barely speaks.  He dubs him `Radio' and later we learn his name to be James Robert Kennedy.  We know that he is handicapped, but are not told exactly what.  His mother (S. Epatha Merkerson) tells us that `he is the same as everybody else, just a little slower than most.'<br/><br/>Radio becomes the football handy man, doing whatever he can to help.  This is unacceptable to a few which is a paradigm to time and place.  Johnny's father (Chris Mulkey) is outraged by Radio and starts to cause controversy. He believes that Radio is a sideshow mascot and is distracting Coach Jones. Meanwhile, as the bond between Coach Jones and Radio increases, the more little instances start to arise and cause trouble.  Radio would unintentionally shout out the plays the Yellow Jackets were running during a game, or be victimized into going in the girl's locker room.  The principal (Alfre Woodard) and Coach Jones have frequent visits with the School Board, who are trying to consider what is best for the student body.  We learn that Coach Jones is going to fight to the end for Radio, and as the ending is genuinely uplifting, at the same token it is easily foreseen.  The only real curiosity of the movie is why Coach Jones wants to help Radio so much.<br/><br/>
No doubt I have a tremendous amount of guilt amongst myself because this is a remarkably heartwarming story.  Heartwarming stories simply don't translate into great movies (see Windtalkers, 2002).  Don't get me wrong, it has its moments and can be an emotional rollercoaster.  We are saddened to see what is done to this man and we are overjoyed when he recites the daily lunch menu over the intercom, or to see the satisfaction on his face from simply eating a whopper.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris make the movie more enjoyable than it should be. They are both extremely likeable, but nothing too severe ever threatens their friendship.  They always, and too easily, escape anything that befalls on them. The movie doesn't flow well, and is twenty minutes longer than it needs to be.  As an audience, we are never given a reason to believe that things will not be alright for Radio.  As aforementioned, the message is reinforced continuously and it permits us from enjoying the movie like we should.  Maybe I'm na√Øve though, because I would like to think that society knows to treat each individual equally. That relentlessness keeps `Radio' from being in the upper echelon it should be. It is a nice family movie to watch, and should attract viewers on all air waves.  I did find it very appealing that Radio isn't exactly the person that needed help and guidance. Help can be found in odd places, it seems.<br/><br/>I appreciate the fact that this movie was made, because it is based on actual events, and means well.  James Robert Kennedy is still at T.L Hannah High School today, doing exactly what he did thirty years ago. Radio is pleasant and does no harm, but it relinquishes midway through the movie, and the broadcast seems to repeat over and over again."

Well, When I saw they were finally making, I knew that there would be a ""long lunch"" being taken at work.<br/><br/>Reading some of the initial critics reviews concerned me but when I saw the disparity in opinion between the masses and the ""experts"" I knew that was one of those movies where the ""head"" and ""heart"" don't always agree.<br/><br/>Having said that I found myself enjoying the movie very much. Despite the trailers, this is NOT really a sports movie but it uses sports as the catalyst for a story of how two men find come to know, learn, and draw inspiration from each other. Unlike ""traditional"" sports flicks, there is no ""BIG GAME"", the ""hero"" does not become the ""star"" player, and the ""football"" part of the story is wrapped up early in the movie. In fact the ""breakthrough"" between Radio and his ""antagonist"" occurs not in the football stadium but during the basketball season. Instead of the Big Game Climax, the Ed Harris character actually gives up football coaching at the end of the movie when he realizes, through Radio, his family needs him more (Though I guess he did get back to coaching as the end of the film shows footage of him being inducted into the South Carolina Coaching Hall of Fame).<br/><br/>Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding do a terrific job in portraying their chracters with grace an dignity. Somewhat overlooked is Debra Winger in her role. She is the ""backbone"" of the family and in a way she represents the town. Those of you who enjoy the TV series ""Without a Trace"" may notice that S. Epatha Merkeson plays Radio's mom.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the fact that the town was not portrayed as a stereoptypical Southern hamlet full of bubbas and bubbettes but as a place where everyone accepts people for what they are. I have read some comments that the racism angle is over-looked. I disagree, I think the issue is addressed subtly and shows how people do change their perceptions, though not a by a cataclysmic event but by simply seeing someone do the right thing and following suit. The South is really no different than most places anywhere in the USA. Racism is not something confined to the South.  Neither is brotherhood and love of fellow man.<br/><br/>Anyway, in wrapping up, this is a great movie for the family and one to show your children how we should all treat each other."

","(Synopsis Spoiler!) Radio is a good human-interest story that was inspired by events in 1976 in Anderson, South Carolina.  Cuba Gooding, Jr., who plays the mentally challenged Radio, does such a good acting job, you will believe he is the real Radio.  His real name is James Robert Kennedy, and he was nicknamed Radio, because of his radio collection and listening to the radio all the time. Radio spends his days in this small town pushing or riding a grocery cart down the street, talking to no one. After some football players harass Radio, the football coach Harold Jones played by Ed Harris takes Radio under his wing.  Radio begins to help out at football practice and sits on the bench at games.  In time, Radio begins to trust the coach. However, some people in town think Radio is a distraction to the team, and they want Radio to go.  By this time the coach and the team are all friends to Radio and they want him to stay.

","As one who frequently goes to the movies, I have to say that this has been one of the most impressive movies I have seen this year.  Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr.  gave outstanding performances allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters.  It is nice to occasionally see a movie that does not depend entirely upon special effects but allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche on many levels.  I wish Hollywood would produce more movies of this calibre."

","This is a very moving movie about life itself. The challenges a handicapped person must face in a land that expects perfection is brought to the forefront for all to see and hopefully understand. It should teach the bigots of society that we are all humans, and while some of us are gifted with a mind, heart and sound body, there are decent human beings that exist in the world that are not as lucky, or maybe, we're the unlucky ones. We don't always see the beauty in the world because we're wrapped up in our 'blind' ambitions, and see it only in one light ""what can this world do for me!!!"". Maybe we all wish we were like Radio, a loving happy individual...who loves everyone."

","This movie is typically what everyone stereotypical Hollywood movie is. In other words, no matter how much money the producers spent on finding a good cast, director, cinematographer, etc...,they forgot about the most important part: a good script. The dialogue was simply stilted. Nothing felt real about the movie at all. In fact, if the words ""based on a true story"" had never appeared on screen, I would never have guessed that it really happened. The real Radio deserves a much better film. I can predict that many people will come out of this movie feeling ""uplifted"" or ""enlightened"", but they aren't aware that they were actually tricked into feeling this way. This movie (among many others) makes me ashamed of being a movie buff. Shame on Revolution Studios for distributing this film! But then again, they also distributed Gigli. Regardless of what I say, this film will be successful because people are too easily manipulated ( by marketing, especially ).

The setting was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years old. We have a white high school football coach and teacher, Ed Harris. Then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow, Cuba Gooding, whose greatest possessions, including a radio, are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle.<br/><br/>Ed Harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film.

"MovieManMenzel","8","0","0","27 October 2003"," A Well Made Drama filled with Strong Performances and a Touching Story
","Inspired by True events, Radio is one of the best acted, heart felt dramas I seen widely released in sometime. It definitely is one of the year's best films of 2003. <br/><br/>Radio stars Ed Harris, who is Oscar worthy nonetheless in this film, as football coach Harold Jones. Coach Jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game. However Coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day Radio, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance since Men of Honor, comes by the football field while the coach's team is practicing for the game. Some members of the team, then tie up radio and throw him into a building. They then bang on the building and finally Coach Jones suspects something is wrong. He comes over and helps Radio, who is frightened, and from that point on Coach Jones and Radio shares a very special bond. Radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events. He also becomes Coach Jones's main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and Radio.<br/><br/>The movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life, accepting people for who they are even if they are different, death, and family relationships. The movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film. The thing I liked most about Radio was how real it felt. The performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes. Radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. Some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad. <br/><br/>
In conclusion, I feel that Radio was very overlooked by Critics only getting average reviews. They must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it doesn't make any sense to me. Also the performances as I mentioned before are top-notch and Oscar worthy.  In my opinion, both Ed Harris, who I think is underrated as an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr. should both get some kind on nomination for this movie. Radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big Hollywood movies. My final rating for Radio is a 9/10."

After seeing the real ""Radio"" or James Robert Kennedy (Cuba's character) at the end of this film, you realize how Cuba captured his body language & charm.  Ed Harris I believe did the best he could trying to be the tough Athletic Director as well as Head Coach of the Hannah High School football program and at the same time be a softy.  That felt far-fetched to me.  But Harris pulled it off great.  There were parts that I felt could of been left out.....such as a story that Harris told his daughter that I felt was oddly placed and really effected the rhythm of the movie.  That scene at the same time was crucial to revealing why Harris may of felt that helping Radio ""was the right thing to do"".<br/><br/>In all, ""Radio"" was an enjoyable movie.  I came out feeling I got my money's worth, which means a lot now a days w/ how much movies prices have gotten. For those of you that compared this to ""The Waterboy"" + ""Forrest Gump"" + ""Rain Man"" as I did at first, it was greatly disproven.  No ""Waterboy"" aspects.  ""Rain Man"".........nope.

Cuba Gooding, Jr. should win the 2004 Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of James ""Radio"" Robert Kennedy.  It has been a long time since I could say that an actor did not get in the way of his character; that is when I was watching the movie I did not see the actor but rather the character.  Through outstanding acting skills, as well as the aid of several prothestics, you simply see Radio on the screen.

","Radio is done in the style of other ""feel good"" sports films such as Rocky, Rudy, Cool Runnings and Seabiscuit. All use a specific formula we see very often, but than why do we love them so?<br/><br/>Well lets start off giving the brief summary of the film. Radio, well played by Cuba Gooding Jr. is our hero this time. He is mentally handicapped and each day passes the school in which Coach Jones(Ed Harris) teaches. He stops to watch the team practice and after a few events, Jones takes a liking to him as does the team and soon, the whole town. <br/><br/>Sound like a lot of other movies? It is. Im not one for films following a formula but Disney does it so often and dont we love their movies? Indeed we do. Because despite being formulaic, Radio still has a lot of heart to it. Maybe im a sucker for such sentiment. However, the film is paced well and performances by Cuba, Ed Harris and Debra Winger are top notch. And its always good to see Mrs. Winger making a movie every now and again.<br/><br/>
Each character is likeable and we get some genuine feelings for them. Im not one for the usual hollywood sap fest but this is one that is admittedly well done. As said before, done in the form of Rocky and Seabiscuit how can you go wrong. Perhaps I should be being harder on it for following such a formula or perhaps because of its good acting and writing, it was able to rise above being just another film of that formula(and believe me, there have been films following that same formula that calling awful would be a compliment). Either way, Radio is well done and hopefully Cuba wont go un-noticed come Oscar time."

Not many.  We did get a little glimpse into the coach's motivation (a very provocative dialog in my opinion, not to be soon forgotten) so in my opinion, this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his ""comfort zone"" to reach out to another human being, and in the mean time, touched the lives hundreds more.  A lesson we all need to me reminded of. Why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do?  I recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart.

","I just wanted to let everyone know that this is a GREAT movie.  Do not pay attention to those that have only seen the trailer and think they know the entire story.  Last night (10/11/03) I took my family and we went to the `sneak preview' outside of Atlanta.  I have seen many movies in my life but only a very few that had standing and clapping at the end of the movie. Radio had both!  People in the audience were clapping near the end at a couple touching scenes and then the entire audience stood and clapped at the very end.  It was absolutely amazing.  Something you rarely see happen at most movies these days.  Oh, I know those out there that are not into heart warming and touching movies will not like it and probably have some things in the movie they'll attempt to pick on.  If you are into those special effects, computer generated, explosive scenes and non-stop action then Radio is not for you.  Radio is a story that is told brilliantly!  It is a story to be absorbed and enjoyed with both the heart and mind.  It is one that will stick with you for a long time after leaving the theater unlike the action-packed thrillers and ordinary comedies that seem to dominate the movies these days.  It is truly about time that someone made a movie of this caliber.  Some will attempt to compare it to other films but in reality it stands alone by itself in all areas.  It is a must see!<br/><br/>The only `bad' thing I can say about the movie is that I believe it should have been longer, if you call that `bad.'  They should have taken more time and revealed to the viewer more about the character Radio and his relationship with others by having more scenes with him interacting with people.  Of course they had a few scenes like that but the true understanding of how the majority was feeling about Radio was conveyed to the audience in talk by the Coach and others instead of more action.  More scenes would have made the movie longer but I believe it would have helped in making the audience actually understand the feelings of students and others toward Radio through site and actions instead of talk.  The only `bad' thing is that I wanted more!<br/><br/>I have met the real life Radio and Coach Jones.  Some critics will find it hard to believe that there is actually a real life person like the Radio that is portrayed by Cuba Gooding, Jr.  I am here to tell you that there IS one and he is as sweet and magical as the character in the movie.  To the credit of the real life Coach Jones everybody likes Radio and looks for him at every game.  The movie may not be exactly true to the life of each character but remember it is `based on a true story.'<br/><br/>You will NOT be wasting your time or money by going to see this feature. If you have feelings and are willing to take an hour and 40 minutes to watch and absorb, you will be glad you saw this movie.  Caution to those that are truly tender hearted.take some tissues."

As everyone in Hollywood knows, the quickest way to get acclaim as an actor is to play a retarded guy. Unless, of course, you're Cuba Gooding Jr., whose best role ever was in Jerry Maguire, and hasn't done anything even remotely commendable since (except maybe ""Snow Dogs"" or ""Boat Trip"" - God, does this guy even READ the scripts before he agrees to a movie?).<br/><br/>Ed Harris plays Coach Jones, a football coach who really wants his team to win but has a soft spot for retarded people because he knew one who was caged under a porch when he delivered papers as a boy (I'm not making that up, that's really the explanation).<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Radio, a retarded guy who really likes, get this, radios.

Based on a true story, 'Radio'is about a mentally challenged young man( played by Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr)who is befriended by a high school coach and made the manager/mascot of the football team.In time he becomes an inspiration to everyone around him, including the Coach, played be the normally solid Ed Harris, who spends the entire movie making soulful goo-goo eyes at Radio to the point of being ridiculous. To make matters worse, Debra Winger makes her return to the big screen here as the coaches wife and any more performances like this will make her return short- lived. Gooding hams it up way too much and makes me wonder how he ever won an Oscar(for Jerry Maguire)in the first place. Sorry, but 'Radio'is a loser."

At the same time, Cuba Gooding is not suited for this role, he is an expansive actor and does not pull this off.  Ed Harris does a great job in these roles.

","In Tropic Thunder, Robert Downey tells Ben Stiller that he went full retard for a film role and you must never go full retard.<br/><br/>Maybe advice Cuba Gooding Jr should have heeded as he plays a young mentally challenged black man in a South Carolina small town in the mid 1970s, who spends his days pushing a shopping trolley, being fascinated by radios and comes on the radar of High School Sports Coach Jones who spends time with him and gets him to help out at the school and not be an outsider being ignored. He gets adopted as the school's mascot and gains acceptance after some initial resistance from a few of the students.<br/><br/>Radio is based on the true story of Robert 'Radio' Kennedy. Its a formulaic film but has winning performances from Ed Harris, Alfre Woodard and Debra Winger. Cuba's performance divided opinions, although he is an Oscar winning actor, he seemed to be too immersed in the role without giving any other light or shade. Gooding has been criticised for some of his broad comedy films in the past and maybe this was an attempt to address this criticism and re-establish his serious acting credentials.<br/><br/>The film is sentimental and maybe too saccharine and does lack depth as well but you cannot deny it is heartwarming."

","This great movie just shows what a magnificent actor cuba gooding jr is! after performances in pearl harbour, men of honour and boat trip, his role in this movie took great skill and was absolutely brilliant! the movie itself is a great true story of a young handicapped man who starts spending time at a nearby school with football coach and teacher, coach jones (ed harris), but causes a stir among some parents and the school board! the main aim of coach jones is to simply allow radio (cuba gooding jr) to lead a normal school life! a great film with scenes that will make you cry with laughter and then with sadness! i recommend it to anyone!"

","""Radio"" is a true story that brings forth an assortment of emotions when watched. It involves a mentally challenged young man nicknamed Radio (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is taken under wing by a high school football coach, Coach Jones (Ed Harris). Radio opens the eyes of everyone is the small South Carolina town by going through road blocks in his life and always looking forward even though his future is uncertain. Radio starts attending football games with the team and feels accepted. Though once some of the hardcore fans of the town feel he is being a distraction, they have a meeting to have him banned from the field during the games and not let him go to away games anymore.<br/><br/>Director Michail Tollin did a fantastic job choosing who to play the characters in the movie. Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris both do great jobs playing their parts. The film does an effective job conveying the amazing personalities of many of the town folk, as even Radio's mother, Maggie (S. Epatha Merkerson), asks Coach Jones why he's doing? She asked this because she was just so used to people not accepting Radio for whom he was. These scenes with Coach Jones and Radio's mother are some of the most heart warming scenes in the film. <br/><br/>I love the movie ""Radio"" because it shows how just because someone does not have the physical and mental capabilities of everyone else, they are not able to do the same things and have just as big of a heart. I like how, even though it seems to be a white community that Radio lives in, there are no racial slurs made toward him. Most movies we watch that seem to have the same kind of story line as this movie concentrate on racism. This movie makes us feel for Radio so much because as we are watching it, we know that all that is happening really took place in 1976. After watching this movie, I look at mentally handicapped people differently because I know that they are like the rest of us."

","I just saw this movie on TV so I'm happy I didn't have to spend anything to see it.<br/><br/>I felt there was something missing in the acting. It was melodramatic, lacking any emotional depth despite numerous attempts to turn it into a tear jerker. Everything just falls into place so easily for Radio that it feels unrealistic, like a fairy tale. It left me feeling like I hadn't connected with the characters in any way. Even though I wanted to say 'you go get 'em Radio,' it wasn't until the last clips with the real Radio?? at the end that I felt a connection with the presented character. Those few images and seconds at the end would have been wonderful if they stood alone, maybe made into a 5 minute in-between shows documentary without all the other stuff. The movie just didn't do justice to the actual 'real-life' story.<br/><br/>If you want a good movie on the topic of 'handicapped people,' with excellent acting and an intelligent, thought-provoking story check out the South Korean film 'Marathon.' http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448621/<br/><br/>If you're looking for a simple (though poorly executed) story with a simple message you should probably stick with this movie and/or reference your Disney collection. I prefer movies that actually have something original to offer, that contribute to a deeper understanding of the issues presented. I've heard the 'let's all treat each other equally' message a thousand times but it's rare to find a movie like 'Marathon' that forces you to examine the institutional, social (individual and familial), and even philosophical challenges associated with being handicapped in the modern world."

","The township of Anderson, South Carolina lives and breaths with their Hanna High School football team. Coach Harold Jones(Ed Harris)may just be the most respected man in town; his only fault is putting the pigskin players and team ahead of his wife(Debra Winger)and teenage daughter. Coach Jones finds compassion for a mentally challenged young man given the moniker ""Radio""(Cuba Gooding Jr.). Of course not everyone is pleased with the attention shown the young man given chores to help the team. The school principal(Alfre Woodard)has issues with the situation and comes under fire of the school board as well as the school's biggest booster, Frank Clay(Chris Mulkey), the local banker, frustrated with the idea that ""Radio"" is a distraction for the team and his star athlete son(Riley Smith). Being the butt of cruel minded pranks and the death of his beloved mother(S. Epatha Merkerson)does not deter the good nature of the trusting young man. Attitudes lead to the resignation of the coach and ""Radio"" finally wins over the hearts of the town. The finale shows the real life James ""Radio"" Kennedy still cheering on the team 26 years later.<br/><br/>Gooding is as excellent as Harris is passionate in this heart warming drama held together with some pretty darn good football scenes. Winger almost goes by unnoticed. And Merkerson of TV's LAW & ORDER fame is solid in her role. Not to be overlooked is the superior soundtrack that features the likes of Stevie Wonder, the Doobie Brothers, the Spinners and Al Green. This is touching family fare."

That guy's son plays a couple of mean tricks on Radio, but Radio is too stupid to realize how he's being treated, so he continues to treat the guy like his best bud. Of course, this eventually makes the mean kid like Radio and not want to get rid of him.  And the other turning point is the football coach finally quits in order to spend more time with his own family who he has often ignored.  <br/><br/>I guess Cuba took this role because he thought it may be another award nomination, but Ed Harris gives the better performance.

The film moves slowly, and is very predictable in it's ending. Some parts of the movie are actually a bit boring. However Cuba Gooding does a superb job as an actor-but when the script doesn't give you much to work with, it still can't save the movie. If you're looking for a heartwarming tale about a relationship-this isn't it. The Football scenes are rushed into the movie, (it seems they wanted to copy Remember the Titans, but failed)and the overall conflict in the movie? Well there is none.

","""Radio"" may be based on a truthful, inspiring story but that only goes so far. It just doesn't seem to me like this was the kind of story that ultimately lends itself to a movie; or if it does this was not the way to do it. It's the story of James Robert ""Radio"" Kennedy (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.), a mentally disable young man who is fascinated by radios and football and is taken under the wing of the local football team's coach (Ed Harris as Coach Jones).<br/><br/>What I really disliked about this movie was that the people here don't feel like people. Now I know that this film is based on true events and all, but it's like the details have been fudged left and right in order to make the film universally appealing. In trying to make it so soft and cuddly, it appeals to no one but the most undiscriminating audience that loves anything football-related. The titular character feels like a Hollywood stereotype of a mentally challenged man: he can do no wrong, is always sweet, is loved by everyone (well, except for the one dimensional villain) and has no personality whatsoever. When he is included in the behind-the-scenes of the school football team he feels more like a pet or a mascot than a real person and the film never really focuses on him, following Ed Harris' character Coach Jones instead of going about the more challenging task of showing us what this town really saw in James Robert Kennedy and giving him a real personality with flaws and all. There is also something off-putting about the fact that the people in the town very rarely call him by his actual name, instead calling him by his given nickname of ""Radio"" and that we never see any portrayal of the man's brother in the film, almost as if he refused to be included.<br/><br/>Overall it does pull at your heartstrings and will likely get some sensitive audiences emotionally involved but the plot is the same one you have seen before: the misunderstood misfit shows the rest of the world that it's important to be more caring and understanding. Oh, if we could just set aside our differences and see those poor outcasts for what they really are: beautiful people that just seem weird on the outside¬Ö. well then we could all learn a bit from them and become more beautiful and caring human beings ourselves. This recycled plot combined with the stock villain and the forced, emotionally manipulative story (manipulative to the point where some characters turn into cartoonish villains or saints whenever convenient) that there isn't much to recommend here except for some good performances.

Cuba could be dismissed as unable to do more with the character. I think he does a fine job. It's definitely not award winning but at least he's pushing his acting range.<br/><br/>The major problem for me is the concentration on the coach and Radio. It needs to have a POV from someone else. There are a couple of possibilities. Johnny Clay would be an interesting choice especially with his father Frank. He's set up for a redemption storyline. The side characters need more time. The story is too simplistic when there is easy drama underneath the story. A more fleshed out story for the teenagers would be much more compelling.

In the beginning of the movie you see ""Radio"" pushing his cart through out town marching to the beat of his on drum. Through out this time the movie jumps to the football practice that is taken place during the opening credits. The movie takes no time jumping into the hard and emotional scene of seeing Radio tied up in the equipment shed as the football team tortures him. There is no clear cut reason for the team torturing Radio but you do see an interaction between Radio and a player in the beginning of the movie that could hint to the reason why the players decided to torment him. Coach Jones realizes that his team is up to no good to only find Radio tied up in the shed. Coach Jones then takes Radio home to his mother where he finds out about Radio's past and that he is intellectually disabled. Coach Jones and Radio begin spending more time together, which eventually leads to Radio helping out with the football team and joining high school for the first time in his life. Radio receives his nickname from Coach Jones essentially for the simple fact that he is often seen listening to the radio, as well as collecting radios and fixing them.<br/><br/>Radio is accepted as a part of the football team and is loved by the town. This is a very warming experience since the town was not very accepting of Radio being a part of the football in the beginning. <br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. does an amazing job encompassing the role as Radio. His acting abilities were truly put to the test with this movie and he passed with flying colors. During the closing credits there is actual video of James Robert Kennedy (Radio) and the viewer could hardly tell the difference between the two. Ed Harris also does an amazing job of playing a compassionate yet hardnosed coach that is essential to completing this movie. <br/><br/>This movie is very moving and emotional.

The fact that this story is a true story makes it even more touching. But parts of the movie made me wonder what really happened. Like what made Johnny (Riley Smith) change his mind about Radio? What is really just that piece of scribbled paper and the cheap radio that made Johnny's hate for Radio turn into friendship? Or how about when Radio's mom dies? Where is Radio living?

","""Radio"" is billed as a fictional story based on real people, but I suspect it is predominantly a true story. In 1976 a mentally challenged young black man (Cuba Gooding Jr) is given the name ""Radio"" because he loved radios and always had one with him. His dad was dead and his mom worked most of the time to support the two of them, and ""Radio"" had been basically cast aside, hardly able to speak and with no education, was seen daily pushing his shopping cart through the streets of this small South Carolina town. After some of the high school athletes give 'Radio' trouble, the coach (Ed Harris) makes 'Radio' and offer, to join them at daily afternoon football practice, maybe he can in some way help out. We don't fully understand why the coach does this, as it is not presented as any kind of direct tie-in to the hazing, but it becomes clear later in the movie, during a conversation with his teen daughter who was feeling a bit neglected.<br/><br/>I liked this movie so much because it plays squarely on the human principle that none of us are islands, we are instead all connected as a community and what we do to one, bad or good, reflects on the whole. Regardless of the human topic, great things start with the efforts of one, and here it was the coach taking the time and patience to help this young man become something more than a daily wanderer through town. The short clip at the end of the movie, of the real 'Radio' who today is in his 50s, shows us that things have worked out well. Gooding Jr is no doubt superb as 'Radio', proving that he indeed is one of the better actors working today. But Ed Harris is mostly responsible for how well this story resonates, because he had to play the coach perfectly, and he did. Ed Harris just reinforces why he has been a premiere actor for so many years.<br/><br/>SPOILERS follow, quit reading, OK!?  As it turns out, he explained to his daughter, when coach was 12 and making deliveries, he encountered a young boy, perhaps handicapped, basically in an outside wire cage, treated more like an animal. He saw him many times, and as he matured realized that maybe he could have done something. When 'Radio' came along these many years later, he decided he wouldn't let that happen again. He knew we could and should do more to help the disadvantaged. He bought 'Radio' meals, let him participate in practices as a 'coach's assistant', eventually began letting him on the bench with the coach during games. Not all the parents, or the school board, were happy with this. After the football season we witness, the coach resigns his head coaching job, but remained as a teacher. The short clip at the end of the movie shows the real 'Radio', on the field with the team he still 'helps coach.'"

There's little going on in this sweetly sentimental film which juxtaposes campus life and football with family life and one man's life altering experience through a very rewarding though unlikely friendship. Oscar winner Gooding earned a Razzie nom for his portrayal while the critics pounded the film for it's sappy cornball approach to story telling and Gooding's exaggeration of his character. Nonetheless, the film earned respectable marks from the paying public who were touched by the heartwarming tale of a different kind of relationship. For sentimentalists only. (B)"

","Seriously, how annoying was this movie?  I generally like most of the actors involved, but I couldn't stand ANY of them.<br/><br/>You know what's nice when you see a movie?  When it has some kind of point.<br/><br/>
Don't waste your time on this garbage.  I don't mind a sappy ""feel good "" movie, but this was just boring.  Boring and stupid.<br/><br/>I should have been rooting for Radio instead of Johnny Clay.  Someone didn't do their job on this one.<br/><br/>Radio, you stole what seemed like 12 hours of my life, and I can't get them back.<br/><br/>Go get him Johnny Clay!"
"DJAkin","Null","0","1","14 March 2004"," Cuba Gooding plays a RETARDED man very well.
","Yes, he made super funny faces and said really bizarre things.  I did like the movie overall.  Ed Harris mentored RADIO because he was so nice.  I liked the part where RADIO accidentally gave away the play at one of the FOOTBALL GAMES.  I was SUPER afraid that Ed Harris was going to GET MAD at him.  However, Ed Harris did NOT get mad at him.  The actor from BLOOD SIMPLE was excellent in the role as the barbershop customer.  He was great when he yelled at FRANK toward the end of the movie.  Also, RADIO'S older brother was really good.  He didn't have much SCREEN TIME, but his presence was very known.  I like Cuba.  He can now join the ranks of SEAN PENN and Julie Louise Drefuss as acrettes who can play RETARDED FOLK."

","As far as sports movies go, Radio is right there between Rudy and Necessary Roughness. Radio should have gone straight to TNT (the cable channel, not the stuff used to blow up things, although that's not an entirely bad idea).<br/><br/>Ed Harris reprises his role of the tough minded family man that will eventually come to realize what's truly important in life, with the help of some sort of good hearted person, or a traumatic event, or in this case both, played by Radio. <br/><br/>Alfre Woodard does a credible job in her typical role as the voice of reason.<br/><br/>This movie also has a cop named Irv. Need I say more. Ok, I will. Irv.<br/><br/>There's the punk kid who gives Radio a hard time. Will he come around to learn the error of his ways? Does Radio end up touching his cold little heart? Will this film make salty tears stream down your cheek with the inspirational soul music playing in the background at all times?<br/><br/>To find out the answer to these and more questions, turn on the ""Radio"".<br/><br/>Lastly, and more than probably leastly, we have Cuba Gooding Jr.<br/><br/>
Cuba's portrayal of the mentally challenged Radio was eerily reminiscent of Cuba Gooding Jr. in Jerry Maguire, or Cuba Gooding Jr. in Snow Dogs, or Cuba Gooding Jr. in Rat Race, or Cub...well, you get the point.<br/><br/>
If you have a yearning to see Cuba Gooding Jr. jumping and dancing around like Chris Kattan on a sugar high, while enjoying a somewhat watchable, yet most definitely formulaic sports movie, then by all means tune in...<br/><br/>Radio."

","CubaCuba Gooding Jr. give there an excellent performance, he do his job well, and let's not forget Ad Harris that play his part in the movie very good!! I voted 10 to this movie, cause the plot is good (after all most real stories are the best plot you can have)."

","Only a creep could not like this movie.  It was fantastic!  It is definetely worth seeing and Cuba was awesome and so was Ed!  This movie should win an Oscar!  And this is based on a true story, and we get to see the real Radio in the end."

","The would-be inspirational true story of a mentally-challenged young man (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) in 1976 South Carolina who was given a chance by a kind high school football coach (Ed Harris) to help the team and become a fixture around the local high school. Naturally some prejudices will take place as some of the football-crazed townspeople look at Gooding as more of a distraction. Slowly though Harris shows that Gooding is the one who is really educating the community with his natural enthusiasm, good heart, fine morals and undeniable human spirit. Up and down the whole way, ""Radio"" tries to move its audience one way and then the other with predictable clich√©s and sometimes mean-spirited direction. Gooding, Jr. is pretty impressive here, but honestly he has done better work (remember ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Men of Honor""?). The same is true with Ed Harris who nails the kind coach who inspires greatness ala Tom Landry thing down, but really his part is more of a slickly-conceived caricature than a true three-dimensional character. Debra Winger is wasted as Harris' wife and youngster Sarah Drew's rocky relationship with Harris (her father) is only given a very minute glimpse. In the end you might want to change the channel when it comes to ""Radio"". 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","RADIO (2003) **1/2 Cuba Gooding, Jr., Ed Harris, Debra Winger, S. Epatha Merkerson, Chris Mulkey, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Drew, Riley Smith. Gooding Jr. FINALLY show his Oscar win wasn't a fluke after appearing in a string of under whelming films he acquits himself nicely in his true-life portrait of a mentally challenged young man circa 1976 South Carolina with the titular nickname, James Robert Kennedy, who is befriended and mentored by the local high school athletic coach Harold Jones (Harris in a wonderful performance) that more or less adopts him as the son he never had, and ingratiating him to a largely neglectful community that win themselves over by his loving personality. Based on Gary Smith's 'Sports Illustrated', Mike Rich's adaptation smartly focuses on the friendship between these two radically different yet similar men who forged a lifelong relationship that continues to this day. The only hampering is the at-times predictable occurrences (bullying and underpinnings of racism) and the thin-line of the noble handicapped black man as a token savant/mascot.

"vacuity","Null","0","1","28 October 2003"," Possible Oscars Nomination?
","In the beginning I thought the story would be great, and I started rating it 9/10. In the middle of the movie I'd reached 7/10, because it got quite boring after a while. But I've ended up rating it 8/10, because I think especially Cuba Gooding Jr.'s acting was quite great. I'd not be surprised if he'd end up with a nomination for the Oscars with his performance. Though I thought they should have focused more on only one of the levels of the character of Radio - the problem about racism or the problem about the disadvantages of mental retardation. I'm aware that this story is based on true events and the character Radio really exists the way he was portrayed, after all I think the story could have been handled better to make the intention of the storyteller clearer. But it's worth to watch. The movie's currently getting awful ratings, as far as I could see, but I have the impression that kind of topics are often not very popular as mainstream. Even though Forrest Gump sure was a hit, but not just because of the character, but also because of its wit and plot."
"mjnog","Null","0","4","26 October 2003"," One of the worst films I've ever seen
","I went into this movie hoping for some rudiesque type story, but the most accurate comparison I've seen is a literally Retarded Remember the Titans. Essentially a coach feels bad for retarded guy and lets him help his team and later the basketball team as well. The only problem was there was no real conflict or success other than the fact radio gains more confidence and mumbles alot more. I eventually walked out of the movie with probably 20 minutes left, they appeared to be making the Banker father who we see a few times during the first half of the movie, into the villain. It was kinda like watching the coach and eventually the rest of the school do community service. You feel good that Radio somewhat gets accepted, but I mean I think I got the idea and everything this story had to offer in the first 30 minutes. Essentially horribly boring, I really can't imagine who could enjoy this movie or sit through it without contemplating leaving. Other than the Majestic this is the only movie I've walked out on in like 6 years. Well anyhow I do not recommend it do yourself a favor and skip the theater entirely and goto the video store for hidden treasure. :P"
"iohefy-2","6","0","1","22 October 2003"," NICE LITTLE MOVIE
","Cuba Gooding is excellent as usual and Ed Harris gives another good performance, but this is the usual Southern football coach who stands up for the brain damaged little guy, and stands up for him with the team bully. There is nothing outstanding in the story, but the acting makes up for it. Nice to see Debra Winger back on the screen again."
