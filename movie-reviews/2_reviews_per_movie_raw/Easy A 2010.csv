","Lately the genre of teen comedies skew to the ribald and the are more sex romps than tell stories and introduce characters that you can not only root for but like. ""Easy A"" is a welcomed throwback to earlier teen comedies: risqué, but heartfelt.<br/><br/>In Emma Stone you have a Molly Ringwald for a new generation: relate-able, sexy, funny, sarcastic and lovely shines as Olive, a girl who leads her best friend (Aly Michalka) to believe she wasn't a virgin. The rumor spreads about her fabled loose ways and spurs different reactions from the school population: Brandon (Dan Byrd) wants to use it to his advantage, Marianne (Amanda Bynes) the school's self-appointed religious leader wants to shame Olive and Olive decides to run with it for her own gains.<br/><br/>There are many pluses with this film: A cast of young actors who are true actors who can convey the humor and uphold the tone of the film; a truly funny, vibrant script by Bert V. Royal in which not only the teens get to be smart and fully fleshed out characters but the adults (Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olive's wry and whimsical parents are a joy; and Thomas Haden Church whose character is a new spin on the ""hip teacher"".) as well.<br/><br/>With Stone as the lead and the only face in the promotional poster people may think this is a ""chick flick"" but this film is for anyone who just likes a good film."

","I attended a free preview of this movie and without having done any research on the movie and just based on a short synopsis, had pretty low expectations walking into the cinema. It's always great coming out of a cinema being pleasantly surprised by an enjoyable movie and that's exactly what happened! I've always been a fan of fast witty dialogue and this movie definitely delivers! Virtually every character in the movie whether minor or major seems to have something funny to say, and while there wasn't a lot of ROFL moments, there were quite a few LOL's throughout the movie! To me, it's one of those movies perfect for a Friday night to unwind from work without having to use too many brain cells (but enough so that you don't walk out of there thinking you'd wasted your time and intellect!) - it's one of those movies that i'll definitely be purchasing on DVD when it comes out!!"
"KnightsofNi11","7","65","82","26 November 2010"," A very funny comedy with slightly skewed morals
","It's always nice to see a comedy that doesn't meander around the same stupid gags insulting my intelligence time and time again. I was very happy to see a different kind of teen comedy that was much more sophisticated than the films it branches from and even parodies in many creative ways. Easy A is about a typical high school girl named Olive (Emma Stone). Olive has never been popular and has never really been noticed by anyone, and I don't see why considering Emma Stone is absolutely beautiful but that's beside the point. Anyway, Olive, without thinking things through, starts a little white lie about losing her virginity. This lie spreads to the rumor mill and spreads throughout the whole school ridiculously fast, which is one of the bigger themes of this movie that focuses on a lot of the necessary flaws of high school, one of the most incessantly emotional periods of our lives. Obviously, the rumor quickly gets out of hand and Olive's reputation as the school slut grows. Instead of backing down here, Olive exploits the rumor mill for her own social and financial gain, as guys pay her to pretend to have sex with her. The themes and criticisms of high school life in this film are valid, but thankfully they aren't overbearing and the entire movie becomes a laugh out loud blast.<br/><br/>First off, the dialouge of Easy A is surprisingly great for a film set around these kinds of teenage archetypes. It is much more intelligent sophisticated than the typical pandering you hear coming out of the mouths of teenagers. It adds a whole new level of respect to the film that keeps it very lively and fresh. But the dialouge isn't cocky, thankfully, and I never got the sense the writer was trying boast his wide vocabulary. He went a totally different route, and used it to the advantage of more characterization. Olive is much smarter than her peers and her language reflects that. There are plenty of other characters in the film that obviously don't come close to her sophisticated insight into the world and are the true bimbos and airheads. Their dialouge is much more typical of a teenager, and it reflects a very distinct level of characterization that had hilarious results. Needless to say I felt much smarter watching this film than some of the other crap I've subjected myself to in recent years.<br/><br/>Easy A also has a great variety of characters. Olive is already a very fun character who leads the story perfectly, keeping it interesting all the way through. But then there are other characters like Amanda Bynes as Marianne, the Christian nut job of the school. It's obvious to see where a person who boasts about premarital sex versus a religious zealot is leading, and these two characters are hilarious to watch interact with all their snappy and quick witted dialouge. The male roles are arguably the weakest of the film, but its not as big of a deal when the whole story primarily focuses on the social interactions between high school girls. Gossip is obviously a huge part of the story. But apart from the younger cast the older cast also fall into some hilarious roles. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci play Olive's parents and there isn't a moment with these two on screen that you aren't laughing your head off. This duo plays off each other so well and it makes for some of the most hysterical scenes of the whole film. Then there are other great adults in the film like Thomas Haden Church as the fast talking and sarcastic English teacher who you can't help but love. Malcolm McDowell even cameos as the school's principal and has a couple of short but funny scenes. Overall you couldn't ask for a more fitting and entertaining cast.<br/><br/>Overall, Easy A doesn't provide anything groundbreaking or revolutionary to the comedy genre, but it is certainly a breath of fresh air that keeps my hopes alive for the comedy genre in this age where there are so many god awful comedies being released. Easy A isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination. The story sort of becomes a mess towards the end and it seems to be going off on a lot of random tangents. And then it is all resolved rather simplistically for how all over the place it was. I also have to say that the moral compass of all these characters, especially Olive, is pretty out of wack. Some of the decisions are a little strange and seem ridiculous at times, but I guess it only reflects the naivety of a teenager, and how much we still have to learn. But overall you can't complain too much when you are delivered an overall satisfying and hilarious experience."

","Just saw this with my daughter who is 13. She has just recently seen all the John Hughes 80's movies (Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, etc.) and said it felt just like one of them. I couldn't agree more - great direction and just a hint of a wacky feel to it. Realistic, fun and interesting *normal* parents that don't take the world too seriously and want to be there for their kid.<br/><br/>The only parts that didn't hold up was a couple of logistical things (like a girl that good looking not having any guys following her around, and having a best friend who is such a ditz). All in all though the plot stuck together, was edgy in a few ways, and thoroughly entertaining. I'd put it on the shelf right next to the John Hughes films, and that is a distinguished place indeed."
"Stampsfightclub","9","89","117","24 October 2010"," Star of the future Stone shines in very funny comedy
","Emma Stone stars as Olive, a lonely heart who lies about losing her virginity to her best friend and soon rumour spreads she is a slut. Initially mortified Olive parades around the school as a slut, wearing an 'A' on her clothing but soon she ends up in trouble.<br/><br/>Described as ""the best teen comedy since Mean Girls"" this is a must see because quite simply, it is. The comedy variety of clever performances, physical humour and beautiful word play make a combination of knockabout comedy a treat for anyone over 15 years of age that will entertain you for a glorious hour and a half.<br/><br/>Emma Stone in her first major leading role excels as a typical but not yet typical teenager going through life's friendship and educational battles, and thankfully with a difference. Olive narrates via an internet blog about how everything came about and her life and school reputation changed. Through some original narrative design and comic brightness audiences are easily engaged into the world of its heroine.<br/><br/>Stone's performance is indescribably funny. From singing alone in her bedroom to strutting around in revealing clothing and making us laugh at the same time has made her a star for the future. One scene where she pretends to have it on in a bedroom is very funny and whilst marketed as a comedy, the inevitable drama sequences show Stone as a rock.<br/><br/>Stone steals the film but thanks to the experience of Stanley Tucci and Thomas Haden Church we have an array of comic genius. Tucci has never been funnier.<br/><br/>The plot boasts some great twists and turns whilst marketing some great songs on its soundtrack. The way it separates itself from the normal comedy, by diversifying itself through visual aids such as the live web blog or plot differentiations makes it one out watch over and over again.<br/><br/>A couple of drawbacks include the fact Lisa Kudrow cannot shake the Phoebe tag and the ending is slightly predictable.<br/><br/>These minor things aside this is a knockabout comedy with a great lead performance that is certainly worth checking out."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","67","92","18 September 2010"," Fun, hip and goofy modern comedy and '80s comedy homage
","Through much of the beginning of ""Easy A,"" you have to find all the '80s teen comedy homages fishy. Maybe director Will Gluck and Burt V. Royal are trying to dress up a classic Hughesian formula with modern banter and social media references. Then, somewhere near the halfway point, comes the admission. Olive, played by up-and-comer Emma Stone, confesses she wants her life to have a ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Breakfast Club"" or ""Say Anything"" moment. Ah, and suddenly this is homage territory -- much better. Like the rest of this hip, fun and surprisingly touching comedy, any time ""Easy A"" wanders down the path of cliché, a killer line or great scene nullifies it. <br/><br/>It all begins and ends with Stone, who can do a little bit of everything, which ought to ensure her a long career. She can do typical teen comedy lead autopilot/earn our sympathy, she can command the improvisation-like tangential dry humor that has defined the comedies of the last five or so years and she can be the sensitive, fragile Molly Ringwald type. Nothing feels forced or unnatural in her performance. She seems to be having fun and milking to goofy nature of Royal's script.<br/><br/>More importantly, the reason ""Easy A"" is so good is because it never stops being about Olive's story. A high school nobody, Olive lets her best friend (Alyson Michalka) pressure her into lying about losing her virginity. The simple lie gets overheard by the super-Christian Miss Everybody (Amanda Bynes) and suddenly everyone sees Olive differently, or sees her period. After deciding to embrace the attention as school slut (the story reaches here a bit), Olive then starts to pretend to have sex with guys in need of a reputation boost, which consequently sullies her own.<br/><br/>The only real problem with ""Easy A"" is that there's no good reason to believe Stone was this unattractive nobody given her actual attractiveness and the friends she has -- and we're supposed to believe that suddenly everyone is interested in her because she lost her virginity. Gluck tries to spin this into a positive by making it almost comical how everyone is staring at her or waiting in a perfect line for her to come down the hall, but it's the one scratch in this gem -- take it or leave it. The script and humor and situations that arise eventually more than make up for this road bump.<br/><br/>Gluck's filmmaking is hip and common of modern comedy while the writing is clever and spontaneous. For no logical reason, a scene when Olive's gay friend Brandon (the one she helps first) comes over, Stone and Patricia Clarkson, who plays her mother, do this quick exchange of pretending they're in the Old South and a boy has come over and asked for her. Though completely random and a bit forced, they actually work well at making the characters seem more organic, which is the challenge of most comedies, especially those made today.<br/><br/>Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as the parents are the comic relief. When was the last time parents in a teen comedy were genuine comic relief? They walk a fine line between wacko and genuinely caring and loving parents, but it totally works. Two more originally funny parents haven't existed on film before. Characters such as the aforementioned best friend Rhiannon and Bynes' are more by-the-book as far as being teen comedy stencils, but like every other small flaw with the film, they're covered up by all the multi-dimesional and more interesting ones. Worthy of mention are school faculty members played by Thomas Haden Church, Lisa Kudrow and Malcolm MacDowell.<br/><br/>Most intriguing of all is how the film actually succeeds at finding moments of genuine drama. A few well-thought-out and creative plot twists introduce an intelligence seemingly foreign to these kinds of comedies. The key once again comes from staying focused on Olive's story. The film is structured as a retelling with narration from Olive, so it's told in a reflective manner, which ultimately keeps it from veering off course. It's about Olive wrestling with this lie and her feelings about how she wants to be perceived, along with her understandable pity for the boys who request her ""services."" High school's rough and reputation seems to be everything. Some elements of the high-school experience in ""Easy A"" might be way off, but that's dead on.<br/><br/>Although it lacks the intangible innocence of the numerous '80s comedies it references, ""Easy A"" has a unique and lively spirit of its own and is the best teen comedy (at least featuring a female, finally!) in years. More importantly, it shows that the modern teenage sense of humor and good storytelling don't have to be mutually exclusive.<br/><br/>~Steven C"
"BradInAZ","Null","110","156","2 June 2010"," Modern day Scarlett Letter as gossip gets out of hand at Ojai High School.
","June 2 2010 - saw advanced preview of ""Easy A"" tonight. Emma Stone plays sarcasm great in this one, and supporting cast works well with her. Emma also narrates heavily throughout, and though not rolling on the floor funny, this has the feel of a John Hughes film (even makes reference to him in a longing way). Thomas Haden Church is funny as the only teacher we really meet, and Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are well cast as the understanding and 60's hippy mentality parents. The crowd I saw it with laughed frequently, and there are a lot of ""I've been there"" or ""I've seen that"" moments that you can relate to from your own high school. The writing is a little bit above the age - that is to say, you'd be surprised to hear the advanced dialog coming from today's teenagers, but this movie worked for me and those with me. Makes for a fun night at the movies. Scheduled for release Sept 17 2010."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","49","68","19 September 2010"," ""A"" is for Awesome
","According to Emma Stone's Olive, ""A is for Awesome."" ""Easy A"" is the funny smart movie of the year. Director Will Gluck's fresh mashing of Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" in this Twitter Age is whimsical, genuine, and hysterical. Emma Stone is absolutely amazing. Writer Bert V. Royal's screenplay brilliantly captures the angst and social perils of kids of this Facebook generation. Royal completes his story with touching narrative arcs and twists, and a valiant hero in Emma Stone. ""Easy A"" is reminiscent of ""Juno"" in its clever and biting dialog. Where in ""Juno"" no one in real life actually speaks with those razor-like smarts, ""Easy A"" is witty and sharp in natural speak.<br/><br/>Stone's Olive is a smart ass, but never over the top. She is the straight man, self-aware of the social ""no win"" she finds herself imprisoned. During the staged fake tryst, Olive (Stone) locks herself with Brandon (exasperated funny Dan Byrd) in a friend's bedroom. Brandon is gay and tormented everyday at school for just being. Olive reluctantly agrees to this public staging to recreate his reputation anew. When Olive removes her thong as part of the theatrics, Brandon freaks. Olive says, ""Do you think I have a gnome down there?"" Brandon defends that she is not his type. Duh. Olive surmises could it be: ""I have a V, not a P."" Gluck and Royal orchestrate hysterically. Stone has natural impeccable timing. ""Easy A"" had won me over at this juncture.<br/><br/>Olive is a smart and decent high school student in Ojai, CA. She is never in trouble— in fact nearly invisible. Olive gets caught in a lie, to avoid going on a camping trip with her BFF Rhiannon (charmingly spacey Aly Michalka) and her disturbing New Age parents. Olive tells Rhi that she had a one night stand with a college freshman over the weekend—really she was comically alone at home. School Christian Crusade Leader Marianne (gloriously bitchy Amanda Bynes) overhears Olive's restroom confession. Literally at the speed of light Tweets and texts broadcast Olive's promiscuity. Later Marianne tells Olive she will be judged by a higher power. Olive responds, ""Did I just get saved?"" <br/><br/>""Easy A"" opens with Olive's webcast, which is genius. She confesses, ""There are 2 sides to every story. This is my side—the right one."" Olive's good intentions to resuscitate social outcasts by ""fake rocking their worlds"" soon make her a pariah. She is getting Auto Zone gift cards to have faux sex with boys seeking credibility. Olive's favorite teacher Mr. Griffith (disguised aloof Thomas Hayden Church) becomes concerned when she transforms, and wears bus tiers emblazoned with the scarlet letter A. She is reading ""The Scarlet Letter"" in English class. Also worried is Griffith's Guidance Counselor wife (wacky Lisa Kudrows). Olive's parents note the red flags. Her Mom (wonderfully loopy Patricia Clarkson) remarks that she looks like a stripper-- albeit ""high end"" according to her Dad (hysterically wise Stanley Tucci).<br/><br/>However, on a transactional date Olive realizes that someone crossed the whore line. Fortunately, ""Lobster"" Todd rescues her. Todd (gentle and strong Penn Badgley) says he dismisses the rumors about Olive. He always remembers the beautiful 7th grader, who was kind to him. Olive too has always been in love Todd, since then. This is the distinguishing charm of ""Easy A"". Although Olive is in the adolescent abyss, the people that know her soul like Todd and her parents have faith in her. In a hilarious dinner scene Olive requests that her parents dismiss the rumors of Chlamydia—apparently no big deal. Even her Dad tells her vehemently and comically, ""I would take a bullet for you."" Her Mom understands completely. While gazing at the stars she tells her daughter that when she too was young she slept with a lot of people—""mostly guys"".<br/><br/>""Easy A"" poignantly captures and reminds us of the painful teen angst of fitting in, and just being allowed to be. When overweight dweeb Evan (sympathetic Jameson Moss) begs Olive to say that she had sex with him, she asks him why? Brandon says, ""Just look at me."" You can see the heartbreak in Stone's visage. While Olive is confronted by picketers, Todd tells her, ""Screw all these people, Olive!"" Ultimately, ""Easy A"" gets an ""A"" for its story about having the courage to take a stand, doing what is right despite what people think. Emma Stone is our hero on this journey. She is cute and has such a radiant spirit. She wins us over whether she is singing ""Pocket Full of Sunshine"" in the shower or seeing the suffering in her eyes when she realizes that she shattered the life of someone dear. ""Easy A"" is one of the best movies of the year. It's the kind of movie that is dismissed by the Academy, when it shouldn't. Perhaps, one day."
"ferguson-6","7","55","83","18 September 2010"," The Inexactitude of High School
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is an obvious (and proud of it) homage to the great teen films of John Hughes. It is updated for this generation of teens - replete with FaceBook, texting and webcam. While this one may not have the fully realized characters of the Hughes films, it actually takes things a step further in its commentary on many topics: family life, parenting, religious zealotry, rumor-mongering and the public education system.<br/><br/>Writer Bert V. Royal's script delivers an intellectual and comedic look into high school life ... told through the eyes of the smart, ""invisible"" girl. Just a brief overview will be offered here so as not to take away from the multiple layers.<br/><br/>Emma Stone (""Zombieland"", ""The House Bunny"") delivers a star-making performance as Olive. Forced into a faux-confession by her best friend, Olive experiences the efficiencies of digital gossip spreading as word leaks regarding the apparent loss of her ""V card"". Even though this one is based in Ojai, California, it's nice to know that high school promiscuity is still met with a certain stigma. Here that stigma is compared to Hawthorne's expert novel, The Scarlet Letter.<br/><br/>This sets into action a series of unforeseen events. The school's religious nuts, led by Amanda Bynes, take Olive's situation as a personal affront and spend a great deal of effort trying to punish her for her sins. At the same time, the geeks and dweebs view Olive as their savior and proceed to take advantage of the opportunity.<br/><br/>While she is presented as a very sharp-witted, well-grounded teenager, Olive experiences the enormous power of a reputation. All of this is balanced out by her extraordinary relationship with her free-spirited, yet wise parents played by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci.<br/><br/>I can't possibly do justice to the script or the numerous topics broached, but I will say that it's a welcome new approach to teen movies. The usual schlock sex is replaced by sharp quips and real pressures. Do note that the dialogue is filled with much harsh language that wouldn't be welcome in an environment other than a high school campus. Further support work is offered by Penn Badgley as the good guy, Thomas Haden Church as a new world cool teacher, Malcolm McDowell as an old school principal and Lisa Kudrow as a guidance counselor (in a role that gives me permission to feel the disgust I usually feel when she is on screen).<br/><br/>Don't be scared off thinking this is another lousy teen flick. It is instead an insightful comedy that plays well for adults and teens. While you may not agree with all of the social observations, I believe you will agree the film is presented in a most entertaining and insightful manner."

When her best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) invites her to spend the weekend with her family, Olive lies and tells that she will have a date with a nonexistent community college student. On the next Monday, Rhiannon goes to the bathroom with Olive and asks how her encounter was and Olive lies, telling that she lost her virginity in the weekend with her fictitious boyfriend. However, one school mate overhears their conversation and spreads the rumor about Olive's promiscuity. The religious fanatic Marianne (Amanda Bynes) blames her and out of the blue. Olive becomes a notorious student. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Olive is studying ""The Scarlet Letter"" in the English class and she identifies herself like Hester Prynne, the woman condemned by her Puritan neighbors in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel. Olive discloses the truth to her bullied gay friend Brandon (Dan Byrd) and suggests him to also lie that he had slept with a girl. Brandon asks Olive to help him and she pretends to have sex with him in a party. Then other outcast boys offer to pay Olive to improve their images while Olive's reputation degrades. When Olive loses control of the situation, she needs to take an attitude to revert it.<br/><br/>""Easy A"" is a delightful comedy about an average teenager that is on the spot of her high school mates after telling a lie about an encounter with a fictitious boyfriend.

The Story: Olive Penderghast is a normal high school student just trying to ""blend in the crowd"". At some part, she says she lost her virginity to a boy in community college and everyone starts to call her a ""dirty skank"". Then, she starts dressing like one and pretending to have sex for money.

"evan_harvey","5","58","94","25 September 2010"," Okay, but ultimately souless
","Saw Easy A tonight. It's pretty average. It's a film that had multiple references to classic 80's Brat Pack flicks, and so that raises it above the standard teen movies. Older audiences will get the 80s references more than the younger ones. There's quite a few laughs to be had, and some snappy dialogue. The basic idea of the film is good (a re-working of The Scarlett Letter, which the film unashamedly references and possibly over-references).<br/><br/>However, the main problems are ultimately fundamental flaws in the script. Olive (the smoking hot Emma Stone) is too cool. She's too self- assured, and too smart. It doesn't have the authenticity of teen life, unlike Mean Girls which had it in spades. Olive wasn't the cynical outsider the role called for; she was the confident adult narrator. Films that portray the hero coming out stronger at the end work for a reason, but the character was the same throughout.<br/><br/>The end of the film is a love story and fixes everything in only a few scenes, but it's tacked on, and felt contrived. The core of the film is the 'Scarlett Letter' concept, and it's a clever concept, but it kind of got muddled anywhere outside that. Olive's character didn't really suffer any great despair (at least the drew any empathy), so the ending (where she miraculously found love in about 5 minutes) was more a marriage of convenience than one of passion.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a strong film. Very confident, witty and well-paced. At the end though, it was just souless. No real losses or triumphs, no character development. Olive was just as smart and self-confident at the beginning as she was at the end. The audience didn't cheer Olive through the rough times because there weren't any that felt rough. We didn't really care that she hooked up with a decent guy at the end, as that subplot was woefully malnourished and not given any real development time.<br/><br/>Commercially? Okay. Artistically? Disappointing. It could have been the next Clueless or Mean Girls, but kind of wasted it's potential.<br/><br/>Worth seeing if there'e not much else on, and definitely worth seeing for Emma Stone in tiny blue shorts."

","EASY A – CATCH IT ( A ) Easy A is undoubtedly the best teen movie I've seen in recent times. It's extremely Witty, Clever, sharp & Out of the Box, which regenerate the whole new teenage world for us. Just imagine the teenage life we have seen in Clueless, 10things I hate about you and Mean Girls. Easy A is certainly a major step ahead in the life of vivacious and nowadays teenager's life. Besides the intelligent and brilliant cast, what makes Easy A more effective is its dialogues and storyline. Emma Stone proved that she was meant to do this role; she is witty, charming, funny and incredibly sweet. Emma Stone certainly stole the show and with help of some incredible young and some veterans supporting cast, she rocked it! In the end the musical dance number was a simply sexy & incredible. Penn Badgley is sweet & such a pleasant actor to see on screen. Amanda Bynes did a fine job. Aly Michalka was great, she was so blunt and outspoken, loved it. Dan Bryd is a great comedian, In Cougar Town and now in the movie he proved that this kid can make you laugh Big time. Cam Gigandet is Hot as Always. Now let talks about some veterans supporting cast in t he movie, I think it's the first time such big actors have works have worked in a teenage movie, where they have few scenes. Bravo for Will Gluck for convincing them to do the movie. Stanley Tucci & Patricia Clarkson, Wow Hands down they were great together. I think everyone would love to have parents like that, I wish they make a movie with these characters again some time, they were simply amazing. Lisa Kudrow is funny & mean. Thomas Hayden Church did a good job. Overall Easy A one of the best and intelligent movies of 2010, leave the teenage genre it's for everyone. Enjoy it!"

","This movie is highly overrated, I found it unwatchable, it tried to be Juno, but the story, writing and characters are so poor that it's not even close. I guess I have hard time believing a teenager could be the smartest person in the room all the time. I know teenagers, most of them don't have a clue. As for Emma stone being cast as a misfit, big mistake. Her parents come across as cartoon characters, totally unbelievable in my eyes. Stanley tucci is unbearable as her dad. Has all the typical Hollywood stereotypes, the hypocritical Jesus freaks, the misunderstood gay kid in the closet, and the slut that's really all talk. This movie was a complete waste of time, more annoying then entertaining. Don't waste your time."

","I know, suspend your disbelief when it comes to movies. I can do that with a lot of movies. However, the thing that makes highschool slice of life movies good is them being relatable and believable. This movie, not the least bit believable. Maybe it's just the highschool that I went to, but the ""Jesus freaks"" were largely underground because militant atheism was the ""cool thing,"" and all the gay kids were ""out and proud,"" and even when there were rumors about kids having sex no one really cared (some laughs maybe if it was a weird paring, but otherwise uninteresting). And here's the thing, I was in highschool when this movie came out. 2010 was my junior year, my friend's honors English class watched this as part of their Scarlett Letter unit in 2011 when the DVD was out. I was the target audience, and it fails to speak to me."

","Easy A has received so many positive reviews I was astonished at how bad it was. From the beginning it was difficult to suspend disbelief that a 17-year-old girl would stand out from the crowd for losing her virginity. And how much more difficult to suspend disbelief when the actress playing the character is 22.<br/><br/>It would have been worth the effort if the writing shone, but aside from some clever quips it was painful. The characters behaved in unbelievable ways. The movie has been compared to the works of John Hughes, but Molly Ringwald made a much more convincing outsider than Emma Stone. Stone is very charming and eye-catching, but is miscast for the part if we are to believe this attractive intelligent self-confident and funny woman is an invisible wall-flower who can only gain attention by pretending promiscuity.<br/><br/>Patricia Clarkson, Stanley Tucci and Malcolm MacDowell were a pleasure to watch, as usual, but they were peripheral to the action of the film.With the praise it has received I was expecting a Juno or a Clueless, but this film had less to say than American Pie."

","The more I thought about ""Easy A"", the less I liked it. This is a shame, because while there's plenty to like about it, there's just as much to dislike. The movie is inspired by ""The Scarlet Letter"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, which I'll admit, I never got around to studying in my A.P. English class. But I know the book is about adultery, which the movie has very little to do with. True, there is some adultery in the movie. But whenever the term is thrown around in the movie, it doesn't mean what the filmmakers seem to think it means. ""Adultery"", for the record, is when a married person sleeps with someone other than his or her spouse. Olive Penderghast, as played by Emma Stone, never sleeps with a married person. In fact, she never sleeps with anyone at all.<br/><br/>Instead, the plot starts when Olive invents a fictional boyfriend to get out of going camping with her best friend (Aly Michalka, currently starring on The CW's ""Hellcats"") and her bizarre parents. Soon, the rumor mill starts churning, and extra-virgin Olive gets a reputation as the kind of girl who ""puts out."" Moral of the story: gossip is bad. But it doesn't end there. Olive's goals as a protagonist are unclear. Confusingly, she alternates each scene between trying to dispel the rumor and trying to fuel it. You see, no one paid attention to poor Olive when they thought she was a virgin. Because she's too smart. Or nerdy. Or something. Never mind that guys everywhere would be tripping over themselves noticing her because she looks exactly like Emma Stone. Of course, the cliché of the beautiful nerd who everyone ignores has been used in countless movies before. But at least they usually put a pair of glasses on her and give her a funny hairdo until her ""transformation."" In ""Easy A"", gorgeous Emma Stone always looks like gorgeous Emma Stone.<br/><br/>Of course, it could easily have been a plot point that guys won't talk to Olive because she chooses to be a virgin. But again the character waffles between being a virgin because she's ""not that kind of girl"" and just being a virgin because guys won't talk to her. Anyway, the movie is framed as a web-cast in which Olive bares her soul to her entire high school. Because we're expected to believe that high schoolers spend their free time watching their classmates' web-casts. Or that two hours of confession will convince them of anything other than Olive's desperation for attention.<br/><br/>Leading Olive's persecution is Marianne (Amanda Bynes), the head of the high school's Bible study. Because in the ""Easy A"" universe, Christians are the scum of society. Nazis in any given movie set during WWII are portrayed more sympathetically than Christians are here. Amanda Bynes' character spews out ignorance and hatred while her cohorts nod and strum praise music with vacant expressions. True, there are people in real life that fit the stereotype, but the film makes no attempt to balance them out with at least one character who dares to stand up to Marianne, or to utter a word of disagreement with her, or even to possess a real personality. They just act as Marianne's brainwashed followers, while their preacher ogles high school students doing web-casts in his spare time. They're nothing more than cartoon villains.<br/><br/>Not that any of the other characters are any more realistic or any less cartoony, but at least they have solid performances behind them. Michalka's character is filled with fun energy, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson steal the shows as Olive's wacky parents, Thomas Haden Church gets some good lines as Olive's favorite teacher, and Malcolm McDowell is criminally underused as the school principal. But it makes sense that Amanda Bynes chose to retire after filming ""Easy A."" I've never really thought of her as a bad actress. But here she plays against type, and it results in the worst performance of both Bynes' career and this movie. It's hard to tell whether she's playing Marianne as completely insincere and phony or if it's just terrible acting, but either way she succeeds in giving her character less than a single dimension.<br/><br/>Another problem with the movie becomes apparent within the first few minutes. The pitch for the movie was ""The Scarlet Letter"" in a modern day high school by way of 1980's John Hughes teen comedies. The movie won't quit reminding the audience of this. While some self-awareness is always good, calling out that something's cliché as it happens doesn't make it any less cliché. By the time Haden Church's character mentions that he doesn't want to be like the cliché hip teacher his students see in all of the movies, you get the idea of how it would have felt if the cast of ""Alien"" had spent the entire movie discussing how their scenario was just like Jaws . . . but in outer space. While there are some clever lines, most of the time, the dialog's too ""clever"" for its own good.<br/><br/>Emma Stone deserves her turn as a leading lady. Unfortunately, her charm isn't enough to carry the film. I enjoyed her more in her supporting turn as the last surviving hottie of a zombie apocalypse in ""Zombieland."" If the movie were cut down to its most promising moments, a scene where Stone belts along to a Natasha Bedingfield song (already viewable a dozen places online), a similar scene where she gets a full song and dance number towards the end, and any scene showcasing the family dynamics between Stone, Tucci, and Clarkson, it would have been a more enjoyable film, and it would have been rid of about an hour and ten minutes of uncomfortable dialogue. Unfortunately for screenwriter Bert V. Royal, it'd also be rid of the plot."

","I am honestly surprised to see the good reviews that this movie has been getting. I found it to completely lack direction or logic. The characters were hardly likable or even realistic; and I think the message it sends is not a particularly good one to send to the clearly intended younger audience. Not a fan.<br/><br/>As an observation, I noted a fair amount of Christianity bashing, through the use of exaggerated stereotypes and stepping on a Bible. Some of it came off as a bit obvious and overdone.<br/><br/>I do think Emma Stone is a talent actress, however. Given her age and good looks, I think she will have a strong career in film. I like her better in her more adult oriented roles though."

The rip-offs from older and better done ""teen"" and John Hughes movies litters this movie and signals it's bereavement of ideas. Particularly awful are decent full-aged and experienced adult actors as parents reduced to mocking child-buddies especially Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson.

Nobody is gonna look back on this clichéd, heavily stereotyped, unfunny farce 10 years from now and say oh! wow! It's now a classic like the greater movies of the same genre from the 70s and 80s. Too much of it was far-fetched and unbelievable. That high school was more like a resort than a school and none of the kids looked like teenagers, they all looked like super-duper seniors. I respect Aly Mischalka for taking such a blink and you'll miss her role, I would be embarrassed too if I had been presented with such a lame script about nothing that addresses and resolves nothing. Pretty girl can't get dates so she pretends to be a floozy to get the attention of all the guys in her school...ugh! Okay. With so many jokes about other epic literary works, better films and stellar acting you would think that Easy A was about to take it to the next level but unfortunately it all falls flat about halfway through and follows the cliché of other similar movies rather than be the different film everybody expected it would be.

"blue__yoshi","2","15","25","21 January 2011"," Every bit as annoying as Juno
","So if you loved Juno, knock yourself out. But even then you might hate it. <br/><br/>I worry about the youth of today if this is how they see the world. Are they that self-absorbed that they could really identify and relate to these characters? Is humour these days really only about making references to other things? That's called reminding. It sometimes elicits an unintentional laugh from people who want to indicate they 'get it'. But it doesn't make something funny. <br/><br/>Also, I'm pretty liberal, but since when did that mean hating on religion? I thought it meant acceptance of all points of view. There seemed to be no good reason to demonize religion in this film other than a lazy way for the writer to have a villain. Some balance would have been welcome just so it didn't stick out so clearly that the writer had an issue with religion.<br/><br/>And I don't mean to make any further assumptions about the writer, but the female characters felt like they were speaking dialogue written by a gay man with issues. And that may undermine my plea for tolerance above, but it the characters were just so inconsistent and confused that nobody spoke like they were real people. The only moment that felt in any way real was when her gay friend pleaded for her help because of the problems he was going through at school (which is why I have made my assumption). Everything else felt forced, annoying, inconsistent, and smug. And that's not what I look for in a teen comedy. I prefer honesty, relatable characters, charm and humour - as found in the 80s comedies the film references."
"fedor8","Null","17","29","16 January 2012"," Emma Stone is very cute and she tries hard, but there is only so much juice you can squeeze out of a dried-up lemon of a script.
","I don't normally watch modern teen comedies, in fact almost never, but a very good cast (a rarity these days) attracted me to this movie, and by that I mean Emma Stone and the adult i.e. older actors (apart from Lisa ""Friends"" Kudrow). I should have known better. I understand that this is just a mindless teen comedy, but even the lowest-common denominator genres have to subscribe to some level of basic logic and ground rules.<br/><br/>1. Stone gets called an ""abominable tramp"" during English class, to which she responds by calling the other girl an ""abominable tw*t"". And yet Stone is the only one that gets sent to the principle's office. Duh. 2. Right off the bat Stone is presented to us as a teen of above-average intelligence (which admittedly isn't saying much). In fact, as is typical in these movies, she is given lines of a middle-aged man with 5 university degrees, AND she is full of 5-cent movie ""wisdom"". And yet she agrees to the gay guy's preposterous plea to pretend to have sex with him even though that would clearly only make her phony reputation as an easy lay even worse. We were given to understand that Emma wasn't enjoying that reputation too much, so why the decision? The reason: just so the writer of this lame script could advance his shaky plot. The poor sap couldn't think of a logical way of doing this, so he chose an illogical plot-device. Nice going. 3. ""Everyone claimed they slept with me, but no-one really bothered to actually sleep with me."" (Stone) That's about as dumb as it gets. If your comedy has absolutely zero basis in reality than very little in it will be funny, it's that simple. 4. The writer, probably some middle-aged male, simply projected himself onto Emma's character, a teen, and the result is a girl that doesn't appear even 1% believable, at any point in the movie.<br/><br/>Not to mention casting an incredibly geeky, ugly girl to play Emma Stone as a 12 year-old. If only it was meant to be funny, but it wasn't.<br/><br/>One of the more annoying aspects of EA were Stone's parents, played by Tucci and Clarkson. Always cracking wise, their totally unrealistic hip-understanding-always-cheerful-intelligent-parents shtick gets old very quickly, as does their almost clownish behaviour. But that's the problem of the whole movie: nothing here has an ounce of realism hence it's hard to either care for the characters or laugh at the gags that seem to get increasingly formulaic as the time drags on (and on).<br/><br/>Mocking ""Jesus freaks"" is too easy, it's been done so often by Hollywood by now it's hardly interesting anymore. Besides, didn't ""Monty Python's Life of Brian"" teach Americans how to do religious satire properly? That must have gone way over their empty heads. These Christian gags are so lame they were more than cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>But what could one expect? This director calls up on John Hughes as a major filmic inspiration. But just as ""The Breakfast Club"" cannot be enjoyed by anyone older than 18, the same might be true for EA too. (Admittedly, ""Ferris Bueler's Day Off"" shouldn't be enjoyed or watched by anyone, regardless of sex or age.) Even more embarrassing is that after all the cardboard, utterly absurd characters and goings-on that EA offers us, suddenly they give us Emma Stone CRYING – as if one hour into this goofy mess we can possibly take anything ""dramatic"" that occurs here even half-way seriously. Double-duh. You don't create a cheese-ball comedy environment but then suddenly expect the viewer to take the characters seriously – well, you don't if you're a writer with any amount of common sense.<br/><br/>Predictable and obligatory left-wing political correctness is sprayed all over this turkey: the usual pro-gay stuff, ""the only thing that trumps religion is Capitalism"" (Stone), Florida being commended for voting for Obama, the school's principal being labeled a ""Fascist"" because he doesn't believe in liberally-orientated New Age BS education systems, a black kid being adopted by Tucci and Clarkson, ""the Civil War was just about racism"" (Stone), etc. The whole left-wing movie propaganda alphabet, it's all here. Yes, even in a daft teen comedy. They never let up. Ironically, that makes them just as persistent and self-righteous as the ""Jesus freaks"" they mock here with such childish gusto. (When are American liberals finally going to smell the roses and realize that religion and their precious Marxism are just two sides of the same smelly coin?) <br/><br/>In the end, were it not for Emma Stone being present in nearly every scene, EA could have easily been an unwatchable bomb with no redeeming value whatsoever. It's a pity her films so far have been nearly all garbage. The fact that she seems to be a rising star in Hollywood only means her roles will get even worse. Watch her lift an Oscar in an overrated costume drama, a left-wing propaganda thriller, or a drama about a woman with no legs.<br/><br/>On second thought, no. Oscars are awarded nearly always to homely women with nepotist ties."

Would this movie have been condemned as anti-Muslim? I'm pretty sure it would have. But apparently, it's okay to portray Evangelical Christians as screaming, hypocritical fanatics. (I was just waiting for Ms. Byne's character to whip out a Westboro Baptist Church placard that said, ""God Hates Fags""). <br/><br/>If it isn't P.C. to lump all Muslims into the category of crazed Jihadists, why is it okay to play Evangelicals as one-dimensional,cardboard buffoons? Obviously there are Christians like that (just as some Muslims believe in violent Jihad), but why doesn't anyone in the film community get upset about portraying Christians in such a negative light as in this film? I just love Hollywood's consistency about being ""tolerant"" and ""inclusive"" when it comes to people's beliefs. <br/><br/>The other reason I hate this movie is because I sincerely doubt any girl would let her reputation be besmirched as often and as flippantly as Emma Stone's character does.

","What a disappointment that movie was in its mean-spirited depiction of Christians. <br/><br/>The makers of Easy-A exhibited virtually all of the negative qualities they criticize Christians of possessing: narrow-minded view of anyone not subscribing to their perspective, hateful treatment of those they consider ""beneath"" them, and blatant hypocrisy in their so-called message of tolerance. Quite pathetic how these bigoted filmmakers relish in ""preaching to the choir"" in their simplistic portrayal of a group they know is actually quite tolerate of their intolerance. Can you imagine the backlash if they had revealed their prejudices toward any other group, whether it be religious, ethnic or otherwise?<br/><br/>Of course I realize that there are overly judgmental Christians, who give their faith a bad name. However, the vast majority are just trying to live a decent life, raise their kids right, and help the needy with charitable work and contributions. I'm pretty sure the Christian charities have done a lot more good than bad. Can't say the same for those who cashed in on the cheap-shot film Easy-A."

The plot was very absurd in itself and pretty uninteresting other than a few unexpected twists that were completely random and had no foreshadowing or evidence to go with them. Overall, the writing was just poor. It was funny at many parts, though, and the character development of Emma Stone's character was somewhat good.

","Easy is a pretty simple straight forward story with an odd message. The plot is rather awkward and weird but for the most parts is plays out. Right from the start the film reeks a bit of desperation, as if it's trying too hard to be liked, much like many of its characters. Olive's feature-length confession, a 4th-wall breaking running monologue, is an awkward device that never seems sincere, while the turns the plot takes, particularly one involving a counsellor and a student, are simply too much to swallow. The film goes downhill in my opinion, from the part where it gets more religious. The scene with Olive going to church. It seemed like that was meant for the original R rating of the film.<br/><br/>The characters try hard to be liked but many of them I just don't ended up liking, in particular Olive, her parents (they too hard to be funny), Brandon, and the teacher- Mr. Griffith. Though I did like Amanda Bynes character- she should have been in it more (the best scenes involved her). Easy A is rather shallow and disgusting for a PG-13 film. In my opinion, I think the film would have been better had they kept the film being rated R. The jokes would have been better with a few more swearing and probably more sexual content. The message is obscured by mayhem here as Easy A's moral roots are undercut by its attempts to be one of the cinematic crowd. It just doesn't work for me. Maybe I'm not in the target audience but the film still could had been better. I also felt like they could have added an extra 20 minutes to develop the supporting characters (Rihannon, Marianne, Brandon). Things just felt unfinished and unanswered."
"bill_b4","6","13","22","2 October 2010"," Easy A For Effort
","Noble effort to make a movie with a questionably helpful message. I did enjoy the movie somewhat, but a few nagging things kept distracting me from really liking the movie. I will attempt to elaborate: <br/><br/>1) Aryan High. This did not look like a public school...more like a junior private college for jocks, models and cheer-leaders. I recommend the next time Hollywood makes a high-school movie with a contemporary setting, they actually GO IN one. The kids in this school did not look, OR ACT like kids in any contemporary public school I've ever seen. The plot may have been more successful in a 1950's setting. Promiscuity is not a major concern in today's public high-schools. And they weren't in the 80's, which is when I went. Either you were having sex or wanting to or thinking about it. No one was decried for having done it, or talking about it, or, for that matter bragging about it. Even girls. Granted, the girls were more discreet. On the contrary though, in today's schools you might just get more cred by claiming to be a virgin...especially if attractive like the main protagonist in this story. <br/><br/>2) Somewhat related to the last topic...if making a high-school movie...make it with kids that at least look like they're in high school. It's ironic and hypocritical that a minor plot-point in this movie is a student that's 21 years old and sleeps with a teacher, when ALL the students look like they're in their early 20's. It's about time the ticket-buying public make an issue out of this. I think it's humorous when watching noir movies today like ""Grease"" and the actors all look as old as the teachers. I guess today's movie-makers aren't worried about the future ""snicker-factor"" that might hinder a potential classic, otherwise they'd put more thought into it. I understand the pool of young acting talent is limited...but they are out there. Bust your butt and find 'em. It'll pay off in the long run...and you may just find the next hot star. Oh, and your movie budget might just be more palatable.<br/><br/>3) They hypocritical Christian. If you're going to portray a hypocritical Christian, why not go and meet one? Make the character realistic and believable. I know they're a caricature, but the girl in this movie was portrayed WAY over the top. Really. It kept me from rating this movie higher. I mean, if I was to make a movie with a German, I WOULDN'T give him a swastika arm band and a Hitler mustache...too cliché. Put a little effort into make your characters at least a little realistic.<br/><br/>I know, I know...this is an exceptionally harsh review. I did like the movie and felt bad I couldn't enjoy it more. I thought the message, being comfortable in your own skin, was positive...but done way better with movies like ""Napoleon Dynamite"". A little thought could've made this movie a much more enjoyable experience."

","I wanted to like this movie. It was a good concept, but it just failed for me. Without spoiling any storyline, here's just some stuff I could not get past: 1) When a movie starts with a character narration, that's just bad writing. Lazy. SHOW us, don't TELL us. That's Creative Writing 101, high school level. And the narration just never stopped. It was like listening to an audio book.<br/><br/>2) Everyone was just so overly quirky and funny. The main character, of course. But also her teachers, her parents especially, her friends and her enemies. All of them talked at an inhumanly fast and witty speed - like Robin Williams in the 1980s. It could be cute for a minute, or even for a whole scene, but the entire movie was just unbelievable.<br/><br/>3) While I'm accustomed to 20-something actors playing high school students, in this case, I was really distracted by the actors' obvious ages. For the first 15 minutes of the movie I thought they were in community college. Once I realized it was high school, I couldn't ignore how old they all looked.<br/><br/>4) Good storyline parts were abandoned.

How she helps Brendan in the bedroom is so hilarious, I laughed hard! In just a few days, her world is turned upside down, she feels differently about herself and everyone else feels differently about her as well.

","Being a teenage girl is no easy task, believe me. In Jr. High I had a boyfriend and the first thing on young teenage minds is the curiosity if there is sex in the relationship, fun rumors began to spread and it was one of the worst times in my life. Funny enough, this isn't something that just started when I was a child, or my older sister or my mother or my grandmother. Girl's reputations have always been fragile since the beginning of time, even Shakespeare knew when he wrote Much Ado About Nothing. The Scarlet Letter challenged the double edged sword of how if a man sleeps with a woman, he's a pimp, a lady's man, or just simply ""the Man"". If a woman sleeps with a man, she doesn't get as kind treatment, we get the names ""slut"", ""whore"", or ""tramp"". No matter how much you know it's the truth that you're not those names, it hurts. But what if a girl actually took pride in those names and love the attention she got, even if it was too rough to handle? Emma Stone proving that she's leading lady material handles herself extremely well in this terrific re-imaging of The Scarlet Letter for teenagers that will prove to be more positive and every pre-adult lady should watch.<br/><br/>Like most high school kids, Olive Penderghast just wants to be popular. So much so that when her best friend, Rhiannon, asks Olive how her weekend went, she decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motor-mouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne, and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive's unrepentant weekend of debauchery. Of course not a word of it is true, but that doesn't stop everyone in school from talking, and an amused Olive from deciding to go with the flow. Playing the role of the hussy to the hilt, the girl who used to be invisible begins dressing provocatively and turning heads in the hallways. The students aren't the only ones taking notice, either; Olive's English teacher, Mr. Griffith, is concerned that the kind of attention she's receiving isn't healthy for a developing girl, and his wife, the school counselor, is in full agreement. As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne, she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon's popularity a much-needed shot in the arm. Olive never thought her little game could possibly have any negative effect on anyone but herself, but when loose lips start sinking ships all around her, she realizes that it's high time for the truth to come out.<br/><br/>I think this is a very important film for girls because unfortunately this generation doesn't read as much as they should, plus as much as I loved the book The Scarlet Letter, it wouldn't appeal to everyone. We need a new update to grab someone's interest and I was really impressed with the way the cast and crew handled this film. Emma Stone has a lot of charisma, such maturity for a young lady and she carried herself so well. She even provides comic relief to give the drama little break. Same with Amanda Bynes, almost taking on the character played by Mandy Moore in Saved as the ""holier than thou"" bible thumper who feels that if you have sex before marriage, your soul is damned. Even Lisa Kudrow did a great job, as a high school counselor who puts Olive in a bad situation blaming Olive for her crime and you are just in shock and feel total sympathy for Olive when she realizes that her reputation is destroying her mentally. Easy A provides great education for both teens and adults(parents or soon to be parents) on how hard it can be to be a teenage girl. I wish that I had a film like this when I was 13 because I would have felt a lot better knowing that a lot of girls go through the same thing where you feel so hated for doing something that you didn't do. Easy A is easily one of the year's best films and I'm very happy with the way it was handled, very classy, sexy and funny, I would highly recommend it.<br/><br/>8/10"

","One of the more disappointing flicks in memory. I was so psyched to see it and delighted it was on Netflix instant watch. What began with so much potential including a decent cast (and charming, witty parents) was undermined at every turn with by its relentless attack on Christianity. At one point it even took a shot at capitalism for good measure. I am a Christian and normally don't mind a little mockery of certain aspects of it. I remember being annoyed in college by the ""slimy"" bible thumpers on campus pushing their beliefs on others. I even stopped going to churches when they either engaged in cultish like behavior or the priest spoke down to the congregation. I did this because – despite what Hollywood tells you - there are good churches and decent Christian folk out there. Despite all this about a third in the story was picking up steam and found a nice little groove. Then about 2/3 in the appearance of Patricia Kudrow was like a death nail for me. What a deplorable character with her barrage of GD this and that. She added nothing to the film and really sank any hope the material had with her tirade. Too bad too since I was just starting to really like the family (Tucci and Clarkson were terrific). Plus Church was effective as well particularly when he exclaimed to Stone, ""We all know you read the book."" It was refreshing for a teacher to acknowledge when a student stands out in a positive way. Then the negativity set in and the attacks intensified to dominate the final third and suck the life out of the entire film. Dan Humphrey couldn't even save this one."

"JimD73","5","9","15","6 October 2010"," A good movie with trouble in the details
","There's a good movie lurking within Easy A, I can say that with great certainty. A film aiming to make Emma Stone the new Molly Ringwald, it succeeds in a few departments. Emma Stone shines, and the movie offers a few instances of great dramatic intrigue. However, one sin it commits brings it down greatly: it does not manage to be consistently funny.<br/><br/>Emma Stone stars Olive Penderghast, a small town high school student who manages to top the gossip chain by creating rumours of her promiscuity. Using it to help the woeful male losers pretend they got action, Olive bathes in both gift cards and infamy. However, once the consequences of her actions become apparent, the spotlight is suddenly less bright.<br/><br/>The plot definitely has some dramatic high points, above all relating to the teacher/guidance counsellor married couple played by Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow, a story that perhaps would have been better served as the main plot line rather than a sub plot. Olive being solicited for the real deal is also a dramatic high point. Many of the supporting actors not brought in for comedic relief absolutely sell these moments and make them by far the most memorable parts of the film.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is an incredibly charismatic lead and is well positioned to be the teen queen of the generation. It is a testament to her performance that she is incredibly watchable even while given a terribly wish-washy character, who until the end flip-flops between regretful and infamy-loving at an alarming rate. While some of her one-liners are decently amusing, some stand out as particularly horrible, notably the Tom Cruise line from the trailer (how was that line considered good enough to make the promotional material?).<br/><br/>Two major parts of the plot and cast fail miserably though. While a male romantic interest was necessary, Penn Badgely as Todd seems to be something out of a particularly bad John Hughes movie. This is made ten times worse when the film pokes fun at those very same John Hughes movies. Perhaps if the male lead was less of a underwear model, the overall theme of the film would be less muddied.<br/><br/>Also failing epically is Amanda Bynes as the hyper-Catholic Marianne, whose circle ostracizes Olive. Her acting is consistently hammed up and her groups actions and interactions seem far too cartoonish in contrast to the films real dramatic tension. The movie also seems perhaps a little too gung-ho on an anti-religion slant, using religion as a shortcut to indicate people just not minding their own business.<br/><br/>The general kookiness of some of the characters is also somewhat offputting. Olive introduces her best friends parents as very strange people, seemingly only to keep us from noticing how very strange her own parents are. They are clearly portrayed as loving, and Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson clearly have fun, but they aren't as funny or important as they should be.<br/><br/>In all, the film has many issues, but a great film does lie beneath them. Even with those issues, the movie could have been forgiven if it was at least funny. While it has some great moments and will surely be a star-making vehicle for Stone, Easy A doesn't quite make the grade (worst pun ever, I'm aware)."
"MartinHafer","3","8","13","3 May 2011"," A great premise but the writing really disappoints...
","Although the film begins with some great opening credits and had a great idea for a plot, the rest of the film really, really disappoints due to bad (VERY bad) writing. So, they took a very good idea and made the least of it.<br/><br/>The idea of a high school girl PRETENDING to be a slut isn't a bad idea. And her then helping a gay kid by pretending to sleep with him to stop the other kids from picking on him was great. But, the characters in this film are at best cartoony--walking stereotypes who lack believability. They don't act or talk like any teenagers--at least not on this planet. Take, for instance, Amanda Bynes. She plays the most one-dimensional religious zealot--and ALL her Christian friends and family are all bigoted hypocritical jerks. Olive Oyl from the Popeye cartoons has more depth than these characters! As far as the rest of the characters go, they all seem to try too hard, speak hipster lingo too often and just seem like bad fan fiction. Todd is JUST a plot device--not a person. And, on top of all that, the main character is too smart and glib to be real--and difficult to like and she often behaves inexplicably.<br/><br/>The bottom line is despite a HUGE ad campaign to sell this film (often a sure sign that a Hollywood films sucks) and a clever idea, they do nothing with the premise and the film is a bore. And, I might add, the film isn't great for teens either as it's rather crude, smarmy and might just make them stupider. Dumb and unbelievable when it COULD have made some sort of positive statement.<br/><br/>Oh, and the ""Knock on Wood"" number near the end might just be one of the dumbest I've seen in ages."

Pay attention to the fact that, despite the major success of this film, Emma Stone (who was technically in her 20s when this was filmed and therefore ""playing younger"") has no aspirations to become a teen idol nor get her own Disney show. What makes this film special -- aside from a script to die for and a superb portrayal by Stone, showing no strain whatsoever under the burden of dual duty, that is, both acting and doing a first person narrative, like Bogey in a filme noire -- is the simple fact that Stone will not be reprising this role (or anything similar) in either her lifetime or yours. And that is special. That's makes this film not only a one-of but also one of the best ""smart comedies"" ever, irregardless of age or audience."

","Teen comedy Easy A stars Emma Stone as high-school nobody Olive, who finds herself the centre of attention after a little white lie about losing her virginity becomes hot school gossip. Rather than admit the truth and return to obscurity, Olive capitalises on her new-found fame, even going so far as to make some money out of the situation by charging desperate dorks to say that they have scored with her.<br/><br/>Instead of going for the easy option -- crass low-brow comedy -- Easy A opts for a more sophisticated and good-natured approach, and while this means that real belly-laughs are in short supply, it makes for an appealing movie overall, both amusing and heartfelt, helped no end by a very likeable central turn from Stone. Other solid performances come from Thomas Haden Church as Olive's favourite teacher Mr. Griffith, Amanda Bynes as moralising Jesus freak Marianne, Aly Michalka as Olive's bestie Rhiannon, and Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olive's caring and supportive parents.<br/><br/>Easy A directly references a handful of '80s teen classics that were clearly the inspiration for writer Bert V. Royal, who matches these in terms of tone and characterisation. This film could sit quite nicely nestled amongst time-honoured favourites such as Pretty In Pink, Say Anything, Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club.<br/><br/>6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."

","I have only a few words for this movie.<br/><br/>It is very realistic yet funny. The rumors and gossips can destroy one's life. These should never be practiced. Lies will always hurt people in so many ways.<br/><br/>The protagonist is unbelievably beautiful. I do not know why she was saying those words in the beginning of the movie that no one notices her! I think the director should have cast a little less beautiful person in this character. It is impossible not to notice her. The moment I saw her in this movie, after so many years I was telling myself that Oh why this girl is so beautiful!!!! Really! the protagonist should have been played by someone else of lesser beauty.<br/><br/>And the half naked male characters should think of personal hygiene a bit more.<br/><br/>But overall story is very strong. It translates the modern day ostracism and the life of a woman who is victimized by it. The society is so damn unforgiving when it comes to girls and boys like this. It is unbelievable. It shows how teenage people are abusing technology and destroying social life of someone even without understanding it. If western world is infected with this virus called gossip at such an epidemic level then the society really is doomed. There is no helping it.

She's cute, smart, mouthy without being a jerk and has an awesome sense of humour. And if you've seen Emma Stone in many interviews, like I do, some could assume she's not really ""acting"" but being more likely herself. So the acting itself might not be excellent but she has all my sympathy and I could listen to her all day. Olive's personality fascinates and Emma's deep voice is a blessing for one's ears.<br/><br/>While theme and many characters are exaggerated there are just few real slap-stick moments and a lot of its humour arise from the dialogues. It is not one of those big Oscar awardee but it is a real classic you can watch every once in a while.

"zetes","6","2","2","26 December 2010"," Unbelievable and not very funny, but Emma Stone is so terrific it almost works
","This was hailed by some as being a cut above the average high school comedy. Its star, Emma Stone, starred in what is perhaps my favorite high school movie, Superbad. This one may be better than the average high school comedy, but it's not especially great, either. I obviously wasn't a girl in high school, and it's been over a decade since I've been there, but the events in this movie just don't come close to my actual high school experience. If you don't know the story, it's about a girl, Stone, who invents a sexual partner, and immediately becomes known as a slut around the school. Then she starts to pretend to be stupping a bunch of losers so they become more popular. When I went to school, any girl who looked like Emma Stone or the other gals in this movie, you'd kind of assume they were having sex (Hell, any girl who dressed like these girls, even before Stone embraces her inner slut, would probably be sent home to change, and my high school was pretty dang liberal). It might make guys like me upset because we could never have them, and it might make the ugly girls jealous, but would it ever have been as big a deal as it is in this movie? Not much of it seemed believable to me. It's worst offense, though, is that it just isn't all that funny. There are a few good laughs, but otherwise, it's kind of dull. Yet I didn't come close to hating it. Emma Stone, for one thing, is exceptional. Even when the writing is poor, she sells it. She's just got some wonderful comic timing, and her eyes are wonderfully expressive. I also absolutely love Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as her goofy parents. I really wish they had gotten more time. Instead, they spend a lot of time on a really bizarre and underdeveloped subplot involving her teacher (Thomas Hayden Church), who is married to the school guidance counselor (Lisa Kudrow)."
"fuldamobil","5","9","17","20 September 2010"," More like C-
","I was really disappointed in this film. I loved Emma Stone in Superbad and Zombieland. She has a really nice, relaxed presence that is well suited to a smart teen comedy. Unfortunately, Easy A leaves out the smart although I feel like it thinks it has something to say. And, that's the big problem. The movie is about big issues especially for teenagers: promiscuity, the power of rumors and reputations, std's. But, its only point of view is that these things are bad. There's very little depth here. I don't think any character, especially Olive, learns a lesson they didn't already know. The antagonists, a group of chaste Bible thumpers led by Amanda Bynes, are one-dimensional caricatures. (It doesn't help that Bynes's hemline is higher than a pole dancer's.) And, the protagonists are basically all the same sardonic quipping, impossibly understanding people. This is where all the supposed comedy comes from; witty remarks and pseudo-intellectual playful conversations like the writer had just watched a Gilmore Girls box set. The best comedies have humorous situations as well as funny dialog. Easy A has neither."

","I wondered what the A stood for in the film's title, Easy A. Only now after watching it could I possibly tell you what it means. I think the A stands for atrocious, which is exactly what this terrible mish-mash of a teenage comedy is. Easy A looked like it could have been much better, but it failed to deliver. I had only started taking a bit of notice of Emma Stone after seeing her in Amazing Spider-Man. So I wanted to see this movie as this was her first major starring role and the movie that catapulted her to that position. It was a disappointment to say the least, but through no fault of Emma Stone's.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was terrible due to not enough time devoted to the development of characters (eg. Amanda Bynes), overacting (especially from Patricia Clarkson, but also a bit from Stanley Tucci), and that they added nothing much to the story (Thomas Haden Church, Lisa Kudrow among others). As a result, the writing was bland as their seemed to be no noteworthy plot to speak of as it is unrealistic to me, and the direction was poor. I was expecting something in the style of Mean Girls but this is a poor girl's version of that. Emma Stone's character does come off as a bit of a Lindsay Lohan-Mean Girls clone, but not nearly as good. Thankfully, Emma Stone is much better than that. I prefer her in straighter roles such as Birdman and La La Land. If you are a big fan of Emma Stone, check them titles out and don't waste time on this dull film."

I am a huge fan of John Hughes and his classic 80's teen comedies, to me this just felt like another one of these with a modern twist and a storyline that more can relate to these days. It had a great cast, director and extremely well written script. The story follows Olive who tells a lie about something very personal and it spreads like wildfire through the school. She loses her friends and decides she no longer cares what people think about her.

From the very beginning however, I know that something was terribly wrong. I saw no humor in Emma Stone's ""Scarlet Letter"" situation. Her dialogue & sarcasm were unrealistic for someone her age, I'm sorry. And the odd relationship with her wacky parents? Unreal. Stanley Tucci was seriously miscast as the dad.

Emma Stone is charming, and Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are amusing if highly implausible and eventually a bit too smarmy and self-satisfied. The biggest problem is the main character's motivation. She decides to lie for everyone, then asks them to undo the lie for her, because she is fed up with it. That's it. No drama with her parents, and her love interest is devoted to her throughout the tale. Plot-wise, there is little or no development beyond that.

"SoleVeil","8","3","4","2 March 2014"," A great comedy with the potential to be more. Though it lacks some connections plot-wise, Emma Stones extraordinary performance makes up for all its tiny faults
","Easy A stars Emma Stone as she takes on the role of a very different type of High School student who, despite the image she acquires throughout the movie, endures her tribulations with astounding indifference. If Emma Stones character wouldn't have carried with her that perpetual gleefulness, the movie might have just moved in a completely different direction. Though the movie was undeniably a comedy, I could not help but ponder over the dark undertones that loomed in the background of all the comedy. <br/><br/>Olive is an outsider, as we quickly pick up when she spends her weekend chanting ''A Pocket full of Sunshine'' alone in her room. For some, this may well be the most funny part of of the movie; for me, it was sort of depressing. To me, it emphasizes her lack of a social life, and it is how I felt when I first saw the part. I understand this is far from how most others perceive this part of the movie, but anyways...<br/><br/>Olive is also incredibly intelligent, and her snappy and witty retorts stay with her all throughout the movie. She leads a distanced life but appears to be a contended, courageous and confident girl with little social angst. Her relationship with her laid back parents (who were, by the way, one of the funniest proponents of the movie) is open and genuine. With a sudden lie to her best friend, Olive's life transforms from being an overlooked girl (which appears a little strange judging by her look, but im digressing...)into a whirlwind of exaggerated rumors,boosting her image into someone of a more than, to phrase it nicely, liberal sense of promiscuity.<br/><br/>The movie itself was great. Don't get me wrong, it did contain many funny moments and was distinctly comical. However, I myself saw potential in the movie to be meaningful, and for a movie to be meaningful, it requires realism. I hardly think the scenario presented in Easy A resembles real life. Characters were, at least mostly, very stereotypical and flat. OK, maybe not all of them. Anyways, I hope you get my point. As far as Olive goes, I had just one critique, which is once again digressing from the comedic theme of the movie. I couldn't quite grasp how lightly she took her mortifying daily life. (Potential Spoiler!) How did she just suddenly become a beauty goddess brushing off guys with a sort or royal indifference when it wasn't even clear if she had ever kissed a guy before. An innate confidence, maybe? Just a few things to consider from my point of view, none of which really interfered with the comedic scheme of the movie.<br/><br/>So, let's talk of the comedic value of the movie. Honestly, I didn't have awfully many ''laugh-out loud'' moments. Probably (and here we go again ) because of the dark undertones whose probability of being explored by the writers I failed to discard throughout the entire movie. I think that if I would re-watch the movie with a more comedy-oriented mindset it would indeed be funny, but its first impression on me was undeniably thought-provoking. Taking aside all of the stereotypical clichés, I really think this movie has something to say. <br/><br/>Feel free to disagree with me. Maybe I'll re-watch the movie and jump to a different conclusion."

","What we have here is according to me one of Emma Stone's best movies (and there are many more...she rules). I watched this movie about five times now and I find the characters extremely likable and the passion Emma puts in her performance made it worth-while. I'm really happy with the quality of teen movies Hollywood brings to us these days. This is just one of those, and being a teen myself I could identify all the situations in this movie with those that are in my own life. A fun, funny, sad, touching movie meant to be seen before you die. A must see for anyone who are fans of Struck By Lightning; I love You, Beth Cooper; Pitch Perfect and any teen movie out there. Loads of fun!!!"

","Most teen comedies today are one noted, unfunny crap. But as long as Emma Stone is involved, and around for a long enough time for her to be a teen, I would say that the teen film genre is safe. In Easy A, the witty teen comedy, Emma Stone is hilarious, and lovable. I really hope she's around for a long time.<br/><br/>Stone plays Olive, a teen outcast who tells her best friend that she had sex. Though she didn't. But the word soon gets around. And she is running fake sex errands for her fellow classmates, including a gay guy (played by Dan Byrd). Eventually, she is believed to be a skank, and it boosts her popularity.<br/><br/>I've liked Emma Stone for years now. Ever since she played Jules in Superbad. But in Easy A, she shines. She is going to go on to be something. Easy A isn't a great movie. I Like the cast, which includes Amanada Bynes, Thomas Hayden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Stanley Tucci, and Lisa Kudrow.<br/><br/>A lot of Easy A is hilarious. It's a good thing that they gave this role to Stone, because she does it best. At least in 20 years when all of our favorite actors have passed on(God I hope not), we don't have to stoop to the level of Zac Efron. We still have Emma Stone. She's talented, hot, and hilarious, and I can't wait to see more of her.<br/><br/>B"
"george.schmidt","8","3","4","4 December 2010"," Stone shines in this funny teenage comedy with echoes of John Hughes
","EASY A (2010) *** Emma Stone, Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Dan Byrd, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Stanley Tucci, Cam Gigandet, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell, Alyson Michalka, Fred Armisen. Stone shines as a teenager facing a scandalous rumor – of being a harlot – that only snowballs when she cannot control and instead embraces the innuendo to largely comic affect echoing some John Hughes and of course ""The Scarlett Letter"". Director Will Glick ably gets a lot of mileage from virginity jokes and the like from the fairly smart and funny script by Bert V. Royal but gets more mileage from his even brighter supporting cast particularly the always welcome Clarkson & Tucci as the acridly humorous (and highly, capably understanding) parents. Stone's star is on the rise and she also rises above what would have been another ordinary teen farce but her trademark pluck and smoky voice add panache to what could have been a lackluster role. A nice surprise for a change in a genre that needs fresh blood!"
"dtucker86","Null","3","4","22 September 2010"," stuck on stupid kids
","First of all, I wanted to say that Emma Stone does a terrific job in this film as Olive. Whether she is being sarcastic or slutty she is just awesome. She is one young actress with a lot of promise (I hope she doesn't end up like Lindsey Lohan). Someone else compared her to Molly Ringwald in the John Hughes movies in fact they mention John Hughes in this film. Watching this film made me think back to my high school days when I read The Scarlet Letter in English class. They reference it heavily here and Emma is supposed to be like Hester Prynne in the novel. The only thing is that Hester didn't seek to be branded as a trollop, Olive wanted to be one in the worst way. I just don't understand because she seemed like a smart kid in the beginning. Was she that desperate for attention? High school has changed so much since my day, but one thing stays the same, some high school kids are stuck on stupid. Teenagers will like this film because as in most teen films they play the adults as total dolts. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson absolutely steal the show as Olive's goofy parents. There is one hilarious scene where Olive's mother tells her about her high school exploits with both boys and girls. Your watching this and thinking no wonder Olive is so troubled. Malcolm McDowell has an amusing cameo as an autocratic principal and I thought the ones that play Olive's cliché spouting teacher and his adultress wife were a hoot as well. SPOILER ALERT at least Olive wised up in the end and found true happiness."
"cadfile","10","4","6","22 November 2010"," A realistic plot and some wicked funny lines make this film a pleasure
","I was interested in seeing ""Easy A"" since the trailer came out and I wasn't disappointed. It's a funny movie with an excellent lead turn by Emma Stone. In fact the entire cast does a great job with what on the surface might look like yet another teen sex comedy.<br/><br/>What sets this apart from other movies is it's downright funny. I found myself laughing hard at a lot of the dialogue like when Principal Gibbons tells Olive, ""This is public school. If I can keep the girls off the pole and the boys off the pipe, I get a bonus."" or when Mrs. Griffith said about the character Micah, ""He's not the sharpest Christian in the bible."" I also liked the realistic plot. Compared to ""Confessions of a Teenaged Drama Queen"" where the main character Lola tells a bunch of lies and seems to get everything she wanted even after her lies blew up in her face, in ""Easy A"" Olive loses quite a bit when her lies get out of control. By the end of the film you know she fessed up but you really don't know if she got back her reputation.<br/><br/>I also liked how the film dealt with social media in high school and I especially liked Mr. Griffith's comments ""I don't know what your generation's fascination is with documenting your every thought... but I can assure you, they're not all diamonds. ""Roman is having an OK day, and bought a Coke Zero at the gas station. Raise the roof."" Who gives a rat's ass?"" Exactly.<br/><br/>This was a funny movie with well written characters and a realistic plot. The bonus for me was the call outs to the 1980's teen movies by John Hughes that this film tried to emulate. I think it did a good job.<br/><br/>This will be one I add to my DVD collection."
"movie_space","2","7","13","9 February 2011"," ""Easy A"" a difficult watch...
","""Easy A"" a difficult watch... <br/><br/>Would you pay someone to lie for you? What if you were a really fat guy who eats mars bar shirtless poolside (I didn't make that up, it's in the movie) and you could pay a really hot girl (Emma Stone) to say that she kissed you, would you do it? What about if you were the girl, Olive, would you take the money and lie? That's the situation that Olive finds herself in after an false rumour of her losing her virginity is spread around the entire school. But instead of denying the gossip, Olive buys into it by donning slutty outfits and accepting discount cards and cash from boys in return for lies about sexual exploits they've shared. When STD's, adultery and a shot at actually losing her virginity to a guy she likes pops up, Olive needs more than money and lies to rescue her..<br/><br/>Okay that last sentence really killed all the good work that I'd put into the opening of the review, I suppose it's because I've just watched the whole 92 minutes of ""Easy A"" and I'm feeling anything but inspired or happy, two things I'd like to feel after watching a comedy/romance. Maybe I'm asking too much of a teen movie? It just lacked any sort of believability or depth. You'd be right in thinking believability and depth are hardly two strong characteristics you'd associate with the romantic-comedy genre, but it's what make classics last, think Breakfast at Tiffany's, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually and Bridget Jones. Why? Because these qualities make you relate to the characters: you cry when they cry; if the protagonist finds love, you also believe you can find love etc And I'm afraid, the films allusion to The Scarlet Letter (a 1850's novel about an adulterous woman) is a poor attempt at giving the film depth.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate really, because the cast is alright (Lisa Kudrow, Stanley Lucci), the age old topic of lying never gets old and the power of gossip in the playgrounds is especially relevant today with social networking sites like face book adding whole new dimensions to how messages are spread and the new ways kids are bullying each other. The character of Olive, a girl who ignores what other people say about her and has a refreshingly deep voice, could also be a strong role model for young women, but even with Stone's fairly natural acting ability, she is let down by the average and unimaginative script that tries too hard to be cool and comes off as being dated.<br/><br/>But if you want to see for yourself, and you make it to the end, you'll be rewarded with a snippet of music from Australia's 'Angus and Julia Stone'.

"padmeluv","4","6","11","20 October 2010"," Shallow and Stereotypical
","First let me start out by saying this movie wasn't too bad, except the main character (Emma Stone) really turned me off. From the get-go, her fake sarcasm left no room for imagination, and she had absolutely no charisma. This may have been due to plot development (the writers), but it seemed that her acting style was underdeveloped and her lack of real blockbuster experience showed. Her character relied on ""hip"" pop culture references and quirky characteristics that are also popular on the show ""Glee"" (which I do not watch, I find it rather repulsing).<br/><br/>Another reason this movie was incredibly unoriginal was for its complete stereotypical Christian views. I don't know if they were just being satiric or not, but the way they portrayed the group of Christian (led by Amanda Bynes, in her last role: sad face) was totally unrealistic, and that is not how any Christian group in High School actually acts. Super-cute Cam Gigandet (Micah) helped pick up the mood of the group, but not enough to salvage the film. This whole aspect to the story was unnecessary, and it would have worked just fine if that group hadn't been Christians at all, just a pile of gossipy preps.<br/><br/>The only part of this movie that was semi-decent was the Huckleberry Finn references throughout, especially the one at the end. I cracked up when they popped a clip of the HF movie near the end of the film, when the two gay guys were fondling together, ""Hey, Huck, let me steer."" Overall this movie receives a way below average rating. Shallow plot. Fake sarcasm. Irrelevant pop culture references. Uncharismatic leads. Unrealistic representations. 4/10"

Raters just throw out numbers without any context. A 7.2 means a WELL above average movie. Average in a 1 to 10 scale is five or a six. This movie is low average at best, barely a FIVE. Simple plot, weak dialogue, and fails to capture the magic of growing up as a teen --- like the Hughes movies did. Emma Stone is likable and the only reason this movie is not a Four.

Although I do not remember the ""Scarlet Letter"" totally, i do remember that the ""A"" the women wore stood for adulterer.

Everyone believes Olive (Emma Stone) is now a harlot with a one track mind seeking trim any way she can get it. Spiralling out of control after she helps with others to provide false sexual endeavors, the film frequently references 'The Scarlet Letter'. To say much more will give away more than I am prepared to. With Stanley Tucci in the cast as Olive's hipster ex hippie Father & Thomas Hayden Church as an obscure teacher, it's a must see.

The humour is sarcastic and extremely witty and I loved every minute of it."
"Turfseer","3","3","5","20 August 2011"," Easy ""A"" is really an Easy ""D""
","'Easy A' was written by a first-time screenwriter, Bert V. Royal, and it shows! It's not his fault that most of the actors who play the high school students at 'Ojai North High School' (including the 22 year old star, Emma Stone) are too old for their parts. Director Will Gluck and his casting director must take the blame entirely for that. Royal, on the other hand, has proffered up a script featuring a fairly unsympathetic protagonist, pitted against an assortment of noxious antagonists, most of whom are pure stereotypes.<br/><br/>Mr. Royal has really found the formula for making a quick buck in the film industry. Simply come up with a story about shallow teenagers who attend a high school. Royal reportedly concocted this smug tale in five days and it shows. His protagonist, Olive Penderghast, is an insecure teen who initially doesn't want to let her best friend Rhiannon know that she's a virgin, so she concocts a tall tale of a weekend liaison with a guy at a local community college. Marianne, daughter of a Christian minister and campus gossip, overhears Olive's fictitious claim and then spreads the word that Olive is a slut and soon enough most of the kids at school turn against her.<br/><br/>At first, Olive appears sympathetic, as she is willing to help Brandon, an insecure gay kid who hopes to gain acceptance from his peers by pretending that he's straight. Olive helps him accomplish this by agreeing to simulate a sexual encounter with him, behind closed doors at a party thrown by the 'most popular' teen at the school. But then Olive decides to embrace her notoriety by accepting gift cards from nerds who ask her to vouch that she's had some kind of sexual contact with them.<br/><br/>Since the student body is basically depicted as a bunch of nasty, back-stabbing gossips, Olive is unable to withdraw from the collective condemnation and perhaps seek support from a more sensitive, intellectual type of student. Even the cool English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church) fails to help her. In a completely awkward scene, a student calls Olive an ""abominable tramp"", likening her to Hester Prynne from Hawthorne's 'Scarlet Letter"". For some reason, however, Olive ends up in Principal Gibbon's (Malcolm McDowell) office after calling her an abominable 'twat'. I found it a bit unbelievable that a student would have to go to detention for merely calling another student a 'twat', especially after her rival started the whole thing; in addition, other students who have been actually physically assaulting one another, seem to receive an equal punishment . Actually it's never explained who actually sends Olive to the principal's office (why didn't sensitive Mr. Griffith try and defuse the situation?) and Malcolm McDowell, is also unbelievable as a surly martinet who cuts the kids no slack whatsoever.<br/><br/>What's worse is that we're asked to root for Olive after she begins accepting the gift cards. By doing so, ultimately she bears the responsibility for compounding her negative reputation on campus and no one seems to point that out to her. Why does she act so surprised that one date almost takes things too far? Why also root for her when all the misguided males (sans good guy Todd) have no redeeming qualities? Also ask yourself whether you find it funny that these insecure males (en masse) would offer gifts to a woman who has such a dubious reputation. Is it really worth it to them, to have her vouch for them? In reality, having sexual contact with such an outcast as Olive, would probably lead to scorn from their peers--not approbation! So the whole idea that these nerds would shower gifts on Olive makes little sense!<br/><br/>Olive is allowed to indulge in her negative, acting-out behavior since she's depicted as a total victim of a gossip-ridden society. Even if you believe that most people are like that, at least give your opponents their due: even the unprincipled have something of a likability factor! Not here! In addition to the insecure males, Christians also get short shrift here too. I have no objection to criticizing or making fun of those of the Christian faith but at least create some real life characters to shoot down. Here the Christians are narrow-minded bigots, buffoons, easily disposed of since they are completely one-dimensional. Even educators can't catch a break. Lisa Kudrow's Mrs. Griffith is perhaps the most unpleasant character in 'Easy A', having sex with one of the students and another one of those unlikeable individuals who have no guilt feelings about throwing Olive under the bus. Only Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, who play Olive's over the top 'New Age' parents, manage to eke out a few laughs by taking permissive parenting to one big extreme.<br/><br/>'Easy A' ends awkwardly as it begins. Somehow, Olive's bombastic musical production in the high school gym and a one last 'heart-felt' web cast manages to convince the surly high school population that she's not so bad after all, turning everything around. And she finds 'true love' to boot with that one 'sensitive' guy who respects her decision not to give away her virginity right away. <br/><br/>Despite the poor script, the acting and direction in 'Easy A' is spot on and the film has some nifty cinematography. If you can stand all the implausibilities and lack of 'ideas', you might find all this somewhat entertaining. For more discerning eyes, the most predictable thing here is that the critics were once again taken in by all the tripe. Hopefully, a few of us will pray for their misguided souls!"

This is something a lot of people think, giving the comments here. It's wrong. <br/><br/>The film is good. A few days ago, after watching 'Magic in the Moonlight', I decided to see some more of Stone, and of course I thought of 'Easy A'.

Actors are excellent, script is good and dialogues are actually funny. On top of that, of course there's this brilliant, witty, pretty, intelligent Emma Stone. She is in fact capable of making a bad script/movie look good, but it's just not needed - it's already funny and entertaining and well-written. <br/><br/>Actually, I remember it had a lower score here on IMDb than it has now.

","These are the 90 minutes that brought Emma Stone to popularity in the movie business four years ago, that were crucial for her getting roles in Spider-Man, The Help and Birdman afterward. And last but not least, she scored a Golden Globe nomination for it. Aside from Stone, the movie includes lots of nice music, some real classics and competent performances from more established Hollywood actors, such as Amanda Bynes (her most recent appearance in a film and that was 4 years ago already), Patricia Clarkson, Malcolm McDowell, Lisa Kudrow and Stanley Tucci. Tucci is my favorite here giving an incredibly funny performance as the main character's dad. The writers did a nice job especially with the dialogs for this film. A bit of a shame that writer Bert V. Royal has not worked much since then when it comes to new projects. Nothing big coming out from him really. There isn't a single cheese scene. It is creative and witty from start to finish. The story is fine too, sometimes almost a bit too much against the church, but everybody who is not strictly religious will not be offended. At least the film's director has a bit more in his body of work now. He directed ""Friends with Benefits"" (also including Stone in the cast), Michael J. Fox' new television series and the popular upcoming musical ""Annie"".<br/><br/>The emotional breakdowns from Stone's character did not entirely convince me and one would have been enough as well, but I really liked the message against Facebook and today's mentality of how you have to let the world know about everything you do or feel. It's really embarrassing and it was great to see so much criticism against that here. Also I liked how the relationships were portrayed. The main character's relationship with her teacher was nice to look at and felt only bad during one scene when he tells her that he does not like the other student either. Apart from that, it was very realistic when Kudrow's character and the fat boy from early on disappoint her in the end. It did not matter to them (anymore) that she really helped them both early on. That's life. If you're in the mood for an actually good-quality teenager-centered comedy, this one here would make for a wise pick."

"thill-oliv","7","2","3","24 September 2013"," Easy A : A Laugh Out Loud Film
","Emma Stone delivers a stellar performance as character Olive Penderghast. An average high school student who jumps from the bottom of the social ladder to the top overnight, when there's word that she slept with some guy from a community college. Emma Stone's acting in combination with a raw, comedic script, take the common high school gossip mill onto a whole new level and the big screen.<br/><br/>A bubbly, fun energy is brought to the set by Emma Stone as she assumes her role's new found identity as Ojai High School's biggest slut. Emma's blunt comedy and mannerisms give the students of Ojai a run for their money. With a faux sex scene, made up make-out sessions, etc. and the support of amazing co actors Aly Michalka (the pushy best friend), Amanda Bynes (the annoying ultra-Christian), and Dan Byrd (the gay friend who just wants to fit in), the laughs will just keep coming. A There's just one little catchthe rumors were started with one small lie from Olive herself!<br/><br/>To compliment Emma Stone and Company's acting is a fresh, edgy script, giving Easy A a raw, comedic vibe. To add to this fresh façade, director Will Gluk (Also director of 'Friends with Benefits') guides this film as a narrated internet cast, showing the lie come apart one chapter at a time. Going back and forth between the story and Emma introducing/commentating on the 'chapters' adds a neat element to this film. An example of which is the second chapter titled, ""The Accelerated Velocity of Terminological Inexactitude"", in which the rumor spreads at lightning fast speeds. Another aspect of the script that makes it so amusing, is the parallel made between Olive's life and her studies. While this whole rumor ordeal is happening, Olive's English class is reading 'The Scarlet Letter'. For those of you who don't know, this novel is about a woman who is accused of committing adultery and is made to have a scarlet letter sewn to her clothing. The script is uniquely written in that Olive (Emma Stone) begins dressing like the slut everyone presumes her to be, including a big scarlet 'A' sewn to each of her outfits.<br/><br/>Easy A is a humorous production of a high school rumor gone wrong. A laugh after laugh film with Emma Stone leading off an energetic performance and a supporting script to boot, there's just not much that can go wrong. I makes you wonder thoughjust how much truth is there behind the stories floating around your everyday life?"
"SnoopyStyle","8","2","3","22 September 2013"," Emma Stone lovable
","Virginal high schooler Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) tells a little white lie to her best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka). It quickly spreads as judgmental Marianne (Amanda Bynes) makes Olive the new cause celeb. She decides to own it by playing it up. To help out bullied gay friend Brandon (Dan Byrd), she pretends to sleep with him. Then everybody wants in, and things spin out of control.<br/><br/>There's a lot of sarcastic humor with modern references. It's pretty funny on its own, but it's definitely all Emma Stone. She is absolutely lovable. If there is one problem, it's that we're suppose to believe that Emma Stone and Alyson Michalka are outsiders. It is the movies, so let's put that aside. At most Hollywood usually puts librarian glasses on them anyways."
"g-bodyl","9","2","3","3 January 2013"," Funny and Sweet!
","Easy A is a very funny and touching movie that pays homage to the John Hughes teen movies of the 1980's. Even during the film, we are treated to a montage of clips from various Hughes films. This is also a movie that many of us can relate to whether we are young or old. This is one of the reasons I love this film. I can relate to this film back from my days in high school.<br/><br/>This film is about a girl who has no reputation and no one notices her. But that changes when sexual rumors spread about her. Now, she decides take her newfound popularity to her advantage.<br/><br/>This is the film that made Emma Stone a star. She was a great scene stealer in both Zombieland and Superbad, but she comes into her own here. I also loved the parents played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. They are hilarious and lovable but dim-witted. I also give credit to Amanda Bynes and her religious cult. That was pretty funny.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a hilarious but relatable teen comedy. I bet no one would have thought that the critics would love this and do quite well at the box office. I was one of the doubters but now I'm a believer. This is one of the best teen films of the decade if not century(2000's). I rate this film 9/10."
"bdgerety-67-127267","4","2","3","29 May 2011"," Enough with the sarcastic wit...
","This movie was very well-written. I'll give it that. The writer obviously spent a lot of time on it. It was, however, incredibly pretentious and completely in love with itself. I will bet my bank account that no high school kid in America talks the way the main character did. You're constantly being bombarded with sarcastic wit. At first it's pretty funny but this movie went completely overboard with it. Halfway through I thought to myself ""Hmmm, a gay guy must of written this. Only they could reference this much outside pop culture and extraneous, irrelevant information."", and whaddaya know? I think in the midst of trying to make so many pop culture references he forgot that he was actually tasked with writing a structured movie because the ending felt pretty rushed and the conflict resolved too easily. Oh, and having the unconventional, hip parents was such an original idea, and funny too. The writer watched Juno way too much. The bottom line: If you're a woman aged 13-55 or a homosexual, chances are you'll LOVE this movie. If you're a couple of normal, average, unsuspecting guys just trying to be entertained on a Sunday through Netflix on Demand, you'll be severely disappointed and the only positive thing you'll take away is that you got to see Emma Stone in lingerie and acting slutty. Actually, this is the one redeeming quality it has for all of the guys out there. Definitely worth watching just for that reason. Just put it on mute."
"rooprect","8","1","1","6 February 2020"," The smartest high school teen comedy I've ever seen.
","There's a rare comedy zone that exists above pratfalls & cheap gags, above situational laughs, somewhere near satire but not quite that obvious. It's a peculiar zone, sort of like the classic ""Edward Scissorhands"" where the filmmakers are clearly showing you an exaggerated reality, but not so exaggerated that you lose touch with its relevance. And through this wacky prism we see our own lives with a hilarious spin if the actors can pull off the right deadpan delivery. Very few movies hit this zone, movies like ""Catch-22"" (1970), ""Dr Strangelove"" (1964), ""Joe Vs. the Volcano"" (1990) or ""Punch Drunk Love"" (2002). And here, I'm happy to announce in the most unlikely genre (high school teen comedy) we have a great addition to the list: ""Easy A"".<br/><br/>If I lost you with my opening paragraph don't worry, all I'm saying is that this movie is really funny. Emma Stone plays ""Olive Pendergast"", a 17-year old girl at a California high school who, after years of being a faceless nobody, suddenly gets thrust into the spotlight when strange rumors of her sexual promiscuity spread like wildfire. The ""Easy A"" in the title is a reference to the parallel story of ""The Scarlet Letter"", the 1850 novel about a woman accused of adultery and forced to wear a demeaning ""A"" for her sins. But here we see a cool, modern take on the situation with Olive proudly and spitefully wearing her penance in front of the entire school of her accusers.<br/><br/>And that's what makes this such a fun & hilarious flick. It's that, the whole time, Olive is almost like the puppetmaster and controller of the crazy events that happen as things quickly escalate. Emma Stone is perfect for the role with her sarcastic wit and deadpan apathy even though her life is rapidly going into the trash can. Thus the chain of events becomes like what I described in the opening paragraph: an exaggerated reality delivered with deadpan precision. If you've ever seen a Bill Murray flick (""Groundhog Day""), that's how Emma's character comes across.<br/><br/>Throw into the mix some really witty zingers, some hilariously bizarre characters and a healthy buffet of references to classic 80s teen comedies (movie buffs, you can make a game of trying to catch them all), and you've got a great experience. The whole presentation is like a 80s John Hughes film on steroids. John Hughes would populate his high schools with instantly recognizable archetypes (the jock, the nerd, etc), and here we have the same approach but way off the deep end. Instead of being antagonized by the jocks, Emma's character must match wits with the Jesus freaks who sit around with a guitar singing bad religious diddies (another parallel with the antagonists in ""The Scarlet Letter"").<br/><br/>From beginning to end, ""Easy A"" is very well written, clever, poignant and just plain hilarious. And on top of it all, it delivers a powerful message that every teen, as well as most adults, should remember regarding how to navigate this crazy judgmental society we live in. As you're watching this, you realize that the microcosm of high school applies to our entire civilization. Whatever age you are, definitely give this flick a go."
"hazysistersunshine33","7","1","1","13 January 2020"," Smart teen angst comedy
","The ending was a little typically feel good and it follows some of the typical formulas of teen angst movies, but it was probably one of the smartest teen angst movies I've seen. It has a surprisingly funny and clever script. Emma Stone was great in it and convincing as a pretty intelligent teenager. I really like her. She has proven to be a good comedic as well as dramatic actress. She was hilarious in in House bunny. It this one she plays a high school girl who ends up pretending to sleep with guys for money., so the guys aren't made fun of for being virgins or gay. One would think this would make her a social pariah, but it actually makes her more popular for a while. Times have changed since I was in high school. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson who play her overly progressive parents are great in it too."

","I saw this movie years ago, I decided to come back around to it for fun. I found it pretty enjoyable, It's a pretty good chick click.

"david-meldrum","9","1","1","2 November 2019"," Brilliant, Funny High School Romcom That Takes The Genre For A Contemporary Spin
","I'm very fond of this film; a high school romantic comedy, one of the best of its kind, and very much one of the best of the subset of romcoms that are reworkings of classic texts. In this case, it's The Scarlet Letter that gets the treatment.<br/><br/>The emerging Emma Stone in the lead is brilliant; but what really makes this is the brilliant cast, fine actors in small roles everywhere you look. Of course, no one speaks as the characters do in this film - but of course, that's not the point. There are so many good gags, I keep losing count; my favourite ones being the almost throwaway jokes around the lead's kitchen table as the scene fades into the next one, taking the viewer delightfully by surprise.<br/><br/>It also takes many of the classic, often problematic, tropes of classic high school romcoms, and cleverly subverts them. Emma Stone's Olive is a woman discovering she can take control of her life; and the cost to her, and others, as she tries to conform to type along the way. Rewatching this in 2019, this starts to look like it was, even then, somewhat ahead of its time; it's a delightful, engaging but quietly powerful unpacking of the damage toxic masculinity has on women (and men). Well worth watching, and rewatching."
"Robsrandomopinions394","8","1","1","28 September 2019"," Iconic!
","This is another one of those teen movies, but this time it's different and funny with a extremely likeable lead. Emma Stone's best performance after La La Land! A must see for any teen film fan!"
"truemythmedia","6","1","1","16 September 2019"," Funny
","First off, Emma Stone is pretty delightful. I'm not normally a huge Emma Stone fan. I like her when she is good and don't when she isn't so great. She's not an actress that 'sells' a movie for me but this is definitely one of her better performances. Partly, I think this is due to just how good she is with comedy. Just like in ""La La Land,"" her humor is used to great effect to endear you to her, despite the fact that, in this film, she is going to take a pretty dark turn.<br/><br/>This is of course helped by outstanding casting for her parents Stanley Tucci (""The Lovely Bones,"" 2009) and Patricia Clarkson (""The Green Mile,"" 1999). Both of them play pretty woke parents who seem more like pals with Olive than parents with a heavy heaping of sarcastic wry humor.<br/><br/>I suppose that's my first negative with this film though. The sarcastic approach to everything does wear thin after a while and isn't helped much when everything turns out ok and we get a more earnest heartfelt piece of Olive and her folks. There is certainly a bit of that teen angsty attitude of 'anyone-who-cares-about-things-too-deeply-is-dumb.' It's funny at times but as hopefully people eventually grow to understand that the world is more complicated than that, so the humor and fun becomes trying at a certain point. (And yes I know that's part of the point of the film. I just don't think that excuses a comedy from losing its funniness<br/><br/>Another failing of the film, and this is a nitpick, is the way that the internet and technology is portrayed in the movie. It's just so unrealistic and feels like it was written and designed by middle aged people who happened to see on the news that some kids are really getting into that internet video thingy. I get that there was some lag when it came to figuring out how to portray online life in the aughts but this was made in 2010, not 1999. It's barely any better than the portrayal of the internet in ""Mission Impossible.""<br/><br/>So, I saved the worst for last and it is probably particular to me and other Christians but the way that religious people are portrayed in this film is simply offensive.<br/><br/>""Easy A"" is basically a movie about a girl who is straightlaced but through a well intentioned lie, develops a reputation for being a ""slut."" This brings her popularity with guys but she loses a lot of her old girl friends and becomes the target of a clique of religious 'do gooders' who make fun of her, pray for her, and basically, become her most vocal haters.<br/><br/>As a Christian, I have never met a single Christian who acts the way these ones do. This is coming from a guy who likes the movie ""Saved."" in that film, Mandy Moore leads a similar group of Christian concerned crusaders but she isn't the only Christian in that film. There are plenty of others who aren't so cruel.<br/><br/>Why does this film feel the need to build a straw-woman out of Amanda Bynes (""Hairspray,"" 2007) who can't act to save a fictional soul, and then take her down like the mockery of Christianity that she is? There are plenty of other people who don't like Olive's apparently promiscuous activity that aren't burdened by being wholly unlikable in every way.<br/><br/>I know there are Christians out there who can be real jerks but that doesn't excuse this portrayal in a media landscape that frequently uses Christians as their villains. It would be like showing a Muslim in this movie and having him running around yelling ""Allahu Ahkbar"" and threatening to kill all the americans at the school. Sure there are bad examples out there but to single them out unnecessarily and constantly put a real bad taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>That didn't stop me from having fun with this movie, though. I think anyone there are a lot of people who would like this movie a lot for its humor and heart. Also its pretty rare to see a teen comedy that discusses sex so heavily and openly but isn't so raunchy that it has to be Rated R. It's certainly still too rough for some audiences but, for many, this movie will hit that sweet spot of being highly enjoyable and entertaining without doing too much to turn of weaker kneed viewers."
"questl-18592","7","1","1","16 September 2019"," Easy... B+
","Easy A is a fun little movie about a girl's trip through the high school rumor mill. It's funny, it's well acted, it's filled with... A bunch of people playing high schoolers that are a little too old to actually fit the part.<br/><br/>And that's what holds it back, because the message is important and the performances are solid and the humor did work for me... But.<br/><br/>For everything that works there are little things that take away from it. Some of these ""kids"" act the part, sure they're playing dialed up archetypes, but amidst them are also Rhodes Scholars, the most unrealistically awesome, scene stealing parents and the kind of teachers we all wish we had.<br/><br/>So while a good chunk of this wants to live in reality, there's a significant enough portion that wants to live in a fantasy land and the two just don't merge into a perfect harmony."

I liked the narratives, the humor, and those minor plot twists. Other than that, the movie is averagely average. Nothing special. The kind of movie I forget when the screen is turned off ( I didn't forget Emma's face though, maybe because of La La Land). Unbiased rating : 6/10"
"zkonedog","7","1","1","9 March 2017"," The Thinking-Person's ""Mean Girls""
","A few years ago, the movie ""Mean Girls"" redefined ""high school experience"" movies. With ""Easy A"", the ""bubblegum"" style of ""Mean Girls"" is replaced with a bit more of a sophisticated style.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Easy A"" focuses on high school student Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), who inadvertently starts a rumor that she slept with a fellow student. When the rumor spreads like wildfire and Olive realizes she cannot contain it, she decides to just go with it and see what happens.<br/><br/>When it comes right down to it, ""Easy A"" strikes a nice balance between ridiculous & cute. At some points you'll just be laughing at Olive's crazy antics, while at other times you might just actually care about her character (a rare feat in a primarily comedic effort).<br/><br/>Also, it must be mentioned here that Emma Stone's performance as Olive carries this entire movie. Stone can play sexy, sweet, and everything in between, and her range is on full display in this flick. She is a joy to watch and redeems a plot that gets a bit thin after about the first hour.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Easy A"" is a fun movie if you are interested in high school fare. It tries to be witty, snarky, cute, & even a bit preachy all wrapped up in a single package and, while perhaps not accomplishing any one of those things totally, the combination is enough to warrant a viewing."
"MennoMan","5","1","1","22 May 2015"," Too bad Hollywood Christian Hatred Ruined this Almost Gem
","This film was almost set up to be a classic.. REALLY!!! But bad writing, ignorance or bias got in the way leaving a bad taste of unrealistic characters.<br/><br/>Of course some may disagree but really anyone who really has Christian Friend or at least does not attack their friends beliefs Christian, Jewish, Islamic or Atheist will understand that BAD stereotype is in itself HATE. The reason I myself believe this was in fact Hollywood liberalism ??? Look at the characters.. all the Good People are in fact Liberal, Left or Atheist... All the Bad one.. well.. you get the idea... But saying that, I still loved the good guys for who they were as believable characters.. It was the hateful ones which lack realism. <br/><br/>This is why I am so disappointed. The film mentions and uses many classic like the ""Breakfast Club"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"", yet by using it's negative and unrealistic stereotypes of High School Christians Kids the writers sabotaged their own movie.<br/><br/>from greatness... I really loved the premises, Acting and most of the script.<br/><br/>It is not that the film needed this mean spirit that all Christian High school Kids or even Any are somehow hateful, mean spirited, self righteous instigators of rumors and them-self not following their beliefs in acting this way. The fact is All Kids that age do gossip, spread rumors and hurt others.. but few actually act as mean spirited as the Christians were portrayed. <br/><br/>Of course some will not see this, themselves probably believing this was real life and justified.. or perhaps tire of the mean 'Cheerleaders always taking the wrap... that's fine.<br/><br/>The point is, No real CLASSICS, especially the great ones portrayed and in fact used by name or in intimation had to resort to naming any one religious or cultural group... It is this reviewers belief, if they had simply made the antagonist average High school ""Kids"" like most of the followers.. perhaps this film would be as loved ten years from now as the ones mentioned... Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey... Can't Buy Me Love....! <br/><br/>Still a good solid 5...

","High school is a weird time in a person's life. And it's about to get a whole lot weirder for Olive Penderghast. Olive is a nice, if rather anonymous, girl. She's not popular. She's not unpopular. She's just there, pretty much invisible. Then, in the interest of shutting up her somewhat annoying best friend, Olive makes up a story about having lost her virginity to some college guy. Unfortunately this phony confession is overheard by Marianne, leader of the pack among the school's group of young religious zealots. Marianne spreads the word all over the school. Olive isn't anonymous anymore. Everybody all of a sudden is very interested in her. She uses her newfound notoriety to help out her gay friend Brandon, pretending to sleep with him so he will be accepted by his peers. This works for Brandon, but not so much for Olive, furthering her reputation as a dirty slut. At this point Olive decides to go all-in, fully embracing her new image as the school's resident tramp. And this makes for a pretty fun movie.<br/><br/>Easy A is an homage to all those teen comedies of the 1980s we know so well. This movie may not be quite as good as those other movies it pays tribute to. But it's certainly good enough to provide some solid entertainment. The best thing this movie has going for it is Emma Stone who is absolutely fabulous in the role of Olive. Olive is a smart, charming, witty, endearing girl and Stone brings all of that out wonderfully. It's a star-making performance. The movie doesn't have very many huge laughs but it has its amusing comic moments and Stone nails each and every one of those moments. What the movie may lack in big laughs it makes up for with smarts. It's a very well thought-out movie, scripted with a structure that really works in delivering the story in the best possible way. It's a very simple story but the way it is laid out makes it work well. And while Stone is clearly the star, and weighted with carrying the film on her shoulders, the supporting cast adds a great deal to the proceedings as well. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci are terrific in playing Olive's exceedingly quirky parents. Thomas Haden Church plays one of Olive's teachers in a way that makes it very easy to see why he is Olive's favorite. And all of the younger performers fall comfortably into their roles as well with Amanda Bynes making a particularly good impression in the important role of God-loving Marianne, a great antagonist for Olive.<br/><br/>This movie takes Olive on quite a strange trip. Once she starts down the path of fake whoring there's the sense she may not quite understand what she's getting herself into. Things could get rather messy. But you always believe she'll be resourceful enough to extricate herself from whatever messes she may create. And you'll definitely be rooting for her to do so. Olive is a character who is very easy to love, full credit to Stone for making that so. Olive's smart and very charming. And so is the movie. Yes, it could stand to be a touch funnier. But there are enough laughs here to satisfy. Easy A definitely makes the grade."
"zuko598","7","1","1","6 May 2014"," Easily an A......
","Sorry for a very corny joke in the beginning, but lets get to the review now. So I watched this movie last night with my girlfriend thinking there is no way in hell I am going to like this chick flick, but I indulged myself. I have to say I loved this movie. This was a movie of laughs and also made me feel bad for Olive. She was just so lovable I mean come on who doesn't love sassy teen Emma Stone. This movie has many ups and downs like when Olive first makes that mistake of telling her friend that she slept with a guy George (not real by the way). You and everyone watching the movie will know from the moment she says those things that something bad s gonna happen. Emma's Performance in this movie was spectacular. She carried the movie with a lot of the other great cast members. It showed that in order to make a teen coming of age movie you don't have to make a sappy love story just make something different and funny. All in all if you are looking at this review in order to get a beat on whether to watch this or not my recommendation is a definite almost 100 % yes."
"damittaja","9","1","1","26 October 2013"," Wonderful entertainment
","I really loved the movie. Usually the comedy/romance movies my wife picks are boring so I didn't really have high expectations for this one either. Was I surprised.<br/><br/>The plot - while it stretches plausibility a bit (but don't nearly all great stories do that?) - is wonderful. It takes the topic of fast paced rumor mongering and twists it into an entertaining story. The movie is clearly quite cheerful so naturally from that follows that the plot is quite predictable. However, even if you can guess what probably will happen next, the events are portrayed with such skill in acting and tempo of witty speech that they are still wonderful to witness.<br/><br/>Comedies are often bad because good comedy is hard to pull off. Fart jokes are for children etc. etc. The comedy in this movie is golden and pulled off with style. It's based on the question: what kind of situations might happen when you don't want to act like your peers expect or pressure you to? Technical details. The music score was good. Not epic like in some massive artistic films, but light, playful and rock-ish. Perfect match for this kind of movie with a rocking female heroine. Filming locations generic enough so that you can imagine them in your own hometown. Camera work was solid too.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I can very warmly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a modern comedy with a not-so-subtle romantic component. Also, it probably helps if you are under 35 of age (as the events transpire in high-school and I feel it would be a bit silly to watch a movie about school life when you can't really remember what your own school life was like). The movie left me with a very happy and silly feeling inside."

","The movie deals with the well-rehearsed topic of trying to fit in. Of course, the key message of the movie is that one's personal life is not supposed to be a competitive field. However, the way it deals with the key topic makes this film special. <br/><br/>I personally like that the lead character is someone that a lot of people can relate to, as opposed to being either a super-popular cheerleader or an ultra-dorky outsider.<br/><br/>The acting is good, although some characters are blown out of proportions. However, this is a usual flaw of teen movies and certainly not a major issue in this particular case.<br/><br/>The only downside, albeit slight, is that the movie does not really abound in comic scenes. This makes it somewhat forgettable, as a film either offers an intellectual challenge or stirs up emotions (sorrow or joy, either way) in order to be memorable. That is the sole reason why I give it a 9 as opposed to a clean 10."

"alexsupertramp123","10","1","1","28 June 2012"," Charmingly witty
","I came across this movie on a best comedies of given year list and was at first very doubtful that a teeny romantic-comedy would be to my liking. But after reading strong reviews here on IMDb, especially from people aged twenty or more who faced the same predicament and recommended it strongly for all ages, I gave it a shot. And I was richly rewarded.<br/><br/>The movie was not the hit-the-theaters once a month romantic comedy, that pretty much warms up the same ingredients every time anew - actually, it was only a comedy with a little romance involved. It was really refreshing to see a character (Olive) not mulling over her faith and passively reach some point of salvation at the end, but actively taking on her problems.<br/><br/>Easy A rest on two pillows - an incredibly good Emma Stone, and the enormously smart and witty dialogs. There hardly is one line of dialog I don't listen to with a little smile on my face. So praise to the writers.<br/><br/>Emma Stone single handedly carries this movie, with her seemingly effortless unburdened acting. This is not to say that the rest of the cast wasn't great, but even if it hadn't been, it would still have made a good movie. But the other good actors here did there work well, and gave Stone the space she needed. I especially enjoyed the family scenes and the interaction with the religious fanatics - also nice to see Fred Armisen have a little role.<br/><br/>The script itself is quite original and develops naturally and evenly paced. Not a single dull moment in there. Some developments might be a bit of a stretch, but it never feels contrived. But the best point about the script is, once again, the dialogs. I wish more screenwriters would appreciate the language as part of the artwork and not only as means of developing a story or the quest for a punchline. The only point that felt awkward was her adopted brother, who someone just hung loosely in there without having anything to say or do really. Guess he was there to portray the family some more and get two funny jokes about him being adopted in there.<br/><br/>This one is really a gem in between your scheme A romantic and stoner comedies.<br/><br/>(By the way, the movie she goes to see in the international cinema actually is Scarlett Letter in German)."

"TxMike","Null","1","1","11 January 2011"," Smart high school comedy with the talented Emma Stone.
","Emma Stone is Olive, student at North Ojai High School, just northwest of Los Angeles, where they grow lots of oranges. Although that is not germane to the story. By her own analysis, so far she has gone through high school without getting noticed. By anyone, not even the guidance counselor.<br/><br/>Then, one day just to shut up her best friend who persists on asking her about a date she never had (a pretend date to avoid have to spend a weekend with her friend's family) she tells her that he is a college guy and they slept together.<br/><br/>All of that was false but with twitter and instant messaging everyone at school got the news right away, after the conversation was overheard by staunch Christian girl Amanda Bynes as Marianne.<br/><br/>So suddenly, Olive's anonymity disappears, all the girls look at her with suspicion, and all the guys want to score with her. Instead of quelling all that right away, she sort of enjoys the attention and runs with it.<br/><br/>Thomas Haden Church is her favorite teacher, Mr. Griffith. They are reading and discussing ""The Scarlet Letter"" and Olive picks up on that theme, often wearing a scarlet 'A' on her chest. Patricia Clarkson is Olive's sort of crazy mom. Lisa Kudrow is the guidance counselor, Mrs. Griffith, and also wife of the Literature teacher. And they even dragged in old Malcolm McDowell as Principal Gibbons.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is really good, on the verge of becoming a star, perhaps the star Linsey Lohan would have become if she hadn't screwed up her life. And the writing is very smart. A nice entertaining movie overall. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Eventually Olive's 'reputation' got too far, and a classmate asked her out to actually pay her, with a $200 gift certificate, for sex. She dispatched him in the parking lot of the restaurant, spurning his advances, and was given a ride home by an old friend, now the school mascot. It turned out both of them had secret crushes on each other since the 8th grade, and now that things were cleared up with Olive's webcam broadcast, she and the boy were destined to be together."

"eragonbookfan","2","5","12","20 January 2015"," THIS film ended Amanda Bynes career! What is UP with Hollywood!???
","UGH! My blood was boiling... from beginning to end. Now, I like Emma Stone - she's smart, she's cool, she's likable, she's funny, and I think she's even got the strength to carry a film ALL by herself! And I think ""The Help"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" films are the best ones she's in. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't like ""Superbad"" for igniting her film career. ...But I HATE it when she gets stuck in a stupid, worthless steaming pile of Hollywood trash! Such as this - having to say all these things, having to DO all these things.<br/><br/>WHERE do I begin???????????<br/><br/>This is not worse of than most films, but this goes from stupid to DISGUSTINGLY INSULTING!<br/><br/>To recap a bit, this movie was on my ""to watch"" list for quite a while; I thought at first it seemed like an interesting film about ""better student training"" or about a ""big test"" or ""spelling bee contest"" coming up (hence the grade ""A"" reference.)<br/><br/>But NO! NOT AT ALL, ironically.<br/><br/>Talk about disappointing. Literally, 5 minutes in, I already started to hate it! I did not laugh ONCE! I was shaking my head & rolling my eyes with disgust. I couldn't WAIT for this movie to end - I couldn't even THINK straight while it was playing. Because it takes these rather classic Hollywood attempts of FAILED advantages of pure bias, lame-stream political-correctness, and liberal agendas on our brains. The Christian Bible-thumping hypocrites who are ""abnormal"" and everyone else is ""normal"", and the misunderstood gays, who're your enemies, who're your friends, eavesdropping, rumor-spreading, deceiving others, blasphemy, underage drinking, cursing, sex, swearing, alcoholism, etc... Trust me, EVERY one of those are misunderstood in real-life.<br/><br/>I guess the ""Christians"" we're decided to be the antagonists, because I guess the writers couldn't come up with a better villain; besides that, they are not even written well. All one- dimensional, stereotypical, and dumbfounding, it's all cringe-worthy, rather than funny. I guess it's just the thing nowadays who you can make fun of: Christians and southerners<br/><br/>Perhaps what saddens me most about this film is that when Olive goes looking for honest, Christian answers about sex, she can't find any. And so she settles for our culture's dangerously self-righteous take on this immensely important subject: It's my business and nobody else's.<br/><br/>If this movie was supposed to ""appeal"" to the types of people who think these inaccurate things, I suggest they go see some psychiatrist, or I even recommend one of my teachers, Kent Hovind, as a great guy to check out on his Science seminars! (Seriously go search him up - he's worth it.)<br/><br/>And WHO, in their right mind, would ever want to ""lie"" about sleeping around with people?????<br/><br/>Hey, I myself am a Christian, and I wish to eventually get a career of acting in Hollywood because I do believe some great example & lights are necessary to be shown in that corrupted system of darkness. I love gay people, but I believe homosexuality is a sin - because it's a violation of design. People are never ""born"" gay - it's all based on experience. (but that's another long story). Just love the sinner, hate the sin.<br/><br/>And I hate how they turned Amanda Bynes, a funny, talented, lovely Jewish actress, one of my favorite actresses (from ""Big Fat Liar & ""Robots"") into a ""stupid, air-headed, mean, annoying, judging, finger-pointing Christian"", putting blasphemous, un-Christ-like, unbiblical things in her mouth & personality, which I think seems quite hypocritical of this film being a ""hate speech"" film, and as well being a mean, annoying, judging, and finger-pointing FILM! I find it really pitiful that Amanda Bynes is ""most known"" for this film on IMDb - trust me, she's been in better movies.)<br/><br/>And I bet it's THIS film that sort of ENDED her film career, giving her a ""bad reputation"", and hardly appears in any more films and for getting in trouble with the police & having her mugshots taken. <br/><br/>Fantastic! Well-done, Will Gluck, for ruining a young actress' career.<br/><br/>(Hey, you want a film that portrays real TRUE Christians, being one myself, my strong recommendation is watch ""The Encounter"", ""To Save a Life"", or ""Facing the Giants"".) Those are some films that are SO MUCH much more accurate, meaningful, and truthful in their messages. lot In actuality, in an ideal good-will movie,, we'd be the good guy protagonist, or the stalwart sidekick of the main character. I'm honest. Trust me, in real-life, it's the CHRISTIANS who feel they're getting picked on, or mocked, or being mistreated. Go figure! (The creators of ""God's Not Dead"" understood that! And THAT's even a film that's misunderstood.)<br/><br/>And bringing Malcolm McDowell into the movie???? WHOA. That's quite risky business of wanting to likely draw attention to his most well-known film ""A Clockwork Orange"", literally one of the most awful, confusing, and corrupt flicks out there.<br/><br/>Even bringing in Stanley Tucci and Thomas Haden Church into this circus show! Stanley Tucci was better in ""The Terminal"" and even the 4th ""Transformers"" film! (Yes, I went there) And Church was even better in ""Heaven Is For Real"" - that's also another film based on reality that I recommend).<br/><br/>Literally one of the worst films I think ever made, and I'm GLAD I never watched it earlier, or ever saw it in a theater!<br/><br/>But to be fair, Church, Stone, and Tucci are the best parts in this mess.<br/><br/>As Amanda Bynes puts it, ""This is so stupid.""<br/><br/>My final grade I put on this film is a ""D -"", just 1 steps way from an ""F"".<br/><br/>3/10<br/><br/>PS: imo, Emma Stone looks better with blond hair. That's not a joke."
"yakketyak","Null","4","9","21 September 2010"," Thinks it is smarter than it is
","I'm surprised at the positive reviews for Easy A. I found it to be a very contrived film.<br/><br/>To start with, the main character (Olive) is a walking contradiction. Olive tells us in voice-over at the opening of the film that she is such a 'nobody' that Google Earth wouldn't be able to find her even if she was the size of a building. But right from the beginning Olive is so smart, sassy and totally self-possessed and self-confident that it's very hard to believe she was ever a 'nobody'. The whole premise of the film is based on the fact that Olive is tired of being a wallflower, but there is absolutely nothing about her that makes her seem inhibited or insecure - it does NOT seem like Olive fails to make an impact at the school.<br/><br/>I also found Olive to be a bit too clever for her own good. She reminded me of Juno, always ready with a clever quip or a witty remark. This steady stream of self-satisfied cleverness is quite annoying after a while, especially coming from the mouth of a (supposed) high school girl.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point. Most of the high school characters seem more like twenty-somethings than teenagers. Emma Stone - she's 22. Amanda Bynes? 24. I mean, I can see why they cast Emma Stone, she's very good in the role. But she did not look, talk or act like a high school student. Amanda Bynes was miscast as the bible-bashing Maryanne, she actually looked even older in the film than she is in reality.<br/><br/>So, for some reason the smart, perceptive Olive is best friends with a vacuous and obtuse character called Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka), which doesn't make a lot of sense. I didn't buy their relationship, which in turn made it difficult to buy the fact that Olive feels the need to tell Rhiannon that she had sex with some guy, when in fact she didn't. It's a problem, because this is the incident that kicks off the entire plot of the film, and I'm not convinced by it.<br/><br/>Then Olive starts to develop a reputation for sleeping with people in exchange for money (or gift cards), when in reality she is only letting people SAY she had sex with them. Of course it doesn't take long before this situation starts to get out of hand.<br/><br/>Then comes a very far-fetched scene. We are somehow expected to believe that a high school Guidance Counselor (Lisa Kudrow) would openly confess to a student (Olive) that she (the Guidance Counselor) had slept with a male student and given him chlamydia. This ridiculous scene was the turning point for me. I was willing to overlook a certain amount of implausibility, but this tipped the scale over to absurdity. OK, I get that the plot point raises the stakes for Olive because the male student tells everyone that it was Olive who gave him chlamydia, not the Guidance Counselor. But surely the filmmakers could have thought of a more convincing way for Olive to find out about the affair. I just don't believe that the Guidance Counselor would simply blurt it out - firstly, Olive is a student who the Guidance Counselor has only had one conversation with previously. And secondly, it's not in her interests to tell Olive about her affair with the male student! No-one else knows about it, what purpose could it possibly serve to tell Olive? If she'd just kept her mouth shut, the rumour that it was Olive who gave the male student chlamydia would have stuck, and there would have been no need for anyone to find out that the Guidance Counselor was involved in any way. Olive might have denied it, but so what? Nobody would have believed her! Wouldn't it have been much more believable if Olive had turned up at the office and OVERHEARD the male student talking to the Guidance Counselor about their affair and explaining that he had made Olive the scapegoat for his chlamydia? Simple! Another aspect of the film that really didn't work for me was Olive's romance (if you can call it that) with Todd. She hardly gave him a glance throughout the whole film, and she didn't seem to care about the effect her growing reputation as a slut might be having on Todd's opinion of her. If she had feelings for him it certainly wasn't obvious. It was marginally clearer that he had feelings for her, but as Olive herself asks, why did he wait until near the end of the film to ask her on a date? Todd's response is a total cop-out: ""I haven't over-analyzed it... like you're about to do"". He's basically saying to the audience ""don't over-analyze this poorly written plot point"". Well that's not good enough! The writers should have got it right to begin with, without relying on the lenience of the audience! To be fair, there are some wonderful scenes with Olive and her family. The parents are brilliantly played by the amazing Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. These veteran screen actors imbue their characters with warmth and humour, and their very presence immediately raises the standard of the film. I really liked these scenes, they were well written, well acted and well directed, and the witty banter seemed much more convincing the context of a family that has probably been engaging in clever repartee since Olive was old enough to talk. There was a naturalness to these scenes that I found lacking in the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film, and while I admire Emma Stone and generally thought she did a good job with her character, I was disappointed with the film as a whole, mostly due to an unconvincing script which I believe could have been much better with a bit of refinement and some basic plot enhancements."

","This was an excellent and fun flick. I definitely recommend seeing this with your pals, with your sister or boyfriend (the first two more though, this is more of a teen chick-flick than anything else).

Still, it's a good one.<br/><br/>Emma Stone did FANTASTIC in this, I think if another actress had played her, this movie wouldn't have done half as well. She has a ton of potential to be in films like this AND (hopefully, since she'll be starring in the new Spiderman) serious ones.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast did well, although I would've liked it if Cam and Penn switched their characters, but that's just me :p Overall, an excellent feel-good Saturday night-y movie to see with your friends.

Maybe in the 80s. 5) Actors and actresses, I agree, were more like community college age than high school, and that was at times jarring. 6) Thomas Hayden Church was fun.<br/><br/>7) The Christian bashing was gratuitous... I can understand making a joke or two about Christians promoting abstinence, but the non-funny caricatures of over-emotional Jesus promoting, emotionally stunted Christian club went on and on and on. I don't know when it became ""open season"" to thoroughly bash a religious group like that, but it was over the top and unnecessary. Unlike the rest of the characters in the movie, the Christians are NOT actual fleshed out characters, despite the amount of screen time. They are tacked on, like the writer just had a personal agenda.<br/><br/>Despite the Christian baiting, which I pretty much tuned out halfway through the movie, and definitely marred it unnecessarily, I enjoyed the rest of it, and give it a 7."
"geniuskentyk-1","9","3","7","18 September 2010"," Easy A is Easily an A!
","In a world where the teenage-high school film genre is a worn out and tired formula, 'Easy A' shines by offering something new. It's funny, smart, witty, and never settles for the cliché. 'Easy A' is easily an A!<br/><br/>Emma Stone stars in her breakout role as the film's main character, Olive Penderghast. Olive, is apparently a ""nobody"" at East Ojai High School, and her best and only friend, Rhiannon (Aly Michalka), is obnoxiously foul-mouthed. At the start of the film Rhiannon invites Olive to her family's camping trip for the weekend. Olive lies and says she has plans that weekend, going on a date with a guy. Lying is the central aspect of 'Easy A.'<br/><br/>After the weekend, in which Olive did nothing but stay upstairs and listen nonstop to a song she hates (Pocketful of Sunshine), Rhiannon insistently asks for details about her ""date."" Olive ends up lying and saying she lost her virginity over the weekend. However, a problem quickly arises when the school's extremely religious Christian classmate, Marianne (Amanda Bynes), overhears Olive admitting she lost her virginity. Soon enough the entire school learns of Olive's lost virginity. Olive may have been ""invisible"" before, but now all the attention's on her.<br/><br/>Olive hasn't told anyone the truth yet, but when she's in detention (for calling a fellow Christian extremist a bad, bad word) she ends up revealing the truth to a fellow detention-mate, Brandon, who is gay and gets bullied for it every day. When Brandon asks Olive to fake having sex with him, she initially rejects his proposal. However, the nice and helpful girl that she is, Olive agrees to the plan to help end Brandon's bullying. The two enact their plan at a party, where there are sure to be many witnesses, and soon enough everyone believes and falls for the plan. Days later, more and more guys, mostly the ""nerdy"" or ""loser"" types, pay Olive to pretend they did a variety of things with her in order to raise their high school social-status. Olive is now opened for business.<br/><br/>See, Olive's problem isn't that she's a pathological liar or anything. Olive just wants to help people who are down in the dumps. She downgrades her reputation to improve others'. Throughout all this trampy and trashy mess, we still like Olive because Emma Stone's portrayal of her is charming and confident. Emma Stone has also starred in 'Superbad' and 'Zombieland.' I've only seen 'Zombieland,' but she was great in that, too.<br/><br/>'Easy A' boasts a strong ensemble cast that includes a variety of hilariously memorable characters. Olive's parents are some of the many highlights in the film, hilariously portrayed by Stanley Tucci (The Lovely Bones) and Patricia Clarkson (Shutter Island). Olive's parents are the parents that every teenager wished they had. They're carefree, yet at the same time supportive and trustful of their children. Olive's favorite and likable teacher, Mr. Griffith, is portrayed by Thomas Haden Church (George of the Jungle, Spider-Man 3, Imagine That), and his wife is memorably portrayed by Lisa Kudrow (Friends). Kudrow may seem like just another funny character thrown into the mix, but she's actually more important to the film as it goes on.<br/><br/>The film may have one big conflict, which is Olive's lies and downgrading reputation, but this one conflict soon causes many more problems for her. She loses old friends and new friends. Many guys have payed Olive to pretend to do many things with her, but not one guy has asked her out on a real date, and she wonders why. Another problem arises that concerns Marianne's also extremely Christian boyfriend (Cam Gigandet), and it's a pretty shocking one and will surely catch you off- guard.<br/><br/>'Easy A' is never clichéd, not even with it's romantic side. There's a guy (portrayed by Penn Badgley from The Stepfather) Olive has had a crush on for years, and there's a part in the film where they seem to be closer and their relationship seems to escalate. How come, of all the guys at her school, the one boy Olive likes doesn't believe all the rumors? The guy's reasoning and explanation for this is a good one, and it makes sense because it ties into something Olive indistinctly mentioned to us early on in the film.<br/><br/>Six years ago we were given 'Mean Girls', which offered something new to the teenage-high school-comedy genre. 'Mean Girls' was hilarious and clever, and 'Easy A' is pretty much in the same league as it. This is the first film I've seen by director Will Gluck, who also directed 2009′s 'Fired Up!'. Gluck's next film, 'Friends with Benefits,' is to be released next year, and once again features Emma Stone and Patricia Clarkson, as well as Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis (That 70′s Show), and Woody Harrelson (Zombieland, Seven Pounds).<br/><br/>PS: 'Mean Girls' is one of the most quotable films ever. 'Easy A' is probably just as funny, and also has some quotable lines, though not as much as 'Mean Girls.'<br/><br/>PSS: 'Easy A' features cameos that include: Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange), Lalaine (Lizzie McGuire), and Fred Armisen (Saturday Night Live).<br/><br/>PSSS: If you don't believe me that 'Easy A' is an amazing comedy film, or with my friends, here's some extra commentary: Justin Timberlake – ""Wanna see a movie that's great??? Go see Easy A tonight!!! E. Stone rocks in it. 'Nuff said"" Taylor Swift – ""Just saw Easy A. Easily, definitely, absolutely my new favorite movie."""

","I LOVED this movie! I usually don't watch these types of movies, but I'm so glad I watched this one! Emma Stone is an amazing young actress who is going places. I loved her as ""Gwen"" in Spider-Man and I loved her here. So talented!<br/><br/>And the rest of the cast was familiar to me and great at playing their roles. Like Amanda Bynes is another great actress whom I wanted to mention. I saw her in ""Sydney White"" and this character is so different from the one she's playing now. Amazing job!!! The plot and the directing is amazing. Hopefully I will see more movies with the same cast and director soon. <br/><br/>The songs used in this movie were out of this world good. I knew almost all of them and couldn't help singing along at times. Big round of applause for the music director. Honestly this movie was amazing! Anyone who says different does not have a sense of humor!"
"ligonlaw","9","2","4","11 January 2011"," She Makes You Forget Lindsey Lohan
","When I rented this movie, I had seen Emma Stone on Letterman and had heard her name bouncing around, but had never seen her in anything.<br/><br/>She is Lindsey Lohan's worst nightmare. In Easy A, Ms. Stone plays the type of character, Ms. Lohan played in Mean Girls. The territory is the hostile world of high school. High school is a distant memory for me, and much has changed since I finished. There have been too many movies about high school for my taste, but each generation gets to mark their moment. Ms. Stone, in certain frames, bears a striking resemblance to Ms. Lohan. She is a younger, talented, less-troubled actress who can really carry the big screen.<br/><br/>In her appearance on Letterman, they ran a trailer of the movie which charmed me. Ms. Stone's character receives a birthday card which, when opened, plays ""Pocketful of Sunshine."" She slaps it shut and mutters: ""Worst song ever!"" Over the weekend, she opens the card again and again, singing and dancing to the tune. If that is her singing voice, Ms. Stone can sing. It is a very funny clip, but in that 60 seconds, she demonstrates a lot of range.<br/><br/>The script in this film is absolutely one of the best comedy scripts ever! The relationship between her father (played so well by Stanley Tucci) and her mother (played so well by Patricia Clarkson, who is always good) and their children is warm, loving and very witty.<br/><br/>This is a family which percolates wit and good humor. I would pay good money to have dinner and listen to them chatter about their day. Ms. Stone plays a high school student named Olive, who becomes the center of a storm of gossip about her alleged promiscuity. Her literature class happens to be reading Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter."" Olive decides to play Hester Prynne. She changes her clothing and sews the letter ""A"" on her bustier, flouncing around school as if she is exactly what they say she is.<br/><br/>Wonderful depiction of how gossip travels through modern technology. Her every move is discussed in text and cell phone calls. <br/><br/>Also excellent in this film is Thomas Hayden Church, who plays Mr. Griffith, her English teacher. His timing is perfect and his lines are perfect. <br/><br/>This is usually not my genre, but Easy A is so much better than the average high school drama. It is a smart comedy with a lot of strong performances. It should make some Top 10 Lists for 2010. Comedy does not get as much respect as drama at awards time, but the cast, the writers, directors, editors and cameramen deserve recognition. This is a good movie."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","4","22 December 2010"," Great teen comedy with an excellent performance by Emma Stone
","Easy A is a great teen comedy, up there with films like Mean Girls and Superbad. It has a witty screenplay, some great dialogue, and remains hilarious throughout. It has a great acts as well. Emma stone had recently charmed me in Zombieland and Superbad, and here she shows that she is a great lead. She can really act, giving a performance that is the biggest reason to watch this film. She is perhaps the best young star right now of her age. The rest of the cast is amazing as well. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are hilarious as her off-beat parents, and Lisa Kudrow is great as well in her limited performance. All in all, there is no reason to miss this film. It is rewatchable, entertaining, funny, and best of all, intelligent. Have I mentioned how great Stone is here?"
"paudie","7","2","4","19 November 2010"," Better than the average High School comedy
","This is an enjoyable comedy marked by excellent performances and a slightly dark take on at the problems of High School life.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is an unremarkable student who, by accident, gets the reputation for being a slut (She isn't). In some ways she is glad of the attention and plays along with the reputation. However this only leads to bigger problems.<br/><br/>I've liked Stone in films such as ""Zombieland"" and ""Superbad"" and here again she plays her smart and sarcastic character well so that we have sympathy for her, even though we may not agree with all her decisions. There good performances from Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow as teachers. However Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson almost steal the show as Stone's laid back parents. It looks like they had a ball playing their parts.<br/><br/>A small quibble is the casting of obviously twenty something actors such as Stone and Penn Badgley as High School students.<br/><br/>As expected there is a share of hugging and learning towards the end of the film but that is only to be expected in this genre. It is a well-written and acted comedy that doesn't shove its message at the viewer too hard."
"MovieManMenzel","8","2","4","19 September 2010"," ""Easy A"" gets an A for Awesome! Emma Stone is absolutely terrific!
","Olive (Emma Stone) is your typical high school outcast. She is smart, sarcastic, and smarter than your average student, which is why she is invisible in high school. One Friday, Olive's best friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) asks her to come away for a weekend with her and her parents. Olive respectfully declines because she states she has a date with a college freshman named George over the weekend. This isn't true mind you but just a little white lie because Olive finds Rhiannon's parents a little odd. When Monday rolls around, Rhiannon asks Olive about her date and keeps on asking her if she ""did it"" over the weekend. This is where the fun begins as Olive decides to tell yet another little white lie that turns her world upside down. Lots of laughs, fun, and 80 movie references ensue...<br/><br/>If John Hughes were still alive today, he would be happy to see someone create a feel good teenage comedy that really lives up to all of his 80s classics. That was my first thought when I walked out of the theater after seeing ""Easy A"" over this past weekend. The movie, which from the trailer I always wanted to see but was worried about. Teen comedies today are a dime a dozen and most of them are so bland and boring that they are usually forgettable the moment you leave the theater. ""Easy A"" is truly a breathe of fresh air when it comes to teenage comedies mainly because of its story and even more importantly its cast.<br/><br/>First off, the storyline in this film is fresh and fun. Some will say that this film is loosely based on ""The Scarlet Letter"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, which it can be seen as to be fair. ""Easy A"" uses ""The Scarlet Letter"" as a joke within the film because Olive is reading the novel in her class and is apparently acting out the role of Hester Prynne, who is the main character in the novel. Anyway if the story of an outcast faking losing her virginity in order to get noticed isn't funny enough, you take that plot and go a step further, which makes it even funnier. By the middle of the film, Olive has said to have slept with at least half of the school. This, of course, is wildly untrue but at the same time just reminds the audience of how silly and jaded high school really is and was. The story while silly and fun really says a lot about how a lot of people are selfish for their own personal gain and are also more worried about how others view them rather than how they view themselves.<br/><br/>Besides the storyline, the main reason this film works so well is because of Emma Stone, who proves here she has what it takes to hold a film. Emma Stone has always been a favorite of mine but this is the first time she has had a lead role. Stone is probably best known for her role in ""Zombieland,"" which she was good in but in ""Easy A"" she is just terrific. Stone isn't the typical Hollywood ""hottie"" because lets be honest she looks like your average girl. That's what makes Emma Stone so right for this role because its believable. Stone comes off as intelligent, sarcastic, and as someone who truly wants to be seen as something else. She is a natural in this role. I personally think Stone is a beautiful woman, not because of her body but because she carries herself with such an attractive personality and doesn't try to force sexiness upon the audience. She is just naturally a beautiful woman. I think in a few years from now, Stone will be looked upon as one of the best actresses in Hollywood. She really has a lot of talent and I can't wait to see her in future projects.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, they are all noteworthy as well. Patrica Clarkson and Stanley Tucci are just hilarious as Olive's parents. The playful yet loving relationship they had with Olive was refreshing and was much different than the completely controlling parents displayed in most teenage comedies. Both Clarkson and Tucci are terrific dramatic actors and it was nice seeing both of these talented actors play a silly and fun role for a change. Amanda Bynes plays Marianne, who is a religious nut job in the film. Her role in this film reminded me a lot of Mandy Moore's role in the film, ""Saved!"" I felt Bynes did a good job with the role but the entire time I kept wanting to see Mandy Moore play that role. I don't know why I guess when it comes to a crazy religious nut job Mandy Moore's face has been implanted in my brain. Thomas Haden Church is a nice addition to the cast. He plays his normal sarcastic guy role but in this film he actually isn't a douche-bag like he is in most of the other roles he plays. Even Lisa Kudrow, who I haven't seen in a film in years, does a good job with her small role.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Easy A"" is probably one of the better films of 2010 and that came as a complete surprise to me. Sure its not an Oscar worthy piece of film-making but it's a very funny and enjoyable film from start to finish. This is the second film from director Will Gluck, who really may have some staying power in Hollywood and has really won me over with this film. As I said above, Stone is perfectly cast in the film and holds the film together like a pro. She is the reason to watch the film. Add on the funny and uniquely told story and you have yourself a fun filled little movie that makes you happy as pie when you leave the theater."
"atlasmb","8","0","0","6 July 2020"," Fun, Especially If You Like John Hughes
","Easy A is based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"", but is an homage to the teen films of John Hughes. Director Will Gluck even uses clips from some of those films.<br/><br/>Emma Stone plays Olive, the Hester Prynne of Ojai North High School. She is blessed with a script that gives her character intelligence and insight, combined with a mastery of pop culture references. The result is an extremely funny lampoon of various institutions and social conventions.<br/><br/>Though Olive is the victim of social mores and social media, this comedy keeps things light, thanks to the prodigious charm of Ms. Stone. I might have to watch this film repeatedly to pick up all the references to other films and memes.<br/><br/>Among the other great performances is Patricia Clarkson's portrayal of Olive's mother. She lends a quirkiness that feels genuine and is not demeaning to an older generation.<br/><br/>If John Hughes can't grace us with more of his films, this is a welcome addition to the genre.<br/><br/>(This review is approved by Abe Froman. Never had one lesson!)"

"cgcastanedo-75966","8","0","0","13 April 2020"," "" El redentor sale crucificado""
","In the '80s director John Hughes impacted audiences with 2 movies that became ""cult"" for the teenage audience of that time: ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""The Breakfast Club""
Although some important films about this stage continued to be produced in subsequent decades, I must say that there was a time when the commercial product proliferated with excesses in language, alcohol, drugs, sex and without any dramatic content.
With his movie ""Easy A"", director Will Gluck pays tribute to John Hughes by telling a fun story that contains the interests and concerns of a large group of young students at a public high school in Ojai, California, in 2010.
Using an elaborate Bert V Royal script with very sharp dialogues, the director weaves a consistent plot in which his characters seem to be obsessed and with the firm purpose of building a false image of their true personality.
From this thesis, the director establishes a satirical comedy tone and gives free rein to pointing out the topics that concern him about our society: the games of loyalties and disloyalties as appropriate, friendships for interests, fidelities, betrayals: hypocrisy.
The film also shows how a small lie to support someone, can lead you towards a very problematic process for yourself and for third parties, reaching a point where amending mistakes and demonstrating the truth, will necessarily bring consequences and collateral damage.
Another very important aspect of the film ""Se Dice de Mi"" is the emergence of a great actress, who until now had only appeared in minor roles and here she forcefully demonstrates her limitless histrionic abilities, Emma Stone.
A very agile comedy full of references, scenes, cinematographic and literary that together with the thematic force, the measured direction, plus the impressive performance of Emma Stone make ""Easy A"" a key film and a benchmark in this genre.
Cast includes: Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Dan Byrd, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm Mcdowell"

","Although ""Rhiannon"" (Aly Michalka) is her best friend, a high school student by the name of ""Olive"" (Emma Stone) cannot stand the thought of going with her on a camping trip with Rhiannon's parents. So unable to think of any other excuse, Olive concocts a story about having a date with a college guy for that very weekend. Naturally, being a close friend, when Rhiannon returns she demands that Olive tell her everything about her date. This leads Olive to invent yet another story about losing her virginity in order to make it seem more appealing. This then creates a new problem as their conversation is overheard in the female restroom by a sanctimonious gossip named ""Marianne"" (Amanda Bynes) who then proceeds to tell everybody in the school. As a result, Olive quickly gets a reputation for being a promiscuous tramp which subsequently intrigues all of the guys-but infuriates all of the girls. Naturally, hormones being what they are, things take on a life of their own from that point on. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a cute comedy which started off reasonably well but then slowed down a bit before the end. Even so, I thought Emma Stone put in a pretty good performance overall and for that reason I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average."

","Emma Stone has been typecast as a nerdy high school/ college girl. If you have seen her in other movies, her character is the same in this one. Needless to say, she does it very well, so well in fact when she attempts to act sexy, it doesn't work, perhaps a sign that they had Lindsey Lohan in mind for the part. Emma doesn't want to go camping with her BFF's family so she lied about what she is doing that weekend and later lies that she had sex. (I loved the birthday card from the grandparents with $5.00 in it.) This falsehood is spread around school. Later a guy who is gay asks Emma to say she had sex with him so the kids won't pick on him. At a party, she pretends to have sex with him while nearly the entire student body is outside the door listening. Emma is shocked she now has the reputation as a ""skank."" This is a weak plot point that Ms. Stone makes real for us, as well as pretending to have sex for money with half the school. There is of course the Christian crowd who are more loud and obnoxious than in real life (I think), and Lisa Kudrow who did a lousy job as a guidance counselor, or maybe she wasn't good enough to save a plot with so many cartoon characters and plot implausibilities. The movie was laugh out loud funny and that was only because we did watch all those 80's movies. For those who liked this movie, especially the confrontation with the campus Christians, I recommend the movie ""Saved."" Growing up in the 60's we wanted girls who had sex in our school and didn't attempt to get them expelled. Is California really that ""uncool"" now?"

","I don't know why it is, but no matter how old I get I can still identify with high school teen movies. Maybe it's because I liked my childhood, but wish I'd done more in high school. Maybe it's because I never kissed the first girl I ever had a crush on. I guess I'll never know, but I always have a soft spot for these types of movies when they're well done, and this one is. Emma Stone stars as a high school senior with a heart of gold. She tells an innocent lie when pressured by her best friend, and from that her inability to say no gets her a reputation she does not deserve. It was a really fun, and funny movie. Maybe not really laugh out loud, but lots of reminiscing smiles. The cast is great all around, and the film is one you'll want to revisit after you've finished your John Hughes collection. Enjoy."

","1 March 2011. Reminiscent of the teen classic Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) in attitude, character, and voice-over, this teen comedy adds creative credit design with a little of a cinematic side trips of 500 Days of Summer (2009). But in this version, the audience gets to see how a Ferris might have been created from the lie of an Emma Stone. The script, however, seems to desperately focus on getting its laughs from exaggerated opposites (school mascot) and other over the top attempts for laughs that seem to break from the more fascinating authentic fantasy (as if more makes for is better). In some ways, it would have been intriguing if this movie had tried for serious teen drama instead in capturing the teen audience instead of skirting around the issue using comedy and exaggerating humor, almost making light of a real bullying issue.<br/><br/>By 12 minutes into the movie the one-liners are coming quick and fast, almost at an nauseating, unbelievable pace. Even the public school principal (Malcolm McDowell) is given dialogue most stuffily unreal and almost like a throwback to the 50s. The use of the word ""t"" later is also overdone and the word ""twit"" doesn't seem to even be a problem. What is even more scary, though, is the possibility that the dialogue, at least for the student might actually resonant with the audience (presumably of roughly the same chronologically the same age) may truly think and speak constantly this way in high school (it's been that long) in which case this movie might be more in tune and better than I can give it credit for). Could it be? Hopefully not. An even more challenging and pertinent question is whether the movie industry creates the culture of teen dialogue or only reflects it. Is the dialogue and speech being depicted in this movie portraying what teens really get into or is it getting teens into the depicted, really ""bad"" language and speech patterns? ""A boy in the room"" parent scene continues the overly, exaggerated, and over the top, unreal dialogue that supposedly captures and identifies with the younger generation but that really diminishes the more serious and believable aspects of this movie focusing on some real teen issues, taking the easy way out of having to develop a script that is finely nuanced with both appealing humor and drama. Shortly afterwards, in one of the movie's strongest scenes that starts out pretty lame, but then Brandon's plea becomes a rather emotionally captivating speech that connects to the real human condition, even though the somewhat forced, script device of using lies continues to teeter on unbelievability.<br/><br/>The fakeness of this movie is increased by the obviously impossible swimming pool scene in a house and teen partiers that could only be achieve in a larger, more urban/suburb upperclass venue of a movie, not the small town depicted in this movie. The bed room scene is also riddled with clichés and overtly ridiculous phases almost pandering to the audience, descending almost to raunchy humor. A more sophisticated sex scene that has nice undertones of humor occurs in THE COOLER with William C. Macy and Maria Bello having a loud romp.<br/><br/>Towards the middle of the movie, the more serious elements of the teen condition come into better clarity, balancing the more ridiculous performances to date as our prima dona becomes more aware of others than herself. The accompanying scenes though really maintain, though with less frantic effort, the pace of tolerable humor while only briefly skirting the ridiculous. tapping into a contemporary John Hughe's wannabee.<br/><br/>The counselor scene while perhaps intellectually revealing also is very suspect for its portrayal of guidance counselors especially just the immediately proceeding scene its very clear that the counselor was informed of that was really going on, just adding inconsistency the weaknesses of the script. Even when there's a great opportunity such as the post-counselor scene to really rise above the fluffy, pretentious pseudo-teen humor, the script-writer blows it and misses a truly bonding, relational, meaningful moment of opposite-contentious-bonding in a human way.<br/><br/>Past the midway point, the real conflict and sexual lies that create real tension finally come out and make for a much more revealing, valuable, and worthwhile, meaningful movie experience. Then with our heroine's real date, there is a severe underdevelopment of her date's character to this point so that the inter-character dynamics of almost every other similar movie genre is missing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the tone of this movie, the big dramatic moment is so disrupting to the overall movie's background mood that it's too radical a departure from unreal fantasy to harsh, dramatic movie drama. While the movie seems to settle down, the movie never really gets to go to the depth and intensity that the social issue that the movie raises because the movie never really takes its subject seriously enough but only uses it as a vehicle to appear sophisticated and ""cool."" What is remarkable about this movie is that it's not exactly obvious that the problem with this movie is the actors. It's remarkable perhaps is that this is a movie about a script that really doesn't do justice to the great actors in the movie, because despite the script, there is a sincere effort to make the best of it and sometimes it shows through."

Men just want to use her. Even her easy going parents are concerned about her.<br/><br/>Easy A is the epitome of efficient writing. If you are a budding screenwriter or want to make your own movies, just make a careful study of it. It even wears its influences on its sleeves. Everything referenced to in this film, it will come back to later. <br/><br/>As an example Olive is studying the book The Scarlet Letter at school. Well Olive gets branded as a harlot and she plays up to it by wearing even more revealing clothes with a big label A. Olive mentions 80s brat pack movies of John Hughes. At the end of the film there is a pointless song and dance number just like Ferris Bueller's Day Off. I did like the reference to Huckleberry Finn that would later come back like a boomerang.<br/><br/>Easy A is fresh and amusing with charming performances from the cast, especially Emma Stone. However it is not as clever as it thinks it is and the wheels fall off as the film goes along. For a start I find it hard to believe that Olive is the only high school student who has had sex!<br/><br/>Many of the characters are paper thin and one dimensional. There are lazy stereotypes of Christians but the worse is the one Indian high schooler who speaks with an Indian twang.<br/><br/>So Hollywood film studios cannot have a second generation character of Indian origin who was born and raised in America in this day and age?"

","There are so many great things about this movie that it's easy to rewatch it at least once or twice a year. A great tribute to the outstanding John Hughes movies from the 80s, Easy A has a great cast, soundtrack, and pretty decent storyline...
Despite the fact that in 2010 California a 17 year old having sex was earth shattering somehow. (And they could have definitely done without Lisa Kudrow and her goofy acting.)
All the small irks are overclouded by the great things it offers. Emma Stone was brilliant as a Gilmore Girl talking Olive with quite possibly the best movie parents in the world (Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci). 
High school is hard, no matter when, where, or why. The movie delivers the best advice that it will pass and finding a way to go through it is key."
"TheMovieDiorama","8","0","0","24 February 2018"," Easy A surprisingly felt rather relatable.
","In fact, I'm sure many of us could relate to a character in this film. Whether it be a school friendship you had or the constant rumour spreading that the story revolves around, it evoked a sense of teenage nostalgia. And it is with this relatability that the film becomes effective and emotionally engaging. Olive Penderghast happened to be in the midst of a rumour stating she lost her virginity, slowly but surely this rumour increases in volume and soon starts to reinvent herself as the school slut. Rather unconventional, however the focus on the power of rumours and how it can emotionally inflict damage to someone is apparent. Then embedding the prominence of social media and how one can utilise the medium of webcam shows to express their emotion felt very relevant and surprisingly refreshing. On the surface it seems like a normal ""high school teen flick"" where girls bicker and struggle to get the guy of their dreams, and some of those mundane plot devices are incorporated here. But what the typical teen flick lacks is memorable and likeable characters. Fortunately, a bountiful of prominent lively expressive characters fill the screen at all times. Emma Stone carried this whole film, her quirky eccentric traits were put to excellent use here as Olive. Her dialogue execution is always on point, her facial expressions are perfectly suited to the role. The inclusion of Lisa Kudrow is an automatic win, I just see Phoebe from 'Friends' and consistently makes me jump with joy. Olive's parents were so damn likeable and lovingly endearing that every time they showed up I instantly smiled. The hilarity of the modern script that is used is actually consistent, I laughed on multiple occasions. Direction was solid, pacing was excellent albeit too short. The best way to define Easy A would be to say it's a perfect film to watch when hungover (me currently right now), and for that it does its job. Ever so watchable and incredibly cheerful, would happily view this again. But kids...don't spread rumours..."

","This was the first leading performance from the actress, whose name became part of the infamous ""envelopegate"" Best Picture mistake at the Oscars, she deserved her awards for La La Land, and I looked forward to seeing her earliest big break, directed by Will Gluck (Friends with Benefits, Annie). Basically in Ojai, California, 17-year-old Olive Penderghast (Golden Globe nominated Emma Stone) lies to her best friend Rhiannon Abernathy (Aly Michalka) to get out of going on a camping trip with Rhiannon's parents, Olive tells her that she went on a date. In fact, Olive stays home to listen to Natasha Bedingfield's ""Pocketful of Sunshine"", a song played in a greeting card from her grandmother. The following Monday, Olive is pressed by Rhiannon about what happened on this unreal date, Olive lies that she lost her virginity to a guy from college. Prissy and strictly religious Christian student Marianne (Amanda Bynes) overhears their conversation, she gossips and Olive's lie spreads like wild fire, she it at first uncomfortable with the attention. Olive tells the truth to her friend Brandon (Dan Byrd), he explains that he is being bullied for being homosexual, he asks Olive to pretend to sleep with him, to be accepted by everyone as a ""straight stud"". Brandon convinces Olive to help her, behind a closed bedroom door they pretend to have sex at a party. Following a fight with Rhiannon, who calls her a ""dirty skank"", Olive finds the attention towards her increasing as flattering, so she embraces and counteracts her ""school tramp"" image. Olive wears more provocative clothes, stitching a red ""A"" to everything she wears, this is a reference to the novel The Scarlet Letter, it stands for ""adulteress"". Boys who usually have no luck with girls start to beg Olive to help them, to say that she had sex with them, to increase their popularity, she agrees, in exchange for gift cards for various stores, in turn increasing her reputation. But then things get worse, Marianne's boyfriend Micah (Cam Gigandet) contracts chlamydia from sleeping with school guidance counsellor Mrs. Griffith (Lisa Kudrow), Micah blames Olive, Mrs. Griffith asks Olive to cover up the affair, so she can keep her job and her reputation, Olive agrees. Rhiannon becomes part of Marianne's religious clique, they begin harassing Olive in order to get her to leave school. Olive has an ill-fated date with Anson (Jake Sandvig), who wants to pay her for sex, and not just pretend, then she starts to reconnect with school mascot and her old love interest ""Woodchuck"" Todd (Penn Badgley). Todd tells Olive that he does not believe any of the rumours about her, because he remembers the time when she lied for him when he was not ready for his first kiss years ago. Olive then begins to ask everyone she lied for to help her out by telling the truth, but Brandon and Micah have left town, and everyone else refuses, they enjoy their newfound popularity and don't want the truth to get out. Mrs. Griffith also refuses to tell the truth, Olive threatens to expose her affair, but Mrs. Griffith rebuffs her, saying no one will believe her. Out of spite, Olive tells the truth to Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church), he believes her and separates from his wife. After Olive talks openly about her situation to her parents, open-minded mother Rosemary (Patricia Clarkson) and equally supportive father Dill (Stanley Tucci), she comes up with a plan to get everything out in the open. Olive does a suggestive song and dance number at the school pep rally to get everyone's attention, and tells them to watch her via web cam, in fact she confesses what she has done, many are seen watching, including the various boys Olive helped. Olive texts Rhiannon, apologising for lying to her, she finishes her web broadcast, Todd is outside on a lawnmower telling her to come outside. Olive signs off the broadcast, saying she may lose her virginity to Todd, and proudly declares ""it's nobody's goddamn business"", Olive goes outside, she and Todd share a kiss and are seen riding off on the lawnmower. Also starring Malcolm McDowell as Principal Gibbons, Fred Armisen as Pastor, Morgan Rusler as Mr. Abernathy and Nikki Tyler-Flynn as Mrs. Abernathy. Stone has great charisma as the girl who is flattered by the attention she gains as the floozy of the school, it is a very simple story of how one lie about a non-existent fling can get blown out of proportion and add to up to amusingly increasing consequences, and it has a very witty script, a smart and fun teen comedy. Very good!"

","Yesterday after watching La La Land (for the 3rd time in my case) with some of my friends in the afternoon, I decided to look for some of old performances of Emma Stone, which in the end led me to this movie. So I fired up my TV along with Netflix, and I settled for a Friday midnight movie session, and here are my little thoughts: First, Emma Stone's performance is indescribably funny. Alright, honestly its Emma Stone's performance and her cuteness 😍 that made me really enjoy watching this film. From singing alone in her bedroom to strutting around in revealing clothing, her hilarious expressions, her comedic timing and the way she articulates her lines, makes this ""a worth 2 hours of your life"" film. Other than that, I liked the narratives, the humor, the minor plot twists, the location of the film on the nice little town of Ojai, and last and not least the movie soundtrack selection is Superb 👌 In the end this movie is pretty much what you'd expect from a teen comedy film, as the film covers the issues that is known to concern a typical teenager. Conclusion: I thought it would be a boring movie, like a lot of some teen comedies I watched in the past, but I'm actually impressed and i liked it a lot. For those who didn't watched this movie, give it a try.<br/><br/>I give it a Solid 7 out of 10<br/><br/>PS: And for those wondering what road is in the movie credits, here's the address: Fordyce Rd, Ojai"

","Great movie. Emma Stone as Olive is a likable character, full of sass, attitude and a sharp sense of humour. This makes her very easy to route for as the main protagonist. I really couldn't imagine anyone but Stone in the role....plus those beautiful eyes are just too hard not to fall for. Anyway.... The film is a modern take on The Scarlet Letter (with several references to early versions of the story throughout - just in case you missed the point) and brings the ideas of said story into the modern era, placing it slap bang in the middle of a high school, the perfect place to explore it's promiscuous tone. The film dabbles in themes from its '80s high school' predecessors and even throws in some neat satirical homages to boot. As Olive herself says: ""...no, no, John Hughes did not direct my life..."" and Will Gluck skirts around the clichés just enough to make Easy A unique amongst it's peers. I really enjoyed this film. Good writing, clever dialogue, solid cast and some genuinely funny moments. Also worth a mention are some wonderful turns from Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as Olive's parents. The whole family unit works a treat..and you can completely believe that they have brought up this sharply intelligent, independent girl."

","The movie's most endearing quality is the homage paid to Eighties movies, that moment when it all comes together as Olive dreams about being in her own John Hughes movie. Yes, I have fond memories of SAY ANYTHING's seminal boombox scene and CAN'T BUY ME LOVE in its entirety, and it was great to see them referenced. And people, that song, that haunting melody, I still get the shivers, all together now, Don't You Forget About Me...<br/><br/>Emma Stone is kind of EveryGirl in this movie, obviously adding to her appeal, obviously the new Lindsey Lohan of that time. And this movie has a strong MEAN GIRLS vibe. Must say, Amanda Bynes was pushing it, playing too young. Just checked, seems to have been her last movie. (not that that's what I wanted, I was just criticizing) Kudos to Stanley Tucci and the wonderful Patricia Clarkson and Stevie, the most popular on-screen dog with me besides Buck of MARRIED WITH CHILDREN. Not forgetting Thomas Hayden Church and Lisa Kudrow, although I have a hard time watching her here. The younger male cast doesn't exactly do it for me, that dude who played Brandon soon irritated me, and the other one, Penn Badgley or something like that, doesn't do much better. Ally Michalka good performance, and that girl who played Nina superfine and all too convincing in the part. Come on, Cam Gigandet as a wuss? Well, by some stretch of the imagination only.<br/><br/>Best line: Principal Malcolm McDowell's ""if I keep the girls off the pole and the boys off the pipe, I get a bonus.""<br/><br/>It's a total chick flick. I would not recommend it to guys at all. Me myself I go where the pretty actresses hang out and I gave Emma Stone a shot as (laugh uncontrollably now), in pics, she reminded me of Melinda Clarke in THE O.C. and NIKITA (okay, you can text Emma Stone that) but turns out not-so-much in the movie. But this is a chick flick with not even one inkling of aspiring to appeal to guys. Okay, I take that back, there's the burlesque leggy lingerie dance scene towards the end, but by then, most guys would have left the room. For this is a total, total chick flick that the vast majority of girls can relate to, but guys would think it's all just a silly storm in a teacup. That's if they hadn't run screaming out of the room at the mention of chlamydia... Like I said, chick flick."

","Olive Pendergast (Emma Stone) is a precocious, ordinary high school girl who wants to be popular and unintentionally tells her friend Rhiannon she had sex with a college guy named George. It's not true. Olive doesn't want to spend time with Rhiannon and her off- the-wall nudist parents and she invented a college boyfriend and with pressure from Rhi admits she lost her V-card to George. This throws the school in an uproar! The other students believe Olive is putting out but her favorite English teacher (Thomas Hadden Church) doesn't believe it. During the classroom study of the Nathaniel Hawthorne classic ""The Scarlet Letter"" Nina a judgmental girl insults Hester Prynne and Olive. Olive calls her a sexual name and gets send to the principal (Malcolm McDowell). She sees Brandon a gay friend who receives detention with Olive and they have to clean the school up as punishment. Brandon hit another student who gave him grief over his sexual preference. He and Olive talk about it. The next day, Brandon visits Olive and suggests they pretend to have sex at popular girl Melanie Bostick's house. Olive agrees to it and she and Brandon yell, scream, jump on the bed, and make other noises to make the crowd gathered outside the door think they have sex.<br/><br/>Pretty soon Olive is open for business as the school tramp and only pretending to do sex acts with unpopular boys. She comes on the radar of Nina's Jesus freak friend Marianne (Amanda Bynes) and Marianne wants to throw Olive out of the school for sex acts that are only pretend. Emma Stone is absolutely great as Olive and her eccentric parents played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are wonderfully understanding and supportive of their daughter. Lisa Kudrow is also great as the school guidance counselor married to Olive's teacher. The actor who was the evil James in ""Twilight"" is also very funny as Marianne's dumb as a bag of hammers boyfriend who is secretly seeing the guidance counselor and should be out of high school at the age of 22! This movie is highly recommended for a good laugh and I think Emma Stone's singing voice is very good!"

It won't be to everyone's taste due to the subject matter, but even then I don't think you can complain too much about the performance Stone gives in the lead. She's funny, she's sexy, she plays the role so well that you almost forgive the slightly questionable nature of what she's up to.<br/><br/>Lots of films try to imitate the great John Hughes's 80's comedies like 'Pretty in Pink' ('The Edge of Seventeen' I'm looking at you) but this film does a very good job of gently doffing the cap to them while being its own beast.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film far more than I thought I would, and Emma Stone's portrayal was a big part of that."

"conannz","7","0","0","28 May 2016"," Satire and breakout role for Emma Stone
","When this movie came out the posters and advertising misrepresented it as another dumb teen flick. In fact it is a star vehicle for Emma Stone to gently mock and satirise high school life. <br/><br/>I haven't seen Ferris Bueller's Day Off since it came out ( decades ago) but the one thing I remember about it was the lead character had confidence to spare. It is the same in this. Emma's character 'Olive"" narrates to the camera and tells an improbable story. But she inhabits the role with just the right tone.<br/><br/>As per usual what ruins Olive's reputation enhances the reputations of the misfit boys at the school. This is a very gentle poke at that double standard.<br/><br/>I doubt that losing ones reputation (at high school) has been a big deal since the 70's but who knows what a strange place US high schools might be. So the key plot element which has 'Olive' supposedly losing her virginity and how that changes peoples perceptions of her is a bit of a stretch. However if you buy that contrarian idea then you are in for a treat. <br/><br/>The best parts of the film are Emma Stone hamming it up for the camera - satirising the situation she finds herself in. There are some obvious film homage moments and a few somewhat distracting cameos from Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Haden Church, Lisa Kudrow and Fred Armisen. That is not to say that Tucci, Clarkson, Kudrow and Armisen are bad but they are could have all been replaced by cardboard cutouts and the central story would have still worked out. Of the 'adults"" Haden Church has the best lines.<br/><br/>If you liked this you would probably like 'Freaks & Geeks' where lead character Lindsay Weir explores some of the same territory. Mainly this film film will be remembered for Emma Stone eating the carpet in almost every one of her scenes. <br/><br/>One day if the ""Beyond Clueless"" writers update their documentary 'Easy A' would be a worthy addition."

","The best way to describe Easy A is calling it a wiseass high school retelling of The Scarlet Letter. That can also be a temperature gauge for someone to tell ahead of time if it'll be there thing, or not. I enjoyed it a lot, thanks to a funny as hell Emma Stone who doesn't leave out the vulnerability peeking through her guise as strong young woman. It's a little more relaxed in the content department than some of the bawdier stuff that she got her start in, but still contains sufficient amounts of raunch to please the comedy hounds. Stone also has a veritable army of seasoned pros backing her up, an element which helps her, however she's quite capable of carrying a film and does so as well. She plays Olive, a spitfire high school girl who finds herself in a funny yet unfortunate situation after her dunce of a friend starts a wildfire sexual rumor about her. Soon the whole school is talking about it, and she takes action in a bizarre move to fight fire with fire...of a certain kind. She boldly takes up the mantle of the school harlot, forever changing things in her quiet serengetti of suburban youth. It all spins wildly out of control, a common characteristic of adolescence, with poor Olive stuck right in the middle of the debacle, which sucks for her but is too funny not to enjoy. Stanley Tucci (""The Bucket List"") and Patricia Clarkson are darlings as her parents, Thomas Haden Church scores points as a deliberately hip and sympathetic literature teacher, and Lisa Kudrow that old flamingo, has fun as a dour guidance counselor. There's also work from Amanda Bynes as an unhinged religious nut, the perpetually wooden Cam Gigandet, Penn Badgley and a brief cameo from Malcolm McDowell as the world's most cynical high school principal. As a riff on The Scarlett letter it keeps theme alive, and as a teen comedy with a gaggle of adults trying to keep up with the youngsters, it's a charmer. Stone holds the proceedings together very well."

The casting is very well done and all the actors played there rolls exceptionally well making them feel real. it was like watching a movie that is believable and would happen in reality and not some made up story. It did a good job of showing how greedy some guys get and what they will do to get what they want.

","Olive is an ordinary Californian high school girl whose life is thrown into disarray after one little lie; wanting to get out of going camping with her best friend she claims to have a date with a college boy. Afterwards her friend wants all the juicy details; Olive says nothing happened but isn't believed. Getting bored of denying it she finally admits that she slept with the non-existent boy. That might have been the end of it but her confession was overheard by the school's resident bible-basher and soon everybody knows of her sinful ways. At first she rather enjoys the attention and even plays on it by letting people believe she also had sex with a boy who everybody thought was gay. Soon every boy who wants everybody to think he has been with a girl is paying her for the privilege of saying they'd slept with her. Inevitably things quickly get out of hand but by then getting anybody to believe the truth will be almost impossible especially when so many have benefited from the lies.<br/><br/>In many ways this feels like a classic '80s high school movie, which is of course deliberate; at one point our protagonist tells us how she wishes her life was like those portrayed in various films of that era. The story is enjoyable with plenty of laughs from start to finish. The way it is linking to the classic book 'The Scarlet Letter' which Olive's class just happen to be studying is well handled and fun as well as giving Olive an excuse to wear some interesting clothes complete with a large red 'A'. Emma Stone carries the film in the role of Olive; there is barely a moment when she isn't on screen. She does a great job keeping the situation believable and making her character the most sympathetic even though it was her 'little lies' that caused her problems. The rest of the cast is solid too; most notably Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson who play Olive's somewhat embarrassing, hippyish parents. The conclusion ending, where Olive finds actual romance, may be a little cliché but even this is handled well with a very deliberate nod to 'The Breakfast Club'. Overall I'd say that I enjoyed this a lot more than I expected and would definitely recommend it to anybody wanting a modern take on the classic teen movie."

","Easy A (2010): Dir: Will Gluck / Cast: Emma Stone, Amanda Bynes, Penn Badgley, Dan Byrd, Lisa Kudrow: Here is a teen comedy about taking the easy way out or taking advantage of others for personal gain. Emma Stone plays Olive, an ordinary unpopular girl who becomes popular after a string of rumours. Director Will Gluck is backed with intelligent comic writing that addresses its core issues as oppose to merely using it as a pedestal for dirty humour. Stone is dynamite in her first leading role and she captivates the entire film with wit, charm and a heavy dose of humour. Her tale isn't as straight forward as it seems. She informs viewers through web cam about wanting to help others while losing her virginity but in reality it was all a sham. She takes heat but also in unexpected places and comes out strong. Amanda Bynes goes against type playing a religious pusher who dislikes Olive. She is dating a much older student and will find both refuge and facts with her rival. Penn Badgley plays a school mascot who is forced from a blue devil to a woodchuck. He will obviously be Olive's dark knight but the role is total cardboard with the mascot reversal adding to the film's truthful yet somewhat off putting view of religion. Dan Byrd plays Olive's gay friend who approaches her after being bullied. He benefits from the phony sexual encounter and is left alone to pursue a Huck Finn fantasy. Lisa Kudrow plays a guidance counselor who is involved with a student and this ends up tagged to Stone. It addresses the pressure of sex and reputation while finding an easy target in A list writing.

Though Olive is of course the main character, I felt like every other character was very underdeveloped, we really only knew two things about every other person (i.e., her name is Rosemary, she's Olives mom), I certainly would have liked to see more character from Olives parents and her friend Rhiannon, who was probably the weakest part of the film as we were never made entirely sure how close they were as friends and she is practically written out of the film early on. This isn't a visually stunning film or one with an extremely interesting storyline, it all revolves around the portrayal of one particular character, and I think for that matter, Emma Stone hits it out of the park, she is both hilarious and very natural as Olive, it seemed like a very challenging role as she had to hold the entire movie together, but she did so with pure charisma, and I felt like there was a lot of her in that character. Though it may be forgetful, Easy A is still a fun and easy ninety minutes that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy. <br/><br/>A pupil lies to a friend about losing her virginity, but the rumour mill spreads this around school, earning her unwanted notoriety. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Emma Stones Worst Performance: Aly Michalka"

","Emma Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as Olive Penderghast it's one of the best characters and performances I've ever seen. I have watched this movie so many times and it's so charming, funny and upbeat. The whole story revolves around the old school rumour mill, and it starts churning when Olive tells a little white lie, which eventually lands her in some deep trouble at school as well as embroidering a red A on her chest, stating the fact she is slutting around putting it mildly. With an absolutely outstanding supporting cast, sunbaked cinematography, a top soundtrack and joyful tone that buzzes throughout Easy A is an all time favourite and my highest recommended movie."

The things that happened really exposes how the western, particularly American, youngster moral value has been severely distorted and even reversed. Yet this movie remains very fun entertainment because the comedy is very enjoyable and laughable. Typically this movie is one of those comedies where a lie gets added with more and more lies until it reaches the boiling point and exploded. But the comedy is indeed very entertaining that it set this movie apart. The acting overall is very good.

","I thought this film was absolutely hilarious. And I'm not just saying that because it has literary ties and 80s movies references sprinkled throughout.<br/><br/>Olive has a bad reputation, but it's not really true. She's trying to do the right thing, and like everything else, it's spun out of control. Instead of trying to be honest with people about her actions, Olive chooses to roll with her new image and go all Hester Prynne on High School. She looses sight of why she said what she did to start with and actually believes what people say about her.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is the excellent sarcastic nature and dialogue that it possesses. Olive is played by Emma Stone who has like the best attitude and sense of humor ever. If Olive were real everyone would want to be her best friend, rather than ostracize her. Her humor comes honestly, because her parents are like the coolest people ever. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are absolutely amazing as Olive's parents. Though the ""bad guy"" is really just Olive's reputation and rumor, Amanda Bynes plays the good Christian girl to perfection. Sometimes irony is the best form of comedy.<br/><br/>I like it.

"russel61","Null","0","0","9 December 2012"," Fitting in is not always an ""Easy A""
","A 2010 teen comedy about how little white lies can turn into rumors and rapidly spread briefly changing a young girl named Olive Penderghast 's (Emma Stone) life. Olive lies and says she has a date in order to avoid going on a camping trip with her best friend Rhiuannon Abernathy(Aly Michalka). When both girls return to school on Monday and Rhiuannon ask about the date Olive then tells another lie. The lies keep mounting and Olive begins to lie for others as well. The lies result others popularity improving and yet others getting hurt. When Olive realizes she is in too deep she tries to get those that she lied for to tell the truth and when that does not work she holds a web cast revealing the entire truth to the school population during a pep rally. The movie ""Mean Girls"" is another film that has a similar theme in the sense that teenage high school girls tell lies and spread rumors in order to fit in, gain popularity, or to have others believe they are someone different. When Olive begins embracing the role that she had created, she stitches an ""A"" on her clothes to represent adulterer. This is a motif seen throughout the entire film that can be tied back into the theme by showing how rumors spread through the populous can affect the individual's outlook on their own life. The scenes where Emma Stone's character Olive is continuously listening to ""Pocket full of Sunshine"" on the greeting card helps the viewer gain an understanding of who Olive really is through music. In conclusion, ""Easy A"" affectingly captures and recaps how the teen years are full of the painful anguish that is the balance act between trying to be ourselves and attempting to fit in. Emma Stone plays the role of Olive and portrays her with a spirit full of radiance which is not commonly seen in today's youth. She proceeds to drawl the viewer in even more by truly capturing the spirit of Olive whether she is showing the pain from hurting others or singing in the shower. This movie could be used as an example of what lengths an individual will go to just in order to fit in with everyone else."

","This movie is by and far the best teen movie in existence. Not only because it was cast beautifully, but because the writing is witty and intelligent and the characters are interesting. Not too much of any one thing and keeps you actually interested in the storyline and the characters themselves. Emma Stone is one of my new favourite actresses and this role was MADE for her. She is utterly adorable, but not in that way that teens are generally portrayed in film. She lets you believe that she could be her anonymous self, but instead of the typical ""nobody turns bimbo/mini-skirted/Prada'd/mean girl"" star of the teen comedy/drama, this movie offers a fresh and more genuine version of the heroine's transformation. She finds herself as she finds popularity and has a good grasp of what's really going on. The bottom line is that seventeen year olds aren't idiots, they are just lacking much in the way of real world experience... but they are so often given lame roles in movies like these. This one lets you believe she's seventeen, and she has to deal with all the normal high school crap, but in a far more believable fashion than usual. And with a fabulous script, all the characters come to life.<br/><br/>Olive's (Stone) character is largely supported by her great relationship with her eccentric but genius family. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson shine in their parental roles. Their report is a brilliantly modern and refreshing journey away from what has become such a common cliché of dysfunctional family dynamic that I think teens are starting to believe that they are supposed to act like idiots around their parents. My own teen years looked far more like Olive's than anything else I've seen, and Stone's character portrayal allows a teen to believe that it's actually OK to be intelligent and have a confidence level that is parallel to high school rather than dependent on it. Or defined by it. All in all, a great film for anyone, not just the teen genre."

","I'm disappointed in the critical nonchalance. This picture deserves enthusiasm. <br/><br/>Everyone is talking about Emma Stone's undeniable brilliance, but that isn't the only thing driving this movie toward multiple viewings. First of all, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson turn in giddy performances (as usual; Tucci is one of our best in Hollywood) that revel in Royal's insistent and repetitive script. They are the source of some of EASY A's funniest moments. Indeed, it is structured so that the first half is a LOLian misadventure and the second is a more solemn exploration of the truth it is trying to expose. The camera work is commendable, with several exciting tracking shots that swerve in and out of slow and fast motion. <br/><br/>Contempt for faith is becoming old. Films attempting to convert (or more commonly, dissuade) are insufferable. EASY A uses religion, but avoids that trap. The scene where Olive gives confession and no one is there to listen. The overzealous and hypocritical youngsters. Most of this is a nibble or gnaw on the state-of-affairs while still asserting that having values is possible -- even in a world like this one. <br/><br/>And here we arrive at the thesis. Does EASY A have one? The final line, ""It's none of your damn business"" is quite telling. It's some kind of a plea for kids to stop living in other people's worlds. With Facebook, Twitter, and blogs, we all think that our thoughts are Gospel and everyone needs to understand them. Even in movies like AVATAR, they inspire the thought that living in a world other than our own might somehow be better. EASY A urges people to be honest, be personable, and get off the computer sometimes. Is the film cruel? A bit. Is the film unsure of its own point? A bit. Is the film worth understanding for yourself? A bit. It is proof that Hollywood can periodically hit the mark, or get an A, by building a foundation of comedy without resorting to crudeness and leading (potentially impressionable) viewers to a valuable idea. I'm not saying that the film is a piece of art rivaling its great-grandmother, The Scarlet Letter, but it is the best adaption and it does relate the fundamental plea for compassion to a generation that (unfortunately) needs to laugh and see gaping cleavage to understand. <br/><br/>EASY A is a successful film. Emma Stone is young and raw, capable of great comedy and asking for the hesitant, sarcastic sympathy my generation responds to. There is a bright, relentless script and a slew of notable supporting performances. It was one of the best surprises in 2010, proof that you can still sprinkle vitamins into cereal like sugar.<br/><br/>82.1"

","A clean-cut high school student relies on the school's rumor mill to advance her social and financial standing.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I might settle down for a little romantic-comedy. If only, my state of mind if joyously in a different place. From the liking of the trailer, I somehow sat down and had some sort of 'expectation.' And what I got was more than what I wanted... Emma Stone, known for her beauty and pretty good acting skills has outdone herself. She plays her character as in all her films; vulnerable and intellectually smart. But the twist is, she uses a rumor to gain respect and some sort of reputation. So she isn't the most popular girl... The film has some great humor. I suspected some meh humor that'll wear away but Easy A's humor will really get inside you. It's smart but not too smart. It's dumb but not too dumb. Some scenes will give you warmheartedness and joyous fun, and some are forgettable... The film also packs in a great message for us. At the end, the film gets a lot more smarter and sends the message for our minds to consume. Not only, it gives us some well- being for the future... At times, the film still has flaws; as any film will. Some are forgettable and seem to be purposeful but some will just hit you in the head, make you forget exactly what you were watching. Not to be alarmed though, these flaws don't knock the score down too much... Easy A is surprisingly a surprise. It combines everything I wanted, but didn't expect. So if your expecting something, get ready to receive. The movie surprise me with it's charm. If you don't expect ANYTHING, it's either a love it or hate it. I personally loved it but see people bashing on it. And if your not into these type of films, your out of luck. Maybe you will find something in it, but it is doubtful. Easy A... 7/10."

Yeah? well Easy A is a clear homage to John Hughes so we're in luck with this one. I think we are so used to mediocre teen comedies that this came along and bit us in the backside. For starters it doesn't finish, thank god, with everyone being friends again and high school suddenly being all OK; all that is left for beyond the end credits at least. No, Easy A finishes with a believable (on some level) resolution, you do have a very clichéd look at high school with the fast spread of rumours and the different cliques but you do need some of that narrative for it to actually work inside its genre. Good work this, I recommend."
"tomgillespie2002","7","0","0","29 October 2011"," Shows that the teen comedy still has life in it, with a star-making turn by Emma Stone
","Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) is a confident and highly intelligent girl that is doing well at school until she lies to her best friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) to get out of a camping trip. Rhiannon presses her for details and Olive ends up telling her that she and her made-up boyfriend had sex. They are overheard by the school religious freak Marianna (Amanda Byrnes), who spreads the gossip around like wildfire. Olive is then approached by her old friend Brandon (Dan Byrd), a boy who is being bullied because he is gay. He asks her if she will pretend to have sex with him in order to convince others that he is straight, to which she reluctantly agrees. Soon Olive is making money from desperate boys wanting to be known for having sex with her, at the cost of her reputation.<br/><br/>It's rare that teen comedies actually get the formula right, especially in the last ten years or so. There was a boom back in the late 1990's, started by the hugely successful American Pie (1999), which lasted a good ten years and is still a successful marketplace. If Easy A shares any similarities to any of the teen comedies of recent years, then it's the Tina Fey-scripted Mean Girls (2004), which was a smart and very funny story of high school rivalry and bitchiness. Yet Easy A shares it's true roots with a different era of teen films - the 1980's. Director Will Gluck's favourite film is Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), and the love and homages are plain to see. Olive even fantasises about her life being like a John Hughes movie.<br/><br/>Like Mean Girls, the screenplay is fantastic, and has a talent in Emma Stone to chew on the lines (I'll get to her later). Not only is the script very smart and funny, it's also venomous. Scriptwriter Bert V. Royal has created a highly intelligent character in Olive that can spit back an insult as good as anybody. When studying The Scarlet Letter (of which the film is obviously based on) in English class, one of the religious freaks who is disgusted by the rumours states her disapproval for the lead character in the book, before turning to Olive and saying 'perhaps you should embroider a red A on your wardrobe, you abominable tramp,' to which Olive replies 'maybe you should get a wardrobe, you abominable t**t!'. Shocking, vicious, and very funny.<br/><br/>But the film's masterstroke is Emma Stone. While it's hard to believe that she blends into the background (as she describes at the beginning of the film - I mean, come on, she's gorgeous), she gives a performance full of swagger and confidence. Husky-voiced and super-smart, she gives Olive - who in somebody else's hands might quickly become unsympathetic or annoying - a likability and vulnerability that makes her wholly endearing. Her talent was always obvious from her supporting roles in Superbad (2007) and Zombieland (2009), but this will surely catapult her to wholly deserved stardom.<br/><br/>If there's complaints to be made about the film, then some of the clever-clever quips and the interactions with her rather annoying parents (played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson) can be cloying, and the film does rather run out of steam near to the end. But the film remains enjoyable, charming and genuinely funny. And it's a strong reminder that the teen comedy still has life in it, given a decent script and a bit of heart.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

It's not by any means a cinematic creation of importance - some good performances and a witty intelligent script but not much in terms of craftsmanship - but it's solid entertainment and it may be an effective generation-bridge between parents who were teenagers in the 80's and their own teenage children, one that's not nearly as embarrassing for inter-generation watch as most recent teenage rom-coms are."

Kind of reminds me of what the main stream media has become today except they take lies and spin it into ""Truly Re-Written"" History. The difference is this story is funny where what the media does has become sadly distorted and out of touch with reality.<br/><br/>Thomas Hayden Church (antone remember the sitcom Wings?) is the English Teacher who is teaching the class ""The Scarlett Letter"" in class. Emma Stones character literally becomes a modern day Hester even to the point of putting the letter A on her clothes. If you take this story seriously, which is not the intent, it teaches how cruel human beings still are.<br/><br/>Emma lies to her girlfriend about her first physical male encounter with an imaginary friend named George. The girlfriend is a busy body who takes the story and spins it into reality. Soon we have a modern day Hester who is completely innocent but her reputation is trashed.<br/><br/>From here there are a lot of amusing things that get done by people to take advantage of the rumors, sometimes with hilarious results.

Olive provides the right service for those desperate males whose social status benefits from a few (false) rumors about having had sex with a girl. <br/><br/>In exchange, Olive asks for a few gift cards to have her favorite shops. But while providing a service that has obvious demand, Olive learns that her peers aren't exactly flush with money, hence the profit margins are slim.

Sure, sleeping around will get you noticed, but as a rule, people in that age are far too concerned with their own problems to actually care anymore. Even if you're a group of over-the-top stuck-up Christians, whom seem to populate TV and cinema high schools these days,<br/><br/>While Easy A has to work hard to make its premise credible, there is no doubt the film isn't funny, thanks to its smart script and a performance by Emma Stone that won't be left unnoticed.

Repeating, the movie has tons of entertainment its well made and well paced and the screenplay is funny. I think the Ending of the movie is COMMON. It could have been better or different. We have seen movies end like this. Other than that Easy A is really Easy A IMO."

","It is a really nice movie for young people. It has many compulsory- elements which should be in this kind of movie. For example an huge high school party at some geek's home with colorful drinking cups, an entertainment show in the gym with school mascots, a scene in the headmaster's office, one really cool teacher etc. What I mean is that, you kinda know what you get, but it's awesome. I thought the humour wasn't lame. It was truly funny. I enjoyed the movie pretty much. Can't see any reason why you can't do the same.<br/><br/>I gotta tell you, I love Emma Stone. I liked her personality and her sense of humour. It seemed like she didn't act. Like she is exactly like Olive in real life too. Easily amazing performance."
"DarthVoorhees","7","0","0","24 April 2011"," Emma Stone gives a great performance but the film doesn't quite understand adolescence
","I loved Emma Stone in this film. She is quirky, smart, and sexy as Olive a genuinely very well written character. It really goes to show you that a great performance can make a film because I think 'Easy A' fails at really capturing the spirits behind the teenage comedy. The film works because of Stone and not really the direction.<br/><br/>I'll say this about this scenario, it's very clever. Being a teenager is a miserable experience made all the worse by this facebook generation. 'Easy A' sort of plays with that but really this story is a classic that needs little spinning. It's a story people live and maybe that's why I identified with Olive. The problem with the film is that despite a great deal of wit and truth behind the story it still doesn't feel real. We see this as a Hollywood copy of adolescence and it can't really be close to the real McCoy. Why? Well mainly because the whole scale of this story seems way too large and despite a great cast we see a lot of them as stars and not organic human beings. This story about the venom of rumors might feel more organic if the scale wasn't so large. You don't advertise backstabbing and this film has characters that aren't subtle about their plans.<br/><br/>I think something has to be said about the cast and even Stone. I want a teen comedy that doesn't feel populated by beautiful people. Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Hayden Chruch, Amanda Bynes, Lisa Kudrow and even Stone are all beautiful people. Adolosenance is about the lack of beauty and the constant fear that you will never attain beauty. I kept saying to myself wouldn't this movie be more compelling if Olive was played by a bland looking girl or an overweight girl? Wouldn't it have so much more of an impact? Don't get me wrong I like Stone a great deal but she is beautiful and sticks out as such. It's hard to believe her as the social misfit.<br/><br/>That being said her performance is strong. I merely reject the idea behind it. She is very funny and has great spunk in the role. We gravitate to this Olive character because of her desire to be in control. I love Olive's sarcastic and yet very compelling way of speaking which is really a highlight from Stone. I think though that what makes this performance interesting is that this character is fully rounded and goes on a journey. Stone brings this character from one point to another and it is very compelling.<br/><br/>The other cast members are not as good as Stone. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson each turn in the worst performances of their careers as Olive's parents. These characters are horribly written and any chance of saving them depended on some sort of restraint from Clarkson and Tucci and they sadly indulge big time. These children would have been taken away from Child Protective Services a long time ago and I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>What is there to make about the Scarlet Letter? It's an interesting arch for the film but I think it kind of loses it's touch as a plot device but as a character device it's really special. I love seeing this smart girl Olive using literature to satisfy apes. If she's going to grime herself with filth she might as well do so with a little class."

","Well first I would like to congratulate the writers of this film. It's sociologically very well written and show no lies about relationship between teenagers.<br/><br/>It's interesting to see a movie that doesn't show that inexistent high school people with much older actors and stuff like that. ""Easy A"" gets to the many issues in society and mainly in youth in general. Guilt, reputation, need to acceptance, gossips, sex, envy, religion and the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is an ordinary actress, her character isn't that likable but isn't hateful. Amanda Bynes for once in her life gets out of the nice girl zone and becomes a spoiled girl alienated by religion, even thought it's clear to notice she's just jealous of Olive.<br/><br/>Good film, go see it!!"

","So i haven't done one of these in a really long time, but I just had to for this movie. Easy A is the most adorable and entertaining high school movie since Mean Girls. Everything about this movie is done to perfection. Emma Stone is as charming as ever. The Scarlet Letter based plot is effective. And the Juno-esque dialogues never fail to amuse.<br/><br/>Easy A starts off as an average teen comedy with the protagonist and the best friend along with the obnoxious antagonist. But what makes this movie different from all the other mediocre films is its intelligent narration and its fast-paced yet deliberate story-telling. And unlike other teen comedies, Easy A doesn't just throw vulgar and clichéd jokes at you and expect you to laugh. Instead it is presented in a subtle and ironic manner.<br/><br/>This film also contains many rich and relatable characters. To sum it all up, this is one of the best teen comedies of recent years.<br/><br/>9/10"

Easy A really has much more in common with 1987's Can't buy Me Love.<br/><br/>Emma Stone's dowdy Olive is impossibly adult-like for a high school student, and a white lie told in jest to a 'best friend' sets the ball rolling: soon every nerd in school wants to pay her for the illusion of a sexual encounter with her to raise their social standing. <br/><br/>Sufficed to say, after enjoying the attention for a while everything comes to a head after some adults become entwined in the drama; Olive sets the record straight with a video web-blog that every person in town seems to be watching. <br/><br/>All the familiar elements are there and the plot unfolds with some degree of deja-vu, yet it is fresh and watch-able enough to be enjoyable ... partly due to Emma Stone's undeniable charisma. <br/><br/>Amanda Bynes is a little over the top as an ultra-prudish Christian activist, and Olive's favourite teacher and her counselor are pretty underwhelming. Lisa Kudrow is under-utilised.<br/><br/>Dishonourable mention goes to Olive's saccharin parents; after a while watching them is like drinking a cup of coffee with four sugars - quite hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Its a fun teenage romp, just don't expect character development or too much depth."

","An obvious riff on The Scarlet Letter but watchable and fun. There are the obvious stereotype liberal California parents played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson with great style. They're not completely clueless but trust their daughter's common sense. There is an adopted younger black little brother whose presence is meant to reaffirm the parents liberal bent but nothing is done with his character. It's as if the writers figured they would get some ideas but never did. <br/><br/>Emma Stone is fine as Olive the modern day Hester Prynne but unlike Hester Olive wears her A, literally, as a virginal do-gooder throughout the film. She assists teenage boys in establishing a reputation as a stud while she trashes hers. There is the friend her turns on her (Alyson Michalka), the well meaning popular teacher (Thomas Haden Church) , the clueless principal (Malcolm McDowell) , and a traitorous guidance counselor (Lisa Kudrow). <br/><br/>A large number of allusions to contemporary culture are scattered throughout the film which add to the humor but in ten years few will recall the references. I enjoyed the references to the Demi Moore film The Scarlet Letter which only shared the title with Hawthorne's novel as everything else in the film sprang from the mind of some incompetent screenwriter. <br/><br/>I got some good laughs out of this film but was never sure who the intended audience was. It is certainly a typical teen film but also a bit more. I wouldn't go out of my way to find this film but its quite watchable and you won't feel you wasted and hour and a half by watching it."
"JohnRayPeterson","7","0","0","5 March 2011"," Easy going. Refreshing change from the high-school life theme/genre comedy
","For a high-school comedy genre movie it's better than most; in fact not bad. If you are looking for a movie with the classic high-school gags and romping or if you expect it, get ready for a surprise, not a really big surprise but one nonetheless. <br/><br/>I'm often suspicious of movies with narration by the key character; mostly my suspicions are not founded and the narrated movies turn out just right. Emma Stone delivers a very good narration throughout all the film; I presume she took on the narration part seriously because the movie simply would not have the spark it does without it. Sometimes it's as if she was in the same room telling only to me the background thoughts and at other points in the movie, it's as if she was on stage reciting the story. Mostly the narration lets us in on what the main character's thinking. <br/><br/>This is a light comedy with some class compared to other similarly themed movies. It's not a masterpiece but it is entertaining and does not make me feel stupid for having watched it. <br/><br/>The cast is made up of other fine actors I like such as my favourite couple Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. Stanley Tucci seems to play well with all his co-stars but Patricia Clarkson and him make a perfect on screen couple; she is in real life a good friend of Stanley. If you've seen the 2007 movie 'Blind Date' you understand and would agree. The cast includes also actors who you could not possibly ignore like Malcolm McDowell, Thomas Haden Church to name a few. <br/><br/>They bring the movie's quality up several notches as Stanley Tucci always does. Luckily, the dialogue has sufficient good parts to offset the ones that aren't as much and Emma Stone does an excellent job delivering her lines. Digging for a compromise one word recap I'd have to say it was cute. <br/><br/>If you hate this movie genre, and you are not alone, this movie can't be lumped with the ones that lead you to that judgement. If you simply don't care for the genre or if it leaves you indifferent, well watching it just might change that; it does not for me but give it a try. If you like the genre, watch all or most of the ones that come out, and if you can't get enough of them you may be disappointed because it's not for dumbasses. It's in the middle range of the movie lovers likes and dislikes. The 7.2 Rating at the time of this review reflects the people's appreciation; it seems a fair rating for me."

","Ahh, nothing like a bunch of 20-somethings portraying characters 5 to 10 years their junior. Get past that, though, and there's actually a pretty decent movie that emerges.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is very talented as she plays the role of a chronically sarcastic teen who unintentionally initiates a rumor that she lost her ""V-Card"" to a community college student. Stone's character Olive has no other choice but to embrace her new reputation. Predictably, things slowly begin to snow ball and soon she is accepting payments from classmates to start rumors that they also had sex with her. And, of course, she falls in love with the hottest guy in the school. They kiss. The End. In the middle, she loses her best friend, befriends her enemy, de-friends her enemy and gets involved in a STD scandal involving her favorite teacher and the guidance counselor.<br/><br/>In the beginning, Olive declares that this isn't your typical ""lost teen finds her way story (or something like),"" but in reality, it is. No, the script doesn't play out like most teen movies, which is probably why it's rated so high on IMBb. The problem is; it ended like most teen movies. The anonymous main character -- who always seems to be as beautiful as anyone else in the gigantic high school -- suffers through trials and tribulations, learns a few harsh lessons along the way, and yes, gets the guy in the end.<br/><br/>Easy A initially contained enough foul language to receive an ""R"" rating, but apparently was cut down to appease the target audience (see Trivia), and you can tell. I guess I don't watch many movies from this genre anymore, but Easy A was pretty vulgar for PG-13. I mean, the film's predominant theme is underage sex...and inappropriate teacher-student relationships...and underage drinking...and religion."

","""John Hughes didn't direct my life,"" notes Olive Pendergast, played by the classy, sassy Emma Stone (""Zombieland, ""Superbad"" and the upcoming Spider-Man reboot), who hates being a smart but socially invisible high school student in the scatter-shot funny and thoughtful coming-of-age comedy, ""Easy A"". It's true. Will Gluck (""Fired Up"", co-created the short-lived sitcom ""The Loop"") helmed the film, written by first-timer Bert V. Royal, and both men, with an talented cast, do a fun job paying homage to the late filmmaker while noting that reputation is everything, particularly your life.<br/><br/>Not wanting to admit she spent a weekend at home with her eccentric parents (Oscar nominees Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson) and listening/singing to a Natasha Bedinfield jam from a gift card from her nanna, Olive lies to her homegirl Rhiannon (Aly Michalka, ""Hellcats"") about losing her virginity to a community college student who doesn't exist.<br/><br/>The news, however, gets ""Paul Revered"", e-text style, by uber-Christian crusader Marianne Bryant (Amanda Bynes, ""What I Like About You"") through the high school, and Olive's equated to Hester Prynne, the protagonist of Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" (one of my favorite reads), a book Olive bothered to read as part of her English class.<br/><br/>At first, Olive's horrified by her new position, but decides to be a ""phony harlot"", dressing sexy (with the letter ""A"" on her wardrobe) and pretending to date the school's male underdogs (dorks, gays, fatsos,etc) for gift cards (!). That gets her, sadly, unwanted blame for infidelity, inappropriate attention and social exclusion.<br/><br/>Royal's script's so sharp, it oozes out humor, and Gluck keeps it on target, bowing at Hughes's shrine, while noting the presence of 21st century communication. Oddly and deservedly Golden Globe-nommed, Ms. Stone guarantees her career longevity in her smart tack performance, recalling Ellen Page from ""Juno"". Tucci and Clarkson are so sweetly idiosyncratic (a rarity in teen comedies of any cinematic era), you wish they were your folks! Penn Badgley (""Gossip Girl"") is relaxed and deep as Olive's long-time crush while being the school's basketball team's mascot (a woodchuck?!). Durable are Oscar-nommed Thomas Haden Church (""Sideways"", ""Smart People"") as an concerned English teacher and Malcolm McDowell (""A Clockwork Orange"") as a too-strict principal.<br/><br/>The surprises here are Bynes, who gonzo mocks her good girl rep, and Lisa Kudrow (""Friends"") as a morally dubious guidance counselor. Ojai, California, the film's setting, is warm and inviting, courtesy of d.p.

"estebangonzalez10","8","0","0","21 February 2011"," Emma Stone gets an A in her first lead role
","¨The rumors of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated.¨ I wasn't surprised as to how much I actually enjoyed this teen comedy because I had seen Emma Stone's work in the past. She was only a supporting character in Zombieland and Superbad, but she was great in both those films and her career looked promising. Easy A is her first lead role and she proved she can carry a film all on her own. Emma Stone has the right look for a movie star and at the same time has a natural wit that very few young actresses have. Her performance reminded me a little of Lindsay Lohan in Mean Girls (I just hope her career doesn't follow a similar fate). Stone is a much better actress and seems a lot smarter as well, but let's not forget that Lohan also started off with a promising career. Easy A is directed by Will Gluck, who actually had only directed one other relatively unknown movie before this (Fired Up). The screenplay was also written by another unknown writer in the film industry: Bert V. Royal (who had worked for TV in the Dave Chappell Show). I really enjoyed the script however, and felt it was written by someone with the comedic genius as Tina Fey for example. Easy A had everything good going for it: Emma Stone and a really funny and smart script. That's all you need for a comedy to work these days. Will Gluck pulled it off and delivered one of the best comedies of 2010 (even though there weren't very many good comedies this year).<br/><br/>Olive (Emma Stone) narrates via a video blog how she told her best friend a little white lie about losing her virginity, and how that small lie spread thanks to the High School rumors. The story is told by her and we see what she is saying through flashbacks. It all began when Olive told her best friend, Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) that she had a date with a college guy so she had an excuse not to go camping with her strange family. After not doing anything all weekend, Olive meets Rhiannon back at school and she asks how the date went. Rhi suspects that Olive had sex with this mysterious guy and insists so much that Olive simply lies so she won't bother her anymore. Marianne (Amanda Bynes), the religious freak in school, hears the conversation in the bathroom and begins spreading the rumor. All of a sudden Olive begins to be noticed by everyone at school and she kind of likes being the center of attention. That same day Olive is sent to detention and spends the afternoon with Brandon (Dan Byrd) who's also been detained. Brandon is constantly bullied on by his classmates due to the fact that he's gay. When Brandon learns from Olive that the rumor is a lie he comes up with the idea to lie about having sex with her in order for the students at school to stop believing he's gay. All of a sudden Olive's reputation as a skank begins to grow and she ends up finding herself lying about having relations with several of the students in order to help them out. Olive finds a parallel between herself and the character from The Scarlett Letter (Hester Prynne), the book they are studying in school with professor Griffith (Thomas Haden Church). Everyone seems to judge Olive based on the rumors, except Todd (Penn Badgley), the guy who she's always had a crush for.<br/><br/>Emma Stone proved she can have a lead role in Hollywood and does it well, but she also had a great cast to back her up. Stanley Tucci played her father and he's always funny in every scene he's in. He's just such a great actor that always makes any movie so much funnier when he's on screen. Patricia Clarkson is also hilarious in her role as Olive's mother. These are two of the most unconventional parents I've seen in a movie this year. They were great on screen together. Amanda Bynes was also good in her role as a religious freak who was constantly judging Olive. Thomas Haden Church is always funny in every movie that he appears in so Emma Stone had a great cast to work along with. She also counted with a great script (I loved the narration about the 80's movies and how she wished her life would be directed by John Hughes). The video blog journal also added to the comedy as we got to hear Olive's witty side notes about what was going on. I really didn't care too much for Cam Gigandet and Lisa Kudrow's characters. Their performances were off par with the rest of the cast. Neither of them get much screen time so they don't affect the movie at all. Easy A is easily one of the best comedies of the year. I really enjoyed it and thought Emma Stone was great in it along with the rest of the supporting cast. I wish they made more comedies like this one.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

"garyvanhorn","9","0","0","16 February 2011"," Fantastic high-school comedy that is both witty and insightful.
","Easy A reminds me of Mean Girls, Veronica Mars, and The Assassination of a High School President. It is a fun, witty high-school comedy with serious undertones that are very effectively conveyed without being preachy.<br/><br/>Olive (Emma Stone) is an ordinary high-school girl that just doesn't want to hang out with her best friend, Rhriannon, (Alyson Michalka) one weekend. In order to escape she fabricates a date for the weekend, then spends said weekend at home, doing all kinds of unexciting and unremarkable things. Upon returning to school she is relentlessly questioned by Rhriannon in the girl's bathroom about her weekend. In order to get Rhriannon off her back Olive makes up a sex-filled lie that is overheard by the school Jesus freak, Marianne (Amanda Bynes). Thus the rumor is born and spread at the speed of text and overnight Olive becomes the school slut, who also happens still be a virgin. As nobody will believe otherwise, Olive embraces her new image (at least on the surface, she never actually becomes anything remotely resembling a slut) and begins to wear provocative clothing emblazoned with a scarlet ""A"" in reference to The Scarlett Letter, which she is studying in her English class.<br/><br/>What follows is a very witty and entertaining tale about peer pressure, the power of rumors, self-confidence, individuality, love and self-sacrifice. The movie is funny throughout and the supporting cast includes Malcolm McDowell, Thomas Haden Church, and Stanley Tucci, all of whom are just as entertaining as Emma Stone herself. I very highly recommend this film and plan on buying a copy for myself when I have the opportunity to do so."

","Emma Stone continues rolling as a surefire outstanding actress with her vastly charismatic role as high school teen Olive in the gem flick ""Easy A"". Olive is the prototype perky, witty high school teen. Olive is a teen so she is entitled to make mistakes, and hers was lying to her best friend Rhiannon that she slept with a college boy. Olive spills the beans to Rhiannon in the high school female's potty room where the obnoxious, religious zealot Marianne is also at unknowingly to Olive and Rhiannon. Therefore, Marianne turns the gossip overdrive into high gear and before you could say ""I want some of that Olive Oil all over my body"", the entire student body thinks that Olive is a certifiable slut. There is more that transpires in ""Easy A"" than what was just explained or else it would have been an ""Easy D"". Particularly, the parts that Olive becomes a charity poster girl by helping out the geek and gay males of the school by pretending to sleep with them, so their bullying victimizations come to a cease fire. ""Easy A"" is a modern-day adaptation (high school style) to Nathaniel Hawthorne's literary classic ""The Scarlet Letter"". It was just our luck that Director Will Gluck did a phenomenal job in keeping the movie entertaining and engaging at all times. I especially loved how Gluck incorporated the 80's teen flicks homage into the narrative. That was pretty to think, and you could say anything about 80's movies, but don't you forget about how those 80's teen flicks made such a difference in the history of teen cinema. I was also royally impressed with Screenwriter Bert Royal's pretty nifty ""Easy A"" scribe; it was filled with zappy one-liners! The supporting ensemble of ""Easy A"" sure did aid to the film's success. The greats Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson were (how do you say it?) great as Olive's modern parents Dill & Rosemary. Tucci probably had the funniest lines of the film, and nailed each one of them. The very much underutilized Thomas Haden Church was steady as the cool teacher Mr. Griffiths. Lisa Kudrow guided herself quite effectively in her role as the guidance counselor with a secret, Mrs. Griffiths; and yes, relation to Mr. Griffiths. And also the young gossip guns of ""Easy A"" also held their own with their solid performances- Amanda Bynes as Marianne, Penn Badgley as Woodchuck Todd (Olive's crush), and Alyson Mychalka as Rhiannon. But the spotlight of ""Easy A"" has to be the marvel of Emma Stone. She not only made the grade, but just moved up the thespian scholarship ranks as one of the best young actresses working in movies today. ""Easy A"" deserves an easy A, its one of the best movies I have seen in the last two decades about the lives of high school students. So that was my report card of ""Easy A"", go grade this movie as soon as you can. ***** Excellent"
"Robert_duder","8","0","0","6 February 2011"," A clever, fun, risqué teen comedy. One of the better with great performances!!
","Easy A seems to have solidly placed its star Emma Stone into the Hollywood eye. And for good reason. Any one who is a fan of good solid funny, fun entertaining teen movies will absolutely love Easy A. Is it a chick flick? Yes definitely but anyone can enjoy the humour!! A solid cast of young hot up and comers (a few TV stars on hiatus I'm sure) but has a perfect mix of cheeky humour, sarcasm, physical comedy and mistaken undertones. Now all this doesn't equal a family friendly film. The lead characters are all in college and there is plenty of rough language and taboo talk to keep adult movie goers happy and laughing but with none of the stupid toilet humour of a Judd Apatow film (not that that type of humour is always a bad thing but it usually is.) This was writer Bert Royal's first entry into big time screenplay writing and he hits it out of the park. Cheeky wild humour will literally keep you laughing and sometimes its roll in the aisles funny. This is one of those occasions where a cast just works really well together and while I always pictured Emma Stone as being a little too geeky for this kind of movie she absolutely nails it and looks great doing it.<br/><br/>Emma Stone plays Olive, who just wants to get noticed and at the same time decides to conduct something of an experiment in woman's promiscuity. Stone is geeky and silly but has tons of heart and she will win you over with this film hence why she got so much notice for it including a bit of a surprising Golden Globe nomination. She won't be supporting characters any more I am certain. Penn Badgley of Gossip Girl is the guy next door that loves Olive. He is perfect for playing the guy next door but his character might be almost a little too understated. He's quiet and a little withdrawn and his chemistry with Stone is just a little awkward. I love Amanda Bynes. I think she was on the path to being a brilliant comedienne but somewhere she hit a hiccup. She does a decent job as the snooty, and uppity nemesis to Stone's Olive but I sort of expected more from her and missed seeing her in the lead role. Dan Byrd (Cougar Town fame) is really good as Olive's friend and first 'client' so to speak. He doesn't have a big role but he is great in the role he has. Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow have good supporting roles in the film as Professors. They both have some really funny scenes. Two of the best cameos in the film are by the hilarious Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson who play Olive's liberal parents. The dinner table scene with the three of them is absolutely hilarious and classic!! Alyson Michalka (Hellcats) is Olive's best friend and she does well playing the role she is given. I think her role is very stereotypical so they don't give her a lot of room to act.<br/><br/>The late teen, early twenty demographic that this is aimed at love Television. Especially those cult shows that adults wonder how they stay on the air...you know anything on the CW so it makes sense that they would haul in those young hot TV Stars. But they don't give them a lot instead leaving it up to Emma Stone and the cameos from bigger film stars. Director Will Gluck seems to be a popular choice for this class of film given his first movie was Fired Up! which I have yet to see. I have a feeling this film has a little more intelligence behind it. Regardless he clearly knows how to make the teen comedy flourish and he put together a solid cast and this wins its target audience clearly. Easy A is the absolutely perfect date movie and men won't cringe to sit through this because everyone will laugh and enjoy how silly it is. Check this one out and do yourself a favour!! 8/10"
"russel55","9","0","0","6 February 2011"," Easy A, a grade of A.
","The movie, Easy A was an incredibly good movie. The movie is about a young woman named Olive, who is pretty much unnoticeable to everyone in her whole school. She tells a lie to her friend in the girl's restroom, but she doesn't notice that there is another girl in one of the stalls. Well, the rumor gets spread throughout the entire school and all of a sudden, Olive (Emma Stone) is noticed by all. It just so happens that in her English class they are reading the book The Scarlet letter, which I'm wondering didn't help Olive come up with her idea to blow the entire rumor out of proportion. Anyways, Olive gets this reputation for being a whore, so she plays this role and boy does she play the role and play it well. Then it gets complicated when people who also are not known or are known for things that make their lives bad, convince Olive to ""say"" they did stuff to make the other people look better. For an example, a homosexual boy in Olive's class convinces Olive to help him by pretending to have intercourse with him at a very large party. People no longer thought he was gay because of Olive's lie. OK, no more examples now. The theme of the movie is pretty apparent, Olive told all these lies to help people and in the end it turns around to bite her in the rear. In the end she regrets her decision to play on the rumor that was spread about her. It is rather easy to feel for Olive and to relate with her and her reasoning. The movie has many familiar faces in it including Emma Stone as Olive, Amanda Bynes as Marianne, Lisa Kudrow as Mrs. Griffith and Patricia Clarkson as Olive's mother, Rosemary. The actors and actresses did a great job, making it easy to believe the plot and just the overall ride of watching the film. The movie features high key lighting with all the sets being rather bright, except of course for night shots. I noticed too that when Olive is faced with these dilemmas to help people, the camera tends to view only Olive and her face as she makes these decisions. One of my favorite parts is towards the end of the movie when Olive is sitting with her mother after everything unfolds, all you see is the stars and the calm night sky, but you hear Olive explaining everything to her mother, but you don't see either of them on the screen. In this moment looking at the stars you sense Olive's calmness. You can just sense that she has come up with a plan to make everything better, and you can sense her calmness, it's not so stressful in this point in the film. Another film I have seen that has a similar theme is that of the film The Outsiders. The two boys make a split decision and killed someone and it changed their entire lives. However after the regrettable act, they are given the opportunity to redeem themselves and they save a bunch of little kids in a fire. Similar to that is Olive who makes a decision to be labeled and then helps people and then it turns around to bite her in the butt. After watching the entire movie, though I was still left wondering why she would even go through all the trouble of making the rumor stick. She changed her entire wardrobe to fit the label she was given, she even went as far to put an 'A' on her shirts in reference to the book her English class was reading. Either way, it was a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone. The grade I would give this move would be an A."

","This was a hilarious movie. It parallels the classic novel The Scarlet Letter (which is being studied and brought up in the film and during the girl's class) and a teenager's life. Olive-the main character-lies to her friend about a weekend fling with a college guy. Unfortunately, the high school prude (who is a devout Christian) overhears her, and the rumor mills start cranking. Olive starts using this to her advantage to gain popularity with the boys, but things unfortunately get out of hand, and she learns how things can ruin your reputation-the hard way with a boy one night, and she tries to fix it. Fortunately, she has the right friend and family member. I love her podcasts and the scenes with Amanda Bynes. Lisa Kudrow's character was also good. I think this was a good movie, and it taught me a little bit about my life too. I really recommend it.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

Emma Stone is superb, full of life performance and special mention to stanley tucci and patricia clarkson for playing the coolest parents ever on screen.

"alifakmal","10","0","0","19 January 2011"," This movie really needs a sequel.
","Emma Stone has built a career for herself playing the pretty, smarter-than-average love interest in male-driven movies like Zombieland and Superbad, but the time has finally come for her to be a star on her own. Once you get past the faintly ludicrous conceit that Stone was ever an average-looking high school girl who nobody noticed, she handily carries every scene the whip-smart and deviously funny Easy A. Like Alicia Silverstone and Lindsay Lohan before her, Stone takes a teen comedy that was already pretty good on its own and elevates it to something that's almost transcendently fun.<br/><br/>Olive Penderghast is easily the coolest girl at East Ojai High School, even though she's unpopular enough that nobody would notice. She's got a great sense of humor and fashion sense, a rock-solid relationship with her equally awesome and hilarious parents (Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci), and is generous enough to do a pretty major favor for a gay friend constantly beat up by the school bullies. Olive agrees to pretend to have sex with him to boost his reputation, and once word gets around to the other nerds and closet cases at her school, Olive develops her own reputation as a grade-A slut. In a plot contrivance that's not entirely convincing, the formerly happy wallflower Olive takes her skank status as a badge of honor, tormenting the sanctimonious Christians at school and reaping gift cards in exchange for her imaginary flings with the desperate guys.<br/><br/>Though a girl like Olive probably ought to be able to see that this can't end well, it's too much fun to watch her exploits to quibble with things like reality. Working from Bert V. Royal's script that he tweaked significantly, director Will Gluck is playing excellently with third-wave feminism here. Olive uses her sexuality without shame, dressing up in revealing outfits and emblazoning a literal scarlet letter on her chest, but when she confesses that she's actually a virgin, there's no shame in that either. Easy A is refreshingly free of moralizing about both having sex and not having it, in the end concluding ""Sleep with who you want to sleep with, just keep it to yourself."" It's not the most revolutionary message, sure, but one absent from most teen movies that obsess over sex one way or another.<br/><br/>Even with its rock-solid comedic tone and barrage of perfect one-liners, Easy A's story gets a little too sprawling for its own good. Olive's budding romance with high school nice guy (Penn Badgley) plays out at a nice delicate pace, but subplots about her teacher and his estranged wife (Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow) plus a 22-year-old high school senior (Cam Gigandet) feel subbed in from a worse, less confident movie. It's also bizarre to see former teen comedian Amanda Bynes, with her endless tics and big eyes and strained delivery, share the frame with the relaxed and effortless Stone; Bynes, too, seems transplanted from a lesser teen comedy with none of Easy A's idiosyncratic verve.<br/><br/>It doesn't have as many quotable lines as Clueless, and just misses the whip-fast comedic pace of Mean Girls, but Easy A stands proudly alongside those two teen girl classics, and provides a cinematic snapshot of the current technology-fueled speed of the rumor mill, when something tweeted or texted is automatically true, even without a shred of evidence. Without leaning too heavily on its message and giving ample room for most of its stellar cast to shine, Easy A is zippy and clever and far more original than you thought a high school comedy could be again. and this movie needs to have a sequel. I wanna know what happened next!"
"hayleebooth","6","0","0","17 January 2011"," What I thought....
","In the movie ""Easy A"", I feel as though Emma Stone did not perform her best. Although the movie it self had various comical parts to it, it came off way to unrealistic to myself. Easy A, in my opinion had no point to it, it is just a movie to see if you have nothing better to do in other words. On another note, I did strongly like the way the director went about, ""the scarlet letter"" theme and how he intertwined it with the movie. Allowing the audience to be able to reflect on the plot from the scarlet letter. I agree with how the director went on with telling the audience a little about the reasoning behind Hester Prynne having to wear the letter ""A"", around the town. In other words, this helped the audience relate to the movie and compare it with another source, even if perhaps the viewers had no background knowledge about the scarlet letter. I feel this movie was alright, but did not really have a message to imply."

","I just recently watched this movie and, just like I had suspected, it was like every other teen movie out: predictable. From the beginning of the movie one could pretty much tell what was going to happen next. Aside from the plot, I felt the movie was very unrealistic. In high school when one loses their virginity it doesn't spread like wildfire like it did in the movie and not everyone makes such a big deal out of it. Let's be honest, a good number of kids, at least in my high school, were not virgins. Also, most people are not as judgmental as they are in the movie about having sex. Overall, Emma Stone did a wonderful job playing the role of Olive and the movie was decent."

"priyantha-bandara","8","0","0","4 January 2011"," Easy comedy
","Easy A is a crude comedy. Starts like a typical high school mellow drama where the teens live the modern life of connectivity while not being connected as such with each other. While being proudly rude to each other forming cults and spreading verbal viruses all over, it seems like the high school is functioning as it should be. But someone is unnoticed and she thinks that it has to end. So even though unwillingly she lies to her best friend about losing her virginity over a weekend date and that sure starts a rumor that spreads faster than wild fire. So then she becomes the talk of the school and ultimately for some time she starts to enjoy the attention she gets until things really starts to go south. Rumors, rumors and more rumors ultimately destroying her reputation, puts her under pressure to determine to get everything back to normal and find love with someone actually thinks she is special.<br/><br/>Easy A is fast phased. Characters are quickly introduced , dropped out of the plot without much introduction. But there is no such big trumpet welcomes needed too after all as the characters become familiar rapidly too as each of them have something special about them. So the cast is not a waste. Even the acting is OK. You can't expect Oscar winning performances in a college comedy duh.<br/><br/>The humor is subtle. But used appropriately in places where it suits. There is no huge camera movements or extraordinary cinematography, but I like the way the opening titles roll out. Easy A is a simply movie. No complicated plots or mind bending mysteries to solve etc etc. So just sit back and laugh away."

But then again, maybe she is not offering anything. And of course you could argue about her actions. But not everything has to make sense to be funny and enjoyed.

"Hellmant","8","0","0","29 December 2010"," A great throwback to the 80's when teen comedies ruled!
","'EASY A': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Emma Stone (of 'ZOMBIELAND' and 'SUPERBAD' fame) stars in this surprisingly well made teen film that's sort of an homage to the great ones, like those of John Hughes (which the film references several times). It's directed by Will Gluck (an experienced television writer / producer who also directed the awful 'FIRED UP!') and written by first time writer Bert V. Royal. The film co-stars Penn Badgley, Cam Gigandet, Alison Michalka and Amanda Bynes (in what was supposed to be her last role but she changed her mind and un-retired). It also has several older experienced stars in impressive supporting roles like Thomas Haden Church, Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Lisa Kudrow and Malcolm McDowell.<br/><br/>Stone stars as Olive, a good girl who feels almost completely unnoticed at school. That all changes when she's coerced into fibbing to her best friend Rhiannon (Michalka) about losing her virginity to a guy she made up. That's overheard by stuck-up Christian gossip queen Marianne (Bynes) who blabs it all around school. Although despised by many she likes the sudden attention. So when bullied gay classmate Brandon (Dan Byrd) asks her to do him a favor and help spread a false rumor that she slept with him she feels morally obligated to do so (which furthers the rumors about her). More outcasts come to Olive for help and with a little cash incentive as well as pity she keeps helping them. Her life begins to imitate that of the character in the book 'The Scarlet Letter' which she's reading in school and things quickly spiral out of control.<br/><br/>I didn't have any desire to see this movie after seeing the trailer and TV commercials, which sell it as a typical clichéd teen comedy, but after reading so many surprisingly positive reviews and witnessing it's equally impressive box-office earnings I felt compelled to do so (on video last week when it came out, through a dollar rental). I was surprised to learn all the hype is true; it is a surprisingly clever and entertaining teen comedy. The dialog is all witty, especially coming from the parents (Tucci and Clarkson, who play about the coolest parents ever depicted on screen) and Church (who plays one of the coolest teachers). The directing is effective and Stone's transition to leading lady is an impressive one as well (there's already a project re-teaming Stone with Gluck in the works). All of the supporting players are more than adequate, especially Bynes who makes a great bitchy religious nut. The film is funny, inspiring and a great throwback to the 80's (when teen comedies ruled).<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVckRO-OANw"
"dvc5159","6","0","0","25 December 2010"," Stone and Gluck make it work; this is the year's best comedy and the best teen film since the '80s.
","We've all been through high-school before. We've all faced this - angst, fitting in, etc. It becomes too worrying and too much discussed about in today's society that high-school angst has become somewhat of a cliché in modern media, be it books, music, and movies - due to the ever increasing number of teenagers reading/listening/watching these high- school stuff - they can relate to it.<br/><br/>Will Gluck's ""Easy A"" may very well be a great teen comedy - perhaps the best since John Hughes' teen classics from the '80s (that this film does so proudly pay homage to and reference as well), and with an injection of intelligence to boot. This is a rare comedy that not only makes you care and connect with the characters, it ironically defines the ""status quo"" and the rumor mill of high school and plays it for genuine laughs, and not just cheap stabs at it.<br/><br/>From a witty and razor-sharp script by Bert V. Royal (that manages to satirize every teen cliché past and present from dating to Facebook), director Will Gluck manages to balance perfect comedy timing, whip-smart dialogue and the actor's charming performances without overusing or overplaying the joke to the extent of gross exaggeration. Here, a little lie by ""unknown"" Olive that is mis-understandingly heard by other people and thus places her in the rumor mill of her high school, where her lie is spread like wildfire. Rather than trying to get rid of the rumor at first, Olive comes up with a strategy to get herself known to school and then bravely capitalizes and even expands the rumor to become the ""harlot"" of the school, so to speak. She even refers herself sometime to the main character Hester from the novel ""The Scarlet Letter"" to which this film is also largely influenced by, but done in a comedic way (the film also takes numerous jabs at the so- called disastrous Demi Moore/Gary Oldman film hilariously).<br/><br/>This is where teenage angst and the whole nine yards comes in and it's pretty true. If you don't have sex, you're a nobody. If you do have sex and you're a female, that automatically qualifies you as ""impure"", so to speak, by other people of the same age and slightly older. Royal also plays the rumor mill like a toy and he gleefully but not grossly exaggerates the spread of rumors like wildfire. Gluck uses this and with some light and fleet-footed direction he lively brings this the characters and story to a medium that can be enjoyed by anyone over the age of the suitable PG-13 rating, so as long as they're not strictly and overtly Christian, which this film also brilliantly satirizes very well. Yes, it is hilarious and smart, but at times it can become dramatic - and justifiably so - especially at the second half of the movie. You really feel for the character Olive that you wouldn't mind the comedic timing being off a bit. And there are a few clichés, but they are both played straight and cleverly referenced, well-woven together by Gluck that one wouldn't mind seeing there.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is a charming, adorable and talented young actress with perfect comedy timing and here she puts her charm, looks and wit to terrific use. She fits the lead role Olive perfectly like a glove and you are firmly placed at her side and will be rooting for her character. If there is any indication that Stone will become a big name in the future than this film certainly proves it. The other actors are also great thank's to Gluck's direction - Amanda Bynes as the too-super Christian Marianne is terrific and she handles a very satirical part very well. I especially enjoyed Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci's performances as Olive's parents - they are not only 100% supportive of their children, but they are also carefree, extremely like-able AND reasonable, something not too commonly seen in many teen movies. Maybe it's due to their hippie-like personalities. I can't say, I like 'em. Penn Badgley, Dan Byrd, Thomas Haden Church, Cam Gigandet, Aly Michalka and some brief appearances by Malcolm McDowell and Lisa Kudrow round up the solid supporting ensemble, but it is Stone's show here and she picks it up and runs with it all the way to the finish line.<br/><br/>More than a teen movie with heart - Will Gluck's ""Easy A"" is everything a teen flick should be - fun, sassy and lively. At the same time, ""Easy A"" accomplishes other feats quite unusual for teen films - it is an intelligent social satire that isn't just on the high school ""status quo"" and ""rumor mill"" (lest we forget extreme Christian followers like Marianne), it is both a satire and a tribute to John Hughes and his teen films of the '80s as well as ""The Scarlet Letter"", and a star- making role from the ever-promising and witty Emma Stone. It is easily the best modern teen comedy (perhaps of the decade?) that I have seen in a while and the best comedy of 2010.<br/><br/>The crew-members and cast may be different and John Hughes may be gone but his spirit and influence is ever-present in this film and he lives on here.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 76/100"

","""That's the beauty of being a girl in high school. People hear you had sex once, and bam, you're a bimbo.""<br/><br/>I wouldn't quite put Easy A on the level of Superbad or Mean Girls, but it's a better than average teen comedy that comes at the typical high school tropes from a slightly different angle, and feels fresh, as a result. <br/><br/>The movie works so well because of Emma Stone's performance as Olive, a  wickedly smart and kind-hearted high school girl whose white lies and attempt to do a good deed to help friend avoid bullying, ends up giving her quite the slutty reputation, thanks to the school rumor mill and a group of absurdly over-the-top group of religious students. Olive decides to (pretend to) embrace her newfound status as the school's most notorious fallen woman, but the gossip eventually gets way out of her control, and unfortunate consequences result. <br/><br/>Stone had already proved in Superbad, Zombieland, and The House Bunny that she has a gift for playing the funny hot chick (though in this movie she's initially not very popular with the high school guys...yeah, right), and she has great on-screen chemistry with Amanda Bynes, Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Aly Michalka, and the rest of her co- stars. This is a great cast all-around. No complaints in that area.   <br/><br/>Even when some of the jokes don't amuse as much as they could have (don't get me wrong, there are plenty of times that you'll be rolling with laughter), Emma Stone is so likable and has such great screen presence that I never lost interest.

","Thanks to Emma Stone's ""Olive"" Branch, Easy A was extremely easy on the I's. Whoa, OK, never mind. I mean, she made the movie elevate beyond the disaster it could've been.<br/><br/>Fine, I have to get over my Zombieland prejudices. I HATED her in that movie. Well, more her character, than her. She was absolutely wonderful here (in Easy A) and sorting through IMDb shows me more projects I've either seen and loved or want to view, such as Superbad, Paper Man, The Rocker, or The House Bunny.<br/><br/>Now the movie, itself, isn't perfect on its own, butdamnI would personally vote Stone for a Best Actress (Oscar) Nominee. Heck, if Tomei can get the award for My Cousin Vinny or Cusack nominated for In & Out, Stone EARNED the nomination here.<br/><br/>Okay, let's forget Stone for a moment. The supporting cast (Kudrow, why did you have to wait until half the movie's over to show up?), the cinematography and the dialogue were all good here in Easy A, a veryVERYloose adaption of The Scarlet Letterbut let's face it: Stone's witty comments and delivery gave this old concept a fresh perspective.<br/><br/>Olive (Stone – Oh! I get it) is the 'little miss sunshine' of her high school until one lie to her BFF of getting out of a weekend engagement blossoms into her having (GASP!) sex with an older man. Well, far be it from (100% unrealistic) kids who will judge, envy or mock (or all three) Olive. Unrealistic, as in, a LOT of kids have sex in high school. Sorry, Leave it to (their) Beaver parents. It does, in fact, happen.<br/><br/>Anyways, in this fantasy world, no teen has sex, so Olive's immediately branded as a harlot. She does (& doesn't) care so much, until people catch on, like her other BFF, gay guy friend Brandon (Byrd). A lot of people will look down upon his ""acting straight"" to get through high school as ""lying"" but let me set the record, uh, straightuntil homophobia goes bye-bye with the back of the bus, it's best to fly under the radar until college. This is coming from experience.<br/><br/>I digressHe gets a laid reputation which is followed by others (enter ""fat"" stereotypes here) who want the attention until her lie snowballs uncontrollably. Will she do the right thing? Well, time will tell in this John Hughes update. Not coincidentally, the late (and definitely GREAT) Hughes is mentioned here.<br/><br/>As I've shined more than once, Stone is both the centerpiece and also the glue that holds everything together. She alone didn't make 100% the movie – give it up to a great performance from Clarkson and Tucci as the (somewhat) clueless parents – but she really nailed the lines in an unrealistic film (mainly in the out-of-left field never-would-happen finale.)<br/><br/>I've mentioned this is loosely based on The Scarlet Letter film/work, and even though it's mentioned throughout (SEE: her 'Laverne' A on the clothes) it's never actually about adultery. In fact, she never commits (in the fantasy or real world) adultery. In any case, it's worth watching for some quick and fun dialogue – too many very good lines to quote. I'm surprised to like such a film, but again, it's all about the Stone. Look forward to seeing more of you!"

","Though primarily targeted for girls, this is a movie that will appeal to both the genders. This is a story of Olive, a girl who inadvertently lied to a friend about losing virginity, and the news traveled faster than wildfire among the gossip obsessed teens. Suddenly, she's the school slut. However, she realizes that she doesn't really mind the attention.<br/><br/>Easy A slightly different take on the teen genre with the obscene jokes and the ridiculous situations (I'm actually a fan of them too, if done well, like American Pie did) replaced with witty one-liners. The plot is good and the pace is just right. Will Gluck also does a commendable job as director, and makes sure that the viewer doesn't lose interest anytime during the movie. The cast and the dialogues are the best part about the movie though. Emma Stone does an excellent job, and puts in a performance sparkling with energy and vivacity. Also notable are Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci, who formed an excellent chemistry with Olive and gave many light moments during the movie. The other cast members also did a fine job. The dialogues are intelligent and witty, as already mentioned.<br/><br/>Where it lost out maybe was having too much of a feel good atmosphere, as a result you don't feel down even when Olive is crying in the movie.<br/><br/>It's however, definitely worth a watch.

The movie revolves around Olive, a girl who pretends to lose her virginity and then rumor gets out, and becomes talked about around the school. The movie has some hilarious dialogue and sarcastic comments that has me laughing 3/4 of the movie. The screenplay was well adapted but it was a little predictable when it came to the end. Yet even after its predictivity, the movie was still great. The characters are all played by the right person. I would say that this pg-13 movie barely made it to the rating. Cursing and some sexual jokes occur through the film. I love how they added the scarlet letter comparison and biblical teens. That really made it even more interesting.

","Emma Stone (""Superbad"", ""Zombieland"") helps reinvent the classic 80s teen movie revolution with her Golden Globe nominated portrayal of Olive in the Critic's Choice nominated Best Comedy ""Easy A"". Director John Hughes's films (""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"") had a big influence on this film. Will Gluck (""Fired Up"") directed the film creating a modern comedy version of Hester Prynne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" that rightfully takes place in a high school setting. Emma Stone's character Olive is just another normal teenaged girl trying to live through high school. She is really close to and open with her parents Dill (Stanley Tucci) and Rosemary (Patricia Clarkson). Her best friend is a blonde bombshell that is way more popular than her and her best guy friend, Brandon, is gay. Olive narrates the story while breaking it up into different parts and making a video. Her narration begins when Rhiannon asks Olive to go camping with her and her family for the weekend Olive lies to her saying that she has a hot date with a college guy that weekend to avoid going with Rhi and her eccentric parents. In actuality Olive just has a relaxing normal weekend at her house. However, on Monday when Rhi asks her about her weekend while in the bathroom, Olive says that she had sex with the guy. Their conversation is overheard by the die-hard Christian of the school Marianne (Amanda Bynes) who spreads the rumor throughout the school. Within the hour Olive was no longer just another student, she was known as the slut of the school. Why did she do it? The story begins to parallel The Scarlett Letter as they are reading it in her favorite teacher MR. Griffith's class. Olive begins doing favors for guys saying that she has slept with them to increase their public image. This ultimately leads her to wear an A on her wardrobe to represent adulterer just like in ""The Scarlett Letter"".<br/><br/>""Easy A"" is all about Emma Stone. She has always been a very good actress and has stood out in all of the films she has been in (""Superbad"", ""The House Bunny"", ""Zombieland""), but they didn't allow her to be a star until now. This is her first leading role as an actress and she nailed it, rightfully deserving her present award nominations. She has shown that she is going to be a force to be reckoned with in years to come. She helps the film stay original and get back to the roots of the 80s teen movie revolution also adding to the film a lot. The incorporation of the famous fist pump scene from ""The Breakfast Club"" and the song ""Don't You, Forget About Me"" helps create the echos of the rebirth of the 80s in the film. And oh yeah Stanley Tucci is amazing. Enough said.<br/><br/>Unlike the 80s teenage revolution films like ""The Breakfast Club"", the ending of ""Easy A"" is very predictable. The film itself is actually kind of original, but most things in the film can be seen coming. Also, Amanda Bynes did not seem like the best casting choice for the film. She has her hair bleached blonde for her die-hard Christian role of Marriane that just does not look very good on her. Her acting is also very fake and bad at times. She has to cry in a couple of scenes and it could not have been less believable.<br/><br/>Rated one of the best comedies of the year ""Easy A"" shows how stupid high school really was. People felt like they had to become someone that they weren't because of the stupid teenage social hierarchy. Emma Stone shows us how her character Olive tried to break the system, but high school is a shark tank and they will eat you alive. Wait for DVD if you are going to see the film and go rent or buy ""The Breakfast Club"" now!"

It is presented as just another high school comedy, but it has plenty of bite and is tightly written, embracing, supporting, and presenting its message clearly and without a ""quality"" package, relying mostly on Emma's sweet and strong performance, as the intelligent young man who misjudges the social forces in her high school world.<br/><br/>Many might think it is an analogy of the present world we live in, as fingers are pointed by a group of self-righteous teens who think everyone who doesn't subscribe to their agenda, and others who tend to ""help"" but end up causing more trouble than it is needed. As the story develops, we see Olive engage in a series of moves that eventually turn her from a unrecognizable teen to a loose and extremely popular member of her high school, though one with a tarnished reputation.<br/><br/>Small favors turn against her, lies pile up, and soon she must find a way to go back or surmount these obstacles. It becomes a difficult task, but eventually with the support of her quirky family, and a long time admirer, circumstances improve. Be prepared to be entertained and surprise by the sure and strong monologues, the funny exchange of lines, and the way Emma holds her audience captive, yet this doesn't prepare us for the fantastic scene in the gym where she tells the world she is not an average girl.<br/><br/>""Easy A"" works in many different level and joins other interesting and representative works of contemporary society, leaving a legacy that takes a bit to be recognized. In past years, works like ""I Love You Man"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" were dismissed as silly and light. This year we're surrounded by ""serious dramedies"" that combine badly written and offensive serious themes with a dose of sex and death to make us think we're witnessing important material. The psych of teens is rarely presented with such clarity, and performances like Stone's should be honored."

","Easy A is easy to like and gives ninety minutes of light-hearted entertainment that fans of romantic-comedies would enjoy with their peers. Aimed at the under-18 crowd, the film stars Emma Stone (Superbad, 2007; Zombieland, 2009), an up-and-coming screen queen (of the post-teenage universe), who gives a star lead performance that would raise the eyebrows of critics who deem her as only capable of supporting turns in films of this genre.<br/><br/>Any college guy (nerds and geeks excluded) would give anything to date Stone. She is blessed with natural beauty and an attractive figure – two attributes that suit the role of Olive, which she plays convincingly. In the film, Olive is very talkative. But that is because she leads a rather lonely college life (hard to believe), and thus needs to wax lyrical about her ""vibrant"" social life outside to her friends. This concept essentially becomes the film's main narrative.<br/><br/>In order to gain the envy of her friend, Olive tells her that she had sex with a guy over the weekend. This is overheard by another girl in the toilet and the school's rumor mill starts to spread the juicy news to almost every student. Soon, Olive's peers see her as a slut, but enjoying a rare moment in the limelight, she reciprocates by behaving like one. In one of the film's most hilarious scenes, she helps a gay boy to appear straight to his peers by agreeing to ""have sex"" with him behind closed doors, imitating sex noises and what not.<br/><br/>Olive achieves notoriety in her school, but she soon becomes disillusioned with herself, as she begins to realize that her artificial actions are not representative of her natural character. Easy A's fresh approach to the rom-com genre is quite engaging, with a notable emphasis on presenting college life not as a series of hormone-raging boy-girl relationship pursuits, but rather a time when self-identity is molded and individualism is expressed.<br/><br/>Director Will Gluck's easy-going style makes this a pleasant watch. The film gets a fair share of laughs from both its situational humor and the quite witty dialogue that questions the nature of college life, which I feel represents a microcosm of the ""celebrity-obsessed"" world of gossips and scandals that we live in today. Taking a small leaf out of John Hughes' book, Gluck brings us down to the perspective of a college girl who finds that being socially visible for the wrong reasons entails more alienation from her peers, which in turn leads to an ever escalating cycle of loneliness and self-doubt.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Easy A is a fine social lesson for the post-pubescent crowd that is packaged in a delightfully smart rom-com.<br/><br/>GRADE: B (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","While Easy A has a cliché plot, it still benefits from its smart script and charming performance from Emma Stone. The film has a plot that is so cliché that whenever Hollywood makes a movie about it, people just tend to overlook it. Unfortunately, people also overlooked this particular film. Easy is not just another Hollywood cliché, it has a script that is fresh and it has a lead that is charming. Rhiannon is a typical school girl who is not that popular. So she's going around spreading rumours about herself: that she slept with a college guy and almost the whole school. While all this is fake, guys are going up to her asking her to spread rumours that she slept with them (in exchange for a gift card to Target.) Although Easy A isn't as funny as it should be, it still manages to entertain me with its amazing (and hot!) Emma Stone."

"cesarbau","9","0","0","3 December 2010"," A totally charming comedy about gossip, rash judgment and other sins
","The poster of the movie ""Easy A"" sums up its big lesson well: ""Let's Not and Say We Did."" If you're going to say you've done something, then it better be true, because even a teeny- weeny lie could make your life a living hell and, worse, make your name synonymous with toxic skank forever.<br/><br/>How Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) got to be wearing ""whore couture"" with a scarlet letter A on her chest — like Hester Prynne, the martyr of the Nathaniel Hawthorne novel — is the subject of this totally charming comedy that sheds light on teen misbehaviorial patterns and the nature of shame, rash judgment and other sins. This movie does a satirical take on the nature of gossip: that people are willing to believe the worst in others and that they will blindly believe what they choose to believe. Tell 'em what they want to hear and they will lap it up, spreading the news through phone texts and the Internet.<br/><br/>The hemlines of Olive's clothes conform nicely to Ojai High School's rule: not higher than her fingertips. Her fashion preference is French designer brands: black, cut low, with lacy frills that say corset chic. The letter A recalls Hester's punishment for her crime of Adultery. No, it doesn't stand for Awesome; it's a play on the phrase ""easy lay.""<br/><br/>How easy a lay? Well, some boys in this California school can claim to have bedded her just like that — this weird bunch of guys who many say were gay, repugnant or ostracized. Olive's reputation as a slut, a floozy and a Jezebel trollop was born at a party at a friend's house, where her classmates gathered before a bedroom door to listen to her kinky, squealing session with Brandon (Dan Byrd), who until then had been tormented by talk that he was gay.<br/><br/>But Olive, 17, tells us a totally different story. First that it's all a lie, a bunch of fake relationships and pretend sex. She's been accepting offers simply to help boost the guys' egos and peer ranking. ""The rumors of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated,"" she says.<br/><br/>For a highly intelligent girl to tell her closest friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) the lie that she slept with a college jock sounds dumb, but that's the Olive drawn by director Will Gluck and screenplay author Bert V. Royal: a jumble of contradictions. The trouble with this young woman is that she gives in too quickly to the whims of friends and emotional blackmailers. Is her personality too insecure or of such low self-esteem that she's always trying to please others, even the school lynch mob?<br/><br/>After all, she has the greatest parents in the world (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson), a bit too liberal and hands-off perhaps but exceptional, and quite witty too. ""I will take a bullet for you, have my throat slit to stand up for you,"" dad Dill assures her. Dill and Rosemary Penderghast, plus adopted boy Chip? What a spiced-up family! <br/><br/>Then, things start to get out of hand. At Stage 2, her reputation goes down from a common slut to a tramp who demands cash in exchange for easy favors. It doesn't matter that in reality she gets peanuts for her help, such as discount coupons for Home Depot or free tickets to a foreign-language art-house film. And didn't Brandon just send her a tacky gift, a vibrator?<br/><br/>At Stage 3, she incurs the wrath of Jesus-loving, sex-abstaining Christians on campus, led by Cross Your Heart Club head Marianne Bryant (Amanda Byrnes). Hell-fearing Marianne has many positive virtues. As pretty and as gifted with words, she rivals Olive in a contest to win our sympathy. Yet, in the film's final irony, Olive turns out to have virtues that young Christians hold so dearly.<br/><br/>Stage 4 is the turning point in the spiraling charade, when Olive allegedly turns into a home wrecker and, for the first time, reveals the pain she's been through. She idolizes her hip but wise English teacher Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church), who is married to the very competent guidance counselor (Lisa Kudrow). But Olive later does something to the Griffiths that doesn't make her proud of herself.<br/><br/>And then there's mild-mannered, multi-talented Anson (Jake Sandvig), a hot-air balloon enthusiast and admirer of author Sylvia Plath, who invites Olive to a date at the Lobster Shack. He raises up Olive's hopes for a better social life. But what a letdown it is when, in the movie's eye-opening moment, he turns out to be no better than the rest of the guys. <br/><br/>The movie leaves unanswered the biggest question: what is the motive behind Olive's over- identifying with Hawthorne's branded martyr? Also, it's hard to fathom why the people whom Olive had helped turn so mean in the end. But the movie does answer, in a droll, heartwarming way, the question of why the Penderghast couple has raised such a wonderful daughter in Olive. And as to the puzzle as to who among a short list of school hunks will win Olive's heart, it delivers a solution that is heartwarming, very romantic and obvious.<br/><br/>Assessing this movie's cast could be done through what Olive and her friends call ""identifiers,"" or the initials of the key words that describe a person. Byrnes as Marianne and Michalka as Rhiannon are both F.L, funny and lovable. Haden Church and Kudrow as the Griffiths are B.S., believable and sympathetic. And playing the Penderghasts with a post- hippie style of parenting, Tucci and Clarkson are M.A.G., magical actor genies who are a delight to watch.<br/><br/>And Emma Stone is simply A.B.C. — adorable, bright and a completely confident comedienne. What the critics have unanimously said about her is true. ""Easy A"" is as much the journey of a young woman into adulthood as Stone's stepping stone to a well-deserved stardom."
"Ryan_MYeah","8","0","0","27 November 2010"," The previous teen movie influence is obvious, but Emma Stone's performance is impeccable.
","MYeah is havin' an okay day. Saw Easy A, and got a coke zero at the gas station. Raise the roof! <br/><br/>Olive Penderghast is a social outsider in her high school, but when a rumor starts floating around that she slept with a college student, she decides to use this to heighten her financial, and social placement by pretending to have sex with fellow students of hers. This works out fairly well at the start, but as the escalator of attention rises, she finds herself unhappy with herself, trying to save face, as well as dealing with a struggle between her, and the school's group of Christian enthusiasts.<br/><br/>The film takes a lot of obvious influence from the filmography of John Hughes, as well as the recent Mean Girls, to move its story along, but only rarely is such a thing so trivial. The movie is neatly told, it moves quickly, and the humor actually works, thanks to the combined efforts of director Will Gluck, and screenwriter Bert Royal. Their work is smooth, although a montage of clips from John Hughes' filmography, as well as other little references to his films can become distracting, but the story really isn't the main reason to see the movie.<br/><br/>The REAL reason to see the movie is the impressive star turn by the oh-so charming Emma Stone, who carries the film with a superb performance. Every witty one-liner, or subtle facial expression of hers is destined for a laugh. But her humor never overstays its welcome, her emotional timing works brilliantly, so she's more than enough reason to check the movie out. In addition to Stone, the cast includes Lisa Kudrow, Amanda Bynes, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Haden Church, and Stanley Tucci who all have a gift of natural comedy.<br/><br/>It may not be the best teen movie ever made, but it does feature one of the year's best leading performances.<br/><br/>And that's enough reason for me to give it an easy *** out of ****"

","I watch trailers of all upcoming movies. I liked the trailer of Easy A. Interesting idea about saying that you did something when you didn't especially when its considered bad or a sin! I started the movie, watched few minutes to see if it could sustain my interest, and it did! The narrative was engaging enough that I didn't feel bored. The plot has an easy pace that keep things real yet it doesn't feel too serious. Emma Stone did a good role both as a protagonist and the narrator. I was happy to see Penn Badgley in a movie after watching him in Gossip Girl. Everything works well for this movie, except that I think all the other actors like Stanley Tucci have been wasted in their respective roles! I have to say its one of the best high school movies I've seen till date."

The comedy was snappy and fresh and there even was a message hidden deep in the movie where you cant find it without actually looking. The acting was well done and I thought the movie was well cast. The story kept coming up with surprises that kept me engaged. I left the movie with a feeling of satisfaction, and isn't that what every moviegoer wants?

"Samiam3","6","3","8","17 September 2010"," Amusing yet not quite satisfactory (B- at best)
","Easy A is probably a proud moment for Emma Stone. As far as I understand, this is her first staring role, and it gives her a chance to stretch her comedic legs. Though not terrific, she does her job. The movie as a whole does not, I'm afraid to say.<br/><br/>The mind that though up Easy A is arguably clever, but the mind (or minds) which transfered it to the screen are not as much so. This high school comedy is burdened by a poor screenplay, and a lack of consistent humour. It starts off strong but the middle section is overlong, and tedious, and the ending is rushed and not nearly as clever as was probably intended. Easy A makes you smile, and sometimes makes you laugh, but you come away from it somewhat unsatisfied.<br/><br/>In an attempt to avoid looking like a generic teen comedy, Easy A frequently winks at itself. It acknowledges its source material; Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlett Letter. Self-reflexive though it may be in parts, this movie still feels fairly derivative. The key is always in the details. One of the more annoying clichés in this genre (also seen here) is the utter incredibility of the adult characters. Easy A is quite mean spirited towards all the parents and teachers in the movie, and it doesn't really add to the comedic value. Stanley Tucci gets a few good one liners, but his delivery is lame. The same is true of Thomas Haden Church, Malcolm Mcdowell, and a few others.<br/><br/>Easy A, is a movie that could use a reworking. It's cute, but it's not quite funny enough to recommend as a comedy. It may work more effectively as a date movie."

","Marianne: There's a higher power that will judge you for your indecency. Olive Penderghast: Tom Cruise?<br/><br/>In Easy A, innocent Olive (Emma Stone) foolishly brags to have lost her ""V Card,"" starting a rumor at Southern California's Ojai Valley High School that spins out of control. At some point she becomes the Hester Prynne of the experienced girls, a reference to their currently reading Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter and a testament to the scourging of the ultra-Christians.<br/><br/>Lest this seem a bit heavy for 17 year-old teens, the dialogue by playwright and screenplay specialist Bert V. Royal is witty, but not all the time, and timely if a bit over the top. Juno it is not, missing that comedy's acidity, sophistication, and gifted star, Ellen Page. However, the fetchingly-lisped Stone is still better than most young actresses out there playing young, romantic, and comedic.<br/><br/>Royal's script has plenty of room for commentary on homophobia and adultery as well as the formula for a wholesome, liberal family life evidenced by Olive's parents, played to happy, flower-children harmony by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. That couple should win a special award for playing the understanding, caring parents we all hoped to be or have, but weren't/didn't. They are marvelous.<br/><br/>The thematic weight in this rom-com is with acceptance and truth, notwithstanding the obvious commentary about social communicating best exemplified by Facebook. In fact the entire film is framed by Olive narrating to her website about the rise and fall of her rumor.<br/><br/>Easy A, its title ingeniously playing on Hawthorne, should have taken the rich Hawthorne subject more seriously, for there is plenty of comedic material and life-learning going on with the nineteenth century genius's stories.<br/><br/>""She had wandered, without rule or guidance, into a moral wilderness. Her intellect and heart had their home, as it were, in desert places, where she roamed as freely as the wild Indian in his woods. The scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not tread."" Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter."

","Actually, I was going to rate this movie lower at fist (like a 6), as I did not find it particularly special to start with. But I must admit, I found it better and better as it went on.. Actually, after giving it a second thought, I liked it so much that I am writing my first IMDb review on this movie. (sorry for my rusty English, I am a German speaking user..)<br/><br/>I liked the movie because it has a certain depths to it. Many people pretend to be the people that they are actually not. The people who pretend to be so purist and highly religious are actually the ones that hide their true nature the most. This religious kind of upbringing the children creates adult people with many hang-ups. And then later, we find out about priests in our neighborhood, having sexual relationship with Kids! This is what hang-ups lead to, if not let out at younger age. The priest watching Olives videocast on the internet, hoping her to undress in front of the camera is a typical example of what I am talking about. <br/><br/>Olive on the other side acts like a whore, but is a virgin. It just is amazing and so ironic.. Olive is a really nice girl, brought up in a very cool and new fashioned family. But it's not her who has sexual relationships with every other guy. It is the 40 year old, frustrated female teacher having a relationship with a student boy, who was brought up in a very conservative and religious family. The mother of this boy is slapping her 21 year old son in the hospital for having sex before marriage and getting a venereal disease in the end.. wow, and he even lets her do this!!! Well, how should he know, if his beloved parents never talked to him about this subject before? If something like this happens the parents are usually to blame, not the kids. (It wouldn't happen to Olivia I think..)<br/><br/>Olivia is as normal as a teenager can get. Just as she seems to have brought herself into a dead lock situation, she manages to find her true love and put her uncertainties aside. Isn't it romantic? very. <br/><br/>Emma Stone has really impressed me, the role suits her very well. She is a very interesting, talented and last but not least attractive actress with a lot of potential! There are many young attractive actresses around but Emma has got her own special style and personality, I really adore her. <br/><br/>Thanks for this movie Emma, I would really like to see more of your movies to come. give them hell!"
"dee.reid","10","2","5","25 October 2010"," ""Easy A"" gets an ""A"" for effort...
","(John Hughes would be proud with ""Easy A."") Oh, boy, where to start with this movie, hmm? Well, for one, Will Gluck's ""Easy A"" provided me with a brief respite from the day-to-day insanity that is my life. The last movie I saw in theaters was ""Predators"" and that was back in July; that's three months of not having to pay the inflated ticket price of $8.75 to see a movie. But my self-imposed moratorium on not going to the movies was well-worth the wait with ""Easy A."" The script shines in delivering a fast-paced, laugh-a-minute screenplay with a story vaguely paralleling ""The Scarlet Letter"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne (which I never read in high school); Olive Pendergast (Emma Stone, the husky-voiced redhead from ""Superbad"" and ""Zombieland"" whose career has just been made with this film) is a social nobody at her shiny, pristine Southern California high school. But that changes when a little lie to get out of spending time with her best friend's weird family somehow explodes into a huge, school-wide rumor about how she allegedly lost her virginity to some made-up college hunk. A la Hester Prynne in ""The Scarlet Letter,"" Olive becomes the talk of her high school rumor mill, with boys approaching her left and right to help them with their reputations around campus. So she decides to embrace her newfound infamy (complete with a telltale ""A"" pinned on the shoulder of her new wardrobe), much to the chagrin of the high school queen bee (Amanda Bynes, fresh out of her retirement) and the mascot of the basketball team (Penn Badgley), with whom Olive shares an unusual romantic past with. And we all know how one lie leads to an even bigger lie and how that bigger lie leads to an even bigger lie and so on and so forth. ""Easy A"" is a brilliantly acted teen comedy with nods aplenty to the work of the late John Hughes (1950-2009), ""Can't Buy Me Love"" (1987) with Patrick Dempsey, and Cameron Crowe's ""Say Anything"" (1989). Stone is a star; she's not just a pretty face. She's spunky with an incredibly razor-sharp wit, and a heart to boot, even as she must face the music and try to put the wrong things right in her chaotic life and improve her high school reputation before it's too late. She's intelligent, easy on the eyes, and proves with this movie that she has a bright future ahead of her in the movies. ""Easy A"" is an easy movie to like. In a wasteland of instantly forgettable and stupid teen movies, ""Easy A"" is one teen flick you can pay $8.75 to see in the theater, and not kick yourself for doing so in the morning...<br/><br/>10/10"
"Legendary_Badass","7","2","6","17 September 2010"," Begs for John Hughes, literally
","In Easy A, Emma Stone plays Olive, a teenager flying under the social radar. All of this changes when she uses a little tiny white lie to get out of hanging with her BFF's creepy naturist parents. The falsehood spreads like a wildfire evolving from hanging out with a college student to sleeping with him. Olive chooses to embrace the lie and soon she is the talk of the schoolyard as every guy wants leech off her infamy, offering gift certificates in exchange for the implication that they ""did it"". Of course it won't come as a surprise that eventually Olive changes her mind and has to scramble to save her good name.<br/><br/>Like many of these teen comedies, the lead is wise beyond her years but still susceptible to making youthful mistakes. Like Juno this movie's protagonist is ready to give out a witty comeback and use words that exceed the average vocabulary. I wouldn't call this realistic, and the actions, or rather overreactions, of supporting characters puts Easy A in familiar territory. Fortunately some of the jokes are brilliant. One that will stay with me for a long time to come illustrates Olive's growing fondness for a song that plays when she opens a greeting card sent to her from her grandmother. Through the use of montage an entire weekend eclipses and Olive goes from despising the tune to singing it in the shower.<br/><br/>There are some stereotypes that get their usual Hollywood poking. I already mentioned how the nudist parents are weird, but on the other end of the spectrum is the controlling ""Jesus freak"" Marianne (Amanda Bynes) that provides the predictable conflict that works its way into the second act. Would it have been nice for someone to be religious without being a hypocrite or bigoted? Sure.<br/><br/>Olive spends a lot of time on her own and it wasn't until late in the game that I realized how Todd (Penn Badgley) is being setup as her love interest, and no one should see this coming as his appearances are widely spaced and his impact minimal. If Easy A is supposed to be quirky, original, and/or thought provoking then it's counterintuitive to fall back on the social norm with such a lifeless relationship. Olive is a likable character and this movie didn't feel like it needed her to be thrown into a guy's arms in order to find happiness. And the way it is executed is so peculiar. So much time is dedicated to building Olive's promiscuous persona that nice guy Todd logically shouldn't be interested, in fact it's borderline insulting to think that the average teenage male is looking for the kind of girl who has been physical with everyone he knows. I've been out of high school for a little less than ten years, could things have changed that much?<br/><br/>I'm a little disappointed in the way Easy A concludes. It's a wrapping up that calls upon nostalgia, and in the movie business that means reminding the audience of what movie(s) you want them to consider as an equal. Connecting Easy A to a number of '80s teenage love stories doesn't require a roll call. By mentioning The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off by name is arrogant while the inclusion of an amalgamation '80s ending is downright lazy. It's a sour note to play out a tune that started high and sweet."

I was literally cracking up in the theater. It was especially great because aside from Emma Stone, all of the supporting characters were awesome in their roles!I would say the end is somewhat predictable but seriously which comedy like this, isn't nowadays?

She gets a bad name and eventually she tries to set thing right and who knows, even getting a real date or boyfriend.

","When I'm sad, I enjoy watching light romantic movies. Preferably from the 80s. But everybody kept recommending me Easy A and finally I watched it. And you know what? That was exactly what I needed. It seemed just like a John Hughes movie (who is mentioned in the movie as well) - with some drama, with some life questions and with a happy ending where the guy gets the girl and drives away on a lawn mower.<br/><br/>So what the movie is really about? Well, it's basically about a girl who lies to her friend that she slept with a guy and rumor starts spreading and then she helps out and lies for some other people and finally the whole school is thinking that she is a slut who sleeps for money and has STD. (Well that escalated quickly) But it wouldn't be a light romantic movie if it didn't have a happy ending and like I said, it does. So everything turns out fine in the end.<br/><br/>It seems like a really simple movie, so why the hell am I writing about it here? Well first of all, because I can. Secondly, I liked that this movie was not some kind of cheesy movie about puppy love how most romantic movies seem to be.<br/><br/>The movie for me is how your reputation can change so quickly from one thing to another and how gossip travels so fast that you can't even keep track. Aaand. The topic that is always relevant to nice people - how long are you going to be nice and how much you can let people step on your reputation while you're helping out other people? I think that there's always the last straw and the rule that the needs of many outweigh the needs of the few sometimes is not right. Especially when you're talking about yourself. Nobody wants to be in the few part. Nobody wants to get hurt. But that happens. I think the important part is while helping people out not to forget, that you are the person you are going to live the rest of your life and your decisions reflect mostly on your life. It is not OK, to be hurting yourself in case of others. Of course, I'm not saying that being nice and helping out is bad. But it should come both ways, not just from one side.<br/><br/>Another topic is personal life and it's publication. In the world of Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Tumblr and so on, personal life is not very personal anymore. But I think this is why it's even more important in keeping your privacy. And it is about time that people would respect the privacy boundaries. The information accessible to others is only what you approved, not what people gathered around. The only legit information about a person is what the person said himself and there are always two sides of the stories. Of course, it is quite different if the person lies and there's lies on top of lies and in order to set everything straight you need to crumble down the whole fortress of lies (caution: feelings might get hurt). In this time it's also very important to have somebody who you can trust, somebody who you can talk to. But most times the hardest decisions you have to make yourself.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed watching this movie. And I would recommend it for a evening with ice-cream. You can easily watch it together with any John Hughes movies or alongside 10 things I hate about you. Why? Because this movie has some layers that you're left to think about when it's over and it puts a smile on your face. And those are the best movies to watch when you're sad."
"wvisser-leusden","9","1","2","10 March 2013"," Making fun about the Westerners' sex-obsession
","In the world outside the USA and Western Europe, sex is often less prominently presented. Over there, sex is often only regarded as a way of having a nice time and as a means to make children. Essentially, those people do not feel any urge to use sex for making statements.<br/><br/>Consequently, they often make fun about the Westerners' sex-obsession. Not in our faces, of course, for they know damn well they depend financially on the West.<br/><br/>In line with this, 'Easy A' makes a marvelous comedy about the prominence of sex in our Western lives. Rightly selecting sunny California as its setting. No doubt 'Easy A's plot is pretty much exaggerated, but that's necessary to get the message across.<br/><br/>Apart from this, we are presented with a good film. Competent acting being competently shot, all based on an entertaining plot."

","""Easy A"" earns an A as an excellent movie. This sophisticated comedy celebrates liberal causes and embraces diversity. Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) gets in trouble when she tells her best friend Rhiannon that she spent a weekend with a college guy. Mind you, Olive had no date and spent the entire weekend in her room with her dog as her only companion, and played the song ""I've Got A Pocket of Sunshine."" Later, at school, Rhiannon refuses to believe that her oldest friend didn't have sex with a college guy. Reluctantly, our heroine breaks down under pressure and admits that she did have sex. A bubble-headed Christian fanatic, Marianne, occupies a stall when Olive makes her confession to Rhiannon. Later, Olive helps a homosexual guy out at her high school who is being bullied by the straight guys. She takes Brandon (Dan Byrd) to Melody Bostic's party and they fake like they are having incredible sex. Afterward, Brandon has nothing to worry about because all the guys treat him now as one of them. Olive attracts scandal and acquires a sordid reputation. Eventually, word leaks out in certain quarters that Olive and Brandon didn't have sex and others bribe Olive so say they have had sex with her. Meantime, Marianne, does her best to derail all of Olive's plans and launches a smear campaign against her. Marianne emerges as the chief villainous in ""Easy A."" Olive gets in trouble with the school principal when she calls one of Marianne's minions Nina (Mahaley Manning) a ""twat."" Olive is blessed with two of the most liberal parents in the world and they have adopted an African-American child. ""Easy A"" qualifies as refresh, funny, and fast-moving. Emma Stone is sensational!"

","My love for this movie probably has no upper limit. It has a wonderfully original plot, a fantastic cast, and too many memorable lines. I've loved Emma Stone since Superbad, and she is just amazing in this role. Her casting video was the opening webcam monologue, and you just instantly know that she will be great at it. Amanda Bynes is hilarious and /just/ annoying enough to sympathize with. The grownups (Thomas Hayden Church, Lisa Kudrow, Patricia Clarkson, Stanley Tucci, Malcolm McDowell) are all funny and work well together, but my favorite are Olive's parents by far. Honestly my only complaint is that in one scene, Kudrow says ""godd-mn sh-t"" close to ten times to avoid an ""R"" rating, but to me it seems entirely counter-productive. It's either you cut back on all the swear words or you don't and go with an ""R"" rating. Or at least include an unrated cut with the f-bombs in it. But it's still a great movie which I would recommend anytime."

"Dory_Darko","9","1","2","19 September 2011"," A delicious, clever comedy.
","When I first saw the trailer of Easy A, I wasn't particularly intrigued. It looked like just another high school teenage comedy. But then I decided to watch it anyway (mostly because I wanted to know what all the fuss was about), and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise! Coincidentally, I had just seen Emma Stone for the first time two days ago, when I watched Zombieland, and I thought to myself, ""Hey this girl seems kind of cool"". But that still wasn't an answer as to why right now I can't read a single magazine without seeing her face somewhere. After seeing Easy A, I finally know. This girl is FUN. She has a great talent for comedy of the driest, most sarcastic kind and a perfect sense of timing. And you've got to love that husky voice.<br/><br/>Easy A is about a girl, Olive, who's a straight A-student with a flawless reputation, until she tells a little white lie to her best friend about how she supposedly lost her virginity to a guy that doesn't even exist. However, things go awry when this little anecdote spreads like wildfire and all of a sudden she has a reputation of being a hussy. (This plot line demands some suspension of disbelief, because it's obviously very hard to believe that any group of high school students would be shocked at the thought of one of their peers *having sex*, but whatever.) Of course, like with any rumour, it changes constantly depending on who you talk to. So before Olive knows what hit her, everybody in school thinks she slept with every guy around. Now here's the twist: once it becomes clear that she can use this newfound reputation to her advantage, she does so to the fullest. Simply put: unpopular guys pay her to PRETEND she had sex with them. Obviously, at some point things get out of hand and she has to find a way to fix it all again.<br/><br/>This concept could have been really stupid, if it wasn't for the great screenplay. It is a tribute to classic 80's teenage films including, of course, John Hughes, and it also features some great references to The Scarlet Letter and Sylvia Plath. The dialogue is quick and witty, and the characters are all really typical people without being cliché stereotypes. Stanley Tucci is a delight as Olive's dad, bringing the same kind of dry-as-a-bone humour to the table as his on-screen daughter. Patricia Clarkson is a wonderful actress, and as it turns out, a really funny one as well. All the actors are perfectly cast.<br/><br/>One of the funniest elements in Easy A is a group of Christian students, the 'Jesus freaks'. The leader of this little group is a girl called Marianne, played by Amanda Bynes. She just can't stop preaching to Olive about her 'indecent behaviour' and the dialogue between the two provides some of the funniest moments throughout the film. Here's a small foretaste; Marianne: ""There's a higher power that will judge you for your indecency."" Olive: ""Tom Cruise?"" <br/><br/>Overall, this is mostly a 'chuckle' comedy rather than a 'rolling over the floor laughing' comedy, though it has some really good LOL moments. And the 'chuckles' are widespread.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend watching Easy A if you're in the mood for a witty, intelligent comedy about a smart, sassy girl who takes control of her own life and everybody who thinks they have a right to think badly about her."
"girllovesmovies27","8","1","2","23 July 2011"," Watching Easy A is always an Easy Choice
","*May contain spoilers* I went into watching this movie expecting the worst AND it was anything BUT bad! There are a few off-putting things (the adopted little brother reading the peas that say the naughty word she got in trouble for, for one), but overall the film really captured the high school & even 20-something experience. There's only one scene I recommend muting if your parents are nearby (you'll know it when it comes on). Just to mention the other off-putting things as a precaution: near the end, her song and dance with the school mascot (Woodchuck) is pretty sexual and inappropriate for younger viewers. Actually, the whole story is inappropriate...but that's what teens and 20-somethings like, right? The last off-putting thing to me (*SPOILER ALERT*) is the guidance counselor's affair with a student- even if he's 20-something and incredibly stupid, apparently, because he's still in high school. One thing for sure, this is a COMEDY. Don't take it too seriously. I only mention my few hang-ups with it as a warning. Emma Stone shines in this film, as do the actors that play her parents. Their family dynamic is not necessarily typical, but I'm sure there are some viewers that can relate to it. Penn also did a great job in the film- in fact, he is the only character other than the English teacher that didn't feel like a characterization of a stereotype. I recommend this film though because it's quite enjoyable."
"georgia_cushion","9","1","2","4 June 2011"," I will be buying this on DVD!
","I honestly cannot wait until I can buy this on DVD. I watched this film with my ten 13 year-old friends at my sleepover and we all thought it was hilarious, but also appropriate for our age group as it was not that sexual. It was a clever story-line and Emma Stone's performance was also rather funny, but she was not the only good actor for instance Lisa Kudrow's performance was great as usual. I thought they tackled common high-school issues in a sensible, yet comedic way. The humour is exactly what I like and it also wasn't atypical American corny high school. Overall Easy A is a very, very funny film that is definitely worth a watch, very good for girlie sleepovers. I would give it a 9/10 and say it is suitable for 13+."
"cookiechip_07","8","1","2","2 June 2011"," Easily A Delight!
","Easy A:<br/><br/>Is a teenage comedy about one girl's high school experiences. Directed by William Gluck it's a tale of rumours and reputations. Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), is a bright student who unfortunately has higher social standing with teachers than with her fellow students. Also with regards to her appeal to the opposite sex, in her words ""If Google Earth was a guy, he couldn't find me even if I was dressed up as a ten story building"". <br/><br/>In the opening scene we meet her best friend Rhiannon'Rhi' Abernathy (the exuberant Aly Michalka) who after hearing a little lie from Olive about her having a guy over for the weekend wants Olive to admit she lost her virginity with him and will not take no for an answer. Olive gives in and says yes only to stop Rhi from nagging. Unfortunately this is overheard by Marianne (Amanda Bynes), a sanctimonious religious student who spreads the story like wildfire. However the overnight notoriety gained, is completed absorbed by Olive who previously went unnoticed by others and now that all eyes are on her, decides to use the school's gossip grapevine to advance her social standing, taking on the new'experienced, predatory' image with supreme confidence and comedic authority. <br/><br/>Once Olive becomes an established name in school, she inadvertently takes on a type of heroism with the ability to help the schools various 'outsiders' become 'some bodies'. Through ""intimate"" association with our promiscuous lead the outsiders become 'cool', improving reputations and putting them on the schools social map! <br/><br/>In Easy A the beautiful Emma Stone takes the lead; stepping out from her Superbad tag and leaving it in the shadows, becoming the centre of attention and deservedly so. There is no doubt that she has a bright future ahead as she plays lead role with consummate ease and intelligence, reminiscent of an early Lindsey Lohan. Upon viewing her credentials in Superbad, Paperman, Zombieland and now Easy A, its seems Ms Stone possess all the innate characteristics and acting ability that -given the right roles- will surely see her enter the next young Hollywood elite alongside Ellen Page, Kirsten Stuart, Carey Mulligan, her Superbad co-stars and not down the road of a later Ms Lohan. <br/><br/>The notable element to Easy A is simply the writing (debut by Bert. V. Reynolds). Its witty, sharp and gives each characters a good standard of vocabulary, not opting for the modern day spoken word that you hear in schools such as slang & text-isms i.e. 'lol's & Omg's' which is highly refreshing to watch and just shows that teenage comedy can still have attitude when given a decent use of English language.<br/><br/>Another shining light or should I say lights in this film is the two parents of Olive- Dill and Rosemary (played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson) there chemistry is strong, providing weird but wonderful performances with quirky personalities much like the 'Meet The Fockers' parents but rather toned down versions to meet with the needs of its target audience. Despite this, when its there scene, you'll be sure to laugh and I think they definitely warranted more screen time then they received. The supporting cast all do well with; Thomas Haden Church as the Head Teacher, distracted Guidance Counsellor (Lisa Kudrow), and long time crush (Penn Badgley) all adding their distinctive elements. <br/><br/>Nearly all comedies have far-fetched stories its what makes them funny and this is no different (a state school where apparently losing ones virginity is condemned which leads to counselling etc) so certain aspects like this cant be deemed negative points as others have suggested. Granted, the film doesn't quite take you to the heights of a 'Juno' and hasn't achieved the success of 'Mean Girls' (this film is better) but Easy A is easily a; smart, fun and enjoyable movie... Grade A!!"
"dylan-grieve","6","1","2","31 May 2011"," Didn't like it.
","This movie annoyed me too many times to continue watching it. The few parts where the Christian girl tried to annoy Lindsay Lohan's character by repeatedly jamming her pencil in the sharpener and clicking the stapler irritated me to the point of wanting to jump through the screen and strangle her. The movie was a puffed-up joke in many ways. Lindsay Lohan's parents were cute at first, but quickly became too lewd and weird for my tastes.<br/><br/>This film is basically about what can happen when you tell a few lies; one thing builds from another, and events spiral out of control. It was clearly geared towards young women, so I'm not sure why I watched it. There were some ditzy-girl moments; the Renee Zelweger type that I don't ever expect to understand since I don't have a vagina. To sum it up, if you are a guy, the chances you won't like this movie are pretty good. If you are an older guy, you might be more prone to find it amusing, even tolerable, especially if you watch it with a significant other or family. However, I didn't feel like wasting any more time on it after one hour."
"miss_lady_ice-853-608700","6","1","2","18 April 2011"," Smart but a bit smart for its own good.
","It's refreshing to see a teen movie that is actually for teenagers and is not diluted to appeal to young girls. Just like how it was in the eighties- and eighties films are referenced quite a bit in Easy A.<br/><br/>The title is clever, witty, and has a bit of attitude. However, Easy A does not entirely live up to the promise of its title. It's an intelligent off-beat film for the most part but the director and writer keep congratulating themselves on their wit and quirkiness so often that the film begins to grate. There's also an unpleasant snarky tone to the whole proceedings. Olive (Emma Stone), our slutty protagonist who is not really a slut, is frequently bitchy to pretty much every other character, except her 'favourite teacher'(it's not a euphemism but the film would be much funnier if it was). She has a massive superiority complex, using every excuse to show off her wit and pretentious intellect. Apparently this film is supposed to be indicative of our generation, and it is, in the sense that everybody is self-obsessed. Despite the protagonist being sour, Emma Stone brings a bit of attitude to the film and perhaps indicates that Olive is just as self-absorbed as everybody else.<br/><br/>The film's premise has parallels with 19th century American classic The Scarlet Letter, in which a woman is persecuted and forced to wear an A as a symbol of her adultery, whilst the man is not punished at all. However the filmmakers seem to have got confused about what adultery means, as they keep saying that Olive is an adulterer whereas her actual sin is supposed sluttiness. The film's attempt to convey the religious themes of the novel does not really pay off. I'm not religious at all but I found the obsession with attacking religious zealots rather sour and a distraction from a promising, albeit implausible, comic premise.<br/><br/>So, school report for this film: intelligent, but a big attitude problem."
"m143386","7","1","2","25 March 2011"," The legacy of John Hughes is alive and well...
","A wonderful homage to the John Hughes era of 'coming of age' film, that manages to be as smart, quirky, engaging and respective of its audience. Emma Stone is fabulous as the smart, strong willed lead who decides to defy the establishment but doesn't fully anticipate the consequences. Amanda Bynes was perfect as the prissy god botherer, as is Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci who are the cool parents we all wish were (or had) and Thomas Haden Church is great as the inspirational teacher who really gets his students. They are backed up with a tonne of other great supporting actors. A wonderful film you SHOULD watch with all the family."

Not as great as Mean Girls (but I'm biased because I watched that in 9th grade), but it is smarter and sweeter. And Emma Stone is quite the hottie. It's plot is mainly a literary parallel to Nathan Hawthorne's Scarlett Letter, except there is no baby and no sex.. and it's set in modern day high school.<br/><br/>Her character has the intellectual goods that I adore, and the body I want. It doesn't do what the modern Comedy (Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow.. etc..) movie does, which is be funny in the beginning and then gets too serious and light hearted towards the end.<br/><br/>Instead, it stays smart and funny without any of the comedic awkwardness and line that are not too obscure and too perfectly prepared like in Juno (I swear if she was a real girl, I could see her having a list of witty things in her head and begging for the perfect opportunity to use them).<br/><br/>In all, this is the perfect high school comedy in a long time with a lovable main character (who has awesome parents).<br/><br/>This movie made me believe in comedy again (that and The Other Guys) .<br/><br/>*Lastly, Emma Stone wears lots of sexy corsets.

","'Easy A' may be a tad overrated but it is at least a tad better than the usual sex-loaded teen flicks released these days. What I liked about it is that it actually attempts to tell a story and skillfully references to classics like 'The Scarlet Letter' and those wonderful John Hughes films. In a way, it's like a modern day 'Scarlet Letter' but with much more comedy. Emma Stone brilliantly carries the part of the typical teenager who suddenly finds herself stuck in her own web of lies. She's definitely growing as an actress (something the likes of Lindsey Lohan couldn't achieve despite being in movies her whole life). Stone is terrifically supported by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci (as Olive's parents with the hippie-free-love mentality) who provide some of the best laugh-out-loud moments of the film. Thomas Haden Church stands out as the good-intentioned teacher and Lisa Kudrow is superb in a surprise role. 'Easy A' may not be a classic but it's entertaining, with some hilarious moments nonetheless. Not too bad for a one-time watch."
"cace_mon","4","1","2","26 January 2011"," Fun, entertaining but unrealistic movie
","If you take reality out of the equation and look at this movie as a fun loving teen comedy then ""Easy A"" can be considered quite entertaining. Emma Stone was perfect for the role and it was fun watching her successfully transform from an innocent teenager to the school sex symbol. Her narration throughout the movie added to the story line and helped the audience to get to know the real Olive. However, in my opinion, it seems highly unrealistic in modern day society that the school would be in such an uproar after learning of her activities as it is common knowledge that teenagers are sexually active and high school is a playground for sex and drugs. All in all it was a fun movie but I recommend you save your money and rent the DVD."

","This film is well written and well acted. Ms Stone puts in a fine performance and just about everyone else really gives their best, particularly Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Hayden Church and Lisa Kudrow. Also thank you Amanda Bynes for rethinking your decision to retire from acting!<br/><br/>One reviewer said that the characters were not fully fleshed out but I find myself disagreeing. The writer and director got a lot out of some characters that sometimes had only a minute or so screen time. Some of them we learned a lot about their private anguish or history or relationships in only a few lines. Solid writing.<br/><br/>Others have said it, but what the hell I will too...this film is a loving tribute to the '80's teen films of John Hughes including many of the implausibilities. It's a comedy that actually veers into some fairly sophisticated satire at a few points, plausibility isn't the issue here. Like the Hughes films, it isn't about what teens would actually do or say, but what we *wish* they would or what we wish we would have in our own high school days.<br/><br/>One thing. What John Hughes did in his films was work with real teen aged actors whereas Mr. Gluck has chosen to return to the old cliché of having actors in their 20's play high schoolers and that is a mistake. The kids in the Hughes films *look* young and vulnerable and the viewers are reminded of that. When older actors are used something is lost, that's all I'm saying."

Drawing on Nathanial Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (in more ways than several), it is fairly serious underneath. But, on all levels, it is sharp, witty, and often very funny - it is a pleasure to encounter a film which pretends to be superficial and trivial, but which is as well written as this.<br/><br/>All the performances are very good, but Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as Olive's parents are very funny, and it is now clear that Emma Stone has what it takes to hold a movie together - again, she delivers an intelligent and sexy performance.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film"

","A teen rom com for the MTV generation, with an above average script. The story is of a girl who somewhat parallels a classic US novel of the nineteenth century - 'The Scarlet Letter.'

It all gets out of hand although a stoical handsome hot guy is wandering about in the background waiting his moment. The acting is very good, the direction a little over the top and repetitive, but steady, the soundtrack helpful, and the script full of satirical comments on teens, non-judgemental parents, the internet, relationships etc. So a good hoot with a slice of American hypocrisy laced in amongst the apple pie!

"AbAeterno","9","1","2","20 October 2010"," Stones shines in the smartest teen comedy in a long time
","In her first (and long overdue) truly lead role, the delectable Emma Stone stars here as Olive, an unnoticed and unpopular high school girl who realises she can find the attention she seeks (not to mention better her financial standing) through lies and a clever manipulation of the school's rumour mill.<br/><br/>Upon hearing the basic plot, you might feel an uneasy suspicion creeping in that the underlying construct here – unpopular teen achieves popularity through some drastic change in their lifestyle, and gets one over on the popular kids who used to give her a hard time – might sound like one we've seen one too many times before (and usually not done very well), but leave any preconceived notions about what you think you might be in for at the door; as this film aims to subvert the modes of the teen drama at every turn and does it incredibly well.<br/><br/>Burt V. Royal's script is astute and clever. The dialogue is fresh and humorous, in a Juno-like manner, only outstripping Juno's achievements by far; a great many scenes are brilliantly funny, creating a wonderful and fun overall tone for the piece.<br/><br/>The film is current to the degree that it factors technology into the plot in a manner that makes it vitally integral to the story; Olive delivers her confession to everyone by uploading a video of it onto the internet – a nod to the YouTube generation. And facebook is of course dealt with too, with Olive's very likable teacher Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church) reiterating facebook sceptics' main complaint with the social network: that status updates are boring, not to mention the fact that it can be used as a method of surveillance and tab keeping for anyone who endeavours to document their every action on there.<br/><br/>Why Stone hasn't shot to stardom long before now is one of the great mysteries of Hollywood. Her gorgeous looks, sexily husky voice and excellent comic timing has always marked her out as a unique force in the business, and her versatility and talent as an actress has been proved before now (perhaps best with her wonderful turn in Paper Man in 2009), but the role of Olive proves the perfect vehicle for Stone to showcase her skills, assuring her star status now, if it was ever in question before. Stanley Tucci is another actor who also shines here, as Olive's unbearably cool and sharply witty father.<br/><br/>The speed at which the school's rumour mill works and travels is wonderfully represented through some excellent camera work, as quite lengthy shots zoom at high speed through the school's grounds, pausing regularly to observe various people as they first hear the rumours about Olive's promiscuity.<br/><br/>The film deals with its delicate concept well – Stone herself has stated she has at times been concerned about the possibility that the film might glamorise promiscuity among younger girls, but the film manages to retain a sturdy moral foothold in the background of proceedings, which it also smartly uses to end on.<br/><br/>The absurdity of religious fanaticism is also touched upon, with Amanda Bynes' character Marianne's Christian group running a domineering and imposing presence within Olive's school. Olive intelligently disregards the group's nonsense, but also turns to religion later in the film when she is desperate to absolve her conscience.<br/><br/>The literary basis here is used to great effect beyond Olive's story paralleling that of Hawthorne's The Scarlett Letter, through one neatly later reverted back to Huckleberry Finn joke.<br/><br/>We are even treated to a little 80s nostalgia being thrown into the mix here, as Olive bemoans the loss of chivalry in modern day courtship (who doesn't want John Cusack holding up a boom box for them outside their window?) by reminiscing over love scenes in 80s movies.<br/><br/>This is by far the best teen comedy to come out of Hollywood in ages, and will hopefully be praised for its qualities and inventiveness for a long time to come, as well as gain Stone the true recognition that she deserves."

","I had gone into watching Emma Stone's Easy A with some expectations of a smart teen comedy about reputations and the stereotypes of characterizations that one expects when those kinds of things arise but I got a lot more with the mostly smart dialogue that references everything from the Demi Moore version of The Scarlet Letter to the '80s teen hit films like those of John Hughes (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off), Cameron Crowe (Say Anything...), and Patrick Dempsey (Can't Buy Me Love). There's a few more but I'll just say that I was just overjoyed at both the funny and touching moments that permeated the whole thing and loved not only the performances of Ms. Stone but also Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as her parents, Amanda Bynes as her religious-nut enemy, Thomas Haden Church as her favorite teacher, and Lisa Kudrow as a not-always normal guidance counselor, among others. Nothing more to say except Easy A comes highly recommended."

","High school student Olive Penderghast finds herself the victim of her school's ""rumor mill"" when she lies to her best friend Rhiannon about a weekend tryst with a fictional college freshman. Word quickly spreads of Olive's promiscuity and, much to her surprise, she welcomes the attention. When she agrees to help out a bullied friend by pretending to sleep with him, her image rapidly degrades to a more lascivious state and her world begins to spin out of control. As she helps more and more of her classmates and her lies continue to escalate, Olive must find a way to save face before the school's religious fanatic Marianne gets her expelled and she loses a shot at attaining her own happiness. <br/><br/>Emma Stone shines as Olive. She plays the character without making you hate her. You can see why she did and you support her even though other people do. Plus she can deliver fast lines and look amazing in normally trashy clothes. Alyson Michalka keeps popping up everywhere. First Hellcats and the roommate and now this. She plays Olive's BFF who is proud to be known as big tits. I don't quite understand how this friendship came to be but it did. WIthout her Olive never would have even made up the fling so I guess she's to blame for everything. Olive's parents are enjoyable and funny. Stanley Tucci, who is a complete genius, and Patricia Clarkson play completely oblivious, yet loving parents to Olive. Their timing is so funny. My only issue is why did they have to have the adopted son? He didn't add anything and I don't think he added anything. Amanda Bynes, who i normally love, played the enemy of Olive since she's a deeply religious person. I didn't really like her, but I could see where she was coming from in terms of religion. Penn Badgley, who I normally hate, wasn't annoying. He played Olive's crush who somehow knew her favorite things. (STALKER) Loved how he kept popping up everywhere. Thomas Haden Church played the cool teacher who was teaching Olive's English class about the Scarlet Letter. Felt totally sorry for his character, but like his performance. Overall, go see this movie. It won't let you down. I found the language used and how they talked identical to the halls at my high school and my mother even liked it, and she's 52. It might not be completely realistic, in terms of wearing what she wore to school, but everything else is pretty much to a tee. Every high schooler just wants to be recognized and get the one guy they like. My favorite moment of the whole movie was the end where Penn showed up with his tractor and speakers. What girl could say no to that?"

Emma Stone is extremely charming as Olive, a girl rumored to be the biggest slut in the school & Amanda Bynes is hysterical in her condemnation of Olive, as the leader of an extremist ""Jesus freak"" after school club. It's set up in the 80's rom-com style, which actually brings a fresher light on the stale Gossip Girl type crowd that's developed today. Here's to hoping we see more movies like this in the future!"

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","4","1","3","26 September 2018"," Kind of mean-spirited, not all that entertaining and strangely out-dated, to boot.
","Most of 'Easy A (2010)' ends up coming across kind of mean-spirited, especially in regards to its minority groups. It perpetuates some pretty out-dated, stereotypical ideals surrounding the need to 'fit in', even if you fake it, and the 'outsider' status that apparently comes with any kind of non-conformity. These elements both feel decidedly out of place in a 2010 picture, considering that society - and, even, high-school itself - had already moved past that kind of thinking (for the most part, at least). There's also an issue with the flick playing into the sub-genre's wider problem of sexualising teenagers, which is 'normalised' somewhat since adult actors are portraying the young characters, and the sense that the film adds to the problem of gender-imbalance when it comes to the perception of sex itself. It's a good step-forward that the picture has a female lead, don't get me wrong, but the way it handles its subject matter almost seems to do more harm than good. There are a few more specific story problems, with the keenest of which being that our 'hero' proactively gets herself into most of her own troubles, without much development done to explore why, which makes it slightly difficult to empathise with her - or some of her actions, at least - and reduces wider audience investment. The ending itself also isn't so much a solution as a 'brush under the rug and hope nobody notices'. Overall, the feature is just not funny or all that entertaining, either, and it's pretty difficult to see what the point of it all is, aside from pushing a few generic and, frankly, unfulfilled morals that should be obvious to begin with. 4/10"

Her life began to follow the same pattern of ""the scarlet letter"" plot.<br/><br/>This makes a very interesting story and the actors are just awesome. Emma Stone really showed her true potential in this movie, switching between completely different attitudes (From regular to sad, passing through slut). The result is outstanding and the crew is does a hell out of a job.<br/><br/>To make it short, I think this is a lovely movie that worths a night of yours in the movies. I totally recommend it.

","This was a Saturday evening I dreaded. The previous weekend, my wife and younger daughter accompanied me to one of the few action movies that came out this year. The obvious understanding was that I would go with them to a movie of their choosing. At first, this did not seem so bad, since my daughter is not drawn to chick flickstoo often. Well as the reimbursement weekend rolled around, I was pretty confident my daughter would select a movie with some tasteful blood and guts. To my dismay, both my wife and daughter said the flick they had opted for was, 'Easy ""A""'. I am not sure if my initial reaction was complete fear or utter disgustwhatever it wasit was visible. I kicked, screamed and cried all the way to our seat. To break the pre-movie monotony, my daughter and I counted men entering the theater6 to 10 with about 500 womena little voice echoed in my mind, 'this is the mother of all chick flicks.' This is too long of an introbut I truly enjoyed the movie. It was funny and the acting was excellent. Of course this does not mean I will jump at the next opportunity to see a chick flickbut I may not go with as much kicking and screaming."
"StevePulaski","9","1","3","27 September 2010"," A John Hughes Teenager Movie Minus John Hughes
","Easy A does something almost no teenager movie does nowadays. It takes the theme and overall feel of a John Hughes movie. That alone awards the film two stars that it goes down the path of a true director/writer/producer. John Hughes was an inspiration and a legend in the filmmaking industry who's films will never even be matched by movies in the future. Though Easy A is well aware John Hughes is no part of this, but it takes elements and treats it like Hughes Gold which is the part I like. It even shows clips from The Breakfast Club, Say Anything, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Sixteen Candles in comparison to our lead character which was something I thought was dead in movies. Never would I have thought a current film, made in 2010, utilize and reflect on the characters brought to us on a piece of art made by John Hughes.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is a woman of talent. Her perky attitude and gorgeous smile makes her one of the top female actresses in Hollywood today. This movie makes her. She was backup in Superbad and Zombieland now she finally gets the lead role spot she deserves. Every actor/actress needs a lead movie role, but only few put them on top. While Taylor Lautner had a role when he was younger in The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl, but girls didn't start paying attention to his abs until his breakout with The Twilight Saga finally emerged and since then he has been labeled ""hot"" by every girl in the United States. With Emma Stone's first real lead role in a movie she does a remarkable job and is just a pleasure to see on screen.<br/><br/>The plot involves Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), a clean cut High School student who is overheard by the religious fanatic girl Marianne (Amanda Bynes) while talking with her best friend. Olive and her friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) mention the word ""virginity"" and ""sex"" a few times leaving Marianne under the assumption Olive lost her virginity over the weekend. The rumor spreads throughout the High School (coming from someone who got of the middle school bus not to long ago I can say rumors spread faster than the news of Michael Jackson's death) and everyone now labels Olive as a Jezebel, slut, tramp, every derogatory name in the book.<br/><br/>Olive figures that if people think she's a slut, she'll show no shame in acting like one, sewing a scarlet ""A"" on her clothing, a reference from Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel ""The Scarlet Letter"" which Olive is reading in her English class. Both coincide with each other since Olive and ""The Scarlet Letter""'s character Hester both are in the boat of dealing with sexual abstinence and taking very similar acts and approaches in the film. Things only get worse when after her homosexual friend is tormented at school and begs her to have ""fake sex"" with him at a party so he will be the ""stud"" and not looked down upon. Olive goes into business doing this for other kids and it only sinks her reputation lower and lower.<br/><br/>This film definitely takes a path of it's own when it seems it's following the crowd. I couldn't tell you the wasteland of crap teen movies we have nowadays. In fact, I believe the last good teen film of the 2000 - 2009 decade I saw was Mean Girls a few months ago. So starting off the decade with something like this is excellent. it's in no way recycled. While the teenager plot can be excused because that part just establishes the overall attitude and sense of the film. But having being parallel to a novel and having a perky, upbeat, never dull premise and characters I was consistently amused at Easy A's constant effort and how high in quality it held in an attempt to be like a John Hughes film.<br/><br/>Easy A is Emma Stone's gem in her filmography. This will be her best movie for a long time. While her part in Superbad was only brief and her role in Zombieland wasn't her at all as she played a Gothic/Emo character which was out of the ordinary. Easy A pretty much establishes a personality close to hers. Excusing the sexual abstinence part, she probably is a ""clean cut High School girl"". The topic of sexual abstinence is one usually overshadowed by safe sex and is rarely talked about among parental conversations I can assure, but overall, it is dealt with well in this movie and the outcome is nothing but satisfying. It's also refreshing to here Simple Minds' amazing song ""Don't You Forget About Me"" in a new movie and the reflection of John Hughes clips. That is the cherry on the sundae.<br/><br/>Starring: Emma Stone, Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Cam Gigandet, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell, Alyson Michalka, Stanley Tucci. Directed by: Will Gluck."

"MovieProductions","7","1","3","19 September 2010"," This is an Easy ""B""
","*** out of (****)<br/><br/>Easy A, advertised as another paint-by-numbers, textbook high school drama extravaganza with little redemption and originality and where style tops substance. Emma Stone as the lead looked very unconvincing as she hasn't been the lead in any of her films and no one could replace Lindsay Lohan in the iconic ""Mean Girls"". After seeing this film get critically acclaimed and praised, I ventured off to see it on a late Friday night. To my surprise, Easy A is one of those rare high school flicks that is just so effective and is heavily devoid of clichés, predictability, and dry characters. Pretty much every other high school flick has been pretty subpar, with the exception of ""Mean Girls"". While Easy A is certainly not one of the best films of the year, it's worth the hefty admission. With so many soulless and energy drained flicks that are only worth a fraction of what you spend on a movie ticket, Easy A is worth all your ten bucks. <br/><br/>Easy A, which bares some resemblance to the notorious ""The Scarlet Letter"", the film even heavily references it, revolves around Olive who feels invisible to everyone at high school. Olive talks to her friend in the bathroom about a guy Olive ""dated"" and her friend thinks that Olive lost her virginity to the guy. To compromise with her friend, Olive decides to lie about losing her V-card, although, Olive's past Christian fanatic friend overhears them in the bathroom and Olive's lie is inevitably being spread. After this mishap, Olive's homosexual friend asks Olive to moan and make suggestive sounds in a room, where everyone hears, so that people think they have sex, which they don't. Olive agrees to it and now all the nerdy, outcast guys are asking Olive to do the same favor, and rather than neglect it, she milks the attention she's getting. What she doesn't know, is that acting promiscuous can give some guys the wrong idea.<br/><br/>First off, a majority of ""Easy A"" works because of its script. There is so much wit, references, and dry-pan humor, that this script is probably one of the freshest scripts of the year. Most typical high school films have a mediocre script which heavily references pop culture and expects the audience to play along. ""Easy A"" has a few more brain cells and rather takes the road less traveled by. Furthermore, the characters in this movie are very likable and fulfill their duties. Emma Stone's performance is so charismatic and fulfilling, if Lohan were to retire a potential ""Mean Girls"" sequel, the audience would have no complaints about Stone filling in. Actually, in some ways, Stone tops Lohan's delivery. Moreover, the pacing is also highly effective. Scenes go by pretty briskly, without the film feeling too short either. Additionally, the cinematography is pretty much eye candy. This film looks very vibrant and the colors jump off of the screen. It's definitely the epitome of a high school flick. <br/><br/>While ""Easy A"" soars, there are a few problems. Firstly, the middle kind of sags and almost brings the charismatic outing down. The audience is introduced to a more serious tone and this hurts the film's harmless atmosphere and feels awfully depressing. Furthermore, while the film is pretty much devoid of predictability, the resolution is highly predictable, which is passable considering the rest of the film is pretty unique. Lastly, I found that some of the jokes were hit and miss. For a comedy, the jokes didn't pack that much of a punch, but then again, it takes a lot for me to laugh. However, that's acceptable because the humor doesn't resort to cheap gags or schoolyard puns, instead it relies on witty delivery. <br/><br/>Don't let the director credits fool you. This film may have been directed by the same man that gave us the mediocrity ""Fired Up"", but Gluck has vastly improved. ""Easy A"" is a wholly effective comedy because it relies on an enthralling script, solid character development, and a smooth pace. All the elements of a well-made film are here and for once in a blue moon, you can seal your brains on. Has there been a film that looks ""copy-and-paste"" but turns out to be the complete opposite and is worth every cent you spend? ""Easy A"" is a pretty good example of that. I recommend it."

Bert V. Royal knocks out a script that is old-school witty and charming and intentionally dredges up homages to Hughes classics like ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""Say Anything"" A totally enjoyable movie for teens and adults alike."

","Well, I was definitely not the target audience for this movie, but I am sure that any teenage girl who ever felt out of place, felt like an outcast, or ever had any kind of trouble in High School will relate to this movie (or at least parts of it).<br/><br/>The movie is straight forward and very easy to understand, and it portrays the characters in ways that you can easily get into the movie and sympathize for the characters. And hats off to Emma Stone for her performance in the movie, she was simply put, quite good in this movie. And also, Thomas Haden Church brought a lot of color and depth to the movie with his role, as did Amanda Bynes with her role.<br/><br/>I had thought this movie to be another funny teenage comedy, but boy was I wrong. This is far from being just another pointless teen comedy with cheap laughs and shallow punch lines. Obviously, the movie is directed at teenage girls, but I think the movie does bring something out to the viewers, regardless of sex, age and such. The whole movie is built up around rumors, how they start, how they spread, and how they affect the people involved, and it did so in a good manner. And being the Hollywood movie that it is, of course, it had a sassy ending. Not spoiling it here by saying how it ends, but trust me, you will see it coming a mile away.<br/><br/>If you, like me, saw this movie with the hopes of it being a comedy, you will be disappointed. Sure there are moments that had comedy value, but not enough to actually make you laugh out loud, or enough to be labeled a comedy as per se. There is a deeper meaning to this movie, and you will appreciate that fully if you are a teenage girl in High School, or if you were a teenage girl in High School in the past.<br/><br/>Not a bad movie at all, just wished I had known what it was about prior to seeing it, and would have had some type of heads up on it."
"DICK STEEL","10","1","5","16 November 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Easy A
","Here Emma Stone fits like hand in glove as Olive, one of the many unknowns in her high school, who is neither brainy nor nerdy nor pretty enough to be noticed, going about her own business with nary anyone giving two hoots about, except perhaps for best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka from Bandslam). One thing she learns though is how rumours get spread around like wildfire, and having seen the effects of how her little lie about a weekend one night stand, get to make its ugly rounds around campus. Soon she helps a gay acquaintance who's not ready to get out of the closet yet by pretending to have an orgasmic session during a party, and the rest, as they say, is history as she gains notoriety, and overnight becomes THE girl in school, and a go-to person for the down and the trodden to seek help with affirming their studly status, for a price of course.<br/><br/>So what price that of a simple, harmless lie, if only to assist others in need to find their self- worth and self-esteem back amongst their peers, even at the expense of being labelled as a skank or a whore? The story grapples with this dilemma in a comical fashion, but when you think about it, is one's reputation easily traded for money and gifts, or is it something to be protected against baseless accusations, or what if one is responsible for purporting these rumours in the first place for acting the part, like what Olive does with her wardrobe and attitude transformation, especially when one is basking in the limelight and the grabbing all the attention, than to be ignored and unnoticed. And who says what will happen if you repeat a lie enough times so much so that they become the ""truth""?<br/><br/>The main driver that made this movie the fun romp it is, is the rapid fire wordplay in the dialogues. It's just been too long that a film came by to provide that witty, and cheeky even, conversational pieces between characters, and Stone, together with her parents played by Stanely Tucci and Patricia Clarkson who chew up all the limited scenes they're in with their charisma, provide plenty of that in their dysfunctional family of sorts, though I must admit it's a pretty novel, risky and unconventional way to bring up the kids, but if the rapport is as what's seen in the film, I'd say why not.<br/><br/>Director Will Gluck also crafted the film in a unique fashion, with multiple narrative ideas running, each introducing a different dilemma for our heroine, splitting them up into logical chapters before wrapping everything up neatly, and I mean that in a nice way, and not the convenient cop out, though one can always fall back on the inevitable cliché especially on the romantic subplot where it dwells on not realizing that true love has always been there waiting from the start. And not to forget with most chick flicks, the relationships with the best friend forever type, and the archetypical enemy who just cannot stand the sight of the other.<br/><br/>Bert V. Royal's story also seemed to have an axe to grind with the hypocritical religious zealots, and while they play out for most of the laugh out loud comedic moments in the film (as we identify their traits amongst some folks all of us definitely have our brushes with), you can't help but feel that some may feel slighted by the portrayal, or even that of a particular group who get passed off as cheap misers in the film. I think comedies probably have a leeway where on one hand pokes fun, but on the other raises some serious thoughts about what's actually happening right under our nostrils. And not to forget his homage to the 80s romantic comedies that will hit a nostalgic spot for film fans who grew up in that era.<br/><br/>Supporting Emma Stone is a slate of recognizable stars who make the most and best use of their limited screen time. Leading the charge is Thomas Haden Church as Olive's favourite teacher in school, who stays fairly non-judgemental and thinks Olive's rebellious ways is but a phase to outgrow. Lisa Kudrow plays his wife and councillor in the school who has a dirty secret that her mister is unaware of, and though introduced late in the film, is quite instrumental in providing that catalyst for a conclusion. Kudrow still hasn't lost her comedic timing yet. Malcolm McDowell shows up as the no nonsense principal of the public school, and his sarcasm is quite top notch.<br/><br/>But Easy A also demonstrates the fickleness of the Hollywood starlet system, and how you're popular one day, and quite forgotten the next. We haven't seen Amanda Bynes for quite a while, and she stars here not as the protagonist as one may think she would, but as the antagonistic fiend of Olive's who is quite misguided in her faith, hypocritical in thinking she can, heaven willing, change Olive and smack her back on the right path of righteousness. However, as all sinners can attest to, her mouth is also quick to hurl insults. Not a favourite character of mine, and definitely very negative, but hey, kudos to Bynes for taking up a character against type and trying to expand the range of roles she can handle. Ana quite well at that too.<br/><br/>For the excellent casting, story and that dialogue that's music to the ears, this is one chick flick that I enjoyed enough to shortlist into my favourites for this year. Highly recommended stuff, even if you're a guy and wondering whether such chicks do exist to lend a hand or two. For a price of course. Highly recommended! And I'm not telling you a lie!"

But one day, when she tells her friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) what she wants to hear, she ends up adding a reputation to her list of issues.<br/><br/>The reputation bizarrely combines with Olive's compassion for her friend Brandon (Dan Byrd), and the next thing you know, her reputation has grown beyond control. What's a girl to do? Well, in Olive's case, she decides to grab onto the reputation along with everything it means, and ride it for all it's worth.<br/><br/>Olive's favorite teacher, Mr. Griffth (Thomas Haden Church) knows something's going on, but he doesn't know what. Mrs. Griffith (Lisa Kudrow), the guidance counselor at the school where her husband teaches, knows something's going on, but what she knows isn't actually what it is. Crusading Christian Marianne (Amanda Bynes) thinks she knows something, but doesn't really want to know anything. Olive's parents, Rosemary (Patricia Clarkson) and Dill (Stanley Tucci) are entirely understanding of something they don't know they don't understand at all. And Woodchuck Todd (Penn Badgley)? Olive would just as soon he didn't know or understand anything at all! <br/><br/>Easy A sounds like a fairly simplistic premise and to some extent it is. But the script is clever in ways that raise it above the basic idea, and what could be a confusing mess is actually presented with a winning combination of clarity, humor, and feeling. Much of the cohesiveness of the movie as a whole can be credited to some very skillful edits. And I loved the literary references which, far from stuffy, were actually funny and all too appropriate additions.<br/><br/>It doesn't hurt that the acting is, in most cases, stellar. Emma Stone is perfectly cast as Olive. For all her occasional drama, I would have liked her when I was in high school and, considering that I hated everybody when I was in high school, that's saying something! I wanted to slap Amanda Bynes, and that means she did a superb job bringing Marianne to life. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci were a pure delight to watch every time they were on screen. I also really enjoyed seeing Malcolm McDowell in a small role as the school principal.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Easy A wasn't as funny as I thought and hoped it would be, but it was somehow more moving than I'd imagined. There are laughs, but there are also tears and a few scenes where your own high school years will likely creep up on you and give a little extra kick to the happy or sad of the moment. The teens in the theatre, though, seemed to be entirely wrapped up in the immediacy of the film, and laughed more than I did. Of course, their high school memories are yet to be made...<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: None.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: Easy A is rated PG for ""mature thematic elements involving teen sexuality, language and some drug material."" Because of those elements, I can't recommend Easy A for young children. Older teens, though (16 or so and up), will likely really enjoy the movie, and if you've got a sense of humor about high school, you will, too."

How long will she keep the lie ?<br/><br/>Emma Stone was great in this film. I think the highlight of this movie is Emma's charcther being super obsessed with Natasha Bedingfields song Pocketful of Sunshine where at first Olive hated the song and then she became hooked to the song.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes plays a nosy teen who later befriends Olive. Also starring Lisa Kudrow,Stanley Gucci Penn Badgesy and Dan Byrd. If you enjoyed Mean Girls then you'll probably like this film. It also has a throwback to the 80s .<br/><br/>6/10

"loverofchelsea","6","0","1","29 June 2017"," Average film with a little cliché plot
","Easy A I believe is a blockbuster of a movie that was provided as a springboard for Emma Stone to be noticed for the big screen movie La La Land. A rather satirical piece with intelligent writing in the way the character Olive Penderghast structures how her reputation was going through the motions whilst she was at high school and how she told the story of faking having sex with loads of people and spreading the word around school. A rather noticeable big name cast as well in Amanda Bynes (Marianne), Lisa Kudrow (Mrs. Griffith) and even star of Quantico Johanna Braddy (Melody Bostic) The only thing that stops me from rating this movie higher than I am is the fact of the location and the plot itself of normal teen little shy talked about in middle school around the losing your virginity topic and being obsessed. Would still recommend to see as it does what it says the genre is. A comedy but one that's a little on the funny ha ha and peculiar side."

","When I sat down to watch this movie I wasn't expecting anything more than a boring, half-spun, tale of a misunderstood teenager where everything in her life goes wrong and she does stupid things to set them right. Throw in a love affair or two in there too. <br/><br/>But NO. Easy A was surprisingly thought provoking and hilarious. It was simply and clean cut. The execution was flawless for such a simple plot. The characters were well written and the actors who played them were well cast. <br/><br/>After having seen a string of unoriginal, bland chick flicks the genre has basically been reduced to a category of nonsensical, waste-time movies in my opinion. It's wonderful to see some intelligent film makers out there who can combine the woes of growing up, make a lesson of it and portray it in a comic light. <br/><br/>There is nothing about this movie that I disliked... except that it was too short. I hope they make a sequel. I recommend you go watch it."
"The-Sarkologist","8","0","1","7 January 2012"," Not what I expected from a Teen Comedy
","It is difficult to say whether this book is a modernised version of Nathaneal Hawthorne's 'The Scarlet Letter' set in a American highschool, especially since I have not read the book, but it is a good movie nonetheless. The story is about a small lie and how the small lie gets blown out of proportion. The movie is centered around an innocent woman named Olive who decides that she does not want to go on a camping trip with her friend's hippie parents so says that she has a big date that weekend. However, after the weekend, her friend believes that she finally got laid, and then the rumour spreads.<br/><br/>It doesn't end there because some of the guys learn that she really did not get laid, and her homosexual friend, who is persecuted because of his homosexuality, convinces her to pretend to sleep with him at a party, and of course this also spreads like wildfire. However, it spreads in two ways. Among most people it is that she slept with him at the party, but among others, it is because she is willing to say that she slept with somebody when she actually did not.<br/><br/>As such this movie is about a lie and about how lies can spread and how they can ruin somebody's reputation, and that once the lie has taken hold it becomes very difficult to then bring the truth to light. Most movies about lies are about how lies never actually hold true. This movie is different, but in a way it is the same. Lies never really help anybody, even the simple 'white' lies. This white lie seemed innocent at first, but in the end it was because nobody wanted to know the truth, and for those that did know the truth, because it benefited them, they did not want to truth to become known.<br/><br/>As with most modern movies, everything does tend to turn out okay in the end, that is for those whom we want it to turn out well. For those that we begin to dislike we finish the movie glad that they have been punished. However, life is never like that, and that is the case with lies. We all lie, and there is no way to get around that. I myself try not to lie, and I tend to feel repugnant when I do lie, however the temptation is always there. Moreso, we want to lie to make ourselves feel better than we really are, or to impress people that we want to impress. Obviously it is easy to tell people not to lie, but in the end, what we need to realise, and experience, is that lies always end up backfiring."
"freemantle_uk","6","0","1","7 January 2012"," The pitfalls of high school
","Easy A was one of the big comedy hits of 2010, a film with a low budget that made a healthy profit and earn a lot of critical acclaim. It was also a film that helped confirm Emma Stone's raising star and let Will Gluck wash away the nasty film Fired Up from our collective consciousness.<br/><br/>Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) is a 17-year-old high school that is invisible in her high school in Ojai, California. Her life changes when a rumour spreads like wildfire that she lost her virginity and many forms of the tale emerge. Her gay friend Brandon (Dan Byrd) asks her if she pretends to have sex with him so that would end all the bullying he suffers. Soon Olive embraces her new identity as the school slut and turns it into a parody and gets paid to pretend she sleep or committed other acts to people who need to enhance their reputations. But soon everything starts to spiral out of control, including being the target of fundamental Christians led by Marianne (Amanda Bynes).<br/><br/>The big positive of Easy A is Emma Stone is a natural comedian, delivering her lines with expert timing and just seemed so natural and real in the role. She is a character is wise beyond her years and is a very smart and self confession character, willing to take on the rumours head-on. Will Gluck has a moment of directional flashes with slowing how the rumours spread around the school. Bert V. Royal also does deliver a witty script with good lines throughout.<br/><br/>My big problem with Easy A is a lot of the characters felt like over-the-top characterchures what they are meant to be. We got a fundamentalist Christian that runs her sect like a cult, who dresses in stereotypical female preppy way who thinks everything that does not stay in line to her narrow world view then it is a sin and that everything was God's will: if the character was Jewish or Muslim it would be considered highly offensive. I cannot picture a character like that being liked or popular or influential in any way and if anything would have been told shut or simply ignored by most of the students. As well this is a film set in California, where even Republicans tend to be are socially fairly liberal. It would have made more sense to set Easy A in a more typically Republican/Socially Conservative state like in the Bible Belt or in the Mid-West. Olive's parents are actually very annoying with their banner and interaction and it really did not feel like a real parent-daughter relationship. They just seem too causal about what was going on with their daughter.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is meant to be playing a character that is an outsider, a character who is ignore by the majority of her peers. Stone is a glorious, striking red hair, how could boys not interested in her? She would easily be a popular girl and in any reality Olive would have lots of friends, whether she was a cheerleader or a alternative click. This clique system that is shown in films does really exist and it would be a much more mixed picture of friends. Plus the rumour that spreads and mutates is that a 17-year-old girl looses her virginity to an older man, woo: like that has never happened before. If it turned out the girl was only 14 then I think her year/grade would be talk or if the girl had a more down to earth look and a quiet personality. A character like Olive in reality would not care, she would just carry on with does would not worry about what people think about her because she knows the truth.<br/><br/>I believe that the double standard the film show is true, that if a boy has sex in high school he is a stud, become popular but if a girl has sex she is a slag, someone who become a source of notoriety. But most of the time boys lie and big themselves up.<br/><br/>Stone also uses the word 'twat' and I was annoyed because I though if they use the word at least pronounce it properly. And I question why is Malcolm MacDowell in this and why does the school have a English principal? Were there no American/Canadian actors available or even an actor that could do an American accent? Overall Easy A is a decent film, it does have good dialogue and it funny, but it is not the great comic masterpiece some critics seem to think it is. It is a fantasy world, not a real picture of what high school life is like.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"perkypops","9","0","2","24 December 2011"," Super script and a great performance from Emma Stone
","You know a good film from early on as it sucks you in and refuses to let you go until the credits roll. Emma Stone (as Olive) sucks you in right from the start after an inventive title sequence which lasts well into the films first few minutes. Stone is not just perfectly cast for the role of Olive she delivers every ounce of sharpness from a terrific script and screenplay. And the characters around Olive are just so perfectly pitched and played by a very strong support.<br/><br/>It is hard to dislike this film or its multi-layered messages about how we deceive ourselves as we seek to deceive others, and how we'd like to have something stronger than the truth to suck and see especially when the revealed fiction is about someone we can watch being destroyed. Olive becomes an unlikely target for destruction because truth bores the pants off of others in her life.<br/><br/>But Olive is not the destructive type. In fact Olive has a heart so big it gets her into all kinds of mischief and it is just a question of how far things will go before she breaks if indeed she has a breaking point.<br/><br/>The film is fun to watch with some real laugh out loud moments but it still manages to get its messages across at every opportunity. So I award a maximum ten to Emma Stone and a handsome nine to the film as a whole. Recommended with a warning (You will want to watch it all over again)."

","There are many references to John Hughes films in Easy A, as there are to The Scarlet Letter (not the Demi Moore version). The film lights up the shadow it casts over itself with charming and likable characters. Tucci and Clarkson are undoubtedly the coolest movie parents of all time. Their banter is excruciatingly sweet and hysterical, such as Tucci's riffing on his adopted son ""Where are you from originally?"". Stone can be a bit precocious, but manages to avoid annoying arrogance or self awareness, like Juno. It's a film that deals with exploitation of those that are willing to help others. Perhaps trying a bit too hard to achieve Hughes greatness is the only real drawback this film suffers from."

","Though I have never been very impressed by director John Hughes, much less the Hughes parody films, I found myself engaged and even enthralled by Will Gluck's Easy A. The premise is intelligent in the fact that it takes Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter as its literary and character template. Gluck than combines this with John Hughes parody to create this original, even provocative film. The lines and dialogue are conveyed well by Stone and Bynes scores a hit as a snotty church girl with a lot of hang-ups. I was surprised to find that I had no hang-ups with this teen comedy that is actually worth seeing or even a second viewing."

"ajs-10","7","0","1","22 October 2011"," A lot better than expected!... I'll even go so far as to say I liked it!... a bit...
","As some of you may know, I'm not big on comedies. It may be because I have a peculiar sense of humour, but, for the most part, what Hollywood thinks is funny is usually antipodean to my opinion (bet you're looking up what 'antipodean' means now). I'll still keep trying them out form time to time though you never know, there just might be someone out there in 'La La land' on the same wavelength as me! And so we come to 'Easy A'; a teen comedy (not encouraging so far), all about a girl of (alleged) easy virtue (still not encouraging, but hey, I've come this far). Well, despite many misgivings, I must say it wasn't half as bad as I thought it might be (& that's high praise from me! for a comedy). Now, since I've been accused of giving too much away in my plot summaries, I will just give you the very briefest outline of what it's about (you'll probably get more from the trailer than I usually give away but, (sigh), if I'm getting complaints I guess I'd better pare it down a tad or 12).<br/><br/>Olive Penderghast is at high school and she lies to her friend, Rhiannon, about sleeping with a boy (for reasons I won't go into). As they do, rumours spread like wildfire, and before she knows it, Olive finds herself with an unwanted reputation. The question is what is she going to do about it?... So there you go, the new and improved 'outline' Hope you liked it and I didn't spoil the entire movie for you If I did then you have my profound apologies.<br/><br/>I said earlier that I didn't find this film too bad, well, I might even go so far as to say I actually enjoyed parts of it quite a bit! I thought Patricia Clarkson as Rosemary (Olive's mother) and Stanley Tucci as Dill (her dad) provided a great comic foil for her character. Her favourite teacher, Mr Griffith, played by Thomas Haden Church, and his wife, played by Lisa Kudrow, also added another dimension to the piece. Of course, it was Emma Stone, as Olive, that held the whole thing together, and I thought she put in an excellent performance. Honourable mentions go to; Malcolm McDowell as Principal Gibbons, Penn Badgley as Woodchuck Todd, Amanda Bynes as Marianne, Dan Byrd as Brandon and Aly Michalka as Rhiannon.<br/><br/>A witty script with some great dialogue made a welcome change from many recent (so called) comedy efforts I've seen spewed out of 'tinsel town' in recent years. It also has a pretty good soundtrack with some tunes even I recognised! There is a minor problem with it though The way Olive chooses to deal with her problem is dragged on a bit too long and after a while it gets a bit monotonous. Fortunately it picks up though and it got saved from a lower score by a rather cool ending (sorry no clues). Over all, although not perfect, I found this a witty, pretty well written and entertaining comedy Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 7.1/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 61,651 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 86/100 (based on 174 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."

","When this movie first came out almost a year ago, I didn't think about it. I didn't plan on ever watching it, I had heard good things about it, but I just thought it was a chick flick. When in fact the movie is more of a romantic comedy, and a funny one at that, I'm still not sure if I liked this or Date Night more, but both were very good movies.<br/><br/>The film does feel much like an 80's movie, mostly John Huges movies like Ferris Bueller, Breakfast Club, as well as others. Now I was born in the 90's, but I do have a love for 80's films, like Back to the Future, Star Wars 5 and 6, and the John Hughes movie's I've seen. And this definitely brought that same style.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is brilliant, this is the only movie I've seen her in so far, but she is now one of my favorite actresses, that is how good she was. But for me, Amanda Bynes stole the show, I loved the Amanda Show, and she is definitely just as witty here.<br/><br/>Well there are some jokes that fall flat, and it may seem like it's trying to hard to be like 80's high school movies than it's own movie, I still found myself loving most of it."
"TheHrunting","Null","0","1","28 July 2011"," Imaginary foreplay is the newest rage
","""Easy A"" is about a mixup that spirals out of control in a moderately populated town high school in California that blends literature, religious fanaticism, homages to '80s John Hughes flicks as well as adolescents at their peak with hormones. This is frequently narrated with snappy dialogue that's self-aware of its every move to a fault, as it often arrives at conclusions even before it allows the viewer to. It includes some humorously awkward situations of high school life, as well as pokes fun at other teen flicks even though it ironically embraces some of the same clichés. Minus the honesty and self-degradation and it's still riding as a passenger on the same train.<br/><br/>Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) is overheard in the ladies room by the do-gooder Marianne Bryant (Amanda Bynes) when she tells her best friend Rhi (Aly Michalka) that she slept with a fictional guy named George despite still being a virgin to dodge going on another uncomfortable camping trip. Marianne, being the antagonist of the story and the moral crusader she is, sticks her nose high and uses the modern day equivalent of a rumor mill--text messages and social networks--to self-righteously put Olive, who was previously hidden from view, back in her place. Or so she thought. Olive has a hide thicker than a rhino and attempts to use reverse psychology on her hecklers and simultaneously fake it till she makes it about her own dating status. Marianne's lackeys come at her but she's like instant oatmeal with comebacks. After getting in trouble over calling one the ""T"" word, she serves detention with Brandon (Dan Byrd)--a gay kid who's made fun of and gets into fights--and he begs her to pretend to have sex with him so people will lay off his back. They go to a party so the socially elite can be a witness and both put on a noisy stir in the bedroom while none of the drunkards are the wiser.<br/><br/>Why this charade wasn't stopped short was because Olive has liberal, adoptive parents who still think they're cool and trust that she'll make the right choices and correct her own mistakes. The overly honest mom played by Patricia Clarkson is hilarious because she says everything the daughter doesn't want to hear and doesn't always come with the best advice. Olive goes about in seductive outfits with an ""A"" stitched on relating to a literature story called ""The Scarlet Letter"" and takes it all in with stride as to whether she's gawked at or dismissed. From what at first started out as having sympathy for Brandon, turns into a gift-card giving business where she pretends to give nooky to unconfident guys who want the status but without actually doing the physical deed. This part of the story doesn't exactly transition due to it never being explained that she's greedy or desperately needs money. Though despite her cunning wit that's twice her age, she still seems a little naive with the trappings of a teen as to what she's doing and without exactly thinking about the afterwards. It has moments of causing the pacing to get lost in the shuffle and her character development to feel up and down: one moment helping those who can't help themselves, to going with the flow and then back again when she volunteers to take the rap for someone other than a student. After a date gone bad and a meet up gone right, she wants people to revert their stances to get her life back in order until she finds out people's true colors.<br/><br/>""Easy A"" seems like an abstinence ploy within a ploy, but I digress this isn't out to make a major point about the subject of promiscuity besides to say that you should own up to your own actions and not perpetuate notions if you didn't actually do any action. This is more sarcastic, playful and clever than roll-on-the-floor funny--partly because it seems too well scripted than naturally delivered--but it comes with a relating factor that a chunk of teens go through when it comes time for blossoming sexuality: how to tell what they like, how to go about finding it and most importantly how to do it. Not to mention double standards of girls and boys, and peer pressure to do it and then an opposite pressure not to do it. This has an original take on an age old idea that covers common ground but came with some contrived caricatures such as the I-know-exactly-what-to-say knight in shining armor conveniently showing up at just the right moment despite being peppered throughout and giving a nod to John Cusack. Is that supposed to qualify as a reward? Not to mention what sucked out intrigue was a chunk of the story feels laid out like a spoon fed blueprint with easy little chapters and nearly every nuance told to what's going on even though the story is fairly simple on its own. Fortunately this did right by not having any closing morals pushed on the audience rather than letting them choose themselves where they stand.

","I have been known to like the movies some call ""chick flicks"" but that is not really true. While movies like Serendipity and 10 things I hate about you are two of my favorites I am more of a horror/action-adventure fan. That said, my review of this film is simple: it is one of the best films i have EVER seen. Emma's role - while seemingly an easy one to play, is a very complicated one, and she pulled it off with great ease - The writers gave us a GOOD solid progression of events that were totally believable, All the major roles played their parts perfectly and believably, and the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) humor present throughout this movie kept me watching with great interest waiting for more.<br/><br/>Having been a small and insignificant high school entity back in the day, I sorta could relate to how Emma's character started out. If I knew then what I know now, my life in high school would have been a lot more interesting - not as interesting or lucrative as Emma's character was, but fun to say the least. Ending was not a letdown in any way as a lot of these types of movies are, but left me feeling satisfied and it just ""felt right"""

There are some references to John Hughes' '80s flicks, which might go over the heads of a teen audience.<br/><br/>As other posters had said, it is a stretch and perhaps too much of a suspension of disbelief that Emma Stone's character would be one of the ""invisible"" people in high school culture. A woman who is that good looking with her spunk would be a shoe-in for the popular or A-list crowd for whom high school is fun and games and a huge picnic.<br/><br/>As is typical of Hollywood, this film takes its turn making fun of Christians. In the liberal democrat tradition, any religion is acceptable except Christianity. Imagine the uproar if the film made fun of,say Muslims. I hadn't heard of any Christian groups protesting it, but perhaps they chose not to give this film free advertising or to dignify it with a response.<br/><br/>Overall, not bad, but not great.

This is overheard by leader of the God Squad, Marianne Bryant (Bynes), who promptly spreads the news like wild fire. When another pupil asks for her help to hide his homosexuality by saying they had sex together, Olive, her virginal stock already tarnished, agrees and sets in wheels the motion of a world of fake floozy and financial gain. But pitfalls are surely around the corner<br/><br/>OK, in essence it's just a comic spin on The Scarlet Letter, which Olive and classmates are studying in class, but following on from the great standards set by Clueless and Mean Girls, Easy A has enough vigour, vibrancy and savvy nous to make it one of the best teen comedies post the 1980's. True enough to say that some of the weighty angst themes such as promiscuity, peer pressure and peripheral love are glossed over in favour of lightweight comedy, not to mention the ballsy attack on religion, but still the social comment, all be it wryly, does exist. Besides, it's more fun this way, where the one line zingers and the whippy dialogue come thick and fast, courtesy of a fine script and a wonderful array of characters. Hell, Gluck and Royal even manage to, and get top results from, referencing and homaging those much loved John Hughes and Cameron Crowe movies that so many of us remember fondly. This is very much a successful whole.<br/><br/>The support characters are well rounded, especially the adults, where Church and Kudrow have a potent plot thread, and Tucci and Clarkson, as Olive's easy going parents, almost steal the movie from the teen actors. Seriously, those two might be the coolest parents, ever! But a film of this type could only engage and delight so many if its lead off character turns in a great one. In her first lead vehicle, Emma Stone is a revelation, further delivering on the promise shown in support slots in Superbad and Zombieland. With adroit comic timing and charm in abundance, Stone manages to blend streety cred with star wattage, making it a complete whole. Which when she is asked to be the epicentre for 98% of the lens time, is some going. Backing up Stone is Bynes who is memorable to say the least, whilst it would be wrong to not mention the fine comedy efforts of Badgley and Dan Byrd as potential love interest and gay friend respectively. The former gets the cool moment, the latter gets the laugh out loud fake sex moment.<br/><br/>The breeziness hides just how well acted and how well written it actually is, for it's one of the best of its type and one that just gets better on repeat viewings. 8.5/10"

","So I watched 2010's ""easy A"", starring the current ""I'm a smart complicated actress see I have brunette hair"" chick, I mean Emma Stone. So far I have seen her in other movies playing basically the same character, such as ""zombieland"" (which I liked) and ""the rocker"" which gets an enthusiastic ehhhh. So is this a good movie, I say no. However, though I think the movie is much worse than I am going to admit, I am going to do a first and see this movie through someone else's eyes. I am going to think of this movie's target audience, chiefly mildly interesting and intelligent girls in their mid teens to early thirties. This movie got some pretty warm reviews from both people on IMDb and critics. I didn't like it, I could see how this movie could have been good but just not to me. The parents played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are the best part of the movie. They are the kind of parents I hope to be someday. They are warm, funny, and have an open honest relationship with their kids. The relationship between Thomas Hayden Church and his wife played by Lisa Kudrow is interesting and complex. I even appreciate the multiple homages to John Hughes and other 80's movies that are similar to this one. Overall though I just didn't say wow. But that brings us back to the target audience. Look if you are a female in the age range listed above (and even outside of this range( you will probably like this movie regardless of personal possibly esoteric movie standards. If you are someone enthralled by 80's teen movies you might get a kick out of this. If you like barely legal hot chicks and dudes playing high school kids you might satisfy your personal fetish. However, If you watch only weird indy flicks or a lot of action/thriller movies, you will either hate it or be like me and say ""my life isn't better or worse for having seen this and I didn't try to commit ritual suicide during it, so ehhhhhhhhhh; but really mean eh (which is not as good as ehhhhhhhh.)"

","This high school comedy was a dark house last year and earned more than 80 million dollars in the box office in North America alone. It stars the new girlfriend of Spiderman Emma Stone as a modern THE SCARLET LETTER tale happened in high school without any vulgar slapstick which frequently reoccur in the recent comedies worked as set pieces. The tug-war between rumors and reputations is always tricky not only to teenagers. <br/><br/>The film has a star-studded supporting cast, including Oscar nominees Thomas, Patricia and Stanley, as well as Lisa Kudrow, who surprisingly had a slightly repugnant role. Patricia and Stanley as the liberal parents does manifest a great affecting love and rapport with their children (the quirky respond to the adaption question), which is the most precious achievement of the film, deserves a standing ovation. <br/><br/>Emma Stone is adorable in her first leading role, which earned her an Golden Globe nomination this year, her hoarse voice does distinguish her from other cheesy hot chicks and her personal temperament is perfect for her character, like it is emphasized in the film, the film reminds us of 80's teenage films made by the late John Hughes, time flies, nostalgia becomes the new trend, for example, the unrecognizable Amanda Bynes, I miss SHE'S THE MAN (2005) even though she is only 24 now. <br/><br/>It is a big comfort to see a fresh teenage comedy focused on a high school girl instead of the popular nerdy geeks, and I do foresee a brighter future for Ms. Emma Stone."

","This smart and charming film self-consciously invokes the John Hughes teen movies of the 1980s, but Easy A is a little too pat and plastic to rank alongside those classic flicks.<br/><br/>Olive (Emma Stone) is the good girl nobody pays attention to in her high school, until the day she lies about having a date with a college guy to avoid spending the weekend with her inexplicable and insufferable best friend (Alyson Michalka). That lie eventually expands to include Olive having sex with the non-existent college guy, a fib that spreads like wildfire thanks to it being overheard by school Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes). Olive is both horrified at her new reputation and enticed by the attention her new identity brings her.<br/><br/>Things get more complicated when closeted gay teen Brandon (Dan Byrd) asks Olive to pretend to have sex with him in order to convince the rest of the school he's straight and spare him any more homophobic torments. Olive agrees, and that leads to her becoming the pretend tramp for a string of school outcasts and losers, leaving Olive with a more and more scandalous reputation which she becomes more and more fond of.<br/><br/>Eventually, the downside of being thought the class whore comes crashing down on Olive's life, forcing her to take to the internet to try and clear her namewhich always works so well in real life.<br/><br/>Easy A is clever and fast-paced with an adorable star in Emma Stone and some funny supporting performances from Thomas Haden Church as Olive's favorite teacher and Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci and Olive's uninhibited and omni-supportive parents. It's a pleasant enough diversion but you can't ignore how the movie as a whole is about as thin as butcher's paper.<br/><br/>Everything in this film is too perfect and too obvious and toowell, easy. Take Olive and her best friend as an example. As these characters are presented, it doesn't seem to make any sense that the girls would even hang out together, let alone be best friends. They don't have anything in common. The don't act the same, talk the same or think the same. The story simply needed Olive to have a best friend and these storytellers simply decided to make her as colorful as possible, without any thought as to how and why she fits with Olive. All of Easy A is like that, with pieces that stack one on top of the other like children's blocks instead of fitting together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>It's a mild complaint about a good production, but it's a weakness that's highlighted by explicit references to John Hughes' teen movies filled with a messy humanity that's nowhere to be found in Easy A. It's like these filmmakers created something good and then convinced themselves it was much better than that.<br/><br/>Easy A is an entertaining piece of work that no one's going to remember 20 years from now. If you demand more than that from a filmyou really need to get over yourself."
"napierslogs","5","0","1","31 December 2010"," ""Easy A"" is enjoyable except for the annoying vocabulary
","""Easy A"" has way too many similarities to the overrated ""Juno"" (2007). Like Ellen Page, Emma Stone did portray her character, Olive, with humour and heart, but no teenagers talk like that! She's not indie-cool and smarter than everybody else, it's only young adult writers who wish they were like that (or perhaps a young adult writer who wishes he could sleep with Diablo Cody).<br/><br/>Olive is ostracized at school because of a rumour of promiscuity. Knowing that the plot is congruent with Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"", I was thinking that I should read that before seeing this film just to make sure that I catch all the subtle nuances, but no, there's no need, there is nothing subtle about this film. It's just a modern tale about exclusion and teen sex, but with a rather refreshing ambivalent take on abstinence versus promiscuity.<br/><br/>The problem with ""Easy A"" is that Olive and her classmates are not as smart as their vocabulary (and based on a few evident mistakes, the writer is not as smart as the vocabulary either). I'll let the parents slide because Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson were very funny and made me laugh through every scene. ""Easy A"" is an enjoyable watch but only if you can get past the sesquipedalian loquaciousness."
"halbarad_loire","8","0","1","31 December 2010"," Easy Awesome
","When I went into this film I knew absolutely nothing about it. Well, I knew it was a teen comedy of sorts so I knew... something.<br/><br/>So here we go. <br/><br/>To quote Emma Stone ""A is for Awesome"". She couldn't be any more correct with this film. As Will Gluck's second film this really shows some style and ability though there is no doubt that the brilliant screenplay helped make this film what it is. It's smart, funny and most importantly - genuine. It's not been that long since I was in college I know how things can spread, insanely fast, and how some people can really want to fit in.<br/><br/>The film starts with Olive (Emma Stone) and her webcast and with a brilliance in the script that continues throughout the whole film, she says ""There are 2 sides to every story. This is my side—the right one.""<br/><br/>To compress the story we have Olive telling a lie which involves sex to her bff Rhi (Alyson Michalka). A lie that so many people tell in real life it's no surprise they all end the same way, they bite you in the arse. In no time at all the arse-biting commences and Olive becomes the schools bimbo thanks to one extremely religious puritan (Amanda Bynes) who spreads what she overheard like wildfire.<br/><br/>Here we link in with the base theme of the story; ""The Scarlet Letter"". Olive and the rest of her English Language class are reading it and with coincidence as subtle as a . It links in so well as it is meant to, after all this is a sort of modern take on the classic.<br/><br/>Olive meets Brandon (Dan Byrd) in detention and this is the start of Olive's downfall. She feels sorry for him and she, as she does with many other people later in the film, pretends to rock his world. This happens with a number of people and eventually the rumours have made the worst happen. What she thinks is a real date turns out to be somebody who wants to pay for the real thing and the realisation hits her - everybody thinks she's a whore.<br/><br/>The Easy A title and Scarlet Letter links come in not long after the Brandon incident (which was brilliantly funny). Rhi tells Olive that the whole school thinks Olive is a ""Dirty skank"" which annoys her so she starts to wear... more risqué clothes with a large red A either embroidered - in most cases just over her breast.<br/><br/>A little more on the script. I can't go on more about how brilliant it is. It's so... genuine. Everything seems so real and so much like what somebody would say, even lines like ""The Accelerated Velocity of Terminological Inexactitude"" which as Olive explains is her obnoxious way of saying lies travel fast. I suppose talking like that hits close to home with me because I can be obnoxious with the use of longer words instead of simplifying. Rhi finds out her identifier are her... sizable breasts and is so happy about that. Somebody I knew was very much like that. Marianne is the only one I couldn't particularly see because while I knew religious people I never knew a religious freak who was willing to condemn me to hell for whatever I did that contradicted their beliefs. Even minor character like Evan(Jameson Moss), an overweight nerd, asks olive and she wants to know why - his line is ""look at me"".<br/><br/>There's a lot more but generally speaking the screenplay is excellent and acting follows in suite with even tiny mannerisms by all the characters fitting in perfectly. Emma Stone was perfect, it was a role i would say designed for her, with her in mind every step of the way. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olives parents were the liberal parents, offering support when needed but brilliant comedy also when needed. Thomas Haden Church was great as Mr. Griffith. No matter what the reason was, he sold me as a teacher because he was certainly channelling my old history teacher. The approachable, enthusiastic and understanding. Alyson Michalka sold me as Rhi, a rather vacuous self centred girl but still a good friend. Amanda Bynes was great as the puritanical Christian leader of the school. Lisa Kudrow was even great in her small part. Not too far from her Phoebe character but it had some good moments I didn't expect. Namely when she outright tells Olive she's going to screw her over and she knows that people won't even believe the truth if Olive states it simply because she's the Guidance Councilor.<br/><br/>Really, I could go on forever and then spend another eternity trying to put all this off-the-top-of-my-head review into a perfectly coherent review but I'll leave it with this.<br/><br/>Easy A is the best film of 2010. It doesn't have the effects or big names of Inception. It doesn't have the thought provoking drama or story of Shutter Island or Black Swan (or Inception!). It's not even as stylised as Scott Pilgrim. Why is this film the best? Synergy. Every single part of this film comes together and makes it my personal favourite film of 2010.<br/><br/>Watch it. Now."

"montera_iulian","7","0","4","24 November 2010"," The idea of ""being awesome"" is the start of all problems...
","This is a story about the clicheic ""I need to be awesome to be liked"" dogma which has spread in almost any teenager since ever. Why we need that to be liked? Why we need to do outrageous or non-conventional things in order for the average Joe to like us? Is it a right thing or a bad thing? Well, I guess the answer for that is in anyone's personal beliefs and since we're not debaters here we're not gonna comment on the subject.<br/><br/>The movie dissects the issue pretty good by mixing up humor with personal situations and frustrations that mostly any teenager has at one point. There are exceptions but the rule is out-there. Olive (Emma Stone) is a virgin college teen which realizes that with one ""little"" lie she could change her college life. That ""little"" lie though covers a deep personal problem and she decides to go out on a rampage by pretending to having intimate relationships with mostly all guys that have personality-issues in her college. Along this journey of lies she gets both ""praised"" and ""cursed"". In time she finds herself in between admitting her true nature, her true character or cover all up and just let it go. It all gets a big mess-up when she finds out that being a ""tramp"" is not the solution to be liked. The story pretty much evolves around this subject and it's entertaining by not being that clicheic. It's a fresh movie but all-around it has it's lacks in storytelling and pacing because at one point it just loses it's charm.<br/><br/>Emma Stone was a very good choice for this movie. I'm usually not into her movies but she managed to bring life to her character and made it interesting. She also physically looks perfect for the role because it would have been such a bad/clicheic choice if they had chosen a hottie or some ""Ugly Betty"". I also enjoyed Stanley Tucci who portrays Olive's father. He may not appear more than 10 minutes together in the whole movie but I just like that guy as an actor. The one which I'm not happy to being cast is Thomas Haden Church because besides not being a fan of him, he was just bad in this.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie was edited pretty well, no random shots or random ""intermissions"" between the movie's chapters although there was no ingenuity. The music used is forgettable, nothing like in the case of 500 Days of Summer but it still manages to induce a ""cool"" college atmosphere. This is not a general college movie, it's really entertaining, covers a good amount of college-personal issues, and it's really good directed. I recommend this flick to anyone who's into these kind of movies and I guarantee they will have a great time."

","http://reelpopcorn.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>I don't know what it is about movies that take place in a high school setting, but too often characters in them just look way too old. This is definitely the case a few times with Easy A, but that little stigma aside the movie does deliver. <br/><br/>Easy A, stars Emma Stone, of Superbad and Zombieland fame. She plays the role of Olive Penderghast, a precocious teenager who attends a fictional high school called Ojai North High in Ojai, California. This is significant to mention because of the liberal lifestyle associated with the ""Governator"" state. Olive's family is quite the diverse crew and her parents, played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, certainly give Olive adequate room to express her teenage self.<br/><br/>Express herself is exactly what she does. Olive's English class is studying Nathaniel Hawthorne's, the Scarlet Letter, and she takes it upon herself, after a scathing rumor is started about her, not to deny the rumors, but let them take on a life of their own. This has an alarming effect on the student body at Ojai, who eventually all have an opinion of what she is doing or not doing.<br/><br/>Emma Stone has, in my opinion, solidified herself as a very viable movie star. She basically crushes the role of Olive and is more than easy on the eyes. Also, at 22 years old she has a wide range of roles that she could fit into. <br/><br/>Easy A, has a lot of social commentary directed towards teenagers that might be wasted on them, but it isn't on an older audience that has sat in classrooms similar to the ones in the movie. The advent of Facebook and other social networking sites has made gossip spread exponentially faster, but there hasn't been a movie released in awhile that depicts what types of effects it can have."

","Easy A - a modern-day teen movie that actually works! A John Hughes-esqe flick for the 2000. Fresh content, witty and clever dialogue, charming characters make this movie a winner. Gives us a closer look at the kind of gossip that travels a high school, set up in a storyteling fashion, with the main character talking to the audience on a webcast intended for her classmates (and the movie's target audience) Our main character Olive, portrayed by new ""it"" girl (and Phx area native) Emma Stone, aims to grab the attention of the school. Through a simple white lie, Olive quickly, almost inadvertently circulates self-perpetuated rumors that she is the school slut, granting sexual favors to various boys upon request. We see various characters intertwine with Olive, including her hilarious parents (one of which is Stanley Tucci) who use brilliant humor effectively, her best friend who leaves her side, the judgmental oober-Christian, a few faculty members including her tough principal, and the boy in the wings.<br/><br/>This quasi-romance/comedy tends to move pretty quickly - styling the humor to what we see in such shows as 30 Rock or Arrested Development, where if you wait too long to try and get a line the film moves on to the next line.<br/><br/>The bedroom scene where Olive pretends to ""get it on"" with the gay character is quite the riot, I couldn't stop laughing. Her quick wit is displayed throughout by snappy comebacks with both her high school tormentors as well as her ""clientele"".<br/><br/>The diverse mix of character personalities kept me continually entertained, especially when I couldn't guess what they were going to say or do next. I really appreciated the authenticity of Olive's character - she was clearly an atypical high schooler, yet you could identify with her and want to root for her, all while she stayed believable.<br/><br/>Grade in my book: 8/10 stars"
"Likes_Ninjas90","9","0","1","10 October 2010"," It's one of the best comedies about adolescence since Juno
","In a high school in Ojai California, Olive (Emma Stone) is looking to find a way out of her friend Rhiannon's camping trip. She makes up a story about how she has a date with a guy named George. After the weekend, Rhiannon keeps pestering her about what happened. Olive decides to tell her what she wants to hear and says that she slept with the boy. The story is overheard by a Marianne (Amanda Bynes), a sensitive Christian girl who decides to tell everyone at school as a means of condemning Olive's behaviour. For the first time in her schooling life, Olive starts to attract more male attention than ever before. Her parents Rosemary (Patricia Clarkson) and Dill (Stanley Tucci) are unfazed by any stories, but her teacher Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church) is more skeptical about the way she is playing up to the rumours. Since she is studying the novel ""The Scarlet Letter"" in her class she uses the text as an excuse for her changing behaviour, saying she is trying to move closer towards the story. As the rumours start to escalate, more guys try to become more involved with Olive, if only to improve their own reputations and she uses this not only for her own social gains but to help out her friends as well.<br/><br/>It's easy to be skeptical when another American teenage comedy arrives, seemingly ready to offer the derivative coming of age and rite of passage stories again. But Easy A, just the second film by director Will Gluck, is a very pleasant surprise. This is a thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy that refuses to treat its target audience like they are the lowest common denominator. The lack of gross-out gags is refreshing but it's most impressive how the film is willing to intelligently consider ideas of conformity and image. The screenplay here has been sharply refined by Bert V. Royal and the messages are honest ones. Sometimes it's the truth, or more likely people's perceptions of what is true, that can be the most damaging. It's an issue rather poignantly displayed in scenes where Olive is begged by her male friends to build their reputations so they won't be hassled. Her gay friend is regularly pained by people knowing about his preferences and in one of the film's funniest scenes Olive attends at party with him to make some noise about it. There are as many honest moments as there are silly ones and the film is regularly sparked by genuinely funny dialogue. When Marianne tries to interrogate Olive and asks her if she bothered to use protection, she briskly fires back ""your parents didn't"". Blistering one-liners aside, it is also surprising how many literary references there are. The film has in-jokes relating to not only ""The Scarlet Letter"", but also the poet Sylvia Plath and Mark Twain's ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"". They work well to strengthen the ideas of conformity.<br/><br/>Emma Stone has had small roles in films like Zombieland (2009), Superbad (2007) and Ghost of Girlfriends Past (2009). Her performance as Olive is so complete here that in time she will almost certainly be given more opportunities to carry comedies by herself. The quality of the script is a great asset for her. She has a lot of fun with the dialogue and it makes her more engaging and sympathetic as the story grows darker. Both the film and Olive progress so that she gradually learns about the repercussions of her actions. Whereas a lot of comedies rely on a single joke, this film develops and there are certainly some surprises towards the end and more vulnerable moments for Olive. It is encouraging to see a young female character that is funny, smart and compassionate in a film like this. One suspects that Stone and Gluck have a great relationship, given the quality of her performance and also because they are making another film together next year. The only doubt surrounding Olive is whether a girl like this would really be so initially unpopular. There are a lot of other fun supporting characters here too. Stanley Tucci and Christina Applegate in particular are far too awesome to be anyone's real parents but they bring so much humour to their scenes that it really doesn't matter. As the overbearing Christian, some might find that Amanda Bynes' character borders on being a caricature but it's still performed for laughs, with tongue firmly in cheek, as opposed to supporting an anti-Christian message.<br/><br/>Easy A should not be disregarded as just a generic teen film. The thoughtful concerns for conformity and the influence of language and communication today grant the film universal appeal. It is significant that so much of the material here is humorously performed by the entire cast. They all relish a frequently witty script, particularly Emma Stone, who gives a very charming, winning performance. As the director too, Will Gluck has proved that teenage comedies do not have to limit their sophistication or intelligence to be a success. It's one of the best comedies about adolescence since Juno."

","""I just thought of the funniest thing. My name is an anagram for 'I love.'"" -- Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone)<br/><br/>I thought the idea for this movie sounded like one of the most preposterous ideas I've ever read and so almost didn't bother with it at all. After contriving a story that she lost her virginity to a (nonexistent) college boyfriend so she won't seem like a prude, high schooler Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) gets propositioned by a gay classmate to pretend to have sex with him so he can disguise his homosexuality from the hulking football team which has been hazing him. Their ploy is a success, Olive receives other propositions and, before she realizes it, has a reputation that she has neither earned nor deserves. I still think it's a stupid idea, which makes me all the more delighted at the result, which is a far better film than I would have suspected could come from the material.<br/><br/>Most of that's due to director Will Gluck's insistence on plausibility. After the initial ""fake orgasm"" while huddled classmates giggle outside a locked door at what they imagine must be happening (but isn't), Gluck spurns any reliance on physical comedy or silly situations. Funny things happen, but those things are all due to character and character development, not slapstick. And Gluck has in his arsenal not just a good cast but a great cast, a far better one than your typical teen sex romp boasts, including Thomas Hayden Church (All About Steve) as Olive's English teacher, currently expounding on Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter; Lisa Kudrow (forever associated with TV's Friends) as a counselor with a secret; Amanda Bynes (Hairspray) as a self-righteous uber-Christian out to save Olive's sinful soul; Cam Gigandet (Twilight) as Bynes' boyfriend who sings hymns with her, but harbors his own secret; and Patricia Clarkson (Shutter Island) and Stanley Tucci (Julie & Julia) as Olive's parents. Clarkson and Tucci can virtually do no wrong, and their glib delivery is so good that I'd love to see them together in another film. In fact, if there's any fanciful element in the film, it's that nobody's parents are that cool, but they're so amusing that I can live with it.<br/><br/>Too often in these things, secondary characters -- teachers, parents et al. -- are given the most cursory development and become props to facilitate getting us to the next lowbrow farcical scene, and rarely does a teen comedy seriously invite parallels with classwork in American literature. Yet here, with the exception of Malcolm McDowell (The Book of Eli) as a distant school principal, all the characters are justified beyond their strategic roles. They're people; they're not objects. Gluck even resists the temptation to make the indignant Bynes too much of a villain.<br/><br/>The real success is Stone's ability to carry the film as its star. She flawlessly understands her character, understands the story, and approaches it with a maturity sometimes lacking in actresses twice her age. I'm not completely comfortable with the film's resolution, which involves an impromptu musical number, but then I seldom am, simply because it's harder to resolve these complex questions than to set them up. Nevertheless, Easy A at least asks the questions, which many films fail to do."

Her character Olive really did stand out a lot in this movie, which could be a negative cause all the other characters just didn't have some great dialogue like she did. She just seemed to confident and too snappy. Which made the other characters just seem like side character that is just there so Olive can show off her witty dialogue. I enjoyed a lot of movies that Emma Stone was featured in and I liked this movie and her character as well. But what appears to be a smart teen comedy doesn't really have much of a message when it all comes down to it...Some but not much. It mainly revolves around promiscuity and the importance of it for some people in order to build their reputation. With rumors and gossiping going on as well, and STD playing big part in the story as well. The movie portray the Bible group as the villains in this one, lead by Amanda Bynes. I don't know what happened to Amanda but her face looked super bloated in this which was odd cause the rest of her body is skinny. Which made me wonder if they made her look like that on purpose or if she just has a fat face now. The movie offers few funny situations and some fun yet witty dialogue mainly from Olive(Emma Stone) with her remarks constantly and all, while the other characters just seem like cardboard. Which I think is the main flaw, just about every character is the same from beginning to end, even Olive so there really isn't anything to cheer for or anything. In another words no character development and hardly and win or losses. This film isn't a ""chick flick"" but for anyone that likes a good comedy.<br/><br/>7.6/10"

","As I sit home after work it's near 1 am. About 48 hours after seeing this movie I try and let it settle in. Like most movies I will critic. I will wait 48 hours later to write. To be not so be bias. Pending work, school, or home life influences. Even though the act of doing that is an influence, Yet I find it works.<br/><br/>First off from the previews I thought it looked lame. It seemed to resemble cheap rendition of Saved! mixed with Superbad. So I delayed, I waited until I had seen ""The Town"" first, so ""not to waste my time"". Especially a grueling day and night work schedule time, waste. <br/><br/>I was wrong! ""The Town was great and in ""no way!"" a comparison to this film. From my experience, Watching Emma Stone in ""Zombieland"" and in ""Superbad"" I was never really impressed. I thought she had a Manly voice, and a very plane and ""unhollywood"" look to her. Yet I was wrong again! Boy did she shine in this role in my respect! She had completely flipped in my face my expectation and attraction which I had defined to her. Usually in a movie which pretty much caters to one sex I Lose patience very quickly. Especially with the non lead actors in the film which I notice they tend to bring out the worst and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>Even Thomas Haden Church which personally, I can't stand was great! I thought the guy, was a Joke playing the sandman in spider-man, but in this one I was glad to be an audience member. SO!! Hard nose critics!! You will fall in love with Emma Stone In this one and if you don't You've got some serious questions you should ask yourself as you look in the mirror. P.S. Amanda Bynes Is awesome.... she kicked Mandy Moore's ass in the weirdo Jesus freak role. Lastly not to make a mountain out of a pebble but it is kind of fun to be proved wrong, in the way this movie did to me. I went in expecting to watch Emma Stone's ""Bridget Jones Diary"" Filmed by the paparazzi that follows Paris Hilton, or better yet Lindsay Lohan. Although I came out satisfied IN each parties abilities! in this film especially ""Emma Stone"" You untouchable Sexy Love Lightbulb! Sincerely, with Love, Dave"
"mysteryfan04","8","0","1","1 October 2010"," One of the Best Teen Comedies to Come in a While
","Easy A is a brilliant teen comedy. The first half of the movie is extremely hilarious and attention-grabbing. It draws you in with its opening intro of a web-cast, and Olive (the main character) tells you her story of how she ruined her flawless reputation. It begins with a lie about her losing her virginity on a weekend, with that lie turning into a rumor. Then, a gay classmate asks her to fake having sex with her to keep her new found reputation consistent and to have bullies stop disrespecting him. You may think you know where the story is going, but it pulls the rug out from under you and under itself; it takes risks that other similar films nowadays would be afraid to do. The story is very original, with several great performances, especially from Emma Stone who plays Olive. She has superb comic timing and is able to carry the movie. Penn Badgley and Aly Michalka are funny and believable as her love interest and best friend respectively. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are particularly funny as the quirky parents. Dan Byrd plays the gay teenager with believability and humor. The only criticisms I have are that the film reaches its ending but runs out of things to say, and that the parents seem a little TOO perfect for a girl who is faking sexual activity. However, it is so well-written and acted that it would be completely worthy of a Best Picture Academy Award nomination. I highly recommend this movie for all teens, parents, and teachers."

","Emma Stone delivers a hilarious performance as the sarcastic and lovable Olive, who pretends to lose her virginity to a school mate, Brandon, in order to help his reputation and dupe people into thinking he's not really homosexual.<br/><br/>As far as the comedy goes, it's very teenager-in-high-school based. It's also very family orientated based comedy. Amanda Bynes plays a over-the-top Christian who helps start a rumor about Olive and is basically the film's antagonist.<br/><br/>I found the comedy very endearing and not at all raunchy. It's mostly a clean comedy but there's actually quite a bit of romance in the film, surprisingly. The jokes came quick and at random, but very easy to understand. It's relatable to anyone who's attended or is attending high school. It's even easier to relate to when Olive begins to get some flak for the rumors being spread. I have been in her position of having a rumor spread about me.<br/><br/>It's got a feel of an ensemble cast, regardless of the fact that Bynes and Stone are advertised as the main attractions. I feel that without all the subsequent characters that the movie wouldn't have had such a great progression and development. As the film progresses, the characters all develop very well and easily paced.<br/><br/>I only found one really tiny problem with the movie. I felt the plot was a little bit tame and the 2 film paced a little too slow. I realize it's hard to write this type of movie and be original. I just felt that the movie moves very slow and a lot of the time, I kept wondering why I was still interested...or if I even was still interested. After about the first 30 minutes, the movie is no longer engaging.<br/><br/>I still found it to be a decently entertaining movie and it's a funny teen romance movie. It's a good date movie, for sure. It's a fun movie for teens and maybe some adults. It's target audience is definitely for high school-ers. I'd recommend it to anyone in high school or just recently graduated."

","You would think a story about a teen lying about having sex would not seem like a winner, but it's the comic performance of Emma Stone that really keeps your interest. In her first starring role, and she does not disappoint. Emma Stone is the new comedic actress of this generation.<br/><br/>Olive(Emma Stone) is a clean cut teenager, who lacks a social life. But that all changes when she tells a little lie about her having sex with a guy to her friend(Alyson Michalka, Phil of the Future and Hellcats), Olive doesn't think much of it, till it gets around school, people starting rumors about her. Olive does not like it at first, but quickly embraces it, then a lot of outcasts ask her help, to pretend to have sex with them, so they won't be nerds anymore. But what happens when this gets to be too much for Olive to handle? <br/><br/>The writers of this where trying to channel those teen movies of the 80's, and did it very well. Emma Stone is such a joy to watch. But she does not hog the spotlight from her co-stars, Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci has her ditsy parents, they are quite the scene stealer's. Not to mention Alyson Michalka, Amanda Bynes, Penn Bagley, Lisa Kudrow, and Thomas Haden Church are also great. A+ for Easy A"

","A sexless, sex comedy about an average student named Olive, who, after lie's about having a one night stand with a college to her friend, Rhiannon so Olive doesn't have to go camping with her, ends up being heard by the school's Christian snob, Marianne. After a twist of different rumours, Olive decides to go WITH the rumours, instead of stopping them. Guys end up charging Olive so they can SAY that they slept with her, but actually they didn't. And of course, the rumour get's out of hand in some hilarious ways.<br/><br/>The movie title goes so well with the movie. In most movies, it only manages to get so far with the storytelling, but this movie takes it's full advantage of the story, with hardly any flaws. It's a mix of Mean Girls and Juno. It has a lot of gossip and sexual remarks, and also a quirky main character with clever and hilarious lines. Amanda Bynes is excellent, as usual as Marianne. Olive's parents are very clueless to what's going on and are a hoot every time they're on screen. There are some lines in here that you'll be repeating. I cannot wait for this movie to come to Bluray. The only flaw is the ending. It could have been more constructed with a better conclusion. The rest of the movie is so good that the ending doesn't matter. This is, by far one of the best movies of 2010 and probably one of my personal favourites of all time!"

","Wow...first time I actually felt like I should pay for a movie in a long time.<br/><br/>I love watching movies and I usually hate teen comedies...this was a very nice rare exception.<br/><br/>Some of the stuff was over the top in terms of the parents, but not too much.<br/><br/>Emma Stone who is not only super hot, but also super exciting on the screen really pulled off an exceptional performance with some well developed material.<br/><br/>Of the two comedies I watched at the theatre that day, ""The Other Guys"" and ""Easy A"", this is by far one which I enjoyed on so many levels and was actually glad that the ticket was paid for, because the story was great and the humour was actually funny and meaningful.<br/><br/>I had a great time when usually I regret sitting in a movie theatre with most of the stuff which has come out in the last few years.<br/><br/>It's a nice refreshing change to see a well written story with a good cast."

","Easy A is so different to the usual teen comedies in a really good way, mainly because the story is so original. Highlights were definitely Emma Stone, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. Emma Stone is truly the next it girl. It's mainly her nuanced, perfectly-timed and well-thought-out acting that makes Olive endearing, and not just one of those girls in a teen movie that goes all-out-klutzy and is forgettable because she's just like all the others. This is partly due to how her character was written, so kudos to Bert V. Royal for churning out someone different.<br/><br/>I also LOVED the John Hughes and 80s teen movies references. It really shows how different this film is because of how aware and respectful it is towards the truly great teen movies of the 80s. It doesn't forget where it comes from, or what inspired it, and go off on a tangent of clichÃ©s and inane characters. It has themes that can be universally applied to anyone and not just restricted to high school, which makes it mean more in real life, and proves it's not just another teen comedy advertising sex, nudity and getting drunk. It has what most movies of this genre don't even care to think about - true heart. And when you have that, everything else - good acting, writing and direction - can form naturally around it."

","Bert V. Royal and Will Gluck have finally done something worth recognizing. Easy A starring Emma Stone was surprisingly good. The move was funny and had a good moral to the story. Besides the ""Low Key"" Religion smash, and the time to time eye rolling humor, this movie was great. With a broad cast of B list actors, it was a worthy flick. The story is about a girl names Olive who is a nobody at school, and gets the taste of rumors around school first hand. The movie got a PG-13 rating, which was okay for what it was, but the movie was definitely border line R. I would recommend this movie to a high school student. An adult? Not exactly. If you're looking for a break from reality, and a trip to over-exaggerated high school this movie is perfect."
