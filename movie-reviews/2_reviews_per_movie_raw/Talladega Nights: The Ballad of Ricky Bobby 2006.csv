","Here is the review my wife and I wrote for cincity2000.com <br/><br/>Talladega Superspeedway. For those unfamiliar, it is NASCAR's biggest and fastest race track, and the setting for the latest Will Ferrell comedy Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. I'm no fan of professional racing, but I do know funny. Put Will Ferrell in the driver's seat of a stock car, cast John C. Reilly (so wonderful in Chicago) as his best friend, and pit Sacha Baron Cohen (best known as Ali G.) as his rival and you can be almost guaranteed a good movie.<br/><br/>Here's the dealÂ…Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) is born in the backseat of a souped-up Chevelle. His motivation in life is given to him when he is ten years old by his alcoholic father: ""If you ain't first, you're last."" This mantra carries him to the pit crew of a losing race team. When he's given the chance to finish a race, Ricky shows that there isn't much he won't do to win. Teamed with his best friend Cal Naughton, Jr. (Reilly) they become 'Shake and Bake' and go on to NASCAR super-stardom. Ricky has the perfect life. A sexy wife, a family, riches. Enter Jean Girard (Cohen), a flamboyant Frenchman who begins to unravel Ricky's perfect world by beating him on and off the track. Ricky is forced to deal with his own fears. And a cougar.<br/><br/>What's this, you say? A Comedy? Sounds more like the 'feel good' movie of the summer! Perhaps I failed to mention that Jean Girard is a gay married man (Andy Richter plays his husband in a decidedly underwritten role) who sips espresso while he races. Or that Ricky and his wife Carley (the hot Leslie Bibb) have two delinquent sons named Walker and Texas Ranger. And how about the cougar? Oh, I know I mentioned the cougar! All this and more mixes together very well under the comedic eye of Adam McKay, who wrote (along with Ferrell) and directed.<br/><br/>Talladega Nights takes the whole All-American-Dream concept and makes it funny. It's Rudy with belly laughs. Better yet, it's the Anchorman of car racing, which makes sense since McKay did that movie, too. A lot of the scenes felt improvised, but by seasoned professionals. And with a great cast that included Gary Cole and Amy Adams, the jokes were constant and seamless. From an extended dinner grace addressed to 'tiny, baby, Christmas Jesus' to Molly Shannon's portrayal of the drunken wife of the team owner, the movie never failed to make you laugh. As an added bonus, this movie also has some great action. The race sequences were very believable and the crashes were amazing.<br/><br/>To be completely fair, there were moments when some of the scenes dragged a little. And some characters you will not like as much as others. But all in all, an enjoyable, laugh out loud experience for anyone 13 years and up. Shake and Bake, baby!"

","It's a pretty funny movie. You could tell Will Ferrell and Sacha Cohen (aka Ali G) and John C. Reilly all had the opportunity to improvise lines and riff on one another, and all three were pretty good.<br/><br/>Ricky Bobby's kids were given some choice lines and nailed home some great (albeit loud and aggro) deliveries. Amy Adams is totally hot. The dad role was well-played. The car action was money and you couldn't quite tell when it was CG and when it was recreated action, so that was good. They did it right.<br/><br/>The overabundance of seeded advertising was acknowledged in the film's dialogue and concretely addressed at the end of the movie (when Ricky Bobby goes sponsorless0 but it was still kind of annoying. I just can't understand how Hollywood blockbusters need more money. They could do the same movie without the extra $$ I think, but in this particular movie, set as it is with NASCAR, it certainly fits in the world we see on screen if there is rampant, colorful advertising.<br/><br/>So it's a good movie, a lot of gut laughs, and not unlike Dodgeball or Anchorman or the like..."
"DKosty123","8","66","103","13 August 2006"," Great Lampoon of NASCAR- Best Comedy of 2006
","This movie does something that is rarely done successfully done, pokes fun at the modern NASCAR circuit. Without detailing all the gags, this is pure fun which doesn't offend the tastes too often. Will Farrell is patently absurd as Ricky Bobby & the support he receives in this film from the entire cast is excellent. Gary Cole is very solid as Ricky's dad, & so is Jane Lynch as his mom. Amy Adams is solid too. In fact, the entire cast including John C. Reilly seems to have been fit into their roles like gloves.<br/><br/>Sasha Cohen comes off better in this as Ricky Bobbys French nemesis than he does in even Borat. He is used perfectly & fits his role really well. The story line works really well as the evolution from speed too shake & bake too magic man & me helps keep the film focused on something besides the jokes. There is just enough plot to hang the jokes on. <br/><br/>The script is lots of fun with references to lots of things besides NASCAR & Sex (which is all too often the only thing done as comedy today). This film proves that outrageous is much better than sex when done right as comedy. Thank goodness this is much better than the ill conceived BETWITCHED Farrell did in 2005. This film is really an excellent showcase for everyone involved. If your a NASCAR fan, you should even get some extra fun out of this one.<br/><br/>Get ready for the checkered flag Ricky Booby, this film is a winner all the way."
"osusullins","9","184","316","17 July 2006"," Pure Funny!
","I was lucky enough to be at a premiere in Chicago for this movie and it was pure fun entertainment. I am not a nascar fan and I love this movie. First off let me say that most of the scenes that they show in the previews are not in the movie, or are at least altered from the trailer version. The characters are extremely funny. John C. Reily and Will Farrell make a perfect red-neck match in this comedy. They play off each other and you can tell that they must have had a blast making this movie. The scene where they are saying grace around the table will, in my opinion, go down as one of the funniest scenes ever. I rank this movie right up there with other will Farrell greats like Old School, Wedding Crashers and Anchorman. So, whether you are a will Farrell fan or not, if you just enjoy fun movies that will have you laughing out loud from start to finish, than you should definitely go check this movie out when it comes out. I will be the guy in the front of the line waiting to get my ticket to see this movie again. A+"
"sarahcats1227","10","47","74","28 August 2007"," Very Good!
","I liked this movie a LOT. I think it's annoying how people come on here and whine and cry about poking fun at things...boo hoo he joked about boobs or gay people or Jesus or whatever...every single comment I read was someone who didn't like it because it offended them. It's a comedy, grow up!! Of course it's going to make fun of things, what else would make it funny? I thought that this movie was HILARIOUS, I am a very big fan of Will Ferrell I can't think of one movie I seen with him in it that I didn't like! So please, if you're that easily offended, next time you wanna rent a movie, for all out sakes, DON'T pick up a comedy. GEEZ!"

","When looking at the merits of a movie and decide whether it is good or not, one must think of the goal of the picture. Is it a serious film, designed to comment on society, or is the movie's job to merely entertain? I think we all know the answer to this one when it comes to Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. This movie's goal is to entertain the audience, make them laugh, make them spend an hour and a half rejoicing in talented comedians doing their job well. And this movie reached its goal. Not only is this movie an above-average sports movie (it even concludes with a big race and a warm and fuzzy winner!), but is also a very funny movie. All I had to do was listen to the reaction of the sold out theater I was in and I knew that most people will find this movie to be very funny. Will Ferrell is Ricky Bobby, a NASCAR driver who makes up one half of ""Shake and Bake,"" with John C. Reilly's Cal Naughton, Jr. being the ""Bake"" half of the duo. They are childhood friends who have now become teammates on the top NASCAR level, where Cal sets up the play that lets Ricky win almost every race--that is, unless Ricky has already crashed out of it. Talladega Nights follows the same story arc that Days of Thunder did, but is far more entertaining, as Ferrell and Reilly work together to bring humor to all parts of the racer's lives, including a bizarre dinner ritual that includes corporate sponsorship. Sure, the movie slows down for about 20 minutes in the middle to develop plot, but that may have been designed to give us, the audience, a break, allowing us to get ready for the final scenes of the movie. Sacha Baron Cohen (aka Ali G, Borat) plays the French Formula 1 driver who threatens to oust Ricky Bobby as the best driver on the track, perhaps the funniest overall character in the movie. There is not one scene with Cohen in it that isn't funny. After watching this movie, it is clear why Will Ferrell takes his comedies so seriously (watch the extras on the Elf DVD to see Ferrell between scenes, he's not always ""on"" playing the clown on set)--he gets the results he's looking for. This movie is laugh-out-loud funny pretty much from start to finish, and seeing Gary Cole return to comedy as Ricky Bobby's father will bring back memories of Office Space for a moment, then this new character will win you over."
"wastebot","8","85","143","4 August 2006"," Long Overdue NASCAR Parody
","You still get plenty of fast paced action, muscle cars, and massive car crashes. You just get to laugh a lot too.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell really doesn't get enough credit for his acting. As mindless as it seems, he still manages to make it believable. You have to keep in mind it's usually during over-the-top parodies, so it's supposed to be carefree and with complete disdain, yet he still manages to make it intelligent most of the time (at least in this film), so the result is far more than simple fart and gross-out type jokes.<br/><br/>He also had the benefit of writing this film, cast members like John C. Reilly and Sasha Baron Cohen, and a focus for the film in deep need of parody. NASCAR has been long overdue."
"gavin6942","8","29","45","17 December 2006"," I Hate To Admit It, But I Liked This One
","Ricky Bobby grows up to become a big-time race car driver. With the conflict of having no father to raise him, life was not always easy. And now, as an adult, he is finally ready to meet his match: a French driver from the Formula Un series. Can Ricky make him surrender? Shake and bake! I really don't want to like this film, because I think Will Ferrell is past his prime already and on his way out. The bigger a role he receives, the less likely he is to make a good movie, because he is just such a dumb actor. Popping in for a brief time (""Wedding Crashers"") is alright, but a full movie (""Elf"")? I don't know. Yet, he took the whole film here and ran with it.<br/><br/>The help came from John C. Reilly, who was fantastic as Cal Naughton, Jr. While he is not the usual co-star of Ferrell (such as Vince Vaughn, or one of the Wilson brothers) he was a dominant force. Seeing some new faces was very good, although having ""Crash"" from ""Anchorman"" was a nice touch, as I would consider ""Anchorman"" to be Ferrell's best film.<br/><br/>Stealing the show was Sacha Baron Cohen as Jean Girard. I did not even recognize him until the movie was almost over. Cohen is a master of disguise (""Alig G"", ""Borat"", ""Bruno"") and I would say this was his best performance yet. All the French references were great (Albert Camus, Perrier, crepes) and this character was so much more than just a simple parody of French culture. Why he was hanging out with Elvis Costello and Mos Def is unknown to me.<br/><br/>This film has the comedy that other films by these creators have, with constant pop culture references that pay off if you get it. And heck, if you don't, there's a good amount of really stupid humor, too (such as the imaginary fire). My favorite scene might be where they try to figure out how to pry out a knife from a man's leg.<br/><br/>If you want a cheese fountain at your wedding with nachos and seven different kinds of cheese, you need to see this movie."
"kelseyr-2","8","53","88","2 August 2006"," ""Shake and Bake!"" :)
","If you are a fan of Will Ferrell and Sacha Baron Cohen (from Da Ali G Show), you will love this movie. I saw it for free at a screening in LA, and I must say that I expected it to be a rental-worthy ""dumb comedy""... one of those so-stupid-it's-funny flicks that I wouldn't have paid to see at the theater. However, after seeing this film, let me tell you that I can't wait to see it again and I'd definitely say it's worth the 10 bucks to enjoy this film at the theater with a group of friends! I very rarely laugh out loud during movies (and the friend that I was with says the same thing), but we were both cracking up almost the whole time!!! You definitely don't need to be into Nascar to like this movie (I'm not). In addition to the hilarious red-neck ""dynamic duo"" of Ferrell and John C. Reily, you'll love Sacha Cohen's character, the gay French racer Jean Girard. And there are subtle social & political commentaries on America throughout the movie that made me smile! Go see for yourself when it opens in the theaters!"
"Okonh0wp","8","42","72","29 August 2006"," an entirely solid follow-up
","Two summers ago, Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay teamed up for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, the best display of improvisational comedy on screen since Christopher Guest (Best in Show, A Mighty Wind) entered the scene. This summer, the pair re-teamed for a sort of quasi-sequel as evidenced by the colon and ""The Legend of"" in the title. Will Ferrell stars as moderately dim-witted race car driver Ricky Bobby who differs from Anchorman's protagonist Ron Burgundy in that he is a more fully-fleshed out character. His need for speed on the track is guided by a void left by his race car driving dad's (Gary Cole's) abandonment. Along for the ride is the ever-so-versatile John C. Riley as perennial sidekick Cal Naughton Jr. who literally finishes second to him in every race. He suggests to his buddy maybe, just once, he can let him win just once to which Ricky Bobby replies, ""Well I see where you're coming from but if you win, how am I gonna win."" <br/><br/>Talladega is more likable to its subject than a strict satire, because it firmly implants itself in the Nascar world and picks on its more absurd elements. In particular, the heavy emphasis on sponsorship in NASCAR takes a heavy beating with things like Ricky Bobby being contractually obligated to include Powerade in his grace. The ensemble of characters doesn't produce that same energy that Anchorman had, but Talladega Nights did have some priceless bits of humor and it works just as well, perhaps even better, as a feel-good movie."
"JimboLimbo","9","19","30","5 August 2006"," Funny - but more as performance art than as a film
","I don't know that I'd enjoy this movie in New York or San Francisco, but in rural West Virginia it was absolutely hilarious. <br/><br/>A disclaimer: I'm a Southern white male. I was born in the South and live in the South. I wear cowboy boots, drive a pickup and prefer Bourbon to Scotch. I even like NASCAR and auto racing in general. <br/><br/>The movie wasn't hilarious because of the gags in the film, some of which are pretty funny, but because of the relentless parody of what passes for Southern American culture these days, and the reaction from the audience. It was clear that the majority of folks in the theater were expecting something more friendly to the NASCAR ""lifestyle"" and perhaps even affirmation of it. <br/><br/>I think the advertising gave that impression - a friendly caricature of NASCAR. Instead, it delivered a ruthless lampooning of the idiocy of fat-assed, fat SUV'd, inarticulate redneck-ism that is too often celebrated in the South. The bait and switch was a thing of beauty.<br/><br/>The movie touches on just about every aspect of the NASCAR persona, and hits very close to home in its ridicule. From the drug dealing sleazy father to the obnoxious children and the floozy trophy wife, Talladega Nights hits the mark on recognizable characters from around the corner, and then illustrates their hypocrisy and ugliness in great detail. The film grinds and grinds on the awfulness of the characters - none of them are likable or have an iota of merit. I think to many people, this will feel like overdoing the material or just going on too long in certain scenes. In the theater I sat in, it was a delicious silence of self-recognition in the audience and discomfort at seeing themselves mirrored in such unflattering terms. Some left fairly early. Some tried to cheer or find humor in the ironic ""victories"" of the characters or their insipid jokes (""shake and bake"" actually got laughs and cheers...) but eventually, the audience realized that they were the targets of the film and that there would be no redemption for their on-screen avatars.<br/><br/>The piece de resistance was the final race in which Ricky Bobby defeats Jean, a homosexual ex Formula 1 driver who earlier defeated Ricky Bobby in a barroom brawl. Ricky Bobby overcomes all odds to defeat Jean in their private competition by an inch, perhaps signaling the hoped-for feel good ending for our beleaguered audience, but instead Ricky Bobby passionately kisses the Frenchman, making clear the latent homosexuality of his long standing relationship with boyhood friend and sidekick Cal is quite real. Silence in the theater - stunned utter silence except my son and I howling.<br/><br/>The South gave us the Blues, the best American foods, wonderful literature and poetry, rock music and so much else that is beautiful and essential to the American identity and culture. It is a damned shame that its most ignorant and ugly aspects have defined it for so long. I loved that this film so clearly and aggressively attacked the awfulness of the Walmart South.<br/><br/>If you want to laugh hard, go see this film well south of the Mason Dixon and preferably away from a major metro. That is where it is at its best."
"mstomaso","6","28","48","7 January 2007"," Dumb but entertaining racing comedy
","In Talladega Nights, Will Farrell and Jon C. Reilly head a nicely assembled cast (without a lot of star power) in a story about a fool who happens to be a race car driver and who has based his entire life philosophy around a phrase uttered by his alcoholic father during a drunk - ""If you ain't first, you're last"". Ricky Bobby rides high in his largely unexamined life until, predictably, he eventually crashes hard when confronted with a gay French intellectual who just might be a better driver than he is, and a boss who does not appreciate his arrogance.<br/><br/>Talladega Nights uses a narrative and editing style reminiscent of the brilliant Deathrace 2000 to create an entirely different effect - unlike Deathrace 2000's intellectually challenging political and social commentary, Talladega Nights is a simple absurdist comedy played out by several stereotypes in the contemporary racing entertainment industry. The film is successful largely because of it's careful plotting and occasional substitution of slap-stick for (dumb) dialogue driven comedy. The script is nothing special, but was probably well edited in the final construction of the film in order to emphasize its occasional moments of brilliance. If you go into this without much in the way of expectations, you just might enjoy it."
"bloodpuppy11","1","72","137","7 August 2006"," Could have (should have) been much, much better.
","I really wanted to like this movie.<br/><br/>It's obvious that Will Ferrell is a talented comedian; his work on Saturday Night Live, his supporting roles in Old School and Wedding Crashers and portions of Anchorman are all very funny. However, Ferrell often seems to be playing the same character over and over, and with Talladega Nights, Ferrell has taken this a step further, essentially grafting the plot of Anchorman onto NASCAR Racing.<br/><br/>In theory, this should be hilarious, but in reality Talladega Nights just doesn't hold up. The problems with the film are myriad: inconsistent tone (too absurd one moment, too serious the next), unlikable characters, and a general sense that you've seen this all before. As in Anchorman, here Ferrell plays a boorish, unlikable protagonist who has ascended to the top of his game and conducts himself with varying degrees of arrogance, narcissism and idiocy; as far as I could tell, the only reason one would care about the Ricky Bobby character was because 1)you're supposed to because he is the main character of the film or 2) he was played by Will Ferrell. While Ferrell can be a charismatic guy, this charisma failed to carry over to his portrayal of Ricky Bobby, to the point that I found myself actively rooting against the Bobby character.<br/><br/>Additionally, the film follows a virtually identical plot arc as Anchorman, down to the presence of an antagonist who threatens with their ""otherness"" (in Anchorman a female news anchor, in Telledega Night a gay race car driver), a crew of moronic sycophants and yes-men to support the Ferrell character, and a denouement that strives to leave you feeling uplifted. Sadly, all these elements felt forced and stale (the Sacha Baron Cohen character is particularly grating, which is all the more lamentable considering its potential.) <br/><br/>Overall, while Telladega Nights did have some funny moments, nearly all of them were shown in the preview; it's telling when the funniest moments in the film come during the outtakes shown over the end credits. Considering the talent involved in this film, the way that it plays out should be considered a major disappointment."

","Jack Fischer<br/><br/>Talladega Nights Movie Review ""If you ain't first you're last."" (Ricky Bobby) Ricky Bobby, Will Ferrell,comedy genius to perfection"" (Jamie Russell Rotten Tomatoes), becomes the best NASCAR driver, then loses everything when Jean Girard, Sacha Baron Cohen aka Ali G, steals the win from him, leading Ricky to not win for awhile. Then Ricky, makes a comeback when Ricky and Girard crash, leading to a running race to the finish line. In Talladega Nights, Adam McKay creates a comedy using a North Carolinian stereotype through Ricky Bobby. Two parts of the movie were similar to real life situations. First, the costumes were close copies to actual driver suits. The movie used real NASCAR suits that made it more realistic. Additionally, the cars were authentically represented as they had sponsors and logos on the side of the cars. According to Tom Neven, a movie critic, ""there has never been any good NASCAR movies, but Will Ferrell ended that streak"" (Tom Neven Plugged In) to depict a real life situation.While the director Adam McKay made a spoof of the racing world, NASCAR lovers still found it realistic and amusing. People who watch NASCAR were not offended with the movie. They thought it was a realistic movie about a driver that loves to win races. The special effects in Talladega Nights were not too impressive, however, the movie was not designed for that purpose. In the movie the special effects were fine that I could notice. In Talladega Nights the special effects were not the greatest in the eyes of a movie critic, but to an average person they were realistic, for example when Ricky Bobby thinks he on fire after he crashes. The special effects were not supposed to be Academy Award winning, but was just supposed to be a spoof of NASCAR. Talladega Nights was an appealing movie because the directors used authentic costumes and cars to make it believable. Additionally the special effects were not fantastic but convincing. I highly recommend this movie to people that enjoy comedy movies."

Ferrel has a high budget and one of the best supporting casts of the year to work with but he doesn't take advantage of what he is given. By mid way point the movie is Anchorman with a Nascar setting and new names. Sadly Ferrel has been playing the same character for a while. There are some moments of comedic brillianceut the rest of the film doesn't work.

And Talladega Nights is right up there with Ferrell's amazing Anchorman as one of the dumbest, craziest and funniest films that I've seen.<br/><br/>Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a pit-stop engineer whose life radically changes when he is given the chance to drive in a Nascar race. He does so well that he is made a permanent driver and pretty soon he is living the high life. Married to a blonde bimbo, with two kids and massive bank account, Bobby thinks his life is perfect.<br/><br/>But when his place as numero uno on the Nascar circuit is threatened by gay French Formula 1 expert Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), Ricky Bobby's 'perfect' life begins to fall apart.<br/><br/>Ferrell is very much a 'love-him-or-loathe-him' kind of performer, and if you haven't enjoyed his previous films, then there's a good chance that this one will leave you unimpressed. But if you're a fan of the madcap performer's zany style, then Talladega Nights is a surefire winner.<br/><br/>Directed by Adam McKay (who also helmed Anchorman), this laugh-a-minute gag-fest mercilessly rips into the world of Nascar racing, mocking both those who make a living from the sport, and its dedicated fans. But it also has a heart, as we see Bobby learn from his mistakes and, by the end of the film, find true happiness.<br/><br/>Very occasionally, some of the humour is laboured a tad too much, and a couple of the gags fall a little flat, but with so many genuinely hilarious moments to make your sides ache, one can easily forgive a dud joke or two. Talladega Nights isn't quite the virtually flawless, high-performance laugh machine that is Anchorman, but it's damn close.<br/><br/>8.5 out 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."
"jsford2","1","20","40","9 August 2006"," Bad Movie, Bad Message, and Really poor Taste
","This movie had a chance to be a really funny flick. It became so bogged down trying to parody all the characters that it lost direction. Ricky Bobbie was such an ego driven slimeball that I could find no sympathy for him. This movie badly needed a hero, we never find one. Anyone who is even remotely a Nascar fan should be incensed by how this film portrays their sport. The gay French Formula 1 driver really makes a bad film worse. Just the fact that he was French and from Formula 1 was enough to make him the anti-hero, but Ferrell just had to take this over the top also. No Southern dad would ever put up with the disrespect that his children showed their grandfather at the beginning of this film notwithstanding that they were straightened out later by their Grandmother. All in all this was a terrible waste of time and money."
"DonFishies","8","23","48","13 August 2006"," Downright hysterical for the most part, but not as good as Anchorman
","After a fairly terrible year in 2005, it should come as no surprise that it took another teaming with Writer/Director Adam McKay to score Will Ferrell another hit. Sure, Wedding Crashers did so much better than anyone would have ever expected, but all he had was a cameo very late in the film. His most successful film before that was Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Bergundy. The comedy and chemistry was excellent in that film, and even with the really lame material, made the film work in so many ways. Now we have Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. While not necessarily being a better film than Anchorman, it still ranks as a very positive improvement from the rest of the films Ferrell has been doing as of late.<br/><br/>Ever since he was a child, Ricky Bobby (Ferrell), wanted to go fast. After one of the fastest ""growing-up"" sequences I have ever witnessed in a film, we zip right into the action as Ricky is part of the pit crew for a NASCAR driver. After the lazy driver leaves halfway through a race, Ricky takes his place and manages to do so well, that he replaces him. Soon after, he is winning tournaments left and right, and even gets his best friend Cal (John C. Reilly) in as his partner on the track, helping him to win the races (and in turn, win second place after Ricky during the races). Ricky is leading the high-life, but after a few issues on the track, the team he works for decides to hire a gay Formula 1 racer from France, Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), to help shake things up.<br/><br/>The film is much in the same formula as Anchorman, only set more in the satirical world of NASCAR. There are the obvious stereotypes thrown around about the stupid, hick Americans who are into the sport, and of course, all of the sponsorships and such that go into it. These stereotypes are obvious from the get-go, and after awhile, are not too jarringly distracting. They work well coupled in with the rest of the story, and unlike Anchorman, the film actually feels like it has heart and has some fairly dramatic moments (as best as can be used in an obnoxious comedy). Of course, that's not to say that there are not a whole whack of outrageously offensive jokes and crude humour (the majority of which are absolutely hilarious). It is instead, a great mix of all sorts of elements that work on-screen for the actors and for the film itself.<br/><br/>A lot of the scenes are funny in themselves, but I find most of the humour to come from the minor quips the characters throw at each other. It is obviously not totally improvised, but the outtakes during the credits show just a few of the extra lines that are spouted by the characters. It worked in Anchorman, and it works just as good here. Unfortunately, there are a few too many jokes that just fall flat (a lot of Cohen's stuff just did not do it for me), and not nearly enough laugh-out-loud moments. There are plenty of moments of hilarity anyway, but there is room for improvement here and there.<br/><br/>Of noteworthy achievement are the ways the scenes involving the race cars were filmed. They look absolutely awestriking during the races, and look even better during the brutal car crashes. If there was anything that could take away from the comedy in the film, it would be the amazing shots McKay and Company create in the NASCAR races.<br/><br/>There is a little too much seriousness in some scenes however. It was great to see the film becoming more than just a stupid comedy, but there was a bit too much of it in some scenes. It drags the film out a bit, and makes it longer than it probably should have been. In some instances, it felt intensely long, but in others, it felt brisk and fast-paced. It all depended scene-to-scene, so it definitely could have been so much worse. Another thing I disliked, much like Anchorman again, was the fact that many of the scenes in the trailer were not even in the movie. Many of the money-shot, hilarious scenes, were in both, but some of the little ones did not make the jump to the final product. Is it negative to almost assume there are going to be tons of deleted scenes on the DVD (and potentially enough to make a whole other film out of them?). We'll just have to see.<br/><br/>The acting out of everyone is solid, and almost everyone feels perfect in their roles. Ferrell is always great as screwball characters like Ricky Bobby, and he proves himself once again in the role. He has just enough edge and charisma to pull the character off without making him too much of a joke. Reilly nearly steals the show away from him as Cal, the even more dim-witted and bizarrely spoken best friends. Almost everything he says hits dead-on, and the chemistry between the two is just great. Cohen is alright in his role, although he feels a little too over-the-top for his own good. Supporting turns from Michael Clarke Duncan, Jane Lynch, Amy Adams, Greg Germann, Ted Manson and Leslie Bibb are all great in their roles, but Gary Cole stands out as Ricky's dead-beat and drunk/stoned father. His performance is electric, and undoubtedly causes the most laughs of anyone in the cast.<br/><br/>While not as good as Anchorman was, this film still is a hell of a funny movie with some great performances. It may be a little silly, and some jokes may fall a bit flat, but if you are a fan of Will Ferrell, then he is back. And in top form to boot.<br/><br/>8/10."
"masonsaul","9","2","2","23 April 2020"," Incredible comedy
","Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Rikcy Bobby is an incredible comedy that's gleefully stupid whilst also cleverly mocking the tropes and conventions of racing dramas. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are both incredible and have fantastic chemistry. Sacha Baron Cohen, Jane Lynch, Gary Cole and Michael Clarke Duncan are all great. It's consistently extremely funny even if a few jokes don't land. It's also well paced and Adam McKay's direction is excellent. Both the music by Alex Wurman and the soundtrack are really good."
"clm-clm","9","2","2","9 March 2019"," Hilarious
","I love this movie, and I've watched it numerous times. It's outrageously funny because of the characters and plot. It's typical Will Ferrell, so if you like him, you'll definitely enjoy it. It's silly, ridiculous, and fun from beginning to end, poking fun at NASCAR (which I've never seen, but am aware of the fan base) and many other things."

Baby Jesus wants you to watch this movie."
"jimbo-53-186511","7","2","2","10 February 2016"," Hits a few bumps from time to time, but in the main it's pretty funny
","Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) and Cal Naughton Junior (John C Reilly) are life long friends and teammates on the NASCAR circuit. They are both the best drivers on the circuit and regularly finish first and second - this is down to their Shake and Bake method that they employ in order to take out the lead racer. Cal selflessly allows Ricky to win every time meaning that Ricky is dubbed the hero and is the one that hogs the limelight. However, their reign at the top is threatened by the arrival of ace French driver Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen).<br/><br/>Adam McKay has dabbled in satire previously with the original Anchorman film and its more recent sequel. These films were mostly successful in this respect as well as being reasonably funny. For me, McKay has been less successful when he's dabbled in other genres - his buddy cop film The Other Guys was beyond awful. Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is McKay's satirical look at the sport of speedway which thankfully does work fairly well...<br/><br/>For me, Will Ferrell is a frustrating actor as I find that he can either be really irritating or fairly amusing. His performance very much depends on the material that he's given and the director that he works with. McKay seemed to allow Ferrell to be more natural in both Anchorman and Talladega Nights resulting in Ferrell being allowed to be funny and sort of endearing rather than being outright annoying likes he's been in other films. Sacha Baron Cohen is also excellent here in what can be described as fairly comfortable territory for him - he's essentially playing another quirky character with a ridiculous accent and most importantly entertains the audience whilst doing it. Baron Cohen plays a gay character here, but actually manages to make his character funny without being nauseating or over-the top (like he was in Bruno). Leslie Bibb plays the stock clichÃ©d empty-headed shallow trophy-wife in such an over-the-top way that she's actually quite fun to watch. McKay's characterisation here is spot on and what they lack in depth they do make up for by just being fun to watch.<br/><br/>McKay takes some risks here by casting a character that's gay and actually making fun of the character for being gay but I found many of the jokes to be relatively inoffensive and many jokes here lean to being more suggestive or being used by way of double-entendre (which are arguably smarter ways to gain laughs). Ricky's foul-mouthed kids do grate a bit from time to time, but McKay does address this issue when the kids met their grandmother and she gives them some much needed discipline.<br/><br/>The film does lose some momentum in the second half when things start to fall apart for Ricky and we see him trying to re-build some of the remnants of his shattered life and career, but thankfully there are still plenty of amusing scenes (his dad coaching him and his scenes as a pizza delivery guy were funny and still helped to keep things moving).<br/><br/>All in all, Talladega nights may not keep the laughs consistently coming and at close to two hours it is a little on the long side, but despite the generous running time the film still moved along relatively smoothly and I still found plenty to enjoy here."
"Poseidon-3","Null","2","2","21 December 2007"," Typically zany Ferrell flick, needling the NASCAR set.
","Ferrell, a certifiably unhinged comedian if ever there was one, reveals his track trash personage in this uneven, but sometimes hilarious farce. He plays a man, born in the backseat of a speeding car, who possesses a lifelong love for going fast. His deadbeat father Cole, a would-be racer himself, instilled in him the need to win at all costs. Meanwhile, his best friend Reilly supports him to that end while never getting a chance to revel in his own racing glory. Ferrell seemingly has it all; the mansion, the collection of cars, the busty trophy wife (Bibb) and two (impossibly impolite) sons. Unfortunately, his ego has grown along with his wealth and fame, so when gay, French Cohen appears out of nowhere to challenge him on the track, he risks falling very far if he loses. Ferrell, as usual, completely buys into the characterization with no regard for his own vanity (one recurring gag has him running around in some baggy briefs and a helmet!) Some of his jokes are a little indulgent, such as the endless dinner prayers featuring the many incarnations of Jesus, but most of his stuff is pretty amusing here. He's armed the film with a battalion of solid comic performers in supporting roles as well. Bibb is dead-on as the shallow, but sultry, wife, Reilly has just the right blend of dim-bulb amiability and Cole is excellent as the no-good, emotionally bankrupt father. Lynch plays Ferrell's put upon mother and is strong as well. As Ferrell's children, Tumlin and Russell are afforded some real ear-opening bits of dialogue! Adams is appealing in a smallish role as Ferrell's supportive personal assistant. Best of all is the uproarious Cohen who adopts a hysterical accent and who essays his role with captivating arrogance. (Allegedly, this character was partially inspired by real life racer and ""Dancing With the Stars"" champion Helio Castroneves!) Other comic performers aim, with varying degrees of success, for their own share of funny moments on the screen. One doesn't have to love, or even like, NASCAR in order to appreciate the humor here, the target is really the people who attend such events, though a working knowledge of that world may make some of the little cameos mean more. That said, the film runs the risk of offending (and indeed in some cases has offended) the core audience who enjoys NASCAR. However, Ferrell skewers just about every walk of life in his films and certainly did the same during his many years on ""Saturday Night Live"". It's just this segment's turn. If the racetrack fans can get past the jabs at their compadres, they may run into another roadblock with all the subversive, at times mystifying, yet hilarious, doses of homo-erotica tossed in every now and then. Most memorable, aside from a lengthy kiss at the denouement, is Reilly's description of a teenage modeling session! It's a deliberately goofy, at times surreal, piece of movie fluff that is quite entertaining for those who don't demand a great deal."

","Ricky Bobby is born in the backseat of a car. His father is driving so fast, he over-shoots the hospital and has to slam on the brakes. Alas, Ricky Bobby plops out right there on the back seat. Not actually seen, of course, but we get the picture with the sound effects they had. ""I wanna go fast"" are the only words out of his mouth through much of his childhood. I wanted something to go fast too. After the first ten minutes of this movie, I wanted it to go fast right along so I could get the hell out of the theater. There is some funny stuff in this movie but I only really laughed a couple times, the rest were just chuckles if that. One of these laughs came from the delightful Molly Shannon (bless her heart). For those of you who are planning on watching this movie, I say go rent (or even buy) ANCHORMAN instead. After this movie, I can honestly say that Ron Burgundy is better than Ricky Bobby. TALLADEGA NIGHTS offers nothing but but high speed ho-hums and is very tedious. Nuff' said."

","the laughs i had were isolated moments that weren't woven together in any cohesive sense... it was like a string of a hundred unrelated jokes, and most of them were bad. i did laugh, when Ferrell and Cohen were at their best, and when Ricky Bobby's kids went off. i do admit, my laughter spiked when the little kid threatens his grandpa, ""I'm gonna come at you like a spider monkey!"" that was good s***.<br/><br/>but the majority of it just didn't fly. the ads were ridiculously overdone, to the point where a full-blown commercial is inserted right at the climax of the final race. i sense that it was supposed to be funny, but it was just really, really annoying. product placement, great, whatever. commercials and multiple undisguised references to bloated, greedy corporations... screw that. i hope Applebee's suffers a consumer backlash, not that i frequent that particular chain.<br/><br/>Ferrell's love interest didn't get enough screen time. when she was on screen, it was painfully obvious that she was just being kept around so that later on the viewer wouldn't be totally disoriented by her reappearance. the wife and the team owner, the ""bad guys,"" didn't have any presence or any good lines; she was just obnoxious, and he had no balls. the Halliburton joke just didn't go anywhere (you guys could've really done something with that).<br/><br/>now that i recall the movie, one thing that was good was the production value. the races really felt like they were happening, which added a lot. so yay, good race scenes. boo, bad jokes."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The three headed creative team of Will Ferrell, Adam McKay and Judd Apatow obviously work very well together. Although ""T-Nights"" is not quite at the level of ""Anchorman"" or ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", it comes from the same gene pool and features some hilarious moments and great lines.<br/><br/>Once again, Will Ferrell is the centerpiece of this one trick pony. Ferrell's best comedic traits are that we constantly expect him to say something funny and, even more importantly, he can deliver a straight line in a manner that causes laughter.<br/><br/>Fans of the above mentioned movie will recognize most of the faces in the supporting cast. Receiving the most screen time are John C. Reilly as Ricky Bobby's life long Shake and Bake buddy, and Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G) as the nemesis gay French driver who pretty much drives Ricky Bobby over the proverbial edge. Also in the cast are Gary Cole (as Ricky Bobby's long lost Dad, who is NEVER without a beer), Jane Lynch (as Ricky's mom), Michael Clarke Duncan (as the crew chief), David Koechner (crew member) and Molly Shannon (as the sloshed car team owner's wife). Don't miss the nice performance from an almost unrecognizable Amy Adams (so wonderful in ""Junebug"") as one of Ricky Bobby's biggest supporters and his final love interest.<br/><br/>The film basically delivers what it promises. A bunch of laughs and no real story to speak of. You do have to kind of like a film with a soundtrack that features both Roger Miller and AC/DC ... not to mention a french version of the Rolling Stones!! As always, stay for the closing credits for an extra chuckle or two."

In other words, if you're planning to see this movie, you already probably qualify as a Ferrell Fan, or something like that. Which means you'll think it's pretty funny. Not grade-A, top-quality, Steve Martin funny. More like a lot of ""hurting for laughs,"" slapstick humor kind of funny. And as with most Will Ferrell movies, it's awkward at first, but will probably get better with each successive watching. So go ahead, see it. Or not.

","Trying to review and rate a movie like this is tougher than most might think. There are those Will Ferrell fans out there that'll eat up TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY. Then there are those that'll snub it as another foolish not-ready-for-prime-time-style spoof designed to engage our dumbed-down society. But there is a third reason someone might enjoy this rather ridiculous film.<br/><br/>Hopefully there are those movie goers out there that enjoy watching parodies of various lifestyles, and this is where Talladega Nights gets most of Â— if not all of Â— its comedic punch. That we witness a southern Nascar driver with all of his conservative leanings hanging out for everyone to see was absolutely hysterical. Ricky Bobby's (Will Ferrell) big house, multiple gas guzzling cars (Hummers, etc.), a wife who's gauged on breast quality, and two kids named after a horrible action series (""These are my kids, Walker and Texas Ranger"") are all over-exaggerations on conservative values; you wouldn't dare see one of them driving a hybrid car, for instance.<br/><br/>The entrance of a homosexual Frenchman named Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat) adds an additional element in the American prejudice category, Ricky Bobby bashing Girard's foreign heritage while making a fool of Americans' naivetÃ© (""America gave the world Chinese food!"") The challenge of Ricky Bobby to overcome his fear of driving after a horrendous crash is only minimalist humor added to the film. It is, at its core, a spoof on modern southern lifestyle and conservatism, and that is what makes the movie work."

Why is Sasha Cohen's  character a gay Frenchman? Pretty simple, really. This here's America!  ;) There was some major broo-ha-ha about Jeff Gordon possibly being gay  a few years back, and when the most recent Iraq war started, much of  the deep south hated the French for not going along with things.

","I use to love Will Farrel on SNL. The guy definitely has the comic genes, Unfortunately I sat for the first twenty five minutes waiting for something to make me laugh. The premise of the movie seems to have ample room for comedy, although as someone who lived in south for many years some of the southern redneck clichÃ©'s get a little excessive. The odd part about this movie is that one of the funniest characters is Ricky's deadbeat dad played by Gary Cole. Cole isn't know for comedy parts in general but Reese Bobby is somebody we have probably all ran into at some point in our lives, and somebody we would avoid if we saw him coming. To be fair this movie is probably aimed at an audience a lot younger than me and although not quite as juvenile as some of the Adam Sandler movies it isn't what anyone would consider sophisticated comedy. The characters in the story including Ricky's gorgeous and opportunistic wife should come off a lot funnier. The movie does have a few funny lines but just not a lot of comic continuity. Save a few bucks a wait for the DVD."

","Will Ferrell has a comedic talent that can endear him to his fans. This is usually seen in reruns of Saturday Night Live when he was a star of that show. Unfortunately, there is no endearment in this movie. He was rarely funny. Sad to say he was at his funniest in 30 minute intervals. The movie was horribly slow and unappealing. What was funny was that because the movie was so dull and tedious, when a funny part arrived, I found myself in tears. Partly because there were a few hilarious scenes and partly because I was so grateful that something finally made me laugh.<br/><br/>I went to the movie hesitantly and I was tempted to walk out about 20 minutes into the movie but I struggled and stayed. In the past, I have found myself completely disappointed with other Ferrell movies but I refuse to believe he is going to be so unfunny. I want to say he should have stayed in TV doing skits but thats unrealistic. What he really needs to do is find a movie that will allow him to be his old endearing self instead of the pitiful characters he seems to do quite a lot of. Hopefully, his next movie can remove that ""jerk"" from his portrayals.<br/><br/>Not a single one of the characters was funny to the point that you wanted to see more of that character. More often, I was thinking, ""go away"".<br/><br/>I guess the funniest part of the movie was in the closing credits when Ferrell, Reilly and Duncan were seen enjoying themselves in out-takes. Glad they had fun but it is too bad I didn't.<br/><br/>This movie finished 2 out of 10 laps as far as I was concerned. Once it hit the pits, it never got back in the race."

","""Talladega Nights"" is not unbearable to sit through, in fact it has multiple moments that are quite entertaining. Essentially, comedy is in the eye of the beholder, and I found this film's comedic potential often overshadowed by VERY PG-13 subject matter. However, one can expect no less from those who also brought us ""Anchorman."" <br/><br/>I'm quite a fan of Will Ferrell, he being the only reason I saw this film. I know nothing whatsoever about NASCAR. I enjoy his trademark comedic styling to an extent, but I prefer to see him in roles that truly challenge him, such as his minor role in Woody Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda"" and more recently ""Stranger Than Fiction."" The role of Ricky Bobby is nothing we haven't seen him do before, but he does do it well. Ferrell is a talented comedian, and all his trademarks are in Talladega,including near nudity, as seen on the trailer.<br/><br/>Whether or not you like this film depends on what you personally find funny. I don't enjoy 10 year old boys with 4 letter vocabularies and I don't enjoy constant references to manhood, if you get my drift. However, I enjoy silliness when it is done in good taste, and ""Talladega"" has some of those moments too. As stated before, this film is most comparable to ""Anchorman."" If you saw the Legend of Ron Burgundy, the Ballad of Ricky Bobby is essentially the same in terms of humor.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film because it's Ferrell, and he can always deliver. It's good for a laugh and most viewers probably wont be sorely disappointed."

","Talladega Nights is what happens when you let actors write their own material. Someone needs to tell Will Ferrell that just because he can get laughs with other peoples' material doesn't mean he can write a movie.<br/><br/>This movie was green lighted with a six-word pitch: Will Ferrell as a NASCAR Driver and the story, characters and plot never really got beyond the six-word simplicity. Every character in the film seems have an IQ of 70 or less and the jokes just aren't funny, and they keep coming, one awkwardly boring scene after boring scene.<br/><br/>Someone really needs to tell Ferrell that if no one believes your characters could possibly exist in any universe there is no reason to laugh, or believe them. I started wondering how people this stupid remember to breath.<br/><br/>Also the technical quality just isn't there, bad computer graphics, lighting, staging, all are of the quality typically found in Mad TV movie spoofs.<br/><br/>This is what happens when you let demographics control movie making. Studio Execs saw the bank Ferrell's last movies made and the NASCAR demographics and figured people will flock to see it no matter how big of a dog it is.

"MovieManMenzel","5","10","20","5 August 2006"," Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Product Placement & Gay Jokes
","""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is about a man named Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) who as a boy always dreamed of being a race car driver and living life in the fast lane. So one day, Ricky Bobby got the chance of a lifetime as he was able to race in a NASCAR Tournament. Luckily for Ricky Bobby he is one hell of a driver and has what it takes to be the top NASCAR driver in America that is until a Frenchman named Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) comes in and tries to steal Bobby's spotlight. An incredibly long and stupid movie ensues...<br/><br/>Now while I will admit I don't think that Will Ferrell is the funniest guy in Hollywood, I will admit I do normally like the guy in most of the films I have seen him in. I thought ""Anchorman"" was very stupid but very funny at the same time. I own it on DVD and seen it several times. I also thought ""Old School"" was a very funny movie although I do feel it's a tad overrated. With that being said, I wonder what happened with ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" because Will Ferrell was just not funny at all in this film. I didn't even get why the story was suppose to be funny. A redneck kid grows up saying "" I wanna go fast"" and becomes a NASCAR driver. Why is that funny? And why is the film two hours long? The main problem I had with the movie was that it was too stupid for its own good. I mean the whole redneck NASCAR idea is about 10 years old and just isn't funny anymore. I feel bad for hating this film as much as I did but the commercials and movie trailer showed the best parts of the film. The rest of the film felt like a really long and dumb commercial for Wonder Bread, Applebee's, Old Spice, PowerAde, Taco Bell, Coke, KFC, and many other products. I actually wonder if this film had a budget at all considering it really was a two hour commercial and I would think all the product placement would have paid for the entire film to be made.<br/><br/>About 95% of the jokes in ""Talladega Nights"" failed to produce laughs. I sat in a theater which was almost full and barely anyone laughed throughout most of the film. It just wasn't funny because almost every joke was too silly or too stupid to make anyone with any type of brain laugh. And the amount of gay jokes in ""Talladega Nights"" was unbelievable and none of them worked. Its like ""oh that Girard is a French guy and is gay oh man that's so funny!"" Really it's not funny at all and people who laugh at stuff like this aren't mature enough to realize that things like this at this point in time aren't funny and are just recycled jokes used from previous films.<br/><br/>As much as people love Will Ferrell even his biggest fans have to admit ""Bewitched"" was an awful film and ""Kicking and Screaming"" was very average. So at this point, I am not surprised to see him in this bad of a role. But why John C. Reilly? The man is a great actor and I can't understand for a second how he read this script and said wow this is one funny script. I mean his character Cal was so incredibly dumb even dumber than Ricky Bobby if that's even remotely possible. I also wonder how Amy Adams got involved with this. The last film I seen her in was ""Junebug"" where she was nominated for an Oscar based on her performance. So is that what you do after you almost win an Oscar? You take the next script that is handed to you without reading it? I just couldn't believe two people with so much talent could work on a movie that was so moronic and meaningless.<br/><br/>I am beginning to wonder if Adam McKay is a one hit wonder. I know this is really only his second film after ""Anchorman"" but this film was really that bad. It actually seemed like a rehash of ""Anchorman"" although instead of being about a news station it was about NASCAR drivers. It just didn't work and I don't get how Ferrell and McKay who wrote the script together could find most of this film to be amusing. To me the blatant product placement was the funniest thing about the movie as well as all the scenes in the commercials including the ""help me Jesus, help me Oprah, help me Tom Cruise"" line but other than that this movie really didn't make me laugh. I also didn't understand why a comedy that was this stupid had a 2 hour running time. Usually when movies are this dumb they run no longer than 95 minutes however this film was about two hours and just dragged on and on.<br/><br/>Bottom line, even if you're a fan of Will Ferrell I would wait for video for this one. Most of the material used in this movie is about ten years old and almost all of the jokes fall flat. ""Talladega Nights"" is definitely not one of Will Ferrell's better films and in my opinion is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen him in. If you feel like spending $5-$10 on a ticket to a movie where all its best jokes are in the commercial, then see ""Talladega Nights!"" If not save your $5-$10 and go see something else or rent ""Anchorman"" again because in all honesty ""Talladega Nights"" is not worth your time nor your money.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is a 3 out of 10. Definitely not Will Ferrell's best."
"OriginalMovieBuff21","9","13","28","5 August 2006"," One of the best comedies of the year!
","Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is one of the best comedies of this year so far and probably will stay that way. Will Farrell has not let me down yet and I think he never will. Most of comedies are actually stupid but its him that brings every one of his movies up and makes it a lot more funnier than what they actually are. John C Reilly, who is actually most known for serious films, puts on a great performance as Ricky Bobby's sidekick as well as Gary Cole, who played Ricky Bobby's father. Overall, this film is top notch and although I don't think its better than Anchorman, it still made me laugh a ton and not worry about anything. Will Ferrell does not fail!!<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-"
"firebirdus","1","13","28","5 August 2006"," This has to be one of the worst movies ever made
","Absolutely terrible -- the dialouge seems totally ad-libbed (which may work for a show like Curb Your Enthusiasm), transitions between periods in Ricky Bobby's life are poorly done, and the acting is sub-par (I felt quite embarrassed for John C. Rielly). The humor was pretty subpar too and the Fench driver isn't so much funny as his speech is in-audible.<br/><br/>In all the movie felt like a bad Saturday Night Live skit that just wouldn't end. Don't get me wrong there were a few funny parts...but there was more silence in the theater than not. In fact had I not been there with a group of people I would have left after the first 20 minutes. It makes Gigli look like an Academy Award winning film -- it was just that terrible.<br/><br/>Now Will Ferrel really pulled this off with Anchor Man and in his various cameos in other movies (The Wedding Crashers) -- but it amazes me that this movie was even green lighted.

Seriously, this movie is a bunch a Saturday Night Live skits that all run to long way past the point of when it could of been funny ( but most of them weren't) to the point where you are almost tempted to shut the movie off if the scene went on any longer. At points it tries so hard to come up with something funny that you actually feel sorry for the actors reading the dialog because it is just pathetic.

","I am so sick of people saying that Will Ferrell is a genius. He is not an amazing actor...he parades around on camera acting like an immature 10 year old and people think it is Oscar worthy acting. I will admit that I do love some of his movies... Anchorman and Old School were great. Yet his role in Wedding Crashers was the downfall to what should have been one of the greatest comedies of my generation. However this movie is simply a pitiful attempt for movie executives to rob you of your money. They are simply just using Ferrell's image to empty your pockets.

","Will Ferrell's ""TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY"" like many other have said already, seemed to have had promised so much but delivered so little. Coming in off the back of ""ANCHORMAN"" an excellent title, TN really was pretty much the same movie cut to a southern American NASCAR plot line.<br/><br/>You expect more from Ferrell don't you. As a guy often labelled as a genius by some, you would expect innovation, new ideas, fresh new ways of creating laughter. After TALLADEGA NIGHTS, I'm still a big Ferrell fan, but this film came across as lazy and as simply a cash generator. <br/><br/>There was no innovation.<br/><br/>Granted, and credit where credit is due, there were some very funny one-liners but the multiple plots didn't seem to link together coherantly, the story was academic, over-used and rushed.

"Skriptman","1","12","26","6 August 2006"," In desperate need of a script!
","I really looked forward to seeing this film. Will Ferrell, given the right material, is as versatile and funny as anyone out there. But in this case, the movie suffers from having no script. Countless scenes drone on and on without direction or purpose... and, worse, without being funny. Since much of the material is obviously improvised, one becomes uncomfortable watching the actors trying to make something happen, make the scene funny -- and that's exactly what you get: a patchwork of forced, protracted scenes that have no connection to the overall story.<br/><br/>With a number of notable exceptions, a film that is written or co-written by the director frequently suffers from having no one reign in the various elements of the story to keep it focused. Regrettably, that's the problem with ""Talledega Nights"". It's a fun concept and features some wonderful talent but, regrettably, director Adam McKay doesn't come close to doing anything with it."
"qormi","1","8","16","7 April 2007"," A Drag of a Race
","Will Ferrell is a funny guy. He was hilarious on SNL. This movie was not funny. It was aimed at a low-brow audience; the kind that might have trouble tying their shoes. What was wrong with it? For one thing, his two young sons were portrayed as hateful brats, which is not too funny. The way they and the rest cruelly laid into the 85 year old grandpa was pathos; not comedy. The prolonged ""grace"" scene before the meal where everyone gets a chance to poke fun at Jesus was irreverent and made me cringe. ""Uncomfortable"" does not equal ""funny"". When will Will Ferrell finally shelve his signature ""running around naked while flailing your arms "" routine? The boob jokes about his so-called ""smokin' hot wife"" were tiresome to all but the toothless truck stop crowd. Sasha Baron Cohen was funny as usual, but was wasted in this overly long stinker."
"onionsmiling","1","12","27","7 August 2006"," Never Should Have Left the Pits!
","I like Will Ferrell and this movie had a handful of funny moments, but I think it's probably Will's worst effort yet. I thought the choice of supporting actors was poor and some of the southern redneck humor was simply too over the top. The foul-mouthed kids should have earned this movie a PG-17 or R rating. There were young kids in the theater when I saw the film and I actually felt embarrassed for their parents. If it had been me with my kids, we would have gotten up and left. The baby Jesus stuff was really over done and quite honestly, it was somewhat insulting. Why is it that movies today can insult Christians with impunity, but all other so-called ""peace-loving"" religions are off limits? My suggestion: If someone doesn't give you this movie on DVD as a gag gift or a ""re-gift"", save your money and buy yourself a new music CD or a membership to a health spa. You'll be better off in the long run if you simply skip this one and do something more productive with your time. I wish I had."

Its extremely wafer thin and has about as much depth to it as my sister's blow up paddling pool. Secondly, it has been so Americanised its unreal. Not a scene passed without us in the cinema having some form of American patriotism shoved down our throats. The characters were unbelievably shallow, which you can probably blame on Will Ferrell's atrocious acting. And yes, I blame him for ALL the character's being terrible. That is the measure of my hatred for him. Why this guy gets paid millions at a time to be total, utter s**t I do not know <br/><br/>And Finally, it wasn't funny in the slightest. Sure there were one or two little bits where we chuckled briefly, but I was never hooked and wanting more. I wanted to go home.

","What can I say about Ricky Bobby. This movie was horrible. The best scenes in the movie were shown on the various previews, and many scenes from the preview were not even in the movie like the line ""I feel like a mongoose stalking his prey"" and ""I'm coming for you Ricky Booby"" while Frenchie is sitting in the bathtub shaving his legs. This is not a movie kids should be taken to. The scene around the table saying grace to ""Baby Jesus"" was funny in the preview but in the movie it went too far. Ricky's kids were cussing up a storm and being disrespectful to their grandfather, appalling. I thought the hype leading up to this movie was a blatant attempt to get people to go to a movie by not letting on how tasteless it actually was. It would have been just as funny (in the funny parts) without the cussing. Will Ferrell's stock has just dropped a lot in my book. I was also disappointed to see Dale Earnhardt Jr. make a cameo in such a offensive movie, besides the Fox and NBC announcers and Jamie McMurray no other NASCAR drivers were actually seen. This movie just took NASCAR's image and flushed it down the proverbial toilet. I was appalled at the number of kids in the theater watching this with their parents, who should have walked their child out. Why does a movie have to be distasteful, disrespectful, and vulgar to be considered funny these days? They should have given this one a ""R"" rating and been done with it, if it was going to be an ""R"" I would hate to see what they cut out to get it to a ""PG-13"" rating....If you see this don't take the kids but get ready to laugh at the same funny things you saw in the preview and that is about it."

","Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is one of the longest and funniest commercials I have ever seen. They ought to play it during next years ""Super Bowl"" I am sure it would win the best commercial vote. This movie is the ultimate commercial venture and a prime example of the new Hollywood Machine. That machine takes previously made proved movies, repackages them and fills them with ads. It then hypes them and sells them back to the gullible public as a grand new event that you must pay $12 to see on opening day! Don't you agree? If not, let me ask you a question, have you ever seen Will Ferrell running down the road in his underwear before? It was funny the first time, the second time, this three times and it will be funny the next time. The only improvement that they can make will be to catch a close up of the ""BVD"" label on his underwear; of course he will have to wear them inside out next time. Well, he could wear them inside out and on his head. Hasn't that already been done and proved effective? A perfect addition to the next movie commercial.<br/><br/>In all fairness, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby has a couple of tired old, funny SNL sight gags and you don't have to think to watch it. It is actually best to be stoned when you watch it. We observed that this movie is perfect fare for mindless, pimple faced punks.

","I love lamp. Brick killed a man. Milk was a bad choice: A whole host of lines entered our collective lexicon after the brilliant Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Sadly, I do not foresee this happening with Talladega Nights : The Ballad of Ricky Bobby - because, quite frankly, there is nothing memorable about this movie.<br/><br/>The acting and comedic talent is top-notch, the premise brilliant, the legacy grand. The outcome, not so much. The film tries so very hard to be edgy, but it comes out flaccid. I have a theory that much was edited to keep the slew of corporate sponsors, and the chance to shoot on real NASCAR tracks. Maybe the Frat Pack made the film to finance some true debauchery and depravity. Maybe the slew of sponsors is part of a subversive joke, but certainly not one in the vein of Anchorman. Maybe being unimaginably dull is part of the joke.<br/><br/>Maybes aside, I will not to say the film is completely bad. Some of the situations will make it much more fun to actually watch audience reactions than the movie itself. A handful of political jabs and international ribbing really make up the bulk of the ""in-your-face"" humor, the rest being situational improv (that doesn't pan out well and is often far too drawn out) and stereotypical jokes which feel so obvious it's almost offensive (but, to my disappointment, they never really are). This is before mentioning that the movie is almost as boring as actually watching NASCAR.<br/><br/>This movie SHOULD be good. It has everything going for it: great comedians, a cast and crew of impeccable history, and the idea to knock on a ""sport"" that takes itself a bit too seriously. I must report, however, that none of this pans out, and leaving the theater almost seems liberating- the liberation of leaving a film knowing we ALL make mistakes."
"awesome_music_guy_11","1","9","21","5 August 2006"," What happened, Will?
","So far I've liked just about every Will Ferrel movie thats come out, or at least liked how he acted in the role. But this has got to be one of the most brain-dead movies I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Yes, there were some funny spots but for 95% of the movie I had a completely straight face. Let's start at the beginning (which is probably the funniest part of the movie). It begins out very clichÃ© but in a humorous, joking way. Both of the main characters are both mentally retarded (get used to this, because you will later realize that literally every single character in the entire movie is a moron). Ricky Bobby has a beautiful wife, a jealous friend eager to take his place, and a nerdy-yet attractive assistant with a new team boss that wants Ricky off his team. You quickly see the cookie cutter characters fall into an extremely predictable plot. It's so obviously clichÃ© that they were probably kidding, but I didn't find the joke very funny. For the most part the characters spit one-liner jokes that often fall flat, but are a few times funny. It seemed like if the writers couldn't think of any more one-liners, they resorted to having will Ferrel or his co-star act in some neurotic, mentally retarded fashion to get some cheap laughs. They even resorted to not once, but two times just showing will Ferrel running around in his underwear trying to put out invisible fire. In my opinion Will Ferrell can be MUCH funnier than this low-level humor. But enough of talking about the regurgitated garbage and formulaic movie elements.<br/><br/>The most disturbing part of the movie was the fascination with homosexuality. I didn't have a problem with this because I find being gay immoral OR that making fun of gay people is wrong. Homosexuality is a slippery slope to make jokes on(and it COULD have be done in a funny yet tasteful and non-offensive way) yet the movie not only steps on this slippery slope but slips and falls, hitting every offensive branch on the way down. There were NUMEROUS scenes with two men kissing (probably a dozen, in total), including the finale of this man-kissing extravaganza with will Ferrel openly making out with his rival Frenchman for no less than 30 seconds. Then they also make the gay person a villainous, retarded-speaking Frenchman with an at-first-funny-then-annoying-as-the-movie-goes-on accent that really got on my nerves. So basically whether you like gay people or hate them, you probably were offended by the over-use of gay humor.<br/><br/>There was also an awkward haliburton reference near the end, which no one really laughed at. I wish they would leave out political references in both this movie and Anchorman(which was hilarious, by the way) because IMO they both were unnecessary and didn't really have anything to do with the movie.<br/><br/>I laughed and smiled a few times, but overall this movie was a severe disappointment to me and the people I saw the movie with. It follows a cookie-cutter plot with clichÃ© characters and actors delivering sub-par(compared to their usual) performances paired with numerous gay make-out scenes and frankly a lot of low-level humor. If this all sounds enticing to you, then I would highly recommend seeing this movie, in theaters, RIGHT NOW!!!! For the rest of us normal humans, I would recommend waiting until it's on Pay-Per-View and save the money or better yet wait until it is on TV or OnDemand for free."
"Derek237","6","6","13","14 August 2006"," Will Ferrell: hilarious as always
","I saw Talledega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby last night. I was in need of a good laugh, and the flick certainly delivered. As usual, Will Ferrell is unbelievably funny and the main attraction. The actual movie, however, was fairly mediocre.<br/><br/>It feels very fractured; as if there's enough deleted scenes to make an entirely different movie (as the case was with Wake Up Ron Burgundy). I also get the feeling that they left out many funny moments to tell the tale of a man who was destined to go fast, got too cocky, and learned some valuable life lessons blah, blah, blah. I hate to say it, but it almost feels like something Happy Madison productions would dish out. Honestly, if it were not for Will Ferrell, if, say, Rob Schnieder or David Spade was in the lead, I probably would have hated this movie. But because Ferrell is so damn lovable, and because the movie had its share of funny moments and very quotable lines, I liked it. You can already tell by some of the career moves he has been making (many have been flying under the radar), Will Ferrell is slowly gearing towards an image that is more than just the lovable, hilarious idiot. And I think that just establishes him further as a kind of America's Sweetheart type.<br/><br/>John C Rielly is also worth pointing out. He's a great actor, but he seems to be at most ease when he's playing a buffoon. And his character here is about as big of a buffoon as you can imagine.<br/><br/>None of the other actors have many laughs, unfortunately. Sacha Cohen got a little irritating after a while, and every other talent is wasted. Michael Clarke Duncan. They have Michael Clarke Duncan in the damn movie and they don't do a single funny thing with him. Imagine what they could have done with him! Instead, his only laugh comes literally once the movie is over, in a blooper. David Koechner is also in the movie but he merely lingers around like a ghost. He had one scene in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and that made a more lasting impression than the couple of scenes he had in this one. There's also some cameos, of two famous singers who normally would not associate with each other (I guess that's as far as the joke goes), and they do nothing. They just sit there and don't say a word.<br/><br/>So, put that all together and your main reason to see this movie is Will and John: Shake and Bake. There are big laughs here and there, and some great great lines (the crack dealer line, the highlander line, the big red advertisement, pissing excellence, are some that stood out for me) but I guess when they edited the movie they wanted a plot. And that takes the fun out of it. It's painfully formulaic, and even many of the jokes are predictable, too. There's a kiss scene at the end that you can see coming from miles away. Sure, you can't really believe it (in a good, funny way), but you could anticipate it. Ferrell's other movies like Anchorman or Old School were in their own ways unpredictable, or at least, less predictable than this. It makes a comedy so much funnier if you don't know where it's headed from the second it starts. Anchorman barely had a plot and it turned out amazing because of that. There was more room for the funny stuff. Male Chauvanism. Panda Bears. That's all the plot I need.<br/><br/>If Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay collaborate for another comedy, I hope to see two things: A longer title and a thinner plot.<br/><br/>My rating: 6.5/10"

","It may not be THE worst movie I've ever seen, but it's right down there in the bottom two or three. It's been a long time since I walked out of a movie, but I could only endure the first thirty-five minutes of this lemon. ""The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is not about NASCAR, and it's CERTAINLY not about humor! It's more about irritation...sitting through endless skits (as in ""one seemingly never-ending"" skit, not ""rapid-fire keep-up-with-me-here"" humor) waiting for an honest laugh at the end of it , and being disappointed every time. This movie is so devoid of sophistication it makes ""My Name Is Earl"" look like Masterpiece Theater. I think ""Earl"" is the kind of feel the producers were going for, but they missed the mark, and by a wide margin. Their attempt at witty offensiveness just managed the ""offensive"" part, and left the wit at the starting line. I'm not taken aback by ANY target of humor, I just feel none of the bits in this movie were well written. Save your money, folks."

"tomq5p","3","7","16","5 August 2006"," Not enough laughs
","This could be deemed a ""preview movie."" The preview seen on television was funny and engaging; the movie isn't. In fact, some of the jokes seen in the preview don't even appear in the actual film. <br/><br/>The film is basically a re-hash of ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (with a NASCAR spin). Notice the similarity of the two films' titles: both have a title and a sub-title; both include the main character's name; both main characters have the initials R.B.; one is a ""legend,"" the other a ""ballad."" If ""Anchorman"" made you laugh, ""Talladega Nights"" probably will too. If you thought ""Anchorman"" was inane and light on laughs, avoid ""Talladega Nights."" <br/><br/>Both movies have some genuinely funny moments and punchlines, but not enough to sustain them. The formula for ""Talladega Nights"" is the exact same one used for ""Anchorman"": the actors ad-lib many of their lines and the film ends up being made in the editing room instead of emerging from the script. In theory, there is nothing wrong with this formula, but the jokes are simply not funny or frequent enough to keep the momentum up. The movie is basically a Will Ferrell Saturday Night Live sketch idea that is stretched out, somewhat painfully, over 100 minutes. <br/><br/>The humor is funny at times, stupid and ignorant at others. ""Gay"" jokes abound and the word ""retarded"" pops up a couple times. Will Ferrell can be an excellent comedian; if he was held to a higher standard, maybe he'd produce some higher-brow humor instead of churning out mindless movies that are guaranteed to perform at the box office. <br/><br/>One interesting aspect of the film is the way it completely embraces American NASCAR culture, right down to the barrage of product placement, homophobia, and overall ignorance. I left the theater somewhat unsure if the creators of the film were trying to make a statement (Will Ferrell definitely used some of his George W. impression for Ricky Bobby), or just banking in on a hugely popular American ""sport"" and culture. As mush as I'd like to think I am one of the few who are ""in"" on an elaborate joke, I doubt it. Part of the answer lies in whether or not all the brands that appear in the film (no doubt hundreds) were compensated. I fear that they were. <br/><br/>3 out of 10"

I don't believe a race car driver character like that really exists nor do I think that anyone would write about someone like that. <br/><br/>The trend in comedy is getting worse and worse - blame SNL. The stale jokes, one-liners, now wife-swapping is inexcusable.<br/><br/>I'll stick to the ""Road to Morroco"" any day over this tripe.

"philipbyrner","4","3","5","3 October 2006"," over the top trousers around the ankles humour...
","If you really like Will Ferrell you should quite enjoy this film. It has some laughs right the way through but the only putting off point to these laughs is that there's a quiet moment for a couple of seconds after to give everyone watching a chance to redeem themselves and cool off from the laughter. To be honest this is unwanted silence because the jokes aren't really that funny.<br/><br/>Yes OK as I said there are some humorous points but the main jokes are focused on Will Ferrell screaming, which I don't find that funny. Actually I would put this down as a put off showing the stereotypical character of a drunken American loud mouth. This running around with your trousers around your ankles screaming mercifully for about 10 minutes gets boring and at times ridiculous and when the audience laughs for the 1st 2 minutes the cinema is left quiet until this ludicrous satirical episode ends.<br/><br/>Another point to add about Will Ferrell would be to say that he lacks the ability to hold a film and make it his as the leading actor, having said that I think he would be a fantastic accompaniment to a film but too much screaming affects any real judgement on whether he can act. I know it was meant to be a comedy but even Jim Carrey's antics made more sense than some of the ones in this film.<br/><br/>Other than that I thought the French character Gerard played by Sasha bohen (Borat) was a generous addition. Even though the French accent was made a little bit more ridiculous than it actually is, maybe the words were a bit drawn out but the film needed this transition as it took away from Will Ferrell's over compromising character.<br/><br/>All in all this film was OK but I could have easily not watched it and had as much fun staying at home and watched an old Sopranos or something, but if u like Will Ferrell screaming and doing silly things constantly then this is the one for you."

If anyone ever tried you to convince you that America is not in a state of freefall, your trump argument would be to drop the title of this movie into the conversation. The other party would just have to go silent in agreement.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Will Ferrell. I wouldn't see another movie with him in it if he stapled one hundred dollar bills to his naked body and shoved a roman candle up his ***; which can't be too far off. What on earth is John C Reilley doing in this?<br/><br/>Here are ten things I'd rather do than watch a Will Farell movie: Let's start with the easy one: I would rather eat horse feces.

I would rather do 7 other humiliating things And yes, I would rather go to NASCAR and laugh at real idiots."
"Jonny_Numb","2","7","17","13 August 2006"," When all else fails, run around in your underwear...
","The best moments in ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,"" belong to under-appreciated character actor Gary Cole (who played Mike Brady in both ""Brady Bunch"" movies, a sinister thief in ""A Simple Plan,"" and a malevolent sheriff on the TV series ""American Gothic""), who not only treats the material with a gleefully smug sarcasm, but also provides the only whiff of successful comic timing in this NASCAR-wreck of a comedy.<br/><br/>Either I have a knee-jerk resistance to movies featuring the blowhard cast members of ""Saturday Night Live"" and am missing out on nuggets of comedic genius that infiltrate the multiplexes once every month or so, or I'm becoming too snobby for my overgrown film-snob shoes. Whatever the case may be, the recent rash of kitchen-sink comedies featuring performers either obnoxious or charming tend to be largely hit-or-miss affairs. In the best-case scenario, a majority of the gags hit home (""The 40-Year Old Virgin""); on a less successful level are films whose high energy compensates for the margin of misfired gags (""Team America,"" ""Anchorman""); and beneath that lies ""Talladega Nights,"" a film that (snobby) professors of sociology and psychology might unearth 50 years from now to display as a symbol of everything that was wrong with the American sensibility toward things, circa 2006. But wait...maybe that's what star/co-writer Will Ferrell is aiming for! Firing shots at an American Past Time that is quickly eclipsing Major League Baseball, a satirical foray into the world of NASCAR seems like a no-brainer (literally); a scenario so broad that the comedic possibilities are endless. And while he's prone to grating on my nerves in large doses, Will Ferrell has proved gifted in the realm of comedic excess with his retro-behind-the-scenes news send-up, ""Anchorman."" While I wasn't chomping at the bit to see ""Talledega Nights,"" I can't say I wasn't a little intrigued at its potential.<br/><br/>But for all its attempts to gross us out and make us bust a gut, ""Talladega Nights"" is an incredibly pedestrian comedy. For the most part, this tale of the titular superstar NASCAR racer (Ferrell) who suffers a particularly un-funny trauma (he wrecks, and runs around under the delusion that he's been set aflame, when he hasn't) only to rise up and compete against a corporate-competitor Frenchman (Sacrebleu! the French are traitors and wussies in post-9/11 America!) is trying to be a sappy, inspirational movie as much as it's trying to be a send-up of sappy, inspirational movies. We have the corporate flunky who sets Ricky up for a fall; the wackily eclectic pit crew; the cheating-whore trophy wife; the precocious children who yell and swear; the best buddy who shares with Ricky a really stupid catchphrase (""Shake n' bake!""); and the quietly inhibited girl who turns into a purring love interest for our hero. The jokes come quick and dirty, from every which direction--but the satirical possibility of the material seems completely lost on the filmmakers, thus transforming ""Talladega Nights"" into just another undistinguished pile of misfired comedic excess. (By comparison, a ""Trekkies""-style mockumentary targeting NASCAR would have elicited more laughs.) <br/><br/>The half-dozen or so laughs I did derive from ""Talladega"" came courtesy of Cole's hilarious portrayal of Ricky's hard-drinking father, whose unorthodox methods of re-affirming his son's crushed spirit consist of driving blindfolded and with a cougar, among other things. And there's also a great scene involving the removal of a knife plunged into a thigh with another knife. Otherwise, this is a most unspectacular pit stop...but then again, maybe I'm the one who's missing out here...and if that's so, I don't feel the least bit bad about it."
"spam-136","1","7","17","12 August 2006"," A very strange movie
","Movies are a very effective form of getting a point across, either through the actions/dialogue of a character, or the plot of the movie -- these add up to a ""moral"" or ""lesson."" Most comedies do not have this; they exist merely to entertain. Take a movie like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. It is a silly movie, and it does not try to be anything else than a silly movie. And it is extremely effective in its silliness, as well, because the movie is set in a world with rules, even if the rules are stupid. This is the main problem with Talladega Nights. It has no rules. Every character in this movie contradicts him or herself hundreds of times. We think that Ricky Bobby is going act a certain way, and instead he does the exact opposite.<br/><br/>And this is where you have to decide: were the creators of this movie aware of this fact? Did they purposely make every character in this movie NOT likable, simply through their willingness to change their own actions based on a final, pre-set outcome? Was the ending of this movie at all surprising? Of course not. But did Will Ferrell do that on purpose? My point here is that I cannot tell whether or not this movie is intended to be so bad as to be a commentary on NASCAR culture and patriotism. If it is, it is quite hyperbolic and biting. Every character in this movie is rather stupid, but for some reason they all get bursts of intelligence once in a while -- even that doesn't fit the whole ""parody"" paradigm.<br/><br/>And, if the movie is not self-aware of its own ridiculousness, then it is a VERY, VERY bad movie, with lame set-ups for jokes and characters that are so inconsistent they make you want to smash your head on a rock. I usually hate when people write things like ""This movie wasn't funny, because no one in the theater laughed."" Well, I went to this movie, and every time there was supposed to be a joke, no one laughed. Again, either the comedy is so smart that it's going over our heads here, or it's just very stupid. Whether this movie serves as a commentary on American culture, or was just a vehicle for Will Ferrell to act like an idiot yet again is up to you, but I think you can tell how I feel about it."

This wonderfully talented, beautiful, shooting star that wowed us to sheer disbelief in the masterful Junebug is excellent, but her sheer genius cannot salvage this pretentious, condescending pile of hypocritical, degenerative sludge. The actress that plays Carly who won a modeling contract from Oprah inexplicably is neither attractive, charming, or talented. Sacha Baron Cohen's character is a dim ray of light in this disaster, however his character strikes the viewer as more weird than funny.

There was obviously lots of ad-libbing going on, and as haphazardly strung together as it was, it just wasn't a funny story - at best, there were only a few somewhat funny moments, but most attempts just fell flat.

The movie is sooooo inconsistent. For every funny moment, there were 3 awkward moments in which you knew a joke had just occurred, but it either A) Didn't deserve laughs, or B) Was laughed at because WIll Farrell said it and he's supposed to be funny, or C) Was laughed at because someones friend was laughing because Will Farrell is supposed to be funny all of the time. <br/><br/>The acting was ""hit or miss"" at times as well.

This is basically Ferrel just doing his same over the top routine and loud yelling just in a southern accent and in a different setting.<br/><br/>The story is a weak one (not that I was expecting it to be strong) and is very bland and boring but the occasional loud yell or randomness that goes on in this movie keeps you awake. I found that the same jokes and routines were just being used over and over again from within this movie and from within Ferrel's other performances. There was never any exceptionally stupid or exceptionally great thing that went on to really keep me interested so it was pretty predictable, I used the analogy that if I had fallen asleep right after the beginning and woke up at the end I could of figure out what had happened in between.<br/><br/>Personally I'm not a Will Ferrel fan whatsoever, mainly because of the characters he always seems to play, the exception would be ""Hobie"" in Melinda Melinda but needless to say he's not one of my favorite actors and never will be if he keeps doing rolls like this one."

Actually I cannot think of another way that this film could be made without being so being something else. The colors are bright to garish. The emotions are soapish to bathetic.

","""Talladega Nights"" is a movie about NASCAR, the greatest sport know to man. It was written by Will Faro and Adam McKay and directed by Adam McKay. When NASCAR top driver, Rickey Bobby finds himself at the top of the pack, a new driver from France, Jean Girard, takes him on for the lead.<br/><br/>NASCAR most popular driver Rickey Bobby cannot lose a race: it is not in his blood. His whole life he has lived by one saying that his father told him right before he left him at the age of thirteen. He said, ""Rickey, if you ain't first your last."" That is a saying which has kept the fire inside him to bring him to the top of the NASCAR circuit. He did not get there on his own: his team mate Cal Naughton, Jr., has been there right beside him to help him any way he can. With their popular sling shot move no one can beat this NASCAR team.<br/><br/>While they are enjoying their fame at the top of the NASCAR circus, there is a new driver who has made the move from the formal one circuit to NASCAR and he is good. When Rickey suffers from a horrifying wreck during one of the races, he is put into the hospital, mainly to check him out after the wreck. Rickey realizes that he cannot walk, but he really is fine. He just thinks that he cannot walk. The doctors say that it is just in his head and he will be alright in a while. Eventually, he realizes that he can walk again after his crew chef and good friend Naughton convinces him that he can walk again. A few weeks later, Ricky has healed and is ready to run some test laps, he climbs into the car and he start out good, but when he gets up to about twenty-five miles an hour he freaks out, stops the car, and gets out screaming--""I am on fire."" His pit crew runs to his aid and straightens him out. Realizing that Rickey will never race again, the team owner fires Rickey. When Rickey arrives home, he finds that his wife is seeing his best friend Naughton. She tells Rickey are getting a divorce, and she is getting married to his best friend. After getting kicked out of his own house by his ex-wife and best friend, he and his two sons, Walker and Texas Ranger, move into his mother's house where Rickey gets a job as a pizza delivery boy.<br/><br/>Lucy Bobby, Rickey's mom, realizes that Rickey needs to overcome his fears and get back into NASCAR. She contacts Rickey's dad, Reese Bobby, and tells him to help Ricky go fast again. The rest of the movie we will have to see because I do not want to spoil the ending. It is a great movie, and if you like NASCAR, then you will like this movie."

","I was looking forward to seeing this movie because I love Will Farrell but I have to say this movie was a HUGE disappointment. Not to mention, highly offensive. In my opinion it is another not so subtle, attempt by Hollywood to push it's gay agenda. There was a primary character who was ""married"" to his gay lover and there were no less than three incidences of men kissing each other; including Will Farrell making out with a guy. YUK! I had teen aged girls with me and they were ""grossed out"" too. All said the movie was awful and that the guy kissing scenes totally ruined it for them. As a parent, if I'd wanted my children exposed to this then I'd have taken them to a Gay Pride Parade.

Days Of Thunder did go overboard with the racing but, it sure as hell is a great NASCAR movie next to this one. And the idiot thinking he can't walk and sticking himself with a knife takes the cake.

It fits the bill and hits the checklist in every category. It makes you laugh, the dialogue is extremely quotable, the scenes are memorable, and the stereotypes are just oh so perfect. NASCAR, which is arguably the most joked about sport in the world, was the perfect way to root a satire movie and this movie nailed it.

Ricky bobby was a pit crew member until one day he got into the car during a race and did great. He got noticed and started driving Nascar for a company and he was number one in the races. His friend Cal always helped him in the races and came in second or third and asked why cant he be first for once. He realized he was being used and his Ricky crashed one race and he lost everything. His sponsorship, house and his wife married Cal and he was living with his mother delivering pizzas. Then slowly he got his old pit crew back and they built a car.

","Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006): Dir: Adam McKay / Cast: Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Gary Cole, Sacha Baron Cohen, Leslie Bibb: Another superb comedy from director Adam McKay although not the masterpiece that Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is. Title regards Ricky Bobby's carefree existence through life. He was born in a car in fast motion and grew to dominate the race tracks until an accident costs him his reputation, his wife, his best friend, and his team. Director Adam McKay is smart enough to detail the screenplay and deliver an intriguing conclusion. Will Ferrell plays Ricky whose reckless racing parallels his life. He goes through a hilarious transition believing to be paralyzed then his father re-enters his life to assist him in the predicted outcome. John C. Reilly steals scenes as his naÃƒÂ¯ve best friend who goes from second place to the new husband of Bobby's wife. The result of this is twisted but somewhat endearing. Leslie Bibb plays Ricky's wife who ends up playing the field too close to home. Gary Cole is superb as Ricky's irresponsible father who goes from failure to becoming a pivotal element in his comeback. His methods are hilariously dangerous but we know where it is headed. Sacha Baron Cohen counters a standard subplot as a rival driver by swaying our concluding expectations. Funny attack on the world of Nascar. Score: 8 / 10"

","The excellent cast go all-out to be as silly as possible in this great Will Ferrell vehicle (excuse the pun). Ferrell plays his usual outrageously spoiled man-child (as in Anchorman) who is forced to grow up when his hi jinks catch up with him and he's cast out of his successful world. For me, though, the funniest character is the French racing star played by Sacha Baron-Cohen - a hysterical portrait of a pompous snob who reads Camus and sips coffee in his car while casually overtaking the Nascar field, and who freaks out everyone in the bigoted, good old boys racing scene with his gay lifestyle. But like Anchorman, there are so many great scenes, such as when Ricky Bobby's bimbo wife switches to his best friend (John C. Reilly) when Ricky is losing; any scenes Jane Lynch is in, as Ferrell's mother; or the way Ricky unashamedly advertises everything from cake mix to tampons. The movie is just full of steady, reliable laughs."

","This was an excellent parody of the world of NASCAR with their corporate sponsorships, endorsements, beer, and trophy wives. It also takes big blows at middle class Americans, homosexuals and has a heavy emphasis on The South. Though this is in the spirit of fun, the critiquing of beliefs is definitely shown, especially being completely irreverent and blasphemous towards religion specifically the Christian population of the United States. The acting was good for the most part, and I was especially expressed with the child actors in the film. The storyline seemed reminiscent of another Will Ferrell movie Elf, with his shaky mental state and ""daddy issues."" ""With all due respect"" it is somewhat cheesy, and some of the jokes get old like 'Shake and Bake' or are simply not funny like the scene with the long argument about crepes. It also seemed obvious even while watching all of the cutting in the film. This was definitely a negative, but overall the film was entertaining."

","When America's number one NASCAR speed-demon is issued a direct challenge from a gay, French Formula One racer with a hunger for the top spot and a mean talent for tight-cornering, the race is on to become the number one man in all of NASCAR in a full throttle comedy starring Will Ferrell and directed by Anchorman cohort Adam McKay. Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) is a national hero with a ""smokin' hot"" trophy wife, pair of borderline-abusively precocious sons, and an endless line of endorsement deals filling his mansion with toys and driveway with sports cars and Hummers. His racing partner and lifelong friend Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly), never fails to provide him with a hand on the racetrack, frequently performing their trademark ""slingshot"" maneuver to shoot Ricky into first place, leaving Cal in second. While the public loves these buddies (popularly known by the meaningless childhood nicknames they find so exceedingly cool: ""Shake and Bake""), a wedge comes between the two, as Ricky Bobby's longstanding winning-streak is broken by flamboyant French Formula One driver Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), robbing Ricky of everything in an instant as the trauma leaves him unable to drive. Ricky's wife takes his fortunes while Cal takes his wife, and now he's back with his mother (Jane Lynch) and long-estranged father (Gary Cole). Things look bad for Ricky, but his father was once a race car driver himself, and now with the help of a training montage, a live cougar, and the courage to drive without his gleaming white Wonder Bread endorsement, Ricky might be ready to face the track again."

The trouble is, the movie is not funny; it is simply stupid. The scenes that the writers tried to make comical were not because those scenes reminded me of real people that I know who would actually try the scene in real life.

","Will Ferrell stars in ""Talladega Nights"" as Ricky Bobby, a talented NASCAR driver who manages to win almost all the races he enters, making him the most popular driver in the circuit. His luck changes though when a French Formula One driver (Sacha Baron Cohen) enters the scene and steals all the attention, so Ricky Bobby will have to work hard and use all his talent in order to retain his No.1 status. <br/><br/>The film has the same style as one of Ferrell's other films, ""Anchorman"", but it somehow doesn't manage to be that funny and hit all the right notes that the previous did. The characters are funny and the film is a good NASCAR parody, but something seems to be missing here. That's probably because sometimes the jokes seem a little absurd and out of place. The movie compensates however with the racing scenes and I found those to be particularly good for a film that doesn't want to be taken too seriously. The acting is exactly what you would expect from a film like this, most of the actors did a decent job in developing their characters and the results are satisfying.<br/><br/>""Talladega Nights"" is a film that is entertaining and pleasant to watch, but it is a little too silly at times. It is worth watching though for its great comedy cast and well made racing sequences. <br/><br/>My rating: 6,5/10"

","I always approach a Will Ferrell film with trepidation: I think he is very versatile and talented actor, but so very often I dislike the parts he plays.<br/><br/>Ricky Bobby, however, is quite a nice guy. A little on the dumb side, but essentially decent. And the movie overall is fairly amusing - not that much in the way of major laugh-out-louds, but quite a lot of chuckling more or less throughout.<br/><br/>I know nothing about NASCAR and care even less, but this doesn't matter - it is simply a world in which to set the story. And, as is so often the case, there is profanity which I found fairly unnecessary - this would be my main criticism.<br/><br/>All the cast are good. The two boys playing Ferrell's sons get some fabulous lines, and Sacha Baron Cohen gives the most - 'ow you say? - individual French accent since Peter Sellers' Clouseau.<br/><br/>Good fun in an undemanding way."

","My Take: One of the most effective comedies in a long time. <br/><br/>Most comedians should owe much to Will Farrell, who may be the last best comedian at work in Hollywood to date. After charming me with ELF and then again in ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY, Farrell returns in yet another highly-funny comedy that still proves that Farrell's definition of comedy is just the same as ours. Completely wacky jokes and public satire are surprisingly clever in TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOOBY. While it isn't exactly of all tastes (messy humor and crude language may turn off a considerable legion of audience), but it's adult comedy at best. This time, there really are laughs when they mean ""adult humor"".<br/><br/>Farrell plays boastful NASCAR driver Ricky Booby, who has it all, from sexy wife (Leslie Bibb), all the money and all the first-place wins he can possible loath. But after a turn in his career, Booby gets a taste of the simple life as a second banana to best friend Cal Naughton Jr. (John C. Reilly) and embarrassed by a daredevil yet gay French racer (Sacha Baron Cohen). Stuck being a pizza boy living with his mom, Booby returns to the fast lane with a little ""help"" from his long-lost drunk daddy (Gary Cole).<br/><br/>It's racist, noisy and offensive to be sure. But it's also funny, clever and really winning at the same time. TALLADEGA NIGHTS isn't the best and most creative comedy to come out in Hollywood for many years, certainly not the best one out in the year. But with much funnier and more effective term for humor, it's a success all its own for what it is.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

He cannot enter the role with enough conviction to pull it off.<br/><br/>The father is a bore and the training session is stupid rather than funny."

","My friend and I went to go see this movie and we were rather disappointed. Not only did we know what was going to happen (even the details of the end were expected) but we were even able to predict lines! I know that these types of films aren't overly complex as far as plots are concerned so I wasn't too surprised by being able to predict events. One of the main things that Will Farrell is known for is his off the wall, improv comedic lines but I do not feel that this was as creative as it could have been. It almost felt as if he was just recycling lines from previous movies. The funniest part of the whole film was the bloopers during the credits. If you want to see this one, wait for it to be available on Netflix."

I saw this movie with my girlfriend and we spent the entire evening shooting each other sideways glances. Neither one of us could believe it.

Extended dramatic scenes, character development, love interests....not to mention the fact the film is one big rip-roarin' infomercial for how excitin' an' cool Nascar is. I was nervous when I first heard the producers mention in an interview they got ""permission"" from Nascar to do this movie. That's never a good sign and this movie confirmed it. Nascar, something that has cried out for satire for years now, is put on a pedestal and made the spring board for straight-faced action sequences. Yes, action sequences!!

","I thought ""Lady in the Water"" was funnier. Seriously, I did. The purposeful humor of a thriller/drama had more impact than that of a Will Ferrell comedy. Even the (what I believe to be) accidental jokes of ""Lady in the Water"" cast a bigger smile on my face than Will Ferrell's ""awesome"" performance as Ricky Bobby. I wasn't even fooled by the trailer. My friends made me see it. I think as a general rule Will Ferrell should stick to supporting roles as the comic relief (I liked him in Old School). I even really liked him in several of his (but not all) roles on SNL. Lead roles, such as ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights"" just aren't his forte'."

","Hollywood has produced amazing comedies over the last 80 years, with glorious results such as the crisp, gender confusion lines in ""Some Like it Hot"", the hilarious horror spoof given to us by Mel Brook in ""Young Frankestein"", and we have been treated to a few comedic gems by the new renaissance in animation. There are talented comedians in Hollywood, and it's always fun to see them at their best. Robin Williams and Steve Martin come to mind.<br/><br/>Sadly, whatever is being advertised as funny and comedic in this piece of junk, is not even remotely close to the films mentioned before. For starters, it has another lead performance by a man who has taken the magic out of ""Bewitched"", provided the low point in an otherwise great film ""The Wedding Crashers"", and has routinely confounded us in the audience with a little bit of discrimination and taste.<br/><br/>This waste of 90 minutes encourages us to walk out and recoil in disgust as several of the ""characters"" express idiotic ideas in sounds that can only be describe as offensive, screechy, and remotely human. An expletive has been known to be funny in the right situation, and sometimes a hint of bawdy humor goes a long way. In this film, we are constantly clobbered with vulgarity, raunchiness, and loud, rude, and moronic dialog.<br/><br/>2006 continues to be peppered with titles that will rank among the worst ever in Cinema, and this if anything will be more than competition for the title of the worst of the worst, if a certain mystical water creature doesn't snatch that dubious honor. Let this be a reminder to the producers and ""creative"" minds in Hollywood: you shall fail if you continue to treat us this way; sincerely, we are not all looking forward, living, or seeking role models among the lowest common denominators of humanity."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","3","5","13","13 October 2006"," Homogenised, cheeseburger crap.
","Talladega Nights is so crudely manufactured and tacked together that if it were a real NASCAR it would break down before even leaving the factory. Adam McKay and Will Ferrell try their hardest to make the movie work but there is simply not enough mileage in the paper-thin concept to stretch over 108 minutes.<br/><br/>The only people this film is likely to appeal to are NASCAR fans themselves. I don't find anything particularly interesting about a bunch of generic, advertisement-covered vehicles circling a big oval 200 times. I honestly don't see what the appeal is. The movie only exists to cash in on the current, inexplicable NASCAR craze and as another excuse to have Will Ferrell run around in his underwear. Even if the racing were exciting it would justify its existence but it is all done so flatly and amateurish you'd be forgiving for thinking you're just watching some random traffic shots. Even uber-trash Days of Thunder didn't fail in this department.<br/><br/>There are a few laughs here and there, mainly from Reese Bobby, Ricky's transient, pot-dealing father, played by Gary Cole (that's the voice of Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law, folks). But the one thing that almost ruins the entire movie (not hard considering how poor it is anyway) is Sascha Baron Cohen's misjudged, stilted, woefully unfunny performance as a gay Formula One driver. He's just absolutely horrible and every scene with him is painful to watch.<br/><br/>In the end TN:TBORB simply cannot escape the Deus Ex Machina ending you've seen coming from minute one or any other tiresome, clichÃ©d plot mechanics. And it's just not worth your hard earned pennies to laugh only 5 times in 2 hours in between endless bad jokes and boring fast cars. Go play Skalectrix or something."

He has done lots of good kids comedies. And with the ""NASCAR"" theme I would it would really be good comedy with the good ole boys and all.<br/><br/>Not so. WAY NOT SO.<br/><br/>The villain in the movie (another NASCAR driver) was not only openly homosexual - he was FLAMING! The introduced him and his wife (another man). From that point on it was an indoctrination movie on the homosexual lifestyle. The movie ended with a homosexual kiss (not just a peck on the cheek - the full - open mouth - 20 second passionate kiss between the villain and Will Ferrel himself.<br/><br/>Will Ferrel ought be be ashamed at this ""movie"" he did. It makes me wonder if he is homosexual also, because with his reputation he could have nixed all the queer stuff going on in this movie (my opinion). What makes this so damaging is the audience for this movie is really teens and young adults (rated PG13).<br/><br/>I'm also surprised that NASCAR would have its good name affiliated with such trash! But I'm sure with the dollars involved, principles go right into the toilet.<br/><br/>Please, please, don't give the homosexuals who obviously financed this movie your money. Tell everyone you know not to see this garbage. You know, its really too bad, because there was some funny stuff in it and on its own it could have been really funny and well done without the homosexual indoctrination routines.<br/><br/>Well, I've learned my lesson with Hollywood, I'm going to screen any movies I take the kids to first.

I'm not sure if this a problem with me or the movie itself.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the movie simply wasn't as funny as I was hoping it to be. I really thought I'd be treated to the same level of hilarity that I found in ""The Anchorman"" (for example). Sadly, that wasn't the case. While there are certainly some gut busting moments, when viewed as a whole it just wasn't firing on all cylinders (pun intended). There were several stretches of the movie where I found myself barely chuckling, and _almost_ wondering when it was going to be over.<br/><br/>I thought many of the characters, notably Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Mrs. Dennit (Molly Shannon), were under utilized. I also felt like the ad-libbing (if such was the case) simply wasn't gelling as well as it has in previous Ferrell vehicles.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a moderately funny movie (with a few gems), but don't expect anything on the level of ""The Anchorman"" or ""Old School"".<br/><br/>I gave it a 6/10."

","So Ron Burgundy moves from behind the anchor desk to behind the wheel of a super-charged NASCAR automobile.<br/><br/>Or Frank The Tank of ""Old School"" gets a job racing cars. Basically it's all the same with Will Ferrell pictures. Insert the goofy, obnoxious man-child into any occupation, light the fuse, turn on the cameras and get away, he'll do the rest.<br/><br/>And even though this movie will not have the words ""Oscar-winner"" in front of it, it made me laugh Â– a lot; and that's what comedies are supposed to do, aren't they? The plot is pretty simple. Ricky (Ferrell) is born in the back of a Charger driven by his reckless father, Reese (Gary Cole, ""Office Space,"" ""The Brady Bunch Movie""). He grows up really stupid and without his shiftless dad, but always yearns to drive fast.<br/><br/>As an adult, he's on the pit crew of the worst team (Laughing Clown Malt Liquor) in NASCAR history. When the team's driver quits in the middle of a race, Ricky takes over and leads the team to a third-place finish.<br/><br/>From there he is unstoppable (thanks mainly to teammate and fellow driver, Cal Naughton, Jr., played by John C. Reilly), winning race after race and picking up dozens of endorsements. Soon, he has a beautiful wife (Leslie Bibb, TV series ""Crossing Jordan"" and ""Nip & Tuck""), two rude, foul-mouthed kids and lives in a mansion.<br/><br/>He's also arrogant and continually insults his team's owner (Greg Germann, ""Friends With Money"" and a regular on ""Ally McBeal""), until one day he finds himself replaced by an evil, gay, effeminate Frenchman (are there any other kind?), Jean Girard, a hilarious read by Sacha Baron Cohen (a voice in ""Madagascar""), who's married to Andy Richter, Conan O'Brien's former sidekick.<br/><br/>While racing Girard, Bobby goes airborne and has a rollover wreck; he emerges thinking he's on fire. Later, he imagines himself as paralyzed, as well.<br/><br/>He soon loses his wife to Cal, his home, his job and his self-respect (and is forced to deliver pizzas on a bike). Enter Reese back into his life. His father tries to get him to drive without fear (by putting an angry cougar in the front seat with him); to ""feel"" the road (by making him drive with a blindfold on) and to go fast again (by taping cocaine under the car and calling the cops).<br/><br/>Ricky is now ready for the big Talladega 500 race, but will have to contend with both Girard and his former best friend, Cal, who is now the number two driver on the circuit.<br/><br/>Directed by Adam McKay, who helmed Ferrell's ""Anchorman,"" (and worked with him on ""Saturday Night Live"") and written by McKay and Ferrell, you can bet this movie is one long laugh-fest. I'd call the script crude yet crisp, meaning while it has it's stupid moments, there are a few fairly intelligent gags, a well. These include Girard drinking cafÃ© and reading Albert Camus' ""The Stranger"" while winning a race; and Ricky trying to explain the appeal of ""Highlander"" to him.<br/><br/>As crude as some of the other parts are, though, this is one of the funniest movies you will see this year, and gets a big recommendation from this humble scribbler."

He gets his chance to show his stuff when the team's driver decides that he has to go to the toilet during a race. From then on nothing can stop Ricky Bobby, the man with two first names. That is until, a Formula 1 driving Frenchman is added to Ricky Bobby's lineup. And the heat is on. Fans of Farrell and Nascar will probably love this film. When I saw it at an early screening, the audience was laughing and even cheering. I'm not a Farrell fan or a follower of Nascar, so I became bored about halfway into the film. It seemed too long and relied on the same jokes over and over, particularly Ricky Bobby and his friend's signature phrase ""Shake and Bake."" Enough already. Sacha Baron Cohen is the best reason to endure this film. Maybe Steve Martin should have taken French lessons from this guy. He's very good. And so is John C. Reilly, who plays the clueless buddy. A particularly cringeworthy performance comes courtesy of Molly Shannon. How does she keep getting work? Talladega Nights will undoubtedly make a lot of money at the box office.

Much of the acting looks improvised, almost one-takes (the out-takes are better than the movie). Sacha Cohen is far better on his Ali G show, and does a poor Frenchman, even though his role is supposed to be stupid. The whole movie both mocks and imitates, exploits and kowtows to the presumed low mentality of NASCAR lovers, with a few subtle licks at George Bush-ism. The car racing scenes are awful. No one except Reece Bobby is believable (or supposed to be?). What a waste of talent. I didn't see anyone in the theater over 18, and these actors have been on Larry King! What infantile hype!

The plot was thin and was quickly dissolved by having too much going on at once (Ricky Bobby's relationship with his best friend, a troublesome home life, family problems with his dad, new competition on the race track, and psychological issues acquired from a crash early in the movie.) The movie did have a moral, but it was extremely weak. Of course, not all of this movie was bad. Ferrell carried out a very well acted character and was obviously enthusiastic in his role. The movie also throws in some social satire about stereotypical Americans (don't start to think this is a deep film).

I am so proud that she didn't want to see any more filth. Needed an X rating. Dumb, disturbing contents. Children shouldn't have been allowed to participate in the production of this movie in any fashion. Actors in this film shouldn't get paid. Actors must be desperate if this is all they can lend their careers on! Boring and extremely repetitive. Some Saturday Night Live actors get away with making trash. It was worse than awful and the sad part is they are laughing all the way to the bank with people that make diddle squat salary money compared to these actors but I got my money back.Sadly I know they have talent because I have seen them in really wonderful movies, especially Ricky Bobby's best friend. He could have written his own movie in one night and gotten a better review than mine."

","officially the worst film i have ever ever ever seen, what a waste of money, I'm really angry that i wasted my time watching this plot less humorous boring rubbish! i really enjoyed anchor man and was a will farrel fan and now am completely gutted and lost all respect for this guy! he has totally sold out and has no interest in making good films or providing entertainment. the characters were dull and there was not one humorous moment in the entire film not one audience member laughed,even if your an anchor man fan seriously do not i repeat, do not waste your time or money don't even bother downloading It, just pretend it doesn't exist! . This film Will hopefully ruin farrel and we wont then be subjected to another pitiful excuse for a comedy! shame on him!"
"smibbity","1","3","7","13 September 2006"," For the Blue Collar TV crowd...
","You can't compare this movie to Anchorman. The comedy and acting in Anchorman actually has depth. It's like comparing a Mike Myer/Chris Farley/David Spade/Adam Sandler episode of Saturday Night Live to Blue Collar TV. All toilet humor and kids with foul mouths. They knew what they were doing when they made this movie...appealing to a completely different segment of the population was the goal. It's not surprising, no one's made a ""Smokey and the Bandit"" style comedy in a while.<br/><br/>I walked out and got my money refunded after about 25 minutes. I have no patience with a movie that throws shallow humor at you hoping you have no desire for your intellect to be engaged.<br/><br/>The sheer number of people that find this movie funny causes great concern for me."

","Gump ""Stupid is as stupid does"". Movie was not worth a crap. Didn't make a meaning to make. No thought or brains was put in this movie. They did not bother to make the picture even think it was from Alabama. It was in NC. Nothing wrong with NC.Many of the Legends are from NC. <br/><br/>I can see why they came up with Will to do the picture.Who in their right mind would be a party to such crap?I hope Nascar fans do not have to hide their heads to long. Nascar was much to kind to them in my mind. Why would you take such a great sport and make fun of it with this movie? It seems to me that it was made by people who don't get it or don't care what names they hurt. Yep! Nascar was to easy on them."

","I walked out of the movie with my granddaughter and 27 yr. old daughter. No plot , stupid..... Kept waiting for something to happen that was funny..... is it for a reason the description of the movie left out the Gay French driver. I am surprised the Nascar people have not raised arms over this movie. It portrays them to be redneck money hungry stupid people.... Waste of money and time..... Not even one laugh .......AWFUL.. I am not anti-gay..... but the whole story plot from the family disrespect to the gay issues made me sick. This requires 10 lines and I cant give this movie 10 lines of thought...

"muqchuq","1","3","7","14 August 2006"," Insulting.
","Through 25+ years of going to theaters, I have never asked for my money back before. The writers avoided lampooning NASCAR and the South and ended up directly insulting both their targets and the audience. Viewers are prevented from caring about these caricatures (I didn't mean characters) because they're cardboard cutouts. I actually wanted to see them all go up in flames. In the end, I couldn't wait out the potential of that happy end. I left.<br/><br/>This movie takes stereotypes and throws them into even less-appealing relief by exaggerating them. Couple that with awful camera work, crude references, simplistic dialog and scenes that go 1, 2 and sometimes 3 minutes too long and ... you get this. It isn't funny; it's a road accident. That most viewers didn't understand they'd been duped into paying to be insulted is amusing. Sort of. It's also stunning. How could you NOT stand up and leave? <br/><br/>While it had the potential to be sharp and funny, it is dull, boring and loathsome. If entertainment is a fine steak with all the trimmings, this movie is an unseasoned flank steak left on a hot grill all afternoon. It is 1 hour and 45 minutes you'll never get back."
"kdchennault","1","3","7","10 August 2006"," I can't believe I actually paid for a ticket
","I just came from the theater after seeing ""Talledega Nights"". Actually, I just walked out of the theater after seeing only half of the movie. This is one of the worst films I can remember. The profanity is terrible and much of the dialogue/situations are highly inappropriate for anyone but adults. How did this movie get a PG-13 rating? I expected a certain amount of crudeness because of the cast, but nothing like this. Sure, there are a couple of funny moments but not enough to recommend this film to anyone. The best laughs were in the TV trailers. There are some talented comedians in this film who could have made a much better movie if they had not taken the easy way out and tried to get the cheap laughs. Very disappointing, and I will think twice before going to see another Will Ferrell movie."
"MovieAddict2016","5","5","15","8 August 2006"," What ""Anchorman"" was for the news, ""Talladega Nights"" is for NASCAR.
","Here's another comedy in the vein of ""Anchorman"" which is sure to win over the hearts of the easily amused. And by ""easily amused"" I mean teenage boys who think poop jokes are an endless source of joy.<br/><br/>I didn't care much for ""Anchorman"" and this left me feeling similarly unimpressed. Does it have some big laughs? Yes. But its titular character is so aggravating and unlikable, and its story is so ridiculously unbelievable, that developing any emotional attachment towards the movie's protagonists Â– which the film expects us to do at times Â– is a hard task.<br/><br/>The most obvious example of ""Ricky Bobby's"" simplistic humor is its title. As one character states, ""He's got two first names."" Har, har.<br/><br/>The film tries to come across as a satirical statement on blind patriotism (""AmericaÂ…the greatest country in the world""), rednecks, Christians, NASCAR and the ruthless commercialism of the national spirit Â– but it only goes for surface digs. Oh, look! They raise their kids poorly! They swear at the dinner table! They pray to Baby Jesus! They make fun of gays! That's so funny! Yeah, and it gets old fast.<br/><br/>If you're going to make a movie parodying NASCAR then go all out. There's so much more that could be done. Essentially all ""Talladega Nights"" does is obnoxiously point fingers at stupid stereotypes that we already get enough of with ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour."" (Although, admittedly, I'd take Will Ferrell over Larry the Cable Guy any day of the week.) Speaking of stereotypes - Sacha Baren Cohen's horrible French accent is one of the most regrettable in motion picture history. Yes, I know it was intentional. And it was also painfully unfunny.<br/><br/>""Talladega Nights"" has some strong moments of wacky humor. If you go see it, you'll laugh a lot Â– and you'll also sit there a lot, staring at the screen, wondering if that little pause amongst the cast members a few seconds ago after they said something stupid was meant to indicate that their spoken dialogue was an intended joke, and they were giving us a moment to react to it.<br/><br/>Just like ""Anchorman,"" it starts out strong and midway just collapses. Once Ricky Bobby loses his home the movie flushes all its realism down the toilet and turns into a very typical underdog story Â– I half-expected to see Sly Stallone running down the street in shorts or Ralph Macchio waxing on and off. The film drew less and less laughter from the crowd as it rambled on recklessly, and the conclusion Â– which features the typical dumb romantic subplot (with Ricky Bobby finding the girl who truly loves him - as opposed to his more attractive and less caring ex-wife). Oh, and let's not forget that every good slapstick comedy needs an unmotivated villain bent on the destruction of our hero. If you thought the baddie in ""Billy Madison"" was unmotivated, wait until you see this! He hates Ricky Bobby for no apparent reason and disappears for most of the film, only to reappear at the end to give Ricky Bobby a hard time again.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment here is Will Ferrell. An insanely funny co-star, he has consistently proved with his leading-man roles that he is better suited towards smaller roles. His performances in movies like ""Wedding Crashers,"" ""Old School,"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"" were perfect Â– whereas ""Bewitched"" had most people running for the exit signs.<br/><br/>Judging by its box office intake over the first weekend, ""Ricky Bobby"" has hit it big and I am already seeing phrases such as ""Shake n' bake!"" being posted on the Internet (""That just happened!"" is also emerging as a future 'net slogan), but essentially this is just for NASCAR what ""Anchorman"" was for the daily news Â– and the formula is already growing incredibly stale."

","Under normal circumstances I'd take the time to give a detailed review. However this movie has already stolen too much of my valuable time. I will say that one of the strangest things is the gratuitous use of vulgar language and homosexual humor/situations, yet they do not show any of the women exposing their breasts. You call tell they are flashing yet this unrated movie does not show them. So they must think the other aforementioned garbage is more appropriate than seeing women's breasts, which is another incitement of this piece of trash. All you need to do is read some of the other reviews with 1 and 2 stars and you will know how I feel about this pathetic waste of time."

","Sophomoric humor from time to time is good for anyone, but this film is so lame that you will have to question yourself as to why you actually sat through the whole thing (unless you fell asleep).<br/><br/>Yes there are a few mildly funny lines, but there is no plot and no point. I understand that Nascar is one of the most popular spectator ""sports"" in this country, but the race shots are uninspiring and every scene is predictable. Will Ferrel must shake his head and wonder how he can make so much money ""performing"" in such a mindless movie, and I have lost all respect for ""Ali G."" and his brilliant spoofs.<br/><br/>The success of this movie proves once again that no one has ever lost money underestimating the American intellect!"
"fictionalkate","1","4","11","13 August 2006"," Waste of time
","Understanding that this movie was produced to be outrageous and ridiculous, it is a dramatic disappointment! I went into this film expecting stupid comedy, which would have been rewarding given the previews. Instead, it is littered with diluted humor, disconnected dialogue and a painfully weak and tragic plot. From this film forward, if Will Farrell has accepted a part, I plan to proceed with caution and NOT pay premium money to see it. Please be warned, the best scenes are in the previews and you can watch those for free. IF this project was intended to offend, it messed that up too. I would much rather sit through 108 minutes of commercials than see Talladega Nights *EVER* again. I am warning all of my friends of how seriously awful this movie is. I can't remember being this disappointed over a movie ... oh yes. There was ""Anchor Man"". Talladega is worse."
"dredgman","4","4","11","5 August 2006"," Not even Gary Cole could save this movie
","I have mixed feelings about Will Ferrel, I have for awhile. In some of his performances I find him to be extremely annoying and really not all that funny. However, I do appreciate some roles he's done and I acknowledge that fact that he is usually a funny man. In Talladega Nights, Ferrel acted his role just fine. I didn't like the character, though; I found myself rooting against him in the last race. Ricky Bobby is an annoying, self-centered, egotistical, shell of a man who makes a horrible father, and a horrible movie. In the entire span of this movie, I let out nothing more than a few chuckles. There's not much humor in Talladega Nights, which leaves the movie to rely on drama. Since I genuinely did not care for any of the characters, this movie failed miserably."

"MartinHafer","9","2","4","3 November 2007"," I feel almost ashamed to admit I liked it...and it gets better with repeated viewing!
","Generally, when a ""hot"" young comedian is embraced by Hollywood and the American public, I am loathe to see their films. Call me a snob, but I think most comedies in this mold are amazingly dumb and unwatchable--especially when they are done by ""Saturday Night Live"" alumnus (who have a history of wretched films). However, even with these ""flavor of the moments"" (and I assumed Will Farrell was), occasionally they make a movie that is still well worth seeing. Take, for examples, WATERBOY as well as TELLADEGA NIGHTS--both films made by popular SNL comedians who the American public adore--and both of which made some amazingly dumb and pointless films (LITTLE NICKY quickly comes to mind).<br/><br/>So why did I like TALLADEGA NIGHTS? Well, because the film never took itself very seriously and again and again the film deliberately chose to avoid the standard clichÃ©s and formula. For once, the film did not insult its viewers by taking a by-the-numbers approach to the material. So many times, I was wrong guessing where the picture went and moments that seemed like they were about to be saccharine and contrived deliberately twisted the tables and went for dark and satisfying humor (such as when Ricky's dad shows up to get the tickets for the race).<br/><br/>Did I love the movie? Certainly not. At times, the acting and characterizations were just too broad (such as the ""I'm on fire"" scene) and there were quite a few flat moments in the film (mostly in the middle). Comedy-wise, this is not THE PRODUCERS or CITY LIGHTS, but it is pleasant and good for a few laughs.<br/><br/>Having lived in Charlotte, NC several years ago, I REALLY enjoyed seeing the gentle way the film spoofed the fans and racers. To many non-NASCAR enthusiasts or those who live nowhere near the Southern states dominated by the sport, this all might fall a bit flat. But my having lived 10 minutes away from Lowes Motor Speedway and having to put up with all the hoopla (which is bad, since I hate auto racing), it was a delight to see this film. <br/><br/>By the way, you may or may not be offended by the characterization of Ricky Bobby's arch-rival. If you are French, I can probably safely assume you won't find it very funny--though it also strongly pokes fun of Redneck America as well. Also, if you are gay and are very sensitive to this in films, you may also be offended. However, in this age of political correctness and hyper-sensitivity, it's a bit refreshing to see a film that could care less about these sensibilities. Grow thicker skin and just let yourself laugh. This American with French heritage sure could."
"treeskier802","4","2","4","1 July 2007"," Not Worth Your Time
","I am a fan of all the actors in this film. Will Ferrell is absolutely hilarious as is Sacha Baron Cohen. I also like John C. Reilly and Gary Cole. I just wonder what the heck they were all thinking when they decided to do this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, I am not a NASCAR Fan, so maybe I would have appreciated this movie more if I were. I also don't find much humor in white trash or rednecks. These people are so uninteresting that making fun of them is not funny at all. It is difficult to enjoy a movie when you don't care about any of the characters in it or cannot connect with them on any level.<br/><br/>This movie has SOME funny moments. But, for the most part, it is dull and weird.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a good comedy, rent practically anything else Ferrell is in. Most great actors/comedians usually have a bomb movie (or two) to their credit, and this is Ferrell's. I give this movie 4 of 10 stars because of the funny moments that were in it. But, with that said, I wouldn't advise anyone to waste their time with this film. Rating 4 of 10 stars."
"lambiepie-2","5","2","4","24 June 2007"," Disappointing
","This is a film that could have been a laugh riot - and made quite the nice poke of fun for NASCAR and that circuit in general.<br/><br/>But this falls WAY flat - it leaves ""funny parody"" and becomes a series of half baked one liners looking for a movie.<br/><br/>The theme is interesting enough - Ricky Bobby was born in the back seat of a fast car which means he was practically born to race. HIs daddy leaves, his momma raises him, he has always wanted to ""go fast"". He has a BFFL (Best friend for life) who supports Ricky and they're in a pit crew. But RIcky gets a chance to compete when the lazy driver he's pitting for goes out to eat a chicken and doesn't care about finishing the race - and Ricky Bobby shows everyone what he can do. Eventually his BFFL gets to drive too - they create the ""shake and Bake"" and ""slingshot"" that puts Ricky Bobby on top. He gets all that comes with his new fame, a lazy well kept wife and sponsorships. Until a racer comes from France and takes over the winning pole from Ricky Bobby, and his BFFL takes over everything else from Ricky Bobby. This could have been a nice hokey little film but instead, it just goes down, down, down. Silly routines, a neurotic escapade that doesn't make sense, cameos that have no reason to be there in the first place, and the gay references that aren't really funny...flat, flat..FLAT.<br/><br/>All of this flatness could be because all those involved didn't know enough about NASCAR to properly spoof it. Or maybe there's stuff on the editing room floor that is funnier than the stuff that made it on the film. But to be honest, there ARE elements in this film you want the jokes to pay off for...and all I can say is that they just don't.<br/><br/>In other words....I am STILL waiting for a good, funny NASCAR spoof."

However, in retrospect, I think my high expectations for this movie left me slightly disappointed in the end.<br/><br/>The next Anchorman this movie is not. Even though this movie is full of its own laughs, it just never quite achieved the same comedic status as its predecessor. But enough comparisons. In its own right, Talladega Nights is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy that's certainly one of Farrell's better roles. Just don't go in expecting too much, or you might walk away feeling cheated."

","This is another movie that was marketed as family fare and turned out to be laced with unsavory and objectionable material. I am sure most Nascar fans don't' want to take their families to a comedy about nascar racing and see homosexual marriage and men kissing throughout the film. It was disappointing and disgusting, but sadly, not surprising. It seems that the liberal elite in Hollywood can't make a movie that entertains average middle class Americans without trying to shove their gay rights agenda down the audience's throat. <br/><br/>And the fact that none of the marketing alluded to any of the homosexual characters or themes in the film paints it as a sneak attack. Another ambush in the culture wars disguised as family friendly entertainment."

","I am a fan of Will Ferrell... when he's funny. Lately, it seems that he makes movies that are silly but not funny. I appreciate good improv, but this and Anchorman strike me as so totally improvised that there ceases to be any semblance of a plot. I don't need much of a plot, but I need SOMETHING to get me into the movie. This didn't have it. This is not to say that there were not funny bits. But there were so many more bits where I just had to wonder, ""What were they thinking?"" And that's just it. They weren't. This movie plays like it was created by stoned 14 year olds. Which is I'm sure the target audience, so maybe that works. But it missed the mark for me, my girlfriend, and the rest of the audience at the theater. I didn't care for Anchorman that much, but it was funnier than this movie. Wait for it to come out on DVD, which I'm sure it will by October, knowing how the movie industry works these days."

","Seriously, some of the jokes in the trailers do not appear in the film. I still enjoyed it but the early hype had this as more than it turned out to be. Ferrell is his funny self, but much of the film is a long SNL skit. A bit of the warmth and the over the top silliness that Ferrell fans watch him for, and a total waste of John C. Reilly's talents. It probably would have been funnier if they had left the French race car driver as a total villainous stereotype rather than showing bits of good character and reasonableness. An good video rental when the time comes, but there are better comedies to see in the theatre right now."
"samseescinema","5","2","4","7 August 2006"," Talladega Nights just isn't funny enough
","Talladega Nights reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>rating: 2 out of 4<br/><br/>Talladega Nights is for all intensive purposes the sequel to Anchorman. Obviously, the two films don't share similarities in the story department, but each hand Will Ferrell a blank check to do absolutely whatever he chooses to do. They might as well each be called The Will Ferrell Movies Part I and II. There's nothing wrong with this formula as Mr. Ferrell has time and again proved his charm and comic worth. I don't mind if he parades about my theatre screen for ninety minutes because whatever he says, let's admit it, will make us laugh. No, for all the Ferrell exploitation, he's not the film's fault. Plainly and without any critical pretension, Talladega Nights just isn't funny enough. The script gets lost on its way to funny and tries too many back-alleys and shortcuts to get there. It ends up stone dead on the road, engine failed and silent, with only a handful of misused miles under its belt.<br/><br/>As Anchorman spoofed the news media corporations and told the story of its outrageous, unexplainable title character, Talladega Nights tries to do the same for the world of NASCAR and another title character, Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell). Ever since he was birthed in the back of a hotrod at ninety-five miles per hour, Ricky Bobby has wanted to go fast. It's an ambition that carries him to adulthood as he works the pit stop crew for a slacking NASCAR racer. When the racer walks away from the track halfway through the Talladega Competition, Ricky is called upon as replacement. Summoning the courage from a well of deep ambition and frighteningly shallow intelligence he takes the car to the finish line in an amazing show of speed and natural racing talent. Soon he's the face of the Talladega Speedway and racing alongside his best friend, Cal Noughton Jr. (John C. Reilly), under the support of a volley of sponsors. It all comes crumbling down, however, when Formula 1 racer, Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), ends his winning streak and puts Bobby in the hospital after a horrific crash. With his wife gone and his fortune squandered, Bobby must climb back to greatness from the lowly life of a bicycle-riding pizza delivery boy.<br/><br/>Anchorman succeeded in that its spoofs were focused mostly on the Ron Burgundy character. His portrait drew enough satire from the news agency corporations that it didn't need to throw in any extra jabs. Talladega Nights isn't as satisfied with the humor extracted from Ricky Bobby, and tries generating laughs from every southern stereotype racing culture has to offer. The stereotypes, although abundant, don't always mesh to form consistencies. The film wanders off into derogatory homophobia, then to white trash child-rearing, and back around again to the general consensus that southerners are plainly dumb. All of it's given and taken with good humor and no semblance of offense, but often the generalized jokes fall heavily flat and without a shake of laughter from the audience. The flailing humor also often latches onto characters and prevents us from finally connecting with them when sentimentality is offered and sympathy wanted. So when Ricky Bobby goes fast again and wins his life back, it's nothing more than a technicality that draws out the conclusion.<br/><br/>But discussing the mechanics of the comedy genre doesn't quite explain the failure of Talladega Nights. The film simply isn't funny enough. When we should be convulsing with laughter, we're checking our watches. Will Ferrell can jump and scream and run around all he likes (and he does), but the screenplay just doesn't make the cut. I wanted to be red in the face and sore in the abdomen when I left the theatre, but instead I was checking the date on the bathroom's calendar, hoping that the upcoming Borat will fill in the gap Ricky Bobby has left.<br/><br/>Copyright Â©2006 Sam Osborn.

","Southern rednecks, dangerous crashes, crazy lifestyle and all about being first at the end of the finish line. Talladega Nights shows every stereotype of the Nascar experience that will deliver funny joke after funny joke that will make it hard for you to catch your breath. Buckle up because you will fall out of your seat laughing with this fast and exciting film that takes you into the life story of Ricky Bobby.<br/><br/>The film starts with Reese Bobby (Gary Cole) rushing his in labor wife to the hospital in a very beautiful and fast 1970 Ford Mustang, but just as if destiny was writing the script is born in the back of a sports car. A cheesy yet only true way to Segway us into the story and life of Ricky Bobby the race car driving machine. Ricky's journey of makinging to to the top of the NASCAR world. We then meet our antagonist of the film, hair slicked back, Jazz music and libral French ( opposite to our main characters in almost every way) race car driver that has come to overthrow the reign of Ricky Bobby. Then taking a ride on the ups and downs through Ricky Bobby's journey to get "" his balls back"" on the racing track. A real typical and maybe a little too predictable underdog story where the bad guy looks to be invincible, but our hero finds a way to overcome the odds. In the most crazy and fun to watch way as most Will Ferrell fans will come to expect.<br/><br/>Will Farrell a well respected comedian actor throughout the movie industry from his previous films Anchorman and Wedding crashers not to mention his live sketches on SNL. A fake southern redneck accent brings the film to life and draws the viewer into the narcissistic world of Ricky Bobby. Playing every stereotype in the book about a nascar driver. One scene with Ricky saying grace at a family meal where he begins to pray "" Baby Jesus"" to help him win more races, along with encouraging his sons Walker and Texas Ranger on being selfish brats with the goal of raising winners shows his belief in his self centered character. His co-star John c. Reilly (Cal Naughton Jr.) is Ricky's childhood best friend and becomes his side kick teammate on the racing track. A perfect Robin to our Batman, who's acting helps bring an actual theme to the film. So it's not just a pointless comedy sketch, yet shows a theme of friendship and the people you love are more important rather than just winning. And of course, what would a very typical southern American beer drinking film be without our foren not bad guy threatening the great red, white and blue. Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) plays the role very well with a French accent and very confident bad guy. As well gives the viewer someone to cheer agents but gives the film something to lead up to and keep us on the edge of the seats.<br/><br/>The director of this film Adam McKay is brilliant in making hilarious movies for all viewers to enjoy. From his past achievements and experiences in Saturday Night Live and Anchorman. He has lots of experience with comedians and actors for films like this one. Just as one of the great coaches of the Los Angeles Lakers, Phil Jackson knew when to give his star players the freedom to create their own magic, McKay let his stars actors Will and John unleash their inner-Kobe's. Much of the film is improvised. Although this is a high risk high reward stodgy, it helps bring authenticness to the movie.<br/><br/>Going into a film with the expectation to laugh your head off and enjoy what ultimately is comedian art. Acting by two of the best in the business and a world class director bread and butter is these types of films. Talladega Nights is a great film with humor, action, friendship and a whole lot of "" Shake N Bake ""."

","When Will Ferrell is in a good comedy he can be hilarious. But when the material isn't up to the mark things can get uncomfortable. Talladega Nights isn't either so good or bad to find itself in either camp, but somewhere in between. It's a breezy film with some funny moments but the film will not stay with you. There are occasional moments of inspired comedy in Talladega Nights, but the film as a whole doesn't work. We're left ho-humming our way through one obligatory scene after another and wincing through a sting of failed gags until the next bit comes along that tickles our funny bone. There's plenty of humor in the movie, but a dearth of good humor. Ferrell and McKay hope that, between laughs, viewers will start to care about the characters."

To its credit, it functions pretty well as a NASCAR parody, and does infuse the drive-in-a-circle sport with energy.<br/><br/>That said, Gary Cole easily walks away with this movie - which that guy has a knack for doing, but it's still fun to watch.

","I usually have a problem with an unlikable central character, but I just can't resist Ricky Bobby's ridiculously funny character! He is very fun to watch run around, especially when on fake fire. Now, when watching this film don't except any breathtaking stories. Because this story is a very bumpy ride. The first 20 minutes is all obvious exposition and some plot points are honesty too stupid for my taste. The ""Shake and Bake"" joke got old quickly and the ending is a little messy. (keeping this spoiler-free) They wanted to wrap everything up in a nice little bow but it just doesn't work in my opinion. Mistakes should have consequences and I despise when someone doesn't get what he deserved for his choices. However, the story does have some surprising strong points. Watching Ricky Bobby lose his racing touch was done very well and was interesting to watch. That surprised me. And despite my previously mentioned problems this is an extremely funny film. I haven't this hard in a film in a long time! Sasha Baron Cohen provides some awesomely ridiculous laughs as well. This isn't the ballad expected based off of the title, but this is fun ride with laughs all the way to the finish line."

","Will Ferrell and his growing rep company provide some of their biggest laughs ever in TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE LEGEND OF RICKY BOBBY, another of Ferrell's sports-oriented comedies that takes a popular American sport and turns it on its ears.<br/><br/>Ferrell plays the title character, an arrogant and dim-witted stock car driver, whose winning philosophy was based on something his father said to him as a child, whose life is altered forever when he has a serious accident and after a lengthy rehab, tries to resume his life and learns that his best friend has moved in with his wife and kids, taken over his career, and has to depend on his long lost father to take his life back. Ferrell and Adam McKay have concocted one of the smartest and funniest screenplays in comedy history which takes effective pot shots at the stock car driving industry as well as the advertising industry as well. McKay's energized direction is also a big plus, but its Ferrell and his winning cast that really make this one shine.<br/><br/>Ferrell is hysterical, as always, and gets solid comic support from the always reliable John C. Reilly as Cal Naughton, Ricky's best friend who finally takes advantage of his chance to move out of Ricky's shadow, Leslie Bibb as Ricky's gold-digging wife, David Keocher and Michael Clarke Duncan as members of Ricky's pit crew, Jane Lynch as Ricky's mom, and in a performance that comes as close as I have seen anyone to steal a movie from Will Ferrell, Gary Cole as Ricky's derelict Dad, whose training sessions to get Ricky back on the track are hysterical. Sasha Baron Cohen provides some giggles as well in a sexually androgynous variation of his BORAT character.<br/><br/>The film provides solid laughs from beginning to end, especially for Ferrell fans.

","Like Tarantino movies, Will Ferrell movies people either love or hate. It is a specific type of comedy that you either like or do not. I personally am a big fan of Ferrell and his works. In this movie he plays a nascar driver who is obsessed with winning. He a lot of screen time with John C. Reilly who plays his best friend. With every victory his ego rises and his skills are tested when he is beaten by a french F1 racer who is played by none other than Sascha Baron Cohen. The comedy in this movie is pure Will Ferrell. There are many scenes you will laugh out loud but of course only if you liked his previous works. I have watched this movie with different people and the ones who liked Ferrell laughed others did not. But even if we discount the humor the movie still has some depth to it. There is an actually character development on Ricky Bobby's side which I found surprisingly well done. The acting is top notch in generally, the star being of course Will Ferrell. Reilly and Sascha Baron Cohen also deliver an excellent performance, especially the latter whose character is very funny. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie to all Will Ferrell Fans!<br/><br/>9/10"

","Talladega Nights is a typical Will Ferrell movie. It features him, and his usual antics, but with a more straight face attitude appropriate to Nascar.

That being said, I'll have to contradict myself and talk about the French guy. The ""pÃ©pÃ© le pew"" stereotype is over the top, even for this movie. The actor, maybe at the demand of the director, really went overboard with the accent, without even bringing in anything new. At least, when they mocked American bravado in the crepe scene, they didn't make Will more brave, they fed him counter points by having all the other characters defecting, even himself and his best friends who still told him not to concede the point.<br/><br/>Alright, that was too long.<br/><br/>The movie is an excellent laugh, and the twist really funny, especially the instant take over of the family, the cougar, and the taming of the young ones.<br/><br/>If you love Nascar or Will Ferrell or want to see a wacky movie, it's for you."

","""If You Ain't First, You're Last.""<br/><br/>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is one of the best Will Ferrell comedies ever. While I wouldn't allow small children to watch the movie the entertaining plot, all-star cast, and hilarious lines blend together to make this movie great for the older ages. The movie also serves a higher purpose- the writers use the movie to show the uninformed audience just how competitive the world of competitive racing can be. The movie follows the overnight sensation NASCAR driver Ricky Bobby, in his journey through the world of competitive racing. Ricky Bobby is never alone in his racing career; he has his wife Carley, sons Walker and Texas Ranger, and childhood friend Cal Naughton Jr., played by John C. Reilly. Cal Naughton is not only his old friend, but is also Ricky Bobby's ""Shake"" and ""Bake"" driving teammate who always comes in second to Ricky Bobby's first. As a driver, Ricky Bobby comes across many challenges. The biggest, however, is his French competitor Jean Girard, who wants nothing more to defeat the famous Ricky Bobby. The two must fight to earn to title as NASCAR's top driver<br/><br/>I remember the first time that I watched this movie I was mesmerized by the quality of acting and found myself quoting the lines for days. As in all of his movies, Will Ferrell has a natural charisma that makes Ricky Bobby come alive. Not many actors can make a family grace last for three minutes and still keep the audience watching. Another important part of why Will Ferrell can perform so well in this movie is because of his supporting actors, such as John C. Reilly. The two also star in Step Brothers together because they have so much on screen chemistry. In Talladega Nights, Ferrell and Reilly share scenes that highlight both of their personalities. One of the most memorable is at the race track during a fight between Jean Girard and Ricky Bobby when Reilly stays back and just consistently adds the team's motto ""Shake and bake"" to the argument in the attempt to intimidate Girard. This scene clearly portrays Cal Naughton Jr., Reilly, as Ricky Bobby's sidekick who is there simply to add humor while backing up his friend. <br/><br/>Comedy is used throughout the film to not only entertain the audience, but also to show the audience how the NASCAR community works. The writers created a comedic relationship between Ricky Bobby and Jean Girard as competitors. While many drivers probably aren't forced to say ""I love crepes"" in a bar by their competitors, there is still an extreme amount of tension between them. The writers succeeded in conveying to the audience how competitive the racers are through scenes with Bobby and Girard. Another way comedy is used in the movie is through the quote ""If you ain't first, you're last."" This quote appears countless times in the movie by Ricky Bobby and his family. When Bobby says this quote, he is representing the drivers who believe this, but are too scared to come out and say it like he does. Many drivers have this same win at all costs attitude and want first place no matter what. These comedic references to the real world of NASCAR show the audience how competitive the drivers can become. <br/><br/>This movie definitely comes in first. Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby has an interesting plot that goes where no movie has gone before. The writers also cleverly use comedy to convey to the audience how competitive the drivers can get in NASCAR. All of these qualities blend together to make a movie that anyone can enjoy."

","ANCHORMAN director Adam McKay and Will Ferrell must have had a blast making this zany farce about a NASCAR champion driver who experiences the high times along with the low times on the racing circuit. Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) is born in the backseat of the sports car owned by his father Reese Bobby (Gary Cole of OFFICE SPACE) late one evening on the way to the delivery room. You see Reese is a speed demon who can never spend an length of time in a single spot without incurring the wrath of those around him. Nevertheless, Reese instills the quality of speed in his son throughout his public school education. Meantime, Ricky makes fast friends with his classmate Cal Naughton Jr. (John C. Reilly of STEPBROTHERS) in school. Initially, they constitute part of the pit crew for a NASCAR driver who has no desire to win. During one race, the driver walks off to eat lunch and Ricky decides to take over for him. Later, when Cal joins him on the racetrack, they become a NASCAR sensation because Cal willingly helps Ricky win just about every race. They call their strategy shake and bake. Ricky is married to a red hot momma, Carley (Leslie Bibb of LAW ABIDING CITIZEN) and they have two bratty outspoken little boys. Nothing serious happens in this slam-bang comedy with Ferrell having a field day with his moronic protagonist. Half-way through the action, Ricky meets a guy who is more than his match. Gallic gear-jammer Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen of BRUNO) comes to America strictly to beat Ricky on his own turf. Whereas Ricky embraces all the characteristics of an Anglo-Saxon, white male with two kids and a bubble-headed wife, Jean is gay with a husband. Things take an unexpected turn for our hero when he crashes his ride during a race and emerges unscathed physically but devastated mentally. The same way that an alcoholic suffers from the D.T.s is the way that Ricky reacts to being torched. He cannot climb back behind the wheel and ends up delivering pizzas until the authorities take his driving license away from him. Not only does Cal take over his job as the leader racer but his old friend also takes possession of his wife. Eventually, Reese returns and puts Ricky through a boot camp to help his son recover his courage. One of the funniest gags occurs when Reese forces Ricky to drive his car with a female cougar named Karen in the vehicle. As long as Ricky acts calmly, Reese assures him that the cat will not maul him. There are lots of hilarious jokes and then there are some jokes that don't work. Happily, most of the good jokes are really funny. Amy Adams has a good role. The finale between Jean Girand and Ricky is pretty funny, too. Religious types may object to the prayer that is said during a big meal."

I love actress, Jane Lynch, who I think is too young to play Ricky Bobby's mother but I'll take her anytime. She's brilliantly funny. Gary Cole is perfectly cast as his estranged father. Sacha Baron Cohen plays the openly gay French race car driver with an American husband. He is a stark funny contrast to Ricky Bobby's character.

"Electrified_Voltage","7","0","0","15 November 2008"," Rather inconsistent, but a mostly fun, silly romp
","This 2006 comedy starring Will Ferrell has the same kind of title as another film starring the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian, 2004's ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"". Both were co-written by Ferrell and Adam McKay. As popular as the first effort of the two is, I've never cared for it. It appears ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is not as popular, but I definitely like it better. Before seeing it, I knew Sacha Baron Cohen was also featured in the cast, so there were two comedians in the film who had made me laugh several times before, and although the film didn't look so promising at times, it still satisfied.<br/><br/>Ricky Bobby is the son of an enthusiastic race driver named Reese Bobby. During his childhood, he is raised by this mother, Lucy, and doesn't usually see his father, but one time when he does, he is told that if you don't come in first place, you come in last place! Now a man, Ricky works on the pit crew of what is currently the worst NASCAR team, but when he gets to drive in a race, he willingly takes the chance. Although he hasn't seen his father in a long time, he still remembers what he told him. He takes that advice and quickly becomes NASCAR's top racer! His best friend, Cal Naughton Jr., doesn't seem to have a problem always coming in second (or does he?), and at one race, Ricky meets a woman named Carley and soon marries her. Life is going swell for Ricky, until he meets a French racer named Jean Girard, who brings him out of the top spot! <br/><br/>At the beginning, I found Reese Bobby racing in a car with his pregnant wife in the back seat and going right past the hospital pretty amusing, and in the next scene, with Ricky as a kid, and his father coming it to talk to his class, is also good for laughs. After that, much of the early part of the film seemed a bit bland, not quite funny enough to fully satisfy me, but fortunately, it doesn't stay like that. A number of gags are highlights, such as an argument at the table over Ricky referring to Jesus as ""Baby Jesus"" in his grace, Ricky's delayed reaction to a knife he sticks in his leg, and Reese making his son escape from the police! Ricky's two hyperactive sons may not always be funny with their antics, but often are, and can provide more comic highlights. When Sacha Baron Cohen first appears as Jean Girard, the film seems to get better than it has been for a while, as he once again shows his comedic talent! One of the memorable gags involving his character is when he holds Ricky down, threatening to break his arm if he doesn't say what he tells him to say, but promises to let him go if he says it, and Ricky is very stubborn.<br/><br/>It's popular for modern comedies to be silly, crude, and immature, and you can be sure ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is one of those, but it's one of the stronger efforts in this category. Some of them are better, but some of them fail miserably at trying to be funny (if they even try to be funny at all), and fortunately, that does not include this particular comedy. If you can't stand Will Ferrell and his usual antics, there would probably be no exception here, but for those who find him funny (or sometimes funny), and you like silliness, you could find yourself laughing a lot while watching ""Talladega Nights"". If you like Sacha Baron Cohen, that may be a bonus. Some obviously despise this 2006 race car comedy, but in my opinion (and I'm certainly not alone), it's quite funny overall. At any rate, it's much better than several other juvenile comedies I've seen!"

","Having collaborated on ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"", director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell teamed up again for the goofy but harmless ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"". This one casts Ferrell as the NASCAR-driving titular character. Pretty much the whole movie makes fun of the stereotypes associated with that world. This subculture of rednecks with diets consisting of fast food...they really get into NASCAR! Something like 200,000 people show up for a game. And of course, in the eyes of the red-state crowd, what could be worse than a gay Frenchman (Sacha Baron Cohen, aka Borat) participating in the sport? All in all, a pretty fun romp. Given the common portrayals of rednecks in popular media, I get the feeling that they always have a good time with everything. Worth seeing.<br/><br/>Also starring John C. Reilly, Michael Clarke Duncan (John Coffey in ""The Green Mile""), Leslie Bibb, Amy Adams, Gary Cole, Jane Lynch, David Koechner, Pat Hingle, Andy Richter, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Rob Riggle (of ""The Daily Show"")."

","I had great expectations with this film; the return of the Adam McKay/Will Ferrell duo after the very good, funny and successful ""Anchorman"". Like Ron Burgundy, Ricky Bobby is a NASCAR driver, a unique character, one of those that only someone like Ferrell can bring alive. It's almost like it doesn't matter what the character does in the film, as long as he entertains an audience that expects a lot.<br/><br/>As I said, I expected a lot. I expected to be entertained, to laugh and to discover what new range of characters McKay could bring to the table. Alongside the unstoppable Ricky Bobby is his best friend and teammate Cal Naughton Jr. (the underrated John C. Reilly), his gold-digger wife Carley (the beautiful Leslie Bibb), a scene-stealing performance by Gary Cole as Ricky's father, and Sascha Baron Cohen as a French driver called Jean Girard that instantly becomes Ricky Bobby's rival.<br/><br/>Everything you've just read, from the names to the story and whatever else you may think OK, is borderline ridiculous, as it was in ""Anchorman"". I'm glad both Ferrell and McKay (who wrote the script together) were able to honor this kind of humorous tradition, where laughter is the only disease and also the only possible medicine.<br/><br/>There's no point in judging a film like ""Talladega Nights"" for its performances, however intelligent and accurate they are; or for how well shot the race sequences are, as the cars try to get the number one spot; or for how conventional may the storyline be. This film is a statement that reassures what we could perfectly sense in McKay's previous effort: making cinema is fun.<br/><br/>Should I say end of the story? Maybe, and I don't want to sound simplistic but it's obvious that something's being done here and that if you want to feel it, you'll find the movie is alright. So when you watch ""Talladega Nights"" (if you decide to watch it), take into account the whole concept and not every part. Even when there are some scenes and a few jokes that work more than others (which also happened in ""Anchorman""), but this is the typical piece where the whole triumphs over the separation.<br/><br/>For me, it worked; even though ""Anchorman"" worked better. This is the kind of parody, like ""Zoolander"" and ""Dodgeball"" that, whether good or bad, stays with you."
"sc8031","3","0","0","28 June 2008"," Get out of my brain, Will Ferrel!
","I have a hard time watching modern Hollywood comedies because they have no idea how to establish characters. Most modern Hollywood comedies and Will Ferrel movies feature ridiculous, unrealistic and unlikable characters. ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" was a bit more successful because the main characters were either likable or believable, even if the movie was paced poorly. But Ricky Bobby is forgettable, unlikable and full of drawn-out (improvised?) scenes which are often stupid and a chore to sit through.<br/><br/>I don't think the movie's material is necessarily awful or the people involved are unfunny. It just isn't good enough for a feature-length movie. With a film made of this material, stretching it so thin over 90 minutes, there is nothing to hide the wheels of the corporate machine pushing it through the factory press.<br/><br/>On the surface, the film appears to be making fun of NASCAR, but it also seems to be a tribute to that unbelievably popular past-time. There are no real jokes at the expense of NASCAR fans. And the success of the movie is probably because it is aimed at the NASCAR demographic. Most of the jokes are dirty and there are a lot of jokes about the implied homosexuality of the film's arch-rival, a French race-car driver played by Sacha Baron Cohen. Sacha Baron Cohen is (to me) a lot more fun than usual here, perhaps because his schtick only lasts for a few scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>Will Ferrel is a pretty successful actor, to be sure. The number of cameos and leads he's done over the last decade is enormous. It surprises me, because while he's a funny and goofy guy, his range and depth and physical ability are not particularly deep. Yet he's much more interesting doing other roles. And with so much money, I don't know why he keeps doing movies like this. The more he makes like this, the more forgettable he makes himself."

","This may be a stupid movie, but it's not made by stupid people - its subject is stupidity, aka machismo. Which is nothing new for Will Ferrell - the question is, does it hit the bulls-eye? And the answer is: not really. There's plenty to laugh at, but two weeks later there ought to be more stuck in my memory than the Highlander reference and the 'profiling' jukebox. Well, admittedly the celebration of irresponsibility in the Domino's dinner table scene was agreeably edgy (I like the badass kids), and Ferrell's dad remains completely unredeemed and unredeemable to the end, which is a relief. But that Halliburton cameo leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and I could really live without the Smokey and the Bandit-style end credit bloopers, thematic relevance and all."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","0","0","14 April 2008"," Movie suffers from its weak middle part.
","I like a good dumb simple comedy from time to time but I don't really see this as a good and fun enough movie to watch over and over again.<br/><br/>First of all I really like Will Ferrell as a comedian actor. Unfortunately his movies are often of questionable quality and the reason these type of movies still remain watchable is thanks to the very presence of Will Ferrell and often lots of other fine comedy actors, such as also is the case with this movie.<br/><br/>This is just not the greatest made comedy. Of course the movie its story is rather weak and simple but the movie makes the mistake that in its middle part mainly focuses on the more personal and emotional aspect of the character Ricky Bobby. almost as if it starts to take itself too serious, even though the movie keeps its silly comedy style all over it all of the time. If you cut the first part of the movie and you glue it back together with the last part of the movie you'll have one movie and if you cut out the middle part of the movie and release it on its own you'll have a whole other movie. Some characters suddenly disappear in the middle and then suddenly pop up again for the last part of the movie. This is the case with the Sacha Baron Cohen character, who is the main 'villain' and Michael Clarke Duncan.<br/><br/>It remains a technically well made movie though. Also the races themselves are good looking and well captured on camera and brought to the screen. I like this new sort of comedies that are being made this decade. It often are movies with both hits and misses but throughly know to remain perfectly fun and watchable, mostly because of their overall silliness.<br/><br/>Of course ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is also a silly movie. I mean, just look at the title. It's mostly a movie that will amuse you but not really one that will make you laugh out loud all the time. Also the story and mostly the storytelling prevent this movie from being a true successful comedy.<br/><br/>Thank goodness for the cast, that makes up so much and are the main reason why this movie remains so very amusing to watch. Will Ferrell is good as always, as you would expect and really in his element again, this time as a NASCAR driver. He forms he good comical duo within this movie with John C. Reilly, who had his share of serious roles but seems to feel most at ease within comedies these days. The movie also has some truly great supporting actors such as Gary Cole, Michael Clarke Duncan and Amy Adams among others. Sacha Baron Cohen shows up as the movie its main villain, a French Formula 1 driver who has turned over to NASCAR and becomes Ricky Bobby greatest new sport competitor. Baron Cohen with this movie, perhaps for the very first time, shows that he can really act and he is a great comical talent and he is not just good for playing his characters Ali G, BrÃ¼no, and Borat. No wonder that he is a much wanted actor these days and not just only for comedy roles.<br/><br/>Yes it's a watchable amusing movie for on a rainy afternoon when you have nothing else to do. But it's not really a movie I would be anxious about watching again any time soon.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Ddey65","6","0","0","30 March 2008"," As clichÃ© as this sounds, it's a guilty pleasure.
","From the days of the trailer for ""Old School,"" Will Ferrell has tried to present himself within his post-Saturday Night Live career as both the new Steve Martin and John Belushi at the same time. The trouble is, he tends to fail at it. I stated in my review of ""Stranger Than Fiction"" that I liked this movie better than ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"" yet for some reason, I can't think of why. I could give you some aspect of what makes the movie so good though.<br/><br/>Ricky Bobby was born in the back seat of a souped-up 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle, racing it's way to the hospital. Throughout much of his childhood, Ricky lived with his single mother(Jane Lynch) and faced an uncontrollable urge to jump in a car and put the pedal to the metal, and sporadic visits by his father(Gary Cole), a ""semi-professional"" race car driver, and part-time dope-dealer. Wow. He was as anxious to get his driver's license as I was when I was a little kid. As an adult, Ricky ends up joining the Dennit Racing Team's NASCAR pit crew. But when the driver wastes too much time in the pit, Ricky takes over, wins the race, and immediately becomes a star, despite the objections of the younger half of the father & son(Pat Hingle & Greg Germann) team owners. Even better, a female fan(Leslie Bibb) flashes him and he marries her, and they have two kids who are spoiled rotten. Oh, but somebody new is about to join the Dennit Racing Team; a French Formula One racing champion(Sacha Baron Cohen). Worse than that, a GAY French Formula One racing champion. Even worse than that, he's GOOD! Talladega Nights doesn't make fun of the French, so much as it makes fun of how certain Americans, especially rednecks from the old south view the French. And it's competition with this Frenchman that leads to his downfall. But that's not enough for Larry Dennit, who talks Bobby's wife into marrying his best friend. I often get the feeling Carley Bobby secretly works for Dennit Racing. After returning home to his mother with his two kids, and meeting his father again, Dad tries to get him back into racing. It seems like it might work, but even that falls apart.<br/><br/>Molly Shannon is also great as Larry Dennit Jr.'s drunken, orgasmically-addicted wife. From time to time I've wondered if Ferrell had a thing for her, since they've been in so many projects together. But Amy Adams elevates this movie, just as Robin Williams has been known to elevate really bad comedies. As nerdy race-team secretary turned lover Susan, she makes two faux-inspirational speeches, the first of which sends both the main character and the movie right back on track. Her role in this movie is the least comedic, even less than pit crew head Lucius Washington(Michael Clarke Duncan), and yet you have to pinch yourself to remind yourself that this is a joke.<br/><br/>As I pointed out, the movie doesn't really bash the French. In all honesty, it doesn't bash Southerners that hard either. If they really wanted to bash them, they could make them klansmen or idiotic hillbillies oblivious to the modern world. I never even saw a single confederate flag at any of the races, which would've made the movie a little more authentic. Nevertheless, though it's hardly the comedy epic that ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,"" ""National Lampoon's Animal House,"" or ""The Blues Brothers,"" were, it's still amusing and enjoyable enough."

They were named Walker and Texas Ranger because if she wanted them to be girls she'd call them Dr. Quinn and Medicine Woman. Not an exact quote so I could clean up the language.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly make a great comedy duo. Add Sacha Cohen as the French race car rival and you have enough a fun ride, pun included.<br/><br/>One scene that went on for way too long was the bit where Farrell thought he was on fire. Also, the vulgarity that came out of the boys' mouths did come across at times as being too mean. But I have to admit, a lot of what they said was also very funny.<br/><br/>A lot has been said about all the product placement, which of course, can't be avoided with NASCAR, especially when making a spoof of it. Thus, the joke sponsors to no sponsor was right on the money.<br/><br/>Gary Cole gave a great dead pan performance. Jane Lynch, Admy Adams and Leslie Bibb as the women in the great all had their own moments in this.<br/><br/>It's easy to see how this became one of Will Ferrell's biggest hits."

","Of the recent take over of Ferrell/Apatow produced comedy ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is certainly not the most charming, but it's not completely devoid of fresh humor.<br/><br/>This time Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a redneck swept up in NASCAR fame. Bobby is not the most interesting character, but Ferrell demonstrates his diversity although the humor is mostly reminiscent of ""Anchorman"" or ""Old School."" To change things up a bit, however, Ferrell has added the talents of John C. Reilly (as Cal, Ricky's best friend) and character specialist Sacha Baren Cohen (as a French, homosexual rival driver). Even Gary Cole stars as Bobby's father. These actors bring some more interest and make for a nice change to the typical fare for these films.<br/><br/>In general, the plot is rather flat and uninteresting, with only enough comedic bits in between to keep interest. Unlike the aforementioned ""Old School"" or ""Anchorman,"" ""Talladega Nights"" doesn't seem to move forward on the legs of its comedy but instead relies on it like a crutch. Some comic scenes will have you laugh out loud, but others will have you wishing the plot was better and just move on already. The beginning is also rushed and choppy, which for a two-hour film implies that there was some indecision on the part of writers Ferrell and Adam McKay as to how to best tell the story. Overall, it seems that their talents would best be served outside the realm of race car driving - not much humor is found in the races themselves, only the culture of NASCAR and so the NASCAR scenes simply bore."

It did not bomb, but I was expecting to love every second and laugh until my head split. Well, there were some very funny scenes, and cumulatively this movie was funny. But, there were some very unfunny scenes as well, and the end was down right disgusting. I liked every character with the exception of Sacha Baron Cohen's character (Jean Girard).

","I must say Will Ferrell has been disappointing me in his latest movies. I've always seen him as a good comediant but the movies he involves himself in... *sigh* <br/><br/>Talladega nights is a perfectly average comedy. It has only a couple very funny moments. What's really good about it is the satire behind the hole movie, portraying and making fun of not only Nascar but also a wide group of Americans that fit in ""that"" stereotype. The dialogues are silly enough to be funny but the real comedy moments are scarce. It pretty much resumes to the same after a while and you keep expecting for a moment of genius that won't make you stop laughing. It's entertaining, but as a comedy I think it's just average. I do prefer to look at the 'satire/portrait of a stereotyped environment/community' side of it, giving the writers and director credit for it.<br/><br/>I think Will Ferrell can do a lot better and I really hope he finds the right movie for him to finally achieve recognition.<br/><br/>6/10"

","As a comedian, Will Ferrell has frequently shown the chops to merit him one of this generation's shining stars however his feature film career has been spotty at best. His stint behind the wheel of the NASCAR comedy ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is simply an embarrassment for all of the talent involved. It tells the story of Ricky Bobby, a guy who has yearned to follow in his father's speed demon footsteps since a very young age. When the circumstances fall into his lap to race at NASCAR he quickly becomes a legend. The comedy, as it is, plays out in the most low-brow fashion, leading any longtime film viewer to recognize this one as a modern-day example of those ""Smokey and the Bandit"" or ""Cannonball Run"" movies. Occasionally some of the bits work, especially the over-accentuated product placement and one ridiculously long prayer session, but by the time Sacha Baron Cohen (of the infamous ""Borat"") shows up to spew bad homosexual French jokes all hope is lost."

It seems as though Will Ferrell has become just another ""Adam Sandler"" in that every couple of months he makes a mindless comedy. As a result of this film Will Ferrell has gone down on my list of great comedy actors and also the whole movie to me was not really even a comedy but rather a 105 minute commercial for Wonder Bread,Perrier,Applebees,etc.<br/><br/>So for me the movie had no substance at all.

","With Will Ferrell there is no ""over the top"", because for Ferrell there is no ""top""Â—this is an acknowledgment of Farrell's unique talent and gifts. In ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" Will Farrell plays NASCAR champion Ricky Bobby whose credo is ""If you ain't first, you're last."" He and childhood bud Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reily) dominate the NASCAR circuit as ""Shake"" and ""Bake"". Two signature scenes illustrate the Will Ferrell experience. Following a traumatic crash and mental meltdown, Ricky is convinced he is paralyzed, when it is only in his ""head"". However, he screams to partner Cal (Reily) and pit manager Lucius (steady Michael Clarke Duncan), ""I am so paralyzed!"" and stabs himself in his own thigh. Also on the road to regain his driving edge, Ricky's estranged father Reese Bobby (Gary Cole) tells his son, ""You have to learn to drive with the fear...""Â—Reese makes Ricky drive with a live cougar. Both scenes had me laugh so hard, I was in tears. ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is funny and cleverly written by Ferrell and director Adam McKay. Ferrell and McKay nail the NASCAR culture in their satire, and ""Talladega Night"" is funnier than its trailer.<br/><br/>In ""Talladega Nights"" Ricky and Cal rule NASCAR finishing first and second in their races (when Bobby doesn't crash). Cal always finishes second. Ricky has all the trappings of wealth and celebrity. He's got a mansion, luxury cars, his sons-- Walker (Houston Tumlin) and Texas Ranger (Grayson Russell), his ""Red-Hot Smokin' Wife"" Carley (dead-on Leslie Bibb), and his loyal assistant Susan (funny Amy Adams). Ricky has a lot to be thankful for demonstrated in a hilarious dinner prayer scene. However, Ricky's world soon turns upside down with the arrival of French Formula One Champion Jean Girard (outrageous Sacha Baron Cohen of ""Ali G"" fame), who has come to America not for Chinese food or pizza, but to beat Ricky Bobby on the NASCAR track. The gay Jean Girard loves jazz and reads CamusÂ—an obvious rival to our hero Ricky. The stage is set for stretching the bounds of Ricky's courage and character in his hysterical triumph over adversity. Basically, Ferrell has us laughing on the floor.<br/><br/>Adam McKay has everyone play it straight in this merciless comedy. This is Will Ferrell territory. Ferrell brings an unbelievable authenticity to Ricky Bobby. Every character choice he makes is dead on, funny, and never falters into caricature. Ferrell is amazingly earnest and completely bold as ""the big hairy American Winning Machine"". Watching Ferrell running in his underpants thinking that he is on fire speaks for itself. John C. Reily is awesome as Cal, Ricky's loyal driving partner and life-long bud. Reily's Cal is truly a partner to Ricky, a good simple man seeking a measure of validation. Reily gives Cal an ease and clueless charm. Leslie Bibb is hot, and nails her role as Carley, the ""wife of a NASCAR driver"". Jane Lynch is rock solid and hilarious as Ricky's supportive mom Lucy. Amy Adams is wacky charming as the woman who inspires: ""Ricky Bobby is not a thinker. Ricky Bobby is a driver."" Sacha Baron Cohen's accent alone as Jean Girard merits a medal. In character as Girard he is completely out thereÂ—in a great way. Gary Cole is truly awesome as Ricky's dad Reese. His Reese is comically self absorbed finally surrendering to his paternal instincts, well kind of. His driving scenes with Ferrell will become classic.<br/><br/>Here is a curious aside: A number of critics point out that ""Talladega Nights"" has the most product placement shots of any movie, ever. Well, being that this is a satire of NASCAR, what is their point? Ricky Bobby should wear a ""Funny"" decal on his ""Wonder Bread"" racing jump suit. Because that is what ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is. Will Ferrell as Ricky Bobby is the American Laughing Machine. Ferrell and McKay definitely get it right. A clever funny script. Exacting classic comedic performances. All this makes ""Talladega Nights"" a winning time at the movies."

","I was privileged to see an advanced screening of the movie yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. I felt he marketing campaign did not do the movie justice as they portrayed it as a farce (which in part it was), but only showed clips of screw-ball activities. The first 15 minutes of the film was a continuous string of hilarious jokes as we see Ferrell's character grow up. As with all movies of this genre, there is a predictable plot: character has the good life, character goes through a crisis, and character prevails in the end. But the supporting actors make this film enjoyable, memorable and wanting for more. I also highly recommend keeping those butts in the seats for the credits as the bloopers reel is dynamite! Lastly, there was a preview for Ferrell's next movie - this looks like a great concept and seems genuinely funny."

It has to do with those who do not want to have to witness this in such a blatant form. PG-13 wrong it should have been rated R for raunchy. I was very disappointed. Will Ferrell is a great comedian, but this carried it too far for me. I will think long and hard before going to another Will Farrell movie. The trailer could have at least mentioned something about the gay twist in the movie. It was just awkward and directly placed for shock. I enjoy movies with surprises and twists, but this twist did not fit at all. The movie would have been just as funny without that twist. I am ashamed of the Nascar drivers who took part in this movie."

Sacha Baren Cohen who is usually superb as Ali G or Borat, puts on a ridiculous french accent that is neither believable or funny. The Nascar races are entertaining enough with good effects, but the overall plot is predictable and tedious, and the characters are annoying.

It was two minutes of laughs spread over twenty minutes of unending nonsensical babbling. The dinner scene with the kids shouting at grandpa was a perfect example of how our society views manners and yet we just laugh at it without thinking of it as a serious problem in our American values. I thought it was an example of why the world hates Americans and I have to agree. I always thought Will Ferrell was way overrated and this was the final nail in the coffin. Old School was terrible.

If you ask me, this movie contains no real comedy. I find it hard to believe that a script could have been written for this movie, because it relies wholly on Will Ferrell's (bad, distasteful) improv-style comedy, which has not once made me laugh.<br/><br/>It pools in as much stupid comedy as it can find, and everyone likes it.

","A friend let me borrow the DVD...thank goodness. As many reviews have already stated, this film meanders without much attention to a script or development of characters.<br/><br/>It is difficult to like a film in which the protagonist is so unlikable. And Ricky Bobby is one of the most detestable main characters I have seen in a comedy in a long time. I am shocked that so many ""Southerners"" have commented that they ""got the joke."" I'm not so sure they did, cuz the joke's mostly on them.<br/><br/>It becomes more difficult to digest when you find yourself rooting for the antagonist, in this case a French (and openly gay) driver from Formula One. I really really wanted Ricky Bobby to get his clock cleaned on and off the track, and I actually clapped when Gerard beat him.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the two children...ridiculous...the grandfather ""bashing"" scene was NOT funny...it was uncomfortable. That crossed a line for me.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have spoken of Talladega Nights as ""Liberal"" trash because of a pro-gay, anti-Jesus message. I disagree. The film actually works better the other way around...However, that said, it seems that everyone involved in this film was too busy trying to be stupid to have any kind of message."

","The funniest part of the movie was the opening quote from ""Eleanor Roosevelt"". That was literally the last time I laughed at anything in this movie. I found it so tedious and poorly put together, and I finally had to give up on it altogether with about 30 minutes left to go. But I have to admit that I was watching the extended ""unrated"" DVD version, so the thought occurred to me that since what I was watching was not the same version that was shown in the theaters, maybe I was not giving it a fair shot. After all, extended DVD versions always tend to show longer versions of scenes that were wisely trimmed down and put back in scenes that were taken out in order to tighten up the storyline. The person who brought over the DVD, and thought it was hilarious in the theater, had to admit that it didn't seem as funny this time. It has to be because of the DVD, but still I have a hard time imagining anyone in a movie theater laughing at anything in this movie. It was just monumentally unfunny. Every scene went on for far too long, and there were tons of scenes that didn't have any reason to be there other than to pad out the running time. There was about a half hour of plot, and yet they managed to stretch it out into a full two hours. If the theatrical version was shorter, that might have helped, but otherwise it was just painful to watch. The lesson: people who come out with ""extended, unedited and unrated director's cuts"" are doing us no favors."

Once again the trailer is better than the movie. Thanks Hollywood! Take my advice, don't waste your time. I need to make ten lines of comment but there is nothing more I can say other than this movie is horrible.

","TALLADEGA NIGHTS is both the best comedy of 2006 (yes, better than BORAT), and the best Will Ferrell flick yet. Where do I start? First, three scenes, top of head, that stand out as pure genius...the great improv between Ferrell and O'Reilly in the ""baby Jesus"" grace scene, the hilarious slapstick in the knife in leg scene, and the dead-on cultural satire of (well, the whole movie) the scene where Sasha Cohen's indelible Girard breaks Ricky Bobby's arm for not praising crepes. Beyond Cohen and O'Reilly in terrific supporting roles, Gary Cole and Jane Lynch both have some great moments/lines as Ricky Bobby's parents, all of Bobby's crew have funny scenes, and the actress who plays his wife is dead on. What else? The plot basically works, is tight, yet with lots of room to play (some of the improv becomes almost surreal, going into the territory that defined Ferrell's best work on SNL...remember the cowbell)...and it actually has a lot of energy as an action flick, the race scenes really rock. But, what I'm left is, is a rich tapestry of contemporary American excess, greed and shallowness, which serves as biting satire, even as it wallows in it. Ferrell, in my read, is doing a Bush caricature...a bit stupid, a bit charming, and quite dangerous. Yet, I like that ultimately the film has a kindness toward the people its satirizing...unlike BORAT (yeah, I don't mind ridiculing stupid, privileged Americans, but not so cool to deceive and ridicule impoverished Romanians). TALLADEGA NIGHTS...best comedy of 2006!"

Sometimes products make their way into movies in a subtle manner, but in this movie they are in almost every scene.

"royale_w_cheez44","3","2","5","3 December 2006"," Misses the Mark Completely
","""Talladega Nights: The Balad of Ricky Bobby"" is a Will Ferrell vehicle (no pun intended) in the same vein as ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy"" (as you can tell by the similar, pretentious titles). I can't really explain why ""Talladega Nights"" worked for all those I saw it with and all of my friends, and yet there was really nothing in it that worked for me. Mind you, I loved ""Anchorman"" to death, and still think that it's a hilarious movie. However, TN was the exact opposite for me. Maybe it's because I don't follow NASCAR at all, or maybe it's because the same formula just didn't work the second time around.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell and others on screen were said to have improvised all of the time, much of the footage making it into the film. This fact seemed painfully obvious to me, watching scenes and gags that dragged on and on, losing steam quickly. You can especially tell at the dinner scene with the ""Baby Jesus"" joke and with the two bratty and annoying boys who weren't funny to begin with. The film on a whole actually felt like watching outtakes on a DVD for an hour and a half. I personally like my comedy to be something other than watching the actors screw around the whole time.<br/><br/>The actors, even Will Ferrell, couldn't carry this over-bloated film. The characters were completely boring and didn't have any of the appeal of those in ""Anchorman"". Sacha Baron Cohen makes for the only worthwhile aspect of the movie (and gave one of the three stars in my rating), sporting a hilarious French accent and yet again creating another brilliant character. Everything else falls flat completely, with a storyline that goes nowhere and jokes that for the most part seem to be pounding you over the head saying ""It's funny! It's funny!"". Satire? Far from it.<br/><br/>Is it just me? The more I think about it, the more I say ""no"". TN tries too hard to duplicate the magic that Ferrell and company made with ""Anchorman"", and almost none of it works. Though I tried to look through the barrage of product placement and the in-your-face, dragging jokes, I could find nothing special about this movie. It may work for some, but for others (and myself) it comes off as a work solely meant for the self-indulgent purposes of Will Ferrell and friends."
"jimmylee-1","3","2","5","25 November 2006"," Talledega Slump
","I have to disclose that I watched this on an airplane, and there may have been some absolutely gut-busting hilarity in the film that I missed because the sound was bad. I'm hoping there was, because otherwise the the best part of this movie was the outtakes.<br/><br/>I found Will Ferrell to be funny playing a supporting character in Old School. Although Elf seemed like the same joke over and over, I admired Ferrell's willingness to search so hard for new ways to act like an idiot. Anchorman Ron Burgundy had its brief moments - and Christina Applegate is very competent - but it went a bit downhill after the fight scene. Perhaps Will Ferrell reached his pinnacle with Bewitched, where he was joined by not one, but many extremely competent actors - I don't think Bewitched was that great, but compared to Ferrell's previous offerings, it was Shakespeare.<br/><br/>Talledega Nights put a similar character to Ron Burgundy behind the wheel of a race car in what should have been an enjoyable parody of Nascar. Since Nascar is a cultural event that offers so much to work with, I had high hopes for entertainment. The rise and fall of Nascar collectible plate prices alone could have kept the movie going for half an hour, and the name of Ferrell's character showed an awareness of the potential.<br/><br/>This film, though, seemed to follow the same pattern of your more recent Will Ferrell movies. In fact, they're so predictable I may start writing scripts for him in my spare time using the following formula: man has supercilious personality plus everything; man loses everything (here's where Will usually runs around in his BVDs) and is in depths of despair; at last, man is inspired, no longer supercilious, and rises to the occasion while learning a heart-warming yet gut-busting lesson.<br/><br/>For some reason, Nascar didn't offer enough to parody, and we had to add a homosexual relationship to the mix. If the attempt to parody Nascar wasn't offensive to true Nascar fans, I'm sure the French race driver kissing his male lover put the nail in the coffin. I'm disappointed the film stooped to this level of humor when there is so much available in the Bible Belt.<br/><br/>To haul out a quick soapbox, I am compelled to point out that the state of contemporary comedic film is beyond sorry. We've got literally thousands of stand-up comics throughout the country with immense skills. We have classic films as guidelines, ranging from gross-out to urbane, that are hysterically funny. And then Hollywood churns out a film like this one. This is the best we have to offer? When you think that these films are exported to the international market, it's no wonder other countries find us loud and annoying. <br/><br/>The outtakes indicated there was a lot of ad-libbing on the set, and I can only hope that the best lines were lost because the ones in the film were either tired, about three lines too long (oh, it's a joke. I get it), or just lame. <br/><br/>I'm sure that means there will be a sequel. Perhaps it, like this, will pass the time on an airplane. There wasn't much else to recommend Talledega Nights."

To make matters worse, if you are in to that slapstick sort of humor, it even is bad at that. We may as well be watching Jerry Lewis in ""Daytona Mornings"" or Jim Carrey in ""Ace Ventura - NASCAR Detective."""
"moviegeek310","8","2","6","9 August 2006"," ""Talladega"" Funniest in Years
","""Talladega Nights"" is without a doubt the funniest Will Farrell flick I've ever seen. Of course, I've only seen a couple, so I really wouldn't know. Nevertheless, it was hilarious. Though if you're not a fan of Will Farrell, NASCAR, or pure stupidity, you'll probably just be mildly annoyed.<br/><br/>""The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is the tale of a race car driver who really does have the need for speed. Ricky starts out as a lowly pit crew member, but ends up racing when the racer he worked for decides it's time for a lunch break. And guess what, Ricky goes from last to first place. From there he wins every race-even when going backwards- until a new French racer causes him crash. This causes him to think he's on fire, which then causes him to think he is paralyzed, which leads to him sticking a knife in his leg to prove it. But he won't let that stop him, he must always be number 1, or his name isn't Ricky Bobby.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's a dumb plot, but it's hilarious. Will Farrell did a good job in my opinion. I've always thought he was funny ever since he played Alex Trebeck on ""Saturday Night Live"". John C. Reilly as Ricky's best friend, Cal Naughton Jr., also does well in his first comedic role. Then there's Sasha Baron Cohen as the gay French driver Jean Girard, umÂ…yeah, not much to say about that. The one thing I didn't like is the extended racing scenes. NASCAR fans will enjoy it; everyone else will be checking their watches. Other than that you'll be laughing pretty hard every minute or so, which, I'd say, is good for a comedy. Most of the time there are only a couple belly laughs.<br/><br/>Well, that's about it, not much more you can say about comedies. So if you're in the mood to guffaw, watch some wacky Will, etcetera, then this film will have you in stitches.<br/><br/>I give Mr. Bobby 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>This film is rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, language, drug references and brief comic violence."
"jgpingpong","8","2","6","4 August 2006"," A great funny movie
","This has got to be one of Will Ferrell's best movies. Do not believe this isn't a great movie based on what others have said. This is a comedy, not some serious drama based on a book looking to get in depth and analytical about life. This is a true funny film that has the usual morals, and delivers what it promises.<br/><br/>First off the previews did not make this very enticing to see, yet what else do you do when you are bored on a Friday night? While the scenes in the preview commercials would seem to desensitize one, they did a good job in leaving all the highlights out of the movie. There a numerous funny scenes and lines which follow what was shown on TV.<br/><br/>The acting itself is great since Ferrell does a good job in creating a cocky and arrogant man who matures throughout the movie, yet it is the clever lines presented by all the characters which make it amusing. There are non stop laughs in the movie with few repeating gags. The two boys in the movie are hilarious as is all the support cast.<br/><br/>I do have some peeves though. The kissing scenes were just wrong. Now I am not against that stuff, but I don't think it was appropriate to have it presented in that manner and in front of some kids. Some of the one liners are a bit stupid and not all that funny. Finally, I know this is a movie, and as I have said not a serious one, but many of the crash scenes and things that occur on the track and in other car scenes seem unbelievable.<br/><br/>If you are looking to laugh for 2 hours straight this is the movie, definitely a future classic!"

","This movie is very funny, and if you like Anchorman type movies, you will surely like this movie. My wife and i just saw it and it was funy, she even liked it better than Anchorman (She was not a fan of Anchorman, she thought it was OK and funny at times). As far as the movie goes, its a better movie than Anchorman, as Anchorman was more like a bunch of funny parts of a movie strung together. Talladega nights at least has a consistent moving plot story to follow. I myself think Anchroman is funnier, but Talladega Nights is funny too. Also, there are some great outtakes after the movie is over that are hilarious. Good and funny movie to go see...i highly recommend it. (8/10)"

From the trailer and a few outtakes during the credits, it looks like the actors did many takes of most scenes. Don't envy the trailer editor; most of the quirky jokes are hilarious within the context of the relevant scene and or the movie only.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell was a lot of fun, and the supporting actors make it worthwhile to see too. Gary Cole is great as the scoundrel father, and the scenes with the kids are funny too."

I had been really looking forward to the release of the movie for several weeks and was not disappointed by what was presented. I felt the movie kept progressing so that I did not feel bored. I usually find myself going into a movie, looking at my watch at some points to see how much time is left, but that didn't happen here.<br/><br/>As for acting, the cast is great. Once again, it is a Saturday Night Live flavored movie, which is definitely apparent by the type of humor.

All in all, I'll definitely be seeing it again and again."

",""". . . If we are to become men we need the help of other menÂ—we need our fathers to model for us and then to anoint us, we need our buddies to share the coming-of-age rituals with us and to let us join the team of men . . . .""Frank Pittman <br/><br/>I didn't know Talladega Superspeedway is NASCAR Mecca, a race place where devoted fans party and drivers preen, all the time providing snobs like me with redneck stereotypes that play well in late night TV humor. Yet I'm a part of an effete stereotype itself, a hyper-educated egghead with an Accord rather than a Camero and little knowledge of formula car racing.<br/><br/>But I'm not detached enough to tell you that Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is a funny film, in part because of the redneck dumbing down (The Dale Earnhardts demand respect; no satire allowed there) and also because Will Ferrell as ace driver Ricky Bobby and John C. Reilly as his buddy, Cal Naughton, Jr., are effective race car drivers with slightly slow wits and big hearts, especially for each other.<br/><br/>Ricky's two sons are named Walker and Texas Ranger, he screams ""Help me, Jesus! Help me, Tom Cruise! Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft to get the fire off me!"" after an accident, and his wife is a hot blonde who goes where the earning potential is greatest. This is not brilliant comedic material, but it is a tribute to the actors and their sometimes improvised lines that I frequently laughed out loud as they confirmed my best Jeff Foxworthy insights about rednecks.<br/><br/>Besides being a spoof, Nights is also a buddy film with hilarious and tender moments of friendship amid the chaos of track racing groupies and corporate meddling. Similarly, the French and gay bashing portrait of Ricky's accomplished rival is a successful satire of our deepest-held fears about homoeroticism and international disdain for our immaturities. All this satire has been done before, so no kudos for creativity. In fact, the plot of Nights is similar to that of Anchorman, on which both the director and star collaborated.<br/><br/>Ricky Bobby's mantra, picked up from his erstwhile dad (Gary Cole), states, ""If you're not first, you're last."" Nights is not the best comedy of the summer, that honor goes to Little Miss Sunshine, but it stands with Clerks II as a humorous look at a prominent subculture whose political clout is approaching the status of ""soccer moms."""

But, where I think a lot of people go wrong, is cutting this movie short. Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) isn't likable at first, but halfway through the movie, you start to connect to the hardships that he experiences and the failures that sometimes swallow success. The real joy is connecting to the characters and laughing at their portrayals. This comedy isn't paid laughter, but rather, free enjoyment.<br/><br/>If you're into shallow laughter then that is fine.

","I absolutely loved this movie. In the spirit of Nascar and southern culture there were some annoying parts, but this was funny :) Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly make an amazing pair... almost in the likes of Stepbrothers.<br/><br/>The concept was simple and the dialogue was hilarious. They take the crudest material and make it acceptably funny. The special effects were very good, the action was great and even the emotional side brought you in a little bit.<br/><br/>For anyone holding off watching this, like I did, because of the Nascar aspect and all that... DON'T... it's an awesome movie you won't regret seeing."
"Anonymous_Maxine","5","1","2","2 April 2009"," Will Farell still doesn't know when bad jokes stop being funny...
","There are a couple of kids in Talladega Nights who I imagine are meant to be a hilarious representation of typical, smart-ass redneck kids, but most people will probably find them to be the most tasteless thing in a largely tasteless comedy. Of course, the movie is pretty honest in the kind of mindless slapstick that it delivers, but whose idea were those kids? There's a scene mid-way through the movie where they viciously berate an old man, their grandfather, while their idiot father, Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) loudly agrees with them, like any proud father would.<br/><br/>Of course, we all know not to take the movie seriously, but it is definitely a problem when we meet these two little bastards who arouse an intense desire to see them on the receiving end of a series of good smacks, only to have our heroes shower them with praise.<br/><br/>But of course, first and foremost Talladega Nights is a spoof film about American Nascar culture and rednecks in general. I have heard some people offended by the term ""redneck,"" but some of my closest friends proudly call themselves rednecks, and the term is just a little too descriptive and useful (not to mention accurate) to give it up. This premise provides for endless comedic opportunities, although you may find yourself wondering through much of the movie's parade of slapstick gags who the intended audience is. Ferrell has developed a very unique style of humor, but there are a lot of scenes in the movie that it's hard to imagine anyone laughing at.<br/><br/>Unless, of course, they're having an all-night Will Ferrell movie marathon and are still drunk or stoned or both from watching Old School, a much better and funnier movie.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a Nascar driver without a thought in his head and a name that pokes hilarious fun at other celebrities with two first names, like Tom Arnold, Ron Howard, Larry David, Shannon Elizabeth, and M. Night Shyamalan. It also reminds me of some other surnameless celebs, like the unfortunate Tommy Lee Jones, Seann William Scott, and arguably Sarah Jessica Parker and Neil Patrick Harris, who not only were tragically born without last names, but freighted with three first ones. Who would do such a thing to a child?<br/><br/>Anyway, sorry for the digression, although it is telling that that particular digression is more interesting than this movie. And by the way, what would you call someone with a name like Ricky Bobby? Should he be called by his first name or his second first name? I'll stick with the first first one.<br/><br/>Ricky Bobby has had an obsession with speed since childhood, when his father raced out the door and out of his life with all possible speed. Combine his love of speed with a competitive nature and the next logical step is Nascar, where he becomes a house-hold name. His best friend and teammate Carl Naughton Jr. (John C. Reilly) runs interference on the track for him, always helping to propel Ricky across the finish line first and then bundling up all his jealousy and bitterness in a hard little ball in the back of his mind.<br/><br/>Everything is going great for Ricky. He's the best driver on the Nascar circuit, he has a sexy, trashy blonde wife, he's making tons and tons of money and is blissfully unaware of the muted jealousy of his best friend and teammate and he's absolutely relishing the total lack of uppity homosexual French drivers tearing up the all-American Nascar track.<br/><br/>Soon, however, who should arrive but an uppity, homosexual French driver, Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), with the European audacity to tear up the all-American Nascar track. It is one of the movie's surest moments of opportunity for good comedy by poking fun at Ricky's intolerance for a Frechman on the Nascar track, coupled with his paralyzing inability to accept the concept of homosexuality, but unfortunately Ricky's potentially hilarious reaction takes second billing to the scenes of belligerent, cartoonish outwardness on the parts of Gerard and his husband, Gregory.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Talladega Nights was released a full-half decade into the 21st century, which is turning out to be the century where people are developing the opinion that homosexuality is as natural as skin color, and this ironically does some real damage to the movie's comedic gay-bashing. A man who's intolerance for homosexuality nearly renders him unconscious is pretty funny, but two movie characters pushing the boundaries of public displays of affection has never been funny and probably never will be. Someone should have told the writers that.<br/><br/>More than anything else the movie is an opportunity for Will Ferrell to give us a lot of his traditional Will Ferrell comedy, and sometimes it is amusing and sometimes the skits are flatly stupid, but certainly the movie is entertaining. It's not a classic comedy by any stretch of the imagination and there are more flops than hits in the laugh department, but this is one of Ferrell's lesser comedies, like the disappointing Step Brothers, also starring John C. Reilly.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell fans understand what kind of comedy to expect from him, and those in the audience who really understand and appreciate his humor are likely to have a great time with this movie. But unfortunately it's populated with paper-thin characters who are never meant to be even the slightest bit realistic, which makes any plot development that asks us to care about them seem inconsequential and ridiculous. It's hard not to laugh when Ricky is running around the Nascar track in his underwear thinking he's on fire and pleading Tom Cruise to save him with his witchcraft, but too much of the movie is too easy not to laugh at..."

Well, this one goes down as a miss. It seemed like it got progressively stupider after the first third of the movie. Even with parental guidance and children in the movie, most of the dialogue was very inappropriate for children. However, there were three standout performances: 1) Gary Cole as the absent drunken father of Will Ferrell. He always manages to make his characters memorable from Mr. Brady to the annoying boss Lumburger in Office Space. 2) The character of Ricky Bobby's mother. She was a no nonsense grandmother! 3) The camera action during the races. There was one scene in particular in the race that equals the bullet scene in ""Three Kings"", the long shot in ""Snake Eyes"" and a host of other creative camera work seen in movies. It gave me a newfound respect for race car driving, though not enough to make me regularly watch it. But if I was a Nascar fan, I would nave been disappointed with all the filler material outside of the racing.<br/><br/>P.S.

","Having liked Will Ferrell's earlier work in ""Old School"" and particularly ""Anchorman"", I was excited to see this movie. In my opinion it falls short of being a funny movie. The script itself just isn't as funny as you might expect, and while some parts are kinda fun, they are either too stupid or too long-drawn to become laugh-out-loud funny. And apart from Sasha Baron Cohen who appears as Will Ferrell's NASCAR nemesis, most characters are pretty dull. ""Anchorman"" had goofy but lovable characters, and a script that didn't take itself seriously at all. Talladega Nights has neither in my opinion.<br/><br/>It isn't a bad movie at all, but for me it is just a little dull, and not as clear and polished as ""Anchorman"" was. Most of it I guess just comes from the fact that the story told in Talladega Nights isn't as good, plain and simple."

I got neither - he was a complete flop in his role, and in fact his role was atrociously constructed, so perhaps it wasn't his fault.<br/><br/>However, what I got instead was a good back-to-basics snigger-fest at the foibles, and just plain trashiness of the American ""culture"" which surrounds NASCAR, and its ilk. OK, the stereotyped redneck is easy to parody, but this was done with a certain finesse which kept it fresh right till the absurd end. Of course it was very predictable in places, but had just enough comic twists to surprise occasionally. Many of the support apart from Baron Cohen had some very witty lines as Mr Bobby's foil, and they delivered them well.<br/><br/>The product placement was a tad annoying (well done Sony for that _huge_ Vaio logo).

What makes Talledaga Nights different though, is the comedy. Will Ferrell has placed himself amongst a great cast of comic actors; so much so, that he doesn't try and hog the limelight. Instead, Ferrell is funny, but makes the movie funnier by taking a back seat when someone has a funnier bit. And what a cast, including John C. Reilly as his driving partner and team mate and Gary Cole as his estranged father. But best of all is Sacha Baron Cohen as his gay French rival, who seems to be channeling a camp version of Peter Sellers in his voice.<br/><br/>Talledaga Nights is easy to predict and there is little doubt what the ending will be.

The movie is fairly predictable, but let's face it -- we're not going for an Academy Award winner here. Yes, there are entertaining parts, but I would say that Anchorman was a funnier movie with more unexpected bits of humor.<br/><br/>My nine-year-old wanted to see it because of the many previews he'd seen on TV and at the theater. I am glad that I did not take him because there's a fairly good bit of mild-to-moderate profanity and more sexual humor than I care to have to explain to him at this point.<br/><br/>Bottom line -- was it worth it? Yes, because I went with good friends and it was a packed house. But, minus the atmosphere, I would have waited to see it in a second-run theater or on DVD."
"MLDinTN","3","2","7","10 July 2007"," not that funny
","I am a fan of Will Ferrell, but I just don't think this movie is all that great. Maybe he should stick to just acting and not co-writing movie scripts. I thought the script was poor, not enough of a plot. Plus Ferrell once again plays the same goofy character in this movie. And I'm not a fan of NASCAR so that didn't do much for me.<br/><br/>I found a few things funny, but overall it just wasn't a good comedy. Sasha Baron Cohen was probably the funniest thing in the film. He had his little boyfriend and his accent that could barely be understood.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I would skip this Will Ferrell film. His small role in Weddingcrashers was funnier."

","Look I don't know about the rest of you people but this alternative life styles getting shoved down my throat makes me sick. Don't get me wrong a little oddball humor is OK but to much is TOO much. If you want to see a movie that is on the same level as, say, The Anchorman then by all means watch Ricky Bobby. But personally I'd take back the hour and a half that I wasted watching crude antics, and over the top life style themes portrayed in this film. Also there is the matter of lack of respect for the elderly, and also lack of continuity in a family. In one scene young children are berating and belittling their grandfather, but instead of being chastised they are in fact encouraged to continue; also (same scene) children admit to doing badly in school, and showing lack of respect for authority but nothing is done about it. In another matter there is Ricky's father, a transient bum who constantly leaves his family only to come back to leave again. This film is portrayed as a family comedy, but but i can't see it as anything but a waste of time."

","""Talladega Nights"" is genuinely funny, and the best movie I've seen this summer. That's kind of sad when you consider that this is just meant to be a fluffy little comedy and leaden bores like ""The Da Vinci Code"" were meant to be serious entertainment.<br/><br/>But ""Talladega Nights"" has consistent characterizations, a coherent, if goofy, script, and fine performances all around. As far as craft goes, this comedy is better made than the ""serious"" films out there.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is a comic genius; John C. Reilly gets his share of laughs; Sasha Baron Cohen is hysterical -- just to look at him is to laugh - as a French race car driver who wants to retire to design currency to be used by dogs and cats. Gary Cole, as Reese Bobby, Will Ferrell's shiftless, low life, beer drinking father, is one of the most interesting characterizations in the summer's films, and laugh out loud funny.<br/><br/>I wonder about the film's stereotyping of Southerners; Hey, you Southerners out there -- did you feel offended by this movie? And, yet, I laughed.<br/><br/>Unlike other recent comedies, there are few to no gross out scenes here. No use of bodily fluids in attempts at humor."

We took (dragged) my friend who is of the most discerning tastes to it with us and even he enjoyed it. If you liked Anchor Man at all, this movie is Anchor Man upped a notch.

","A non-stop commercial disguised as a ""movie"" has little evidence of the latter (plot, dialogue, character development, humor, reason, point) and ample evidence of the former (I stopped counting at 37 different corporate brands, but I think 150 is a good guess, plus a full-blown Applebee's commercial in the middle). Critique the movie, highlighting the plot holes, or writing another word (even to commend Sascha Baron Cohen as the movie's only redeeming quality) is a waste of time. Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. (Ps, curse IMDb! They want my comment to take more than 10 lines. No, I tell you! This movie is not worth ten lines! Please don't see it!

The story is the same all the way through, but just added a little flavour to make the story funny. In my opinion, it's most probably Will Ferrals worst performance to date and even Anchorman is funnier, but this makes all comedy's look dull, not funny and absolutely stupid. Sacha Baron Cohen makes a half descent effort but still cant pull of genuine comedy.<br/><br/>It's actually more of a film you would mock than laugh with.

","Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby is about a professional race car driver named Ricky Bobby who seems to have everything perfect in his life because he always wins the big races. Soon a new French driver comes into town and threatens to take Ricky Bobby's top spot. Ricky Bobby seems to be losing his fans and the people he cares about because he is not racing and he soon decides to give it up entirely, but thanks to the help of his seldom seen father Ricky Bobby plans to get back in the race and win and also prove to everyone that he still has what it takes to be a great driver. Talladega Nights has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances by the entire cast and good film editing. I'm not into racing myself, but that did not stop me one bit from enjoying this movie. I didn't find the movie particularly funny either, but that did not stop me from enjoying it either. The film is entertaining and all the actors are at the top of their game delivering great comedic performances and the writing of the script was well done and allows the viewer to have a lot of fun. I liked how the film was very entertaining and throughout the film you begin to care about Ricky Bobby and want to see him accomplish his goal and get back into the race in win. Very many comedies these days allow you to care or see a more simpler side to a character and this film does this even while being a comedy and I think it was pulled off well. I also liked some of the more heartfelt scenes in the film and I thought those worked too. At the end of this film I was cheering for Ricky Bobby and wanted to seem him succeed and I think another good thing about this film was that the characters were very well written which does more than just allow us to like or dislike them, but instead as I said earlier to feel for them and want them to do well. Also, I'd like to note that just because I didn't find the film funny doesn't mean that you won't. I just felt that most of the jokes were given away in the film's trailer. Having said that this film is still one of the best comedies of the summer and it is very entertaining and the heartfelt stuff really worked for me and as a whole I was very pleased with this movie and I don't think fans of Will Ferrell, his films or the comedy genre will be disappointed."

Maybe it is because I was raised in the south that this film seems more like a documentary than anything. Talladega Nights tries way too hard to be funny. There is, however a hilarious scene between Ricky and his best friend when one of them confesses to something deep and dark in their past. I don't understand why this film has been so successful. My advice? Wait till it hits video stores."

","""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is an entertaining delight. If you like ""dumb"" comedies, you will likely enjoy this. The same two people who co-wrote ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (Adam McKay and Will Ferrell) co-wrote this, so if you enjoyed the first movie in the ""Mediocre American Man"" trilogy, you will enjoy this. You do not have to be a Nascar fan to enjoy this. You just have to like the Will Ferrell type movie.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a plot, look somewhere else because you have wasted your time and money. If you are someone who complains about the plot, in a comedy by Will Ferrell, you might as well complain about how donuts do not have enough nutrition or how ""Bad Santa"" did not have scenes appropriate for children. This plot is similar to ""Anchorman"" and other sports movies as well. Here you have a man at the top of his game, he hits a little snag, and the rest just explains how he slowly moves up until he is at the top again. The plot may not be Academy Award winning but who goes to see a Will Ferrell movie for its ""rich"" plot? <br/><br/>Will Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a redneck Nascar driver with the perfect name, amazingly and again shows how funny he is with his improvisations and random comments. This was not surprising considering that I have loved him sense his days on ""Saturday Night Live."" He is great playing a lovable moron, as shown in movies such as ""Elf"" or ""Anchorman."" I could tell he had a lot of fun working on this project.<br/><br/>The supporting cast made this funnier. Ricky's two sons, Walker (Houston Tumlin) and Texas Ranger (Grayson Russell) were very rude and profane and my favorite supporting characters. John C. Reilly as Cal, Ricky's best friend, was also great and had very nice chemistry with Will. Sacha Baron Cohen as a gay French Nascar driver made a great villain. Reese and Lucy Bobby played by Gary Cole and Jane Lynch, Ricky's parents, were entertaining especially Reese. Michael Clarke Duncan, as Lucius Washington, and Amy Adams, as Susan, were great as assistants to Ricky Bobby. Leslie Bibb as Carley Bobby was also funny. Even Molly Shannon (who was on ""Saturday Night Live"" with Ferrell) had a humorous part as Mrs. Dennit.<br/><br/>I do not have any complaints about ""Talladega Nights."" It did its job, which was to entertain, and it did it well. However, if I had to make one complaint, it would be that there were numerous scenes shown in the trailers that were not shown in the movie. This is not a bad thing, because I know the DVD will be loaded with deleted scenes. The more I think about it, the more I realize this was not a negative because it made the movie more random.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Talladega Nights"" had me laughing the hardest out of everything I have seen this year. If you are looking for a love story about two men hanging out on a mountain, this is not what you are looking for. If you can laugh at Will Ferrell being a redneck Nascar driver, you are in the right place. If redneck or gay jokes easily offend you, this is not for you. I also suggest not bringing children, this is not a family movie, it is a PG-13 rated comedy for a good reason. If you want a family PG-13 movie, go see ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."" I want to see ""Talladega Nights"" again just to find any jokes I missed!"

The lowest form of human nature and bully mentality is exploited in films like this.

"suziechiodo","8","1","4","17 August 2006"," Finally, a funny Will Ferrell flick
","Let's face it, Will Ferrell has appeared in some real turkeys. Elf was cringeworthy, Bewitched was lame, and you could count the funny bits in Anchorman.<br/><br/>But in 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby', Ferrell has finally starred in (and written) a genuinely hilarious movie. It focuses on the life of the stock car racer Ricky Bobby (Ferrell), from birth to high school to first break to top of the ladder, then the fall from grace before his final comeback.<br/><br/>You don't need to know a whole lot about NASCAR (although it might be even funnier if you do) to appreciate this movie - it's a general send-up of the cheesiest of American culture. There's the line-dancing on the winner's podium; the lame slogans ('Shake and Bake, baby!'); and the rampant advertising (at one point, Ricky Bobby actually sells his windshield: ""It's dangerous and inconvenient, but I sure love Fig Newtons!"").<br/><br/>The funniest bits are probably the improvised ones: when Ricky Bobby gets out of his overturned car yelling to Oprah for help, or when he sticks a knife in his leg and his friends Cal Naughton Jr (John C Reilly) and Lucius Washington (Michael Clarke Duncan) try to prise it out again ('you gotta cut round the meat'). And Ferrell comes into his own during the various prayers to little baby Jesus throughout the movie ('dear lil' baby Jesus, in your golden fleece diaper...').<br/><br/>I could rehash the jokes from the movie forever, but that would ruin the surprise. So I'll simply say this: it may not have the most original plot line, and Sacha Baron Cohen as the French nemesis Jean Girard may have the lamest comedy accent ever, but these are minor peeves. Taken as a whole, Talladega Nights is the funniest (and most quotable) movie I've seen in ages. I dare you to leave the theatre in a bad mood."

"JoeJames76","8","1","4","14 August 2006"," Will Ferrell wins again with a little help from his friends
","Will Ferrell continues his winning streak with yet another irreverent take on the bizarre worlds that exist within our culture. First he tackled the 70s local news era in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Then the world of suburban soccer matches in Kicking and Screaming. This time around, he pokes fun within the increasingly popular NASCAR circuit in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.<br/><br/>What makes Ferrell's films and characters so popular and fun to watch, is that he is self deprecating, yet entirely lovable as dim witted everymen. He can easily go over the top and extreme for the big laugh (I'm caught in a glass case of emotion!!!), yet his varied line delivery and altering of tone can make even a line like, ""Thank you Baby Jesus"" seem like the greatest punch line on earth.<br/><br/>Ricky Bobby is just as funny, if not funnier than most of Ferrell's previous work. It helps that he is smart enough to surround himself with other comedic talents, such as Sacha Baron Cohen, more commonly known for his persona, Ali G. In addition to Cohen, Talladega Nights includes two fine dramatic actors, John C. Reilly and Michael Clarke Duncan, playing it straight for laughs unlike any comedian could.<br/><br/>With a supporting cast like this, Ferrell and friends are encouraged to improvise wildly, spurring each other to new heights as they maintain their composure. Witness Reilly's multiple line deliveries at the dinner table during the closing credits' outtakes, and you realize just how talented comedic actors need to be. (And when it comes to talented actors, NO ONE can rival John C. Reilly!). i'm sure there's another film and a half worth of jokes on the cutting room floor, making the forthcoming DVD release a much anticipated event.<br/><br/>In fact, i had the impression while watching that there must have been more filmed, seeing as Cohen's hilarious French NASCAR driver (Jacques Villeneuve???) shares very few scenes with Ferrell. As a fan who loved the film, I would have liked to have seen more, but I appreciate the editing for the sake of story movement and pacing. The predictable story arc makes for a nice, comfortable zone for the jokes to fly, and you'll be laughing throughout the film without any worries about laughing right through a plot point. A real winner.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"pyrocitor","7","1","4","11 August 2006"," The Ferrell crew do Nascar
","Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby<br/><br/>It seems safe to assume that Talladega Nights was one of the most anticipated films of the year, from all who enjoyed 2004's Anchorman, and wanted more of the same screwball brand of ridiculously random improv comedy. Well director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell and co. have all done their utmost to recreate the winning formula which made Anchorman such a hit two years back, and for the most part succeeded. There is, however, a noticeable change in tone, with despite the fact it was the insanely obscure improving scenes which proved such a hit with audiences, such scenes, which were basically the focus of Anchorman are seldom seen in Talladega Nights. There is much more of an emphasis on racecar driving, and hair raising crashes, as if McKay had the same sort of ideas as the last time, but a bigger budget to bring them to life, which was likely the case. <br/><br/>That being said, if so, said budget was put to use well, as the driving scenes are exhilarating and tense. But at the same time, it's almost sad, because it feels like the charm and spirit of Anchorman's low budget hilarity has been lost - as if McKay put too much emphasis on the driving and not enough on giving us the back and forth improvisation scenes that proved such a hit. There are several, to be sure, but many feel kinda staged, as if trying to imitate the Anchorman style, such as the dinner scene where Ferrell prays to ""Dear Lord Baby Jesus"" which starts out hilarious, but goes on far too long. In fact, the bloopers and outtakes played over the end credits provide some of the most memorable laughs in the movie, and it's a shame they couldn't have been better incorporated into the film. There's also the whole ""redemption"" storyline, where Ricky Bobby is forced to learn the errors of his ways, correct his spoiled persona and learn the true meaning of winning, which I suppose mirrors the storyline of Anchorman, but comes across as cheesier and more patronising this time round, and given the somewhat harsh comedic tone, it would be almost better to see an unexpected unhappy ending, just for a bit of variety. <br/><br/>Once again, Will Ferrell is given free reign to basically do what he does best, and he is truly hilarious once again, bringing life and punch to the character of Ricky Bobby, the incredibly spoiled racecar driver... with two first names. But as was the case with Anchorman, the supporting characters threaten to steal the show away from what was meant to be Ferrell's moment to shine - Gary Cole is nothing less than flat out hilarious as Ricky Bobby's disgusting loser of a dad, and if there was a single standout to be picked from the hilarious supporting cast, Ali G. star Sacha Baron Cohen would be it with his side-splitting turn as an eccentric and very gay french racecar driver, Jean Girard. John C. Reilly also raises many a laugh as Cal Naughton Jr., Ricky Bobby's faithful best friend and co-driver, who always places second to Ricky Bobby's inevitable first. <br/><br/>But there are also several superbly talented cast members who are not given nearly enough to do with the material provided, in particular the criminally underused Amy Adams, who is utterly adorable in her far too short role as Ricky Bobby's manager. The always reliable Michael Clarke Duncan also gives a strong performance, but once again, audiences wish that he'd been given a slightly bigger part, or at least more comedic moments (such as a blooper over the end credits where he sings!) Ferrell's Anchorman co-star David Koechner also turns up in a tiny appearance, though it's hard to see why, as he is given absolutely nothing of note to do, which is sad for all those expecting another performance of Champ like calibre. While the more primary cast members are more than sufficient in terms of providing laughs, it's just a shame these incredibly talented supporting players were given so little to do. <br/><br/>All in all, The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is most certainly worth viewing, especially for fans of Will Ferrell, or his last collaboration with director Adam McKay, but unfortunately enough, Talladega Nights doesn't quite live up to Anchorman in terms of memorability and quotable lines. (though the ""Help me Jesus! Help me Jewish Guy! Help me Tom Cruise! Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft to get the fire off me!!!"" which headlined all the trailers is still just as laugh out loud funny when hearing it in the film, fear not) But Ferrell, and supporting cast such as Reilly, Cohen and Cole are more than capable of providing a hefty enough share of laughs, and for all racing fans, the Nascar scenes are exciting and tense. Ricky Bobby may prove just the thing for a night of summer fun, but there is an overall feeling of somewhat wasted potential, as if it could have been so much better than the very entertaining film it already is. <br/><br/>-7/10"
"aschnier-2","6","1","4","9 August 2006"," More Bewitched than Anchorman
","This movie was kind of a disappointment. I was rather expecting the off the wall humor of Anchorman, and what I got was essentially a comic retread of Days of Thunder with some elements of The Program mixed in. The worst elements of The Program, mind you; the whole story line about the father was rehashed in this movie. This was kind of a problem, as it stopped the best characters from interacting. The supporting cast should have been enough to make this the best comedy of the year, but Molly Shannon, Greg Germann, Sacha Baron Cohen, and even John C O'Reilly (to an extent) were way underutilized. And how do you have Andy Richter in a movie and not give him anything at all to say or do?<br/><br/>As for NASCAR fans (of which I am one of), much of the comedy is targeted at the commercialization rampant in the sport, from the car sponsors to the TV commercials during the race - it doesn't rely on stereotyping the fans very much. The racing isn't terribly realistic (I don't think you can slingshot anywhere anymore, let alone Talladega), but it's not much worse than Days of Thunder...and this at least is a comedy.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie could have been better had they cut out the ""heart"" of the movie and just went for broke like they did with Anchorman - the best parts (such as the sponsor ads) have nothing at all to do with anything. As it stands, there are laughs to be had, but it just isn't the off-the-wall ride that Anchorman was."

","Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby/2006/**1/2<br/><br/>Main Stars: Will Ferrell John C. Reilly Sacha Baron Cohen Gary Cole<br/><br/>Ricky Bobby is no 1st place earner.<br/><br/>Adam McKay (director of the very funny Anchorman and who has a little cameo in this film as a fat racecar driver) returns to direct this lowbrow and disappointing comedy. I did think from the same team that created Anchorman that this film would be a little worse or as good as its previous film but I know it wouldn't have been better. Having seen the previews, I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach that this film wouldn't be that good. It turns out my prediction was correct. I'm not saying this was a bad film. I'm saying it was not a good film. And it wasn't. It was fair to good. The first half of the movie was not funny except for the quote at the very beginning. It was random just like Anchorman but it didn't have the constant laughs like Anchorman did. It had laughs more in the second half when Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) kinda loses his driving racecar spirit. His quote is ""I wanna go fast!"". But when he thought there was no hope left his quote was more like ""I wanna give up!"". I thought the second half had more GIGGLES than the first half which had maybe one more besides the quote. There were definitely no LAUGH OUT LOUD moments. More frowning at how much they tried rather than succeeded. More laughs came out of Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly) than Ricky Bobby. Or as his arch competitor Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) would say ""Ricky Booby"". However Ferrell did succeed in a few scenes like pretending he was on fire and running around in his underwear with his flab jiggling. Then there's the father of Ricky Bobby (Gary Cole) who influenced his son to drive like a racecar driver- reckless and fast. Cole was okay. He was nothing special either. When Jean Girard comes in from the French Formula One to be introduced into NASCAR, Ricky Bobby's talents are put to the test. The urgent question that needs to be answered is ""Who is better?"". Ricky has that ""If you're not first, your last!"" blood in him from his father and Jean Girard is the assertive and swishy Frenchman that also has only to win blood. But what is his objective for coming to America? To be what? You find out. And his friend Cal who made up this stupid ""Shake and Bake"" phrase is also in this challenging match against the pompous Girard. He invented it because it rhymes and they're both verbs. And he thinks he is smart because he said it. Is our national hero Ricky Bobby going to be beaten by the gay Frenchman who has a husband? That's kind of unbelievable actually. I mean Ricky Bobby had a foul-mouthed tough father and he also has two foul-mouthed sons who were definitely taught their lesson the granny way. As I said before the movie was random with smiles and some minor laughs in select scenes or as a local critic would call them- sporadic laughs. Will Ferrell was definitely not the main funny star. It was actually more from his friends than him. And people in the theater were laughing like crazy at the dumbest most idiotic jokes. I sat there with a straight face until, as I said before, the second half. It was indeed funnier than the first half. The story was sort of original and extremely random kinda like ""Family Guy"" except less funny. So a fair to good rating for Will Ferrell's disappointing Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. I had low expectations for this movie to begin with but at least have Will Ferrell as the funniest character! Movie directed by Adam McKay."
"DJAkin","7","1","4","7 August 2006"," Ron Burgundy is funnier than Ricky Bobby
","This movie was good, don't get me wrong, but I feel that Anchorman was better. The plots are similar. Just like when Ron Burgundy went from a hotshot anchor to a nobody - so does Ricky Bobby from Nascar hero to pizza delivery boy on a bicycle. Then they rebound to stardom. Anyway, this was a good movie. I loved the way that Ricky Bobby and his friend constantly said SHAKE AND BAKE to each other to get hyped up. The best part was at dinner when they had tons of fast food and were saying grace to the Baby Jesus. Yes, you read that right, Ricky Bobby was profusely thanking ""The Baby Jesus"" for all the food they were about to receive. Then the other folks at the table became upset because Jesus was an adult with a beard....haha. Then Ricky Bobby kept on saying that he prefers to think of Jesus as a baby!! This reminded me of my cousin David saying that he found a piece of driftwood that was used to beat up the baby Jesus. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie was fun. I would see this again. But there will never be another RON BURGUNDY!!!"
"zetes","7","1","4","7 August 2006"," Good, but a big drop off after the hilarity of Anchorman
","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, in my mind, is one of the funniest (perhaps the funniest) films of the current decade. This similar-sounding film comes from the same team of writer/director Adam McKay and writer/star Will Ferrel. It's not at the same level as Anchorman, unfortunately. It has its share of huge laughs Â– far more than enough to make the film worth seeing. It's just not as consistently funny. The audience frequently laughed loudly, but there was a fair share of jokes that were dead in the water. Crickets could be heard occasionally. Unlike Anchorman, there are only a couple of lines worth quoting, and I kind of doubt that people will ever be referencing it. McKay and Ferrell also try to insert a heart into the picture. Generally, I think this is a mistake. While heartfelt comedies do work, sometimes (like in Anchorman) it's just nice to have something that makes you laugh your butt off. I think, for example, the Farrelly brothers have really lost their way, and I think last year's The 40 Year Old Virgin, of which Talladega Nights is 2006's equivalent, sacrificed many laughs in order to be sweet. Surprisingly, it works quite well in Talladega Nights. It is actually a bit painful to watch Ricky Bobby and his best friend (played by John C. Reilly) split up. The material with Ricky's neglectful father (played by Gary Cole, most famous for his role as the wishy-washy boss Lumberg in Office Space) is actually quite potent. The audience was audibly upset near the end of the film when it looked like this character was going to have a change of heart, but doesn't. It's quite impressive, honestly, that McKay and Ferrell didn't compromise just to please the audience and have a happier solution with that character. Just one of the many reasons why I can't help but have some affection for this movie."
"diac228","7","1","4","7 August 2006"," If you get a kick out of Ferrell stabbing himself to prove that he is paralyzed, this film is for you
","If you don't chew Big Red, then **** you. That's just one of the several humorous one-liners that are sprinkled throughout the silly and sometimes downright-hilarious Talladega Nights. Powered by a stellar cast and more product placement moments than one can count, this film spoofs the sports drama genre and also spoofs the sport of Nascar. Will Ferrell provided his writing skills as well as his acting chops, but it's really all the acting in the film that keeps Talladega from running out of gas. More or less, this is the Nascar version of Anchorman, except for the fact that it does not borrow jokes from other television shows.<br/><br/>Talladega Nights is about a hotshot driver by the name of Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) whom with the help of his best friend, a fellow Nascar driver himself, he rises to the top of the racing world, and along the way marries a beautiful women and has children that could have been spawns of Satan. But, his success is short-lived when Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), a really good driver from France, moves to the United States and gives him a run for his money. Bobby's driving skills, devotion, and courage is put to the test as the new threat charges his way to conquer the racing world. Written by Adam McKay and Will Ferrell, who worked together on Anchorman and Saturday Night Live, they leave plenty of room for improvising and random moments of humor, and oddly enough those scenes are what delivers more than anything else.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, where the writing and directing and pacing fails, it's made-up for by the acting. Whether it's the awesome improvising skills of Ferrell, John C. Reilly (portraying his best friend), Cohen, or even Michael Clarke Duncan (Yes folks, he is actually funny), it is guaranteed that the best moments of the film involve them just playing around, having fun, drifting off on very silly tangents; which includes interpretations of Jesus and deep dark secrets. The races themselves are well-directed, credit should be given to McKay for at least providing a share of in-your-face moments when the crashes lunges right at the camera on several occasions with enough realism to almost temporarily suck out all the humor at the moment. The soundtrack in the film is actually very good, as it mixes some AC/DC, Chicago, and even some Saliva. Good soundtrack, plenty of good one-liners, plenty of off-the-wall humor; the last time a sports comedy successfully mixed this together was The Waterboy, an Adam Sandler hit years ago.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, like most comedies, even spoofs, there are those slow moments that just slow down the film to a point in which its almost unbearable. The relationship between Bobby and his father is thrown in, and despite the father being a fairly funny character; he gives Talladega Nights a hint of unnecessary sentimental value. Then there are other moments in which they are spoofing dramatic moments from other films, so it is confusing as to when the movie should be taken seriously, if it should ever be taken seriously. You'll even get to see Duncan in tears, but thankfully that was during the best moment in the movie.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: One-liners up the ying-yang carries this movie from reaching certain doom, and also might even inspire a second viewing to catch all the witty dialogue exchanged amongst the more talented improvisers. Don't let the product placements fool you either; they are all there for a reason. Ferrell is a whiz at entertaining the audience, but it is not just him making the audience laugh, most of the supporting cast lent their comedic chops and with plenty of success. While the film could have been shorter, and also could have done without the family theme, it is still worthy of viewing on the big screen at least once. While the summer is ending, the barrage of good summer flicks in the 2006 season has yet to end, as Talladega Nights will not disappoint as long as you are a fan of Will Ferrell and are not expecting Frasier-like sophisticated humor.<br/><br/>""Shake...AND bake!"""
"jaredmobarak","4","1","4","6 August 2006"," Shake and BakeÂ…Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby
","If Talladega Nights did anything for me, it confirmed my previous bias that racecar driving is boring to watch. While filled with some great, random one-liners, and some really good performances, Ricky Bobby's ballad crawls along at a sluggish pace. What's weird about this outlook is that the slowest talking character, played hilariously by Sasha Baron Cohen, was actually a part that moved the scenes forward. It was flashy, fast-talking, yet ultimately uninteresting.<br/><br/>I will admit to not being much of a Will Ferrell fan. I find his comedy loud and obnoxious, used correctly very rarely. He is usually good in ensemble pieces where he is not the star, Old School for instance, while using one-note performances extended way beyond their limits in his star vehicles like Anchorman, which I hated besides a nice absurdist back street brawl, and the film being discussed here. Ferrell's shtick seems to always go too long; he seems to revel in killing his jokes, which becomes even more annoying when everyone in America starts to say his lines verbatim in casual conversation. The film had some parts that really worked, however, mostly when it was at its most absurd. There was a subversive sense of comical surrealism at moments that succeeded; they showed that everyone was taking him/ herself with naught a shred of seriousness. Most of the slow parts, really the unsuccessful ones, are when we are suddenly spoon-fed sentimentality and new-found moral fiber that is so out of character, one wishes it was gone so as to see more funny instances. The film worked as a comedy and died quickly when it decided to take itself way too seriously.<br/><br/>There were some real shining moments, however. John C. Reilly is amazing. He has always played the low-key, slightly naÃ¯ve, schlub well, and here he takes low-IQ to another level. The comic timing and delivery is impeccable and I hope that he sticks to these character roles that suit his abilities perfectly rather then try his hand at superstardom as most other ""sidekicks"" try and fail to do. One thing that he has going for him is that he is established already, (used brilliantly by autuers such as Paul Thomas Anderson), and won't fall prey to any lucrative deals for crap scripts. Gary Cole is spectacular as Ferrell's father. The sleazy, white-trash nature he brings is true to the character and provides most of the good laughs. Sasha Baron Cohen was also a revelation to me. I have not seen his Da Ali G Show, so I know very little about him, except for the very funny trailer for his movie starring the titular alter- ego Borat. By being very deliberate and always in character throughout, he has created a working caricature. The accent and effeminate, European tendencies are a great contrast to the boorish Bobby. Most other actors are ineffectively used, mostly because these films need to cram in as many cameos as possible, throwing in totally useless cut scenes that are so random they are more distracting than funny. Amy Adams is involved in possibly the best scene of the movie towards the end in a bar with Ferrell. She delivers a great monologue and Ferrell's vocal reactions after are priceless. Unfortunately she was abused earlier in the film, just being shot silent with mouth open, looking as though her talent would totally be wasted.<br/><br/>In the end, the randomness and short bursts of real good comedy couldn't save the film. Its sluggish pace is definitely not helped by its infinite number of product placements at all. I mean, come on, when did Hollywood need to whore itself out that much? I see where some reviewers have a point saying it's a commentary on the plethora of advertising in the Nascar world, but I don't give the filmmakers that much credit. It was a low budget comedy that needed money to clear its licensing fees and car wrecks. I will admit that product placement caused the best laugh of the film; just watch for Applebees during the final race and prepare for absurdity at its best. Unfortunately we aren't treated with enough moments like that, where the creators trust the audience to go for the ride and laugh while the movie laughs at itself. Instead we get more moments where everything is spelled out for us. For instance, a great moment of hilarity when we arrive at Cohen's character's mansion and see Mos Def and Elvis Costello. The joke is priceless that they, for what possible reason, could be there. It's a real shame that Ferrell needs to bring attention to them, for no other reason than to ruin the inside joke for those who actually recognized the singers. Remember to stay and watch the few outtakes during the start of the end credits. At least reward yourself for sitting through the duration for some good, unorchestrated laughs."
"timmaulou","7","1","4","7 August 2006"," Funny, but did have Lulls.
","This movie to me was much funnier than some of the latest Will Ferrell offerings, like Anchorman and Old School. Some may argue this point, but I think the cast in this movie offered more laughs than the casts of the other two movies. Especially the kids, Walker and Texas Ranger, or as we call him T.R. The movie does have some areas that drag, and some very forced and not that funny areas, but overall, I'll give it a positive rating. Will Ferrell is at his best when allowed to improvise and in this movie you can tell that a lot of the script was allowed to go on with a stream of consciousness.

"Skycoaster","8","1","4","4 August 2006"," Nascar with a Nas-star.
","I have been to a grand total of four Nascar races in my lifetime, and all of them have so closely followed the pattern of circle fast, crash, circle slow, and repeat, that the experiences have all run together. The noise is prohibitively loud and crashes are far too rare and not nearly spectacular enough, meaning that the whole reason we are there is the hope that someone will get hurt. The urge is so great that pointing and gasping at nothing will still attract ten thousand faces hoping to see some sparks. It is a destructive atmosphere, and, for millions, it is a lifestyle.<br/><br/>Pitched and picked up in six words, ""Will Ferrell as a Nascar driver,"" Talladega Nights sends up this lifestyle and then some with jokes meant to be satire but that are sometimes unfortunately realistic. I would wager that at some point in Nascar history a driver has obliged to signing a baby's forehead at the request of its mother, as Ferrell does. For those who live outside of Nascar's influence, these jokes ring true due to sheer irony, but any others may find humor in how similar the movie is to the real thing. And how perfect is the name Ricky Bobby for a Nascar driver?<br/><br/>As Bobby, Will Ferrell has perfected his role as the quintessential millionaire driver. His southern accent is flawless, but to be fair it is not that hard to replicate anyway. Beyond his speech, though, is what really makes him perfect for the role. He has the look and the feel of a walking billboard that advertises itself just as much as its sponsors. He exudes arrogance and self-aggrandizement towards everyone he knows, even his dimwitted friend Cal (John Rielly), who will not let Ricky's flair for competition suppress his naturally amicable personality. Even when he unintentionally betrays Ricky, although I will not say how, he cannot grasp the concept of losing his best friend.<br/><br/>Opposing both teammates is French flamer Jean Girard, played superbly by Sacha Baron Cohen of Da Ali G Show. On HBO he has a flair for every one of his many characters, so naturally playing two stereotypes at once is no problem for him. He speaks his lines with a sincerity that rings so true that we laugh at how serious he sounds, such as when he tries cajole Ricky into kissing him with just a touch of desperation in his voice. Whether or not Ricky obliges, I shall not say.<br/><br/>Most of the humor from any source other than Ferrell or Girard does not deserve a second look. The jokes are interchangeable and juvenile profanity that get tired after Ricky's two sons, Walker and Texas Ranger (pun totally intended), go on a rant about their grandfather, which comes across as more pejorative than funny. Specific jokes of this sort, like some from the trailer, are not in the film, such as when Ferrell absent-mindedly flips a bike onto his lawn. The film looks like it was edited in less than a week, though, mainly because it has a simple layout for these jokes: Funny part, plot element, repeat. Sounds like a Nascar race in itself.<br/><br/>Those concerned that all the humor was lost to the trailer, which is one of the most persuasive in years, will not be disappointed. The biggest laugh is always yet to come, and the chaos always stops just before it gets awkward. Ferrell, of course, must find a way to run around half-naked, a recurring motif for many of his films, most notably Old School, but do not let his movie give you the wrong idea about Nascar; no one will ever have this much fun at a race."

The visuals are as stunning as any racing movie in recent memory, and the character played by Sacha Baron Cohen is a HILARIOUS foil to Will Ferell, and the entire supporting cast is first rate. Although most comedies are idiot plots to string jokes on, this plot is engaging enough to be played straight. The two little Whipper-snappers that Ricky Bobby has for sons, (Walker and Texas Ranger) are HI-Larious, and I want to hang out with them . The quote-ability quotient of this movie also ranks higher than expected, and as a huge fan of Anchorman(which also has a high level of quote-ability) I was so pumped when watching this to see it again to learn the lines that will Definitely impress my friends.

","Funny NASCAR comedy charts the course of Ricky Bobby, a man who only knows how to drive fast.<br/><br/>I do not, as a rule, like Will Ferrell, and I dislike NASCAR but I found this movie very funny. The best of Ferrell's starring vehicles this movie manages to make fun of everyone and everything. On the laugh meter its probably closer to an 8 than the six I've given it, and if thats what you're looking this is your movie. However I have some reservations about the film that kept me from enjoying it completely. I dislike that pretty much every character is as stupid as a stick. There is no characters rather caricatures which would be fine except it becomes jarring when the characters meet real people. This also has to be the film with the greatest amount of product placement in history. Granted the nature of racing is to have little ads everywhere but this film drags it into the peoples ""real lives"" its distracting.<br/><br/>That said this is a very funny movie and perfect for those wanting to laugh away a rained out race day."

The kids were so obnoxious I would never want young kids to see this and think it was OK to talk the way they did. The characters were very well cast. We aren't NASCAR fans, but we did like the race scenes. Both of us are from the South so we got all the jokes and liked them.

"Quinoa1984","8","1","5","6 August 2006"," one of the most shamelessly funny movies of the year
","Like with Will Ferrell's last film as co-writer/star, Talladega Nights is genuinely smart in being completely irreverent and stupid. Sometimes I couldn't believe some of the malarkey I was getting my kicks from in watching this film, and I didn't have the same expectations I had for Anchorman (a different cast, more varied). But it turns out to be probably on par with that film in just delivering a brilliant mix of physical comedy, bits of slapstick, bits of social commentary (well, maybe lots actually), and even nuance too. The genius of Will Ferrell as race-car driver Ricky Bobby, as well as his co-stars John C. Reilly (as best friend Cal) and especially Sacha Baron Cohen as gay French driver Jean Girard, is that they're all fearless at being shameless. Some scenes could be pulled off by other comics or actors, but they just wouldn't be the same with the timing and (likely) improvisation. Something about it all just clicks with the material, and so much goes by that you might want to see it again just to get all of the parts that might've flown by.<br/><br/>The basic premise involves Ricky Bobby (yes, two first names as his full name with a Wonder Bread hat most of the time) as a dimwitted by earnest champion Nascar type driver who gets his game toppled by Gerard (Cohen, his funniest and spot-on role since the Da Ali G show), and after a crippling accident that left him in his underwear screaming and running around on the field. He gets his game back, however, through his even more of a redneck-type father (Gary Cole, his most ingenious playing since Office Space) through certain endeavors. This is all just a cover though for all of the juicy, unexpected comic bits, which can range from delivering big, show-stopping laughs (my favorites were the knives in the leg and Cohen and Andy Richter's odd gay marriage pairing) to little ones that you might be laughing at even as no one else in the theater does. It's also not a boring take on just race car driving either, which might've limited the material.<br/><br/>In the end, Talladega Nights gets its best material at lampooning the 'white-trash' types who participate in &/or love race car driving, and some of the most obvious jabs of any comedy since...well, Anchorman. It's not to say that Ferrell isn't an acquired taste- you'll either find his verbal and physical antics funny or you won't, to which this film might be a mixed bag. But everything from the product placements to the French to most Sports movies and lots of quotable lines in-between makes this the kind of comedy you might be laughing about with your friends once leaving the theater. One things for sure, I've never had a laugh so loud at an joke involving El Diablo (which is a 'fighting chicken' according to Cal) before this."

","The movie was hilarious. I am shocked by the low rating and the handful of haters out there. Talladega was somewhere between a ""glad I saw it"" and a ""absolute must see"" for anyone with a healthy sense of humor. People will be quoting the movie for years. I personally think that Will Ferrell is one of the most talented comedic presences alive, and I believe anyone who thinks the contrary is a dolt. As this belief may bias my review, you should know it wasn't the greatest comedy I have ever seen. It was, however, certainly in my top ten. Go check it out! How can anyone not love Will Ferrell?!?

","When I had first seen Anchorman, which was also directed by Adam McKay, I thought that the farcical improv stuff had reached too far, but I have to say, that it was that very stuff that kept me into Talladega Nights.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I'm not that into the old southern good ol' boy stereotypes that we often see in any pop culture reference to NASCAR and its fans, but Ferrell's script put a good deal of heart and character development beneath the silliness. Walking out out of the theater, I heard a complaint about the product placement, but in some cases, it is played perfectly from a comic perspective. I made the mistake of reading a New York Times review that ruined the most stunning moment of the film, in addition to referring to a throwaway line early on as ""the single funniest joke"". John C. Reilly, Sascha Baron Cohen and Gary Cole each have great supporting moments. I was particularly shocked that Cohen's accent made me laugh as it did. He was spectacular, going toe-to-toe with Ferrell on the improv front. He really is in joining that rare Peter Sellers realm, it seems. Ferrell is as great as he can possibly be in a character rooted in stereotypes. Most of all, I walked away impressed with McKay, who I really thought was too subversive to pull off a blockbuster. Anchorman was cool in that there hadn't been anything like it in the mainstream, but this takes it to another level."

If I knew how obscene and disgusting his character would be, I would have never watched the movie.<br/><br/>Cons: -Will Ferrell is playing the exact same role of a senseless buffoon that he does in other movies such as Elf. -The plot was nonexistent. It was basically ""let's watch Will Ferrell act like a moron for 108 straight minutes"". Also, the angle where his best friend steals his wife, then still tries to be his friend, is not funny so much as dumb. -Jean Girard is revolting. He goes from patting Andy Richter on the butt, to creating images of men kissing each other in his victory lap, to making open sexual passes at Ricky Bobby. By the end of the movie, most of the audience looked ready to puke. -The ""Baby Jesus"" scene was in really poor taste.

","A fun(or maybe not-so-fun)game to play when watching this film would be trying to list all of the product placements or ads that are inserted very cleverly into this film. I realize that NASCAR,through which this movie uses for its setting and framing,is rife with advertising(actually,name me a pro sport that ISN'T!),but still,this movie even adds on to the amount of commercials given that fact.<br/><br/>Now,about the movie: race-car driver Ricky Bobby(Will Ferrell,who has it in fifth-gear here,pun apt and somewhat intended)has wanted to ""go fast"" and ""be first"" practically his whole life. He's born to a race-car driving daddy(GAry Cole,who's fantastic here)and,in fact,he is actually given birth to IN the car his daddy is racing to get his mama to get to the hospital. So to say racing is in his blood would be somewhat of a polite understatement.<br/><br/>HIs meteoric rise to NASCAR stardom is one that starts as a pit crew member who fills in for the decidedly UN-successful driver who quits in the middle of a race to relieve himself(and get lunch,of course),races the team back to respectability,and then goes on to greatness himself,with the help of his loyal if perhaps dense buddy Cal Naughton Jr.(John C.Reilly,fantastic here!)and the steady leadership of his pit crew chief Lucius(Michael Clarke Duncan,game in the role). This nets Ricky,over time,a hot wife(Leslie Bibb,doing more than she has to here),two bratty sons(Houston Tumlin and Grayson Russell),more money than he probably ever really needed and the inflated head of someone who KNOWS he's successful. That all starts to tumble when a predatory,snotty French Formula One racer named Jean Girard(Sach Baron Cohen,doing one of ze moost outrageous Franch accents zees side of Monty Python!)steps onto Ricky's territory and is promptly brought on by the racing team for which Ricky is the star. After an accident that leads to a mental breakdown,Jean becomes the lead racer of the team. Soon,Ricky's world starts unraveling,and he finds himself in need of reconnecting to just what it was that made him the great race-car driver he was. He'll need the help of his no-nonsense mom(Jane Lynch,unrecognizable),his former assistant(Amy Adams,fetching and not a bit overpowering) and,of course,his delinquent dad,who seems to come and go in Ricky's life like the wind.<br/><br/>As was with Anchorman,Wedding Crashers and You,Me and Dupree,this is a comedy that sets you up for about an hour or so of raucous humor before then sticking' ya with the emotive,heartfelt sap. Director Adam McKay(who also was behind Anchorman)knows a formula that wins when he sees it,and this one does. Plenty of cultural sub-referencing(from celebrity cameos and music of the 70s and 80s)and reliable comic foils(Molly Shannon as the racing owner's wife,Andy Richter as Girard's husband,David Koechnner as one of Ricky's pit crew among them)in minor roles,added to Ferrell and Reilly's improv-to-script(Ferrell co-wrote this with McKAy) performing make this film an easy sell for people who've already bought into the ""Frat pack"" type of movie for summer. It,like previous Ferrell efforts have made me laugh out loud and hard on numerous occasions. And while I can understand(and even be put off by it to some degrees)the amount of mapped skill behind movies like this,I have to appreciate it for the kind of summer movie it is: a no-brainer that appeals to one's weirder,more base self.<br/><br/>Anyone who likes this type of film will not be disappointed,and those who find Ferrell's antics annoying can(And probably has)avoid it.And anybody who gets distracted by stupid stuff in movies like product placements can sit back and count the ad placements."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","5","0","3","29 June 2018"," It has a number of troubling issues but the most pertinent is this: it just isn't funny.
","'Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby (2006)' has a number of key problems that easily make it Adam McKay's worst effort. The first issue is that it's honestly pretty offensive, as it's genuinely quite homophobic, fairly sexist, a bit xenophobic and just generally seems to dislike the very people it should most clearly be aimed at. It finds some way of taking a low-blow at pretty much every conceivable group. These low-bows that don't seem satirical to the point that they would be mocking the very idea of their inclusion - which would be the only way they could actually work and, thus, be somewhat excusable. If these dodgy jokes were used as a way to shine a light on how ridiculous the specific attitudes they highlight are, the flick could've lampooned its closed-minded characters and also taken a stance that allowed it to examine why they think the way they do, before developing them so that they become more tolerant and the overall piece can take on an ultimately inclusive tone with at least a half-decent message. The film doesn't do that, though. Not even close. Perhaps the problems were unbeknownst to those behind the camera. The jokes might've just been haphazardly thrown in without any thought to their possibly harmful nature. This leads to, or is perhaps a product of, a careless and callous kind of comedy, one that does occasionally feel a tad mean-spirited. The second main issue is an incredibly poor, almost non-existent, structure that makes the entire movie feel more like a string of improvised jokes than a proper narrative. It is very difficult to become engaged with the 'plot' at any point because of this. The piece also feels incredibly long. Another big problem is the fact that the characters are all either too blatantly unlikable or straight-up stupid - usually a combination of the two - to care about at all. This means you can never be invested in anything that happens to any of them and that the weak 'redemption' arc feels even more unearned than it would've if it were just poorly done. The final flaw is that it isn't actually all that funny, either, giving me maybe two chuckles (and I do only mean short, one-breath chuckles) in its entirety. I will say that the more irreverent, light-hearted and good-natured jokes tend to be the ones that land. In its more absurdist moments, or even its more on-point satirical ones, there is some potential. I can't say that I particularly enjoyed the piece, though, and I certainly wasn't entertained. Also, that French accent is perhaps the worst I've ever heard. 5/10"

","Ferrell stars as a dim-witted NASCAR driver with an over-inflated ego whose mantra of ""if you're not first, you're last"" takes a pounding when his co-driver (Reilly) goes out on his own and steals his barbie-doll wife (Pressly) in the process. Through a series of character defining encounters, including re-acquainting with his long estranged, loser father (Cole) he eventually discovers that winning isn't the only formula to success.<br/><br/>Ferrell's character is a likable guy whose bravado is pumped-up on the belief of others, fair-weathered friends keen to take advantage of residual benefits from his hard-won success. Pressly's bimbo sponge-wife, is a great introduction, perhaps foreshadowing the role she'd go on to play in the TV series ""My Name is Earl"". Sacha Baron Cohen has an eccentric role as a conniving, European race nemesis, in the mould of the villain from the Herbie pictures, but played with his trademark irreverence (""Come, walk with me Ricky Bobby. Do not be alarmed that I appear to have an erection"").<br/><br/>What distinguishes this one from its peers is the very witty script, loaded with memorable one-liners delivered with precision timing by the cast, perhaps most notably Ferrell's precocious, foul-mouthed progeny (""I'm gonna scissor-kick you in the head"" yells one aggressively at his frail grand-father at the dinner table). NASCAR and Ferrell fans should rejoice, this is a triumph that in my humble opinion, eclipses even Ron Burgundy's story. And that's saying something."

","I knew this film was about racing, and I knew the two lead stars, and then I found out it was about NASCAR (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) which I had heard of in Top Gear, so I was certainly going to try it. Basically Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) started as a replacement for a professional driver, but with his first time being so successful, his career as a racing sensation continued, and he goes on to win many more races. He and friend since childhood Cal Naughton Jr. (Chicago's John C. Reilly), calling each other ""Shake"" and ""Bake"", have a loyalty to each other to win every race and once in a while change from 1st and 2nd places, but Cal has always come 2nd. It is when flamboyant gay French Formula One driver Jean Girard (Borat's Sacha Baron Cohen) shows up challenging them that they must fight for their right to stay top of leader board. The biggest NASCAR race of all comes along, Talladega, and Ricky is determined to beat Jean, but in the end, with both getting out of their cars they are disqualified, and Cal finally wins a race. Also starring Gary Cole as Reese Bobby, The Green Mile's Michael Clarke Duncan as Lucius Washington, Leslie Bibb as Carley Bobby, Jane Lynch as Lucy Bobby, Amy Adams as Susan, Andy Richter as Gregory, The Grinch's Molly Shannon as Mrs. Dennit, Greg Germann as Larry Dennit Jr., Jack McBrayer as Glenn, Ian Roberts as Kyle, Houston Tumlin as Walker, Pat Hingle as Mr. Dennit Sr., Elvis Costello and Mos Def. There is the odd giggle or two in places, mostly coming from Cohen's ridiculous French accent (it's not even that good), but it doesn't have enough laughs, and the story isn't exactly engaging, it just gets a bit boring after a while, so I can't see myself watching it again.

","As a child, Ricky Bobby was heavily influenced by the ""second is nothing"" mantra of his amateur race driver and regular absentee father. As an adult he is working as one of the pit crew for the worst team in NASCAR when he gets the chance to drive and marks himself out with his determination and drive to win. Replacing the regular driver, Bobby starts to dominate the sport and quickly finds himself on top of the NASCAR world. However when a French formula 1 champion joins the sport, Bobby finds himself not only having to come to terms with a competitor but also the injury and trauma associated with a massive crash.<br/><br/>Having enjoyed some similar comedies recently so although I never made it to the cinema, I did want to check out Talladega Nights on DVD in the hope of good laughs in a silly sports movie. The thing is, conceptually it is all well and good, delivering a silly concept with a wonderfully absurd load of dialogue to match the characters. On paper (and in the clips) it looked great and here and there it did produce the odd laugh from me. Problem is, in the delivery it is not as funny as I would have liked. It is amusing though and I did enjoy the way it affectionately digs at the very male and American sport of Nascar (does any other country in the world actually care about it?) in the characters and the dialogue.<br/><br/>The big budget allows for plenty of car action but, with me caring so little about the sport, it was not really that engaging even if it was noisy. Personally I would have preferred a lot more work to have gone into the script rather than the action because maybe it could have just been a bit funnier. The cast are mostly good though and it did make me think that they could have done more with the material if it had been stronger. Ferrell is pretty good and enjoys his character but mostly he is outdone by a great performance from Reilly. Support is good from Duncan, Cole and others, but Tumlin and Russell caught my eye with two tremendously foul-mouthed characters. Cohen is part of the wonderful silliness that the film wears as a strength and I really enjoyed his brief turn here.<br/><br/>Overall then, consistently amusing rather than as funny as it should been. The cast do well even if the material doesn't let them be the best they could have been. Silly stuff then but reasonably enjoyable if you are in an undemanding mood."

","Continuing in review of some of the movies that amazingly did not show up at the AcademyÂ—I mean who watches movies like The Queen, Letters from Iwo Jima, or The Departed, anyway?Â—I thought the story of Ricky Bobby warranted an evaluation. <br/><br/>Was the effort modest or feeble? Who knows? But I have to say up front Ferrell movies (e.g. Old School and Anchorman) have the same look and feel of one another. (The first few Adam Sandler movies are like that, too: basically cookie-cutter juvenile gross-out escapades that contain possibly two genuinely comic scenes among them.) <br/><br/>And gross they do! I'm not sure what Ferrell's box office is, compared to, say, George Clooney's movies, but I'll bet it's on the order of viewership of professional wrestling compared to girls' basketball.<br/><br/>Popularity is no reason to hold anything against someone, Ferrell included. In this movie he teams up with Adam McKay of Ron Burgundy, Anchorman, fame to tell the story of a boy who has racing in his blood and lives to fulfill his father's motto: ""If you're not first, you're last.""<br/><br/>The first scene conveys the delivery of young Ricky Bobby. While his mother is in labor in the back seat, his dad, Reese (Gary Cole), pops the clutch in his Chevelle Super Sport to pop out the kid. Qua plot, that's more or less a high point.<br/><br/>Ricky grows up, becomes lifelong friends with Cal Naughton, Jr. (Reilly), busts out in NASCAR, acquires a hot bimbo wife (Bibb) and all the toys, meets his nemesis Jean Girard (a gay, French Formula-1 driver played to wretched excess by Sacha Cohen of Ali G and Borat fame), endures a period of loss, and emerges triumphant... as his newly reunited family and true-love girlfriend Susan (Adams) ride off to Applebee's for Sunday dinner. <br/><br/>Ferrell leaves no redneck good ol' boy stereotype unturned. In a couple of scenes Bobby makes the common man's case for basic American values as George Bush might, though more articulately. And as satire Talladega breaks new ground in spots: <br/><br/>His wife has just finished slaving over a grand luncheon of Taco Bell, pizza, and Kentucky Fried. Ricky says a long grace to the ""little baby Jesus,"" which elicits an argument from his wife that Ricky should be praying to the adult Jesus. This leads to an intellectual free-for-all around the table on the proper image of the Lord and Savior. <br/><br/>Well, okay, it isn't very funny, but can't you imagine some innocent yokels having an argument like that. There are quite a few good moments, and my favorite funny scenes involve Gary Cole as Ricky's dad.

In this affectionate and comical tribute to all things NASCAR, Will Ferrell plays a premiere racer who loses all his self-confidence when a hotshot driver from France (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) challenges his supremacy on the track.<br/><br/>At first the humor is strictly strained slapstick, too tame to be genuinely satirical and too vulgar to be anything but lowbrow, but long about the halfway point, Farrell and director Adam McKay's screenplay suddenly hits the right combination of amiable quirkiness and sweet-natured sentiment and the movie cruises along to the finish line.<br/><br/>More than anything else, the success of the film lies in its performances, which are uniformly endearing and high-spirited. Beyond Ferrell and Boren, there's a great deal of fun to be had from the likes of John C. Reilly, Michael Clark Duncan, Molly Shannon, Gary Cole, and Leslie Bibb, among others, all of whom slide into their roles with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of comic talent.

It's not clever. It's not intelligent. It IS funny, in the base, crass, gutter kind of way most of the world will expect of the American Redneck way of life. There are no surprises, few effects.<br/><br/>It IS tragically funny. The character of Rick Bobby, his life, his marriage, his career, and everything surrounding him is a train wreck that you just have to watch until it slams into the wall of Life and self-destructs into a million pieces...In that respect, this movie does not disappoint.<br/><br/>It rates a 6.6/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"abulletaway","8","0","1","16 March 2007"," I loved it...
","I watched this movie the first time alone. My opinion of it at that time was that it was just OK. However, the following weekend I watched it again, this time with my kids because I knew they would love it, my son 15 and my daughter 14 next month and my parents. We laughed so hard at this movie. Some of the dialog is just priceless. The kids, Walker and Texas Ranger. Yes they had foul mouths but they but they learn something by the end of the film. But what made it so funny was not only the fact that what they were saying was priceless but that Ricky Bobby and their mother had no problem with it. They encouraged it so the kids didn't know they were bad. They just didn't know any different until Grandma shows up. The baby Jesus grace, the ""Help me Tom Cruise! Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft on me to get the fire off me!"" It's that kind of crazy talk that runs from the beginning to end of this movie.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so funny is the dialog. It was refreshing and it would seem that the actors were given a lot of room to try different takes on what to say as shown by all the special features. I am not going to say that this is the funniest movie of all time. But, if you're in a good mood and just want to laugh a bit you will probably enjoy this film a great deal. My parents who don't find Will Ferrell all that amusing couldn't help but be amused at his performance in this film as much as I was. Simply put it's just a fun movie."
"Robert_Hearth","7","0","1","4 March 2007"," ""I'm Going Fast Again!"" Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell)
","""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Adam McKay <br/><br/>Starring: Will Ferrell, Sacha Baron Cohen, John C. Reilly, Gary Cole, Jane Lynch, Leslie Bibb, David Koechner, & Amy Adams <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""Unrated"" (for crude and sexual humor, language, drug references and brief comic violence) <br/><br/>***PLEASE NOTE: This Is A Review Of The ""Unrated"" Version Of The Movie*** <br/><br/>When ""Napoleon Dynamite"" first came out, I thought it was very funny movie that worked very well due its quirky comments and bitter humor. It was a creative, original comedy. Then, suddenly, everyone and their cousin began to quote lines from the movie. I can't tell you how many times I heard ""I told you! I spent it with my uncle in Alaska hunting wolverines!"" The movie came out in 2004 and I have just now gotten where I can watch it again and find it to be humorous. When a movie is repeated over and over again, eventually, it gets old. I expected the same thing with ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby""Â…but I got a bit of a surprise. Instead of my friends repeating quotes from the movie over and over, it was Will Ferrell who played against his own movie. He constantly appeared in public in character, making appearances in various award shows and interviews. By the time I finally saw the movie, Ricky Bobby had gotten old. It would take a very good movie to entertain me after I had gotten so bored with the character and, fortunately, ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" was good enough to provide a fun time. Had Will Ferrell let the movie speak for itself instead of pushing his character in our face almost constantly, ""Talladega Nights"" would have probably been one of the best comedies of the year.<br/><br/>Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) has only had one goal his entire life and that is to go fastÂ…very fast. As a member of the pit crew for a professional racer, Ricky finally gets the chance he has always been waiting for when the racer decides that lunch is more important than racing. Ricky gets to take over the wheel of the car and, when things go very well, Ricky becomes a pro racer. But when a gay French racer named Jean Girard (Cohen) makes his way up the ladder and challenges Ricky, Ricky's talent is put to the ultimate test. At the same time, Ricky's best friend, Cal Naughton Jr. begins a relationship with Ricky's wife, Carley Bobby (Bibb) and Ricky's deadbeat father, Reese (Cole), comes back into his life.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is one of the funniest men working today and has always had a history of crafting interesting and colorful characters, from Ron Burgundy to Buddy the Elf. Ricky Bobby is his latest creations and one of his funniest. He does a great job with the role, but, as I said, he overworked it outside of the movie. As he stated in song at the Academy Awards, John C. Reilly has been able to make a transition between stark dramas and wild comedies. Reilly is a very talented man and gives a more subdued performance here. He was still over-the-top, but he managed to calm Ferrell's performance down a little. Had he not been present, I think the movie would have been a little grating. Sacha Baron Cohen exploded in 2006, mostly due to bringing his character of Borat to the big screen. However, he also gives a very funny performance here. He is just a very versatile actor.<br/><br/>""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" was shoved in our faces from the time production ended and, frankly, I was tired of it before I even saw the movie. But, judging a movie by its promotion is not fair and, as a reviewer, I won't do it. But, I will still hold the people responsible accountable. Do not overplay your own movie. Don't push it at the audience every time you get an audience. It hurts the movie. However, the movie does hurt itself. The characters, especially Ricky Bobby and his wife, become increasingly annoying as the movie progresses. I was shocked at just how unlikable they got. The romance between Ricky Bobby and Susan (Adams) feels a little rushed and just didn't do enough to seem realistic. But, overall, ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" works well enough at being a surprisingly funny and easy watch. Will Ferrell proves yet again that he is hilarious and Sacha Baron Cohen shows that he is not a one hit wander. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when I judged it based on itself, though I wish that Ferrell had calmed down a little with the promotion.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" is a funny movie that has a colorful cast of characters.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)"
"chrichtonsworld","8","0","3","4 February 2007"," Extremely funny movie
","From the title I couldn't make out what the movie was about! Then I saw the trailer that it was about nascar racing! Is this going to be funny? Well yeah! It is extremely funny! From the start till end this movie delivers! Will Ferrel is great as ""Ricky Bobby"" the man who never loses! Until he does! And when he does it goes downhill from there! And who will help him! The father who was never there ""Gary Cole""! ""Gary Cole"" is a very underestimated actor! He gives this movie the special edge it needs! He can portray an attitude where he is cool and a bastard at the same time. Not many actors can pull that off! The contrast of this kind of acting can be seen at the scene where ""Ricky Bobby's family and friend eat dinner where they are all obnoxious and think they own the world. The very arrogant ""Ricky"" shouts at his father in law and is not sympathetic at all. ""Ricky's father (Gary Cole) however is always likable whatever he does! If you are interested try to see ""American Gothic! In this series ""Gary Cole"" is in top form! Another actor I have to mention who makes this movie is Sasha Cohen (known as ""Ali G"" and ""Borat"")! He parodies a top formula one driver who of course is the best in his class and challenges ""Ricky Bobby""! Nice detail that Sasha made his character gay! I think this is a typical Sasha Cohen stunt in order to make a point! With all these funny characters this movie can not go wrong. Even the race car scenes are top notch and exciting! I promise you, you will laugh your head off!"

","I think this is Will Ferrell's best comedy. There are many good jokes, and some touching moments. (There were some moments which are openly non-straight which I found pointless.) Overall this is just plain funny. I laughed several times unexpectedly which suggests that there was some originality involved with the script.<br/><br/>I loved Gary Cole who played Reese Bobby to a ""T"" - perfectly. It was a personal pleasure for me b/c the only other movie I have seen him in (which he did flawlessly) was ""Office Space."" He did ""Reese"" so well that I didn't recognize him in his opening scene.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly as ""Ricky Bobby's"" best friend was utterly convincing throughout the movie. I kept thinking, ""can he be that stupid?"" then had to realize he was only acting - great job.<br/><br/>Michael Clarke Duncan? He can do anything and he is ***ALWAYS*** a joy and a pleasure to watch on the big screen. I wish I was a producer - he'd be in every movie I ever made!<br/><br/>Finally, the racing scenes: I don't watch NASCAR, but to me the racing scenes were very well done and completely believable. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>-LD<br/><br/>PS: the continual reference to Christ as if He is an object of comedy was disappointing, but I have learned that the non-believing world use His name however they like ... just as *I* use to when I was a non-believer.

","Some movies which have high ratings of PG-13 and R are acceptable to watch with your kids if you have good communication between you: parents likely are best at knowing what their individual kids can handle seeing. This movie is not for the faint of heart. The humor is quite low-brow. Anyone with ""gay"" issues will not want to see this one. The Formula One driver who invades NASCAR in order to be ""defeated"" by someone worthy is quite gay. Anyone who has issues with irreverent humor will also have trouble with this one. The reason I'm giving this movie a 7 instead of a LOWER score is the script really is well done. Will Ferrell does a great job playing a redneck, white trash (I'm Southern, so don't get your hackles up if you're offended by this description) NASCAR driver. I love the attitude that comes across when Ricky Bobby and his family spout their philosophies on love, dating, racing, religion, family and friendship. I guarantee I've been unlucky enough to be around people just like Ricky Bobby and his family. Whoever wrote the script has to have been in the South a lot. Very insightful, even if it does make rednecks look bad. (What redneck needs help with that?) Anyhow, laugh-out-loud funny, but definitely not something you'd want to watch with your kids. Unless, of course, you espouse the philosophies so freely given by Ricky Bobby and his crowd. Shake and Bake, buddy!"

","As with most comedies these days, i went in expecting a few decent gags and that was it.

Bobby and Naughton Jnr have been best mates for life and together achieve their dream of racing together in Nascar. They do anything to help each other..... as long as Bobby wins. Their lives get turned upside down when Bobby has a crash that freaks him out and damages his confidence behind the wheel. Will Bobby get back to the top? Will Naughton Jnr step out of Bobby's shadow? <br/><br/>The humour is kind of what you'd expect from Ferrell, but I liked the style a lot more in this movie than ""Anchorman"".

I laughed so loud on the plane other passengers looked at me like I'd lost my mind! If you just tell yourself that it's a comedy and enjoy it for that, you'll get a kick out of it.

"DeadSetMisawa","6","0","1","12 December 2006"," Could Have Been Great, Settle For Decent
","I think my opinion on this film may be a little biased, for one particular reason. I just don't think Will Ferrell is that funny. I think he is funny to the capacity where he is great at bit or supporting roles. For instance, I liked his character in Old School before he became the Tank again and reverted back to his old ADD ways that somehow got him fame on Saturday Night Live. So for me, I just don't and probably will never see him, as a great comic.<br/><br/>Having said that, there were parts in this movie that were incredibly funny, most of them involving other characters, specifically those of John C Reilly and Sacha Baron Cohen's. Oh there were parts where Mr. Bobby had some great lines or moments, but half the time he would inevitably stretch out the joke for another two or three minutes until you feel like yelling 'NEXT SCENE!'. Then again, I'm sure some people enjoy that style of his so this probably won't apply to you.<br/><br/>Still, these moments, thankfully, are made up for by the aforementioned supporting cast and by Ferrell keeping himself in check sometimes. Yes, he actually let's other people steal some scenes, which I didn't know he was capable of, but he did and it was very beneficial to the flow of the movie and establishment of certain characters. All in all, it's a good movie with some laughs to pass the time. If you enjoyed Anchorman, you will most likely enjoy this."
"oneloveall","5","0","2","8 December 2006"," Off target but still more creative then many laughers
","The over-hyped, over-marketed racing comedy featuring overdone, overvalued Will Ferrell immediately had a wrench thrown in it's spokes, if nothing but for the sheer pomposity of it's advertising, through the sheer arrogance of it's lead's bank-ability. Though far from a uninspired comedy, Talladega Nights does prove that Ricky Bobby is no Ron Burgundy. In their last collaboration, writer/director Adam Mckay and writer/star Ferrell displayed much more comfort, knowledge, and wit when versed in their 1970's news world farce Anchorman which, while just as self indulgent and lapsed in solidity as any ex-SNLer's post resume would predict, still knew itself and it's humor quite well. With cocky, oblivious hot-shot NASCAR pro Ricky Bobby, we see a much more stereotypical, lazy script that easily plays the moron cards and relies too heavily on Will Ferrell's lukewarm improvisational flights. In their pseudo-lovingly mapped tribute to all things white trash Americana, this ballad comes out a little imperceptive, insensitive, even condescending. What on paper seemed like a great comedic premise to mine turned out to play like a bunch of city boys poking fun at southern culture. Though the humor is decidedly derogatory, there does lie a heart inside this crude cartoon cut out, even if that is also an insincere one. What saved the movie from being poor, despite my low hard laugh to forced chuckle ratio, was the same mature scope that was to enhance Mr. Burgundy's shallow escapades so memorably. Highlighting the seldomly sharp dialog, breathes the unique racing setting, with a narrative arc that basically parallels the other R.B., creating another unique sub-genre comedy, only this time suffering greatly from a lack of character perspective, coupled with a willingness to succumb to the character-worshiping, mass-marketed whoredom that it mocks. Disappointingly, ha-ha mastermind Sacha Baron Cohen's underplayed performance pales to anything he saves for himself and does not help add much comedic dimension in an already questionable supporting cast. Although Ferrell and crew may be wearing out their comedic welcome, they will certainly conceptually fight it until the end."
"saywardstudio","6","0","1","6 December 2006"," Advertising at it's best....or worst
","While I watched this movie and found it somewhat endearing (Ricky's mother helping him out, the Dad coming back into his life, Grandma straightening out the kids,etc...) I found the movie grating at the same time. The product placements throughout the movie seemed a bit overwhelming. It's weird, if you think about it, we don't cover up our soda bottles and pizza boxes and stuff at home, and the scenes where some of the worst 'advertising' was done was at home, so that made it seem real, but the constant referring to almost every brand, and, later in the movie,Applebees (complete with in race commercial.) It was just weird. That was, I think, my personal biggest gripe. LOL!<br/><br/>I think the way the kids were at the beginning was absolutely atrocious...but they turn around in the end. What raked my nerves was that Ricky was so involved in his fantasy land he was forgetting what was important.... all he cared about was winning and being #1. That was grating, too. I, too, found myself hoping he would lose a race-- and then everything sort of gets ruined for him. The ending was nothing like I had imagined, I figured, once he was down he would come back with the proverbial win at the end- not so, and I found that refreshing. I wasn't expecting him to kiss the French guy, either. <br/><br/>My review is starting to be like the movie...jumping from one subject to another... but, in a nutshell, obnoxious as it may be, it's alright. Go check it out."
"reverendtom","7","0","1","5 December 2006"," Good, not great Farrell outing
","I had extremely high expectations for this film, as ""Anchorman"", by the same creative team, is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The final product is funny, yes, but not nearly as funny as ""Anchorman"". Ferrell seems a little flat here, which may be on-purpose, as his character is supposed to be a dimwit. The insane comedic talent of some of his earlier work is peculiarly missing from most of his performance. The real standouts are his best friend, the father, and of course, the great Sasha Baron Cohen as the French racer. They really shine with this material, whereas Ferrell was just okay. The endless product placement might have been meant as a parody of the product placement in NASCAR, but was kind of just annoying in the context of film. Again, a funny film in its own right, but definitely seemed to lack something."

","Don't get me wrong, this movie is worth watching. But it really isn't worth watching a second time. A lot more smiles or chuckles than outright laughs for me.<br/><br/>Ricky Bobby is definitely no Ron Burgundy. This film lacks the biting wit that made Ron Burgundy such a treat. Instead of a wicked satire it is merely sophomoric. It also lacks a worthy foil for Will Ferrell. Sacha Baron Cohen is disappointing to say the least. I just didn't find him very funny at all. John C. Reilly isn't bad but his character is really just too one dimensional for him to do much with it. The 2 ""love interests"" really weren't there enough to leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>And what the heck is up with the ""unrated"" version on the DVD? There wasn't anything in there that couldn't be in a pg13 that I could see.

","Ricky Bobby was born ""to go fast"". He was born in the back seat of his race car driving father's car in the fictional town of West River, North Carolina. He was raised by his mother Lucy Bobby. Reese Bobby, his alcoholic, pot-dealing father, wasn't around. One morning, while his mother was at the grocery store, Ricky climbed into the driver's seat and, using a wiffleball bat to press the pedals, took his mama's station wagon on a high-speed joy ride.<br/><br/>After ten years, Ricky finally met his father when he showed up for career day at Ricky's school. He told Ricky, ""If you ain't first, you're last"", a motto that stuck with Ricky for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Ricky Bobby never outgrew his love of racing. While working on a pit crew as the jackman for a race team, he replaces an uninterested driver named Terry Cheveaux and ends up finishing third in the race. Ricky soars to the top of NASCAR very quickly, achieving both fame and fortune with his ride at Dennit Racing. He is able to get a ride for best friend Cal, who he uses as the starter of a slingshot move which lets him pass cars easily. His pit crew consists of crew chief Lucius Washington, Glenn, who constantly annoys Ricky and Lucius, Kyle, who thinks that jazz music sounds like ""a tape of somethin' dyin' or something"" and Hershell, a stocky, balding fellow who enjoys fried chicken.<br/><br/>While on top of the racing world, Ricky is challenged by a Formula One driver named Jean Girard, who ends up becoming Ricky's teammate. Girard is an effete gay Frenchman who reads the French existentialist novel The Stranger by Albert Camus and sips macchiato as he races.<br/><br/>Girard outperforms Ricky on the track and overtakes Ricky's #1 standing. Ricky, desperate to regain his dominance, pushes himself too hard and ends up in a horrible wreck. Though he eventually recovers from his crash, he loses his ride at Dennit Racing after a disastrous testing session. His wife, yearning to be married to a top NASCAR driver, divorces Ricky within three hours of his firing and marries Cal, whom Ricky refused to let come first in races.<br/><br/>Ricky moves back home with his mother and takes a job as a pizza delivery driver for Hugalo's Pizza. With his life at a low point, Ricky's father suddenly reenters his life. With the retraining and guidance of his father, Ricky gains his confidence back, but still refuses to race after Reese walks out - and then confesses that he was high when he told Ricky's class ""If you ain't first, you're last!"". Ricky then runs into his former assistant, Susan, at a bar. Susan convinces Ricky to get back into racing at the Talladega 500. Susan then professes her love for Ricky, and they end up having sex in the bar, as Ricky warns the other customers to look away, because ""we're gonna start making animal noises"". Ricky later meets with Jean Girard, who is having tea with Mos Def and Elvis Costello. Girard confesses that he wants to retire to Stockholm with his husband Gregory to ""design a currency for dogs and cats to use"", but before he does, he wants Ricky to beat him. However, he refuses to let Ricky win. Ricky returns to the track and tells Cal he's sorry for always making him come in second.<br/><br/>Despite being un sponsored, underfunded, and starting last, Ricky quickly climbs through the field and passes Cal, moving into second place behind Girard. As Ricky unsuccessfully attempts to pass Girard, his former owner orders Cal to wreck Ricky. Cal refuses, and does the traditional slingshot move to get Ricky side by side with Girard. Larry Dennit, Jr., the owner of Girard and Naughton's cars, orders his third driver, Bryan Waynecrest (who replaced Ricky in the Wonder Bread car), to wreck Cal. The ensuing wreck destroys the rest of the field, leaving only Ricky Bobby and Jean Girard. On the final lap, the two drivers slam into each other numerous times, until they both have a long, spectacular wreck in the tri-oval. So long, in fact, that the race goes to a commercial for Applebee's while the wreck is still taking place. The race's broadcasters, seeming disinterested, declare the race over.<br/><br/>However, Girard and Ricky both get out of their cars and race on foot to the checkered flag, to the tune of Pat Benatar's ""We Belong"". They both dramatically dive for the finish line. Ricky's fingers cross the line, while Girard comes up a bit short. Girard wishes to shake Ricky's hand, but Ricky kisses him passionately instead. Both drivers are disqualified for leaving their cars during the race and Cal wins the race by finishing third. Ricky and Cal make up, again. Reese watches from the distance, and walks away, satisfied. The family, including Susan, Ricky's new ""lady"", meets Reese in the parking lot, and all climb into his old Chevelle to go get thrown out of Applebee's."

Although, I just could not manage to laugh whenever his ill-mannered sons (aptly named Walker and Texas Ranger!) sass at their grandfather. Especially during the scene where their family was having a thanksgiving meal and Ricky Bobby defends his children for talking really rudely to their shocked grandfather, and this makes Mrs. Bobby (Leslie Bibb) hot for her hubby and they make out real bad on top of the table in front of their family.<br/><br/>But that aside, this movie has a lot of funny moments, like when Ricky Bobby sticks a knife in his thigh and when he verbally spars with his French competitor Jean Girard (played by the hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen/Ali G). The rest of the cast amply support their larger-than-life lead. Worth noting is John C. Reilly, who plays Bobby's best friend and forever wingman Cal. He was probably playing himself, having been successfully portraying the average Joe forever that no one quite remembers, as he transforms himself very well into any character he plays."

I enjoyed Old School somewhat although I thought it was infantile at some points and pretty predictable.<br/><br/>This one seems to be a different breed. It only pretends to be stupid. You get some social commentary, people dealing with emotional hang-ups with more depth than most comedies, but not nauseating in an Oprah-esquire way.<br/><br/>The unconventional opening already takes out of garden-variety comedy territory. It almost seems to follow Joseph Campbell's Hero Journey motif which got a lot of press thanks to Star Wars, Indiana Jones etc. Unusual Birth, estranged from father, impressive achievements at an early age, meteoric rise to fame and the like.<br/><br/>But, actually, it all feels pretty natural. If you buy into Campbell's notion of hard-coded archetypes in the psyche, then it at least feels like the script for this movie came out of someone's natural creativity, and not a paint-by-numbers attempt to cash in on the Hero's Journey as a formula.<br/><br/>Most people care about the comedy, and I laughed plenty of times. Many jokes fell flat, but there was always something funny just around the corner. That's just the way it has to be, because there's something about Will Farrel's humor, some extreme ADD quality that makes it beyond random. It's only one step from the ridiculous to the sublime.<br/><br/>The ending provides closure without completely selling out and being afraid to send anyone 100% satisfied.

I suppose that the Anchorman team had to deal with high expectations but I believe they flunked here, by forgetting to crank up the insanity that made their previous efforts so good. There are some good laughs, but too few and far between and most of the best parts already made it to the trailer.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, every one is pretty much comfy and in character, except for Sacha Baron Cohen, who despite being amazing as a Kazakh, does not deliver the gay Frenchman very well. That may be to his credit, but it still makes his parts surprisingly boring, considering that at first glance at least, a gay Frenchman in NASCAR should be a rather fertile background.<br/><br/>There's not much here to warrant a theater outing or purchasing the DVD. A rental may be particularly interesting in a pre-frat-party context, where copious amounts of various legal intoxicants were not forgotten. On an empty stomach and a well rested mind, this fell rather flat.<br/><br/>Everyone but Sacha Baron Cohen - 7/10 - Pretty Decent.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen (Jean Girard) - 3/10 - Sacha, start studying some gay Frenchman's behavior, mannerism and accent for the sequel. There should not be a lack of potential test subjects."

"DICK STEEL","7","0","2","8 October 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby
","At one glance, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (what a mouthful) is surely the live-action version of this summer's Cars, with its setting in NASCAR racing, the drive (pardon the pun) to be number one on the race track, and its storyline in finding out what truly matters in life besides the race (oops, another pun) to the top.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell plays the title character Ricky Bobby, born in the backseat of his speed demon father's racer. A stroke of luck sees him transformed from pit stop crew to the #1 driver in NASCAR, living life from a philosophy imparted from his dad, that if you ain't first, you're last. Fame and wealth come rolling in, until one day a French F1 driver, Jean Girrard (Sacha Baron Cohen) arrives on the race circuit scene and threatens to take over the top dog spot.<br/><br/>The movie is split into equal portions between Ricky Bobby's meteoric rise to fame, which allowed for plenty of laughs, while the latter half is filled with relatively slower moments in regaining confidence after a Days of Thunder-ish event. One scene which truly cracked me up is the one in the hospital - it came out from out of the blue, and tickled me so hard that tears just rolled uncontrollably. The other scene which was as interesting, was one over the dinner table, although it did feel a little stretched out and could be shortened for pacing's sake. But despite the number of sight gags, and witty lines, the jokes here felt a little unevenly spread, which also meant that some of them did fall flat or get repetitive.<br/><br/>What lifted the movie is the support from the secondary casts, with John C Reilly playing Ricky Bobby's wingman and best friend Cal, Michael Clarke Duncan as the race / pit stop manager, and the kids who played Ricky's sons, who surprisingly got the best of the crude one liners, and actually had some form of character development. Sacha Baron Cohen, of Ali G and Borat fame, hams it up with his fake thick French accent and mannerisms - a pity that he doesn't get more screen time as the prime villain.<br/><br/>There are some cuts in the movie given that its PG rating here - censored out were the gay bits, and gay kissing, which jarred the movie though it wasn't missed. What surprised me when watching this movie right after You, Me and Dupree, was the similarities in themes, characters and scenes. We have the same issues with the best friend, a main character who doesn't appreciate nor is contended with what he has, taking things for granted, the father character playing a significant role, as well as ""Career Day"".<br/><br/>Stay tuned right up until after the end credits roll for a small scene, which also had similarities to You, Me and Dupree's, in having a book feature in the scene."
"Donatien3","8","0","1","7 October 2006"," Ricky Bobby delivers big laughs
","When a movie has the pedigree of director Adam McKay (Anchorman, Forty-Year-Old-Virgin), and actors Will Ferrell (Anchorman, Old School), John C. Reilly (Chicago), Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G) and Michael Clarke Duncan (Daredevil, The Green Mile), expectations will be high. Fortunately, ""Talladega Nights: the ballad of Ricky Bobby"", lives up the the pedigree, offering plenty of laughs. Ferrell plays the titular character, a big-hearted (and big-headed) NASCAR driver who lives life by his daddy's words; ""If you're not first, you're last."". After starting life in the pit crew - led by Lucius Washington (Duncan)- Bobby's philosophy helped him become the greatest NASCAR driver in the south, much to the joy of his controlling trophy wife Carley (Leslie Bibb) and his two foul-mouthed kids. Bobby also isn't afraid to bow to the whim of commercialism - putting sponsorship on his Winfield, and fulfilling a contractual obligation to mention Powerade when saying grace).<br/><br/>Aiding his cause is his best buddy Cal Naughton Jr (O' Reilly), who selflessly lets Bobby win, then celebrates with their trademark cry ""shake n' bake"". But their peaceful redneck existence (which includes fancy meals of Dominoes pizza, KFC and Taco Bell) is interrupted by the arrival of Jean Girrard (Cohen, with a ridiculous accent), a gay, French Formula One driver, who declares his intentions to usurp Bobby. After a horrible crash, Bobby goes into a mental breakdown, believing he's paraylsed (culminating in a hilarious scene involving a knife and Ferrel's leg, which rivals the ""hot wax"" scene from ""Forty-Year-Old-Virgin"" as the most cringe-inducingly hilarious moment). Following a failed comeback in a time trail, Bobby's life hits the skids. Carley leaves him for Cal, he's fired by his crew, is forced to move in with his mother, and takes an inglorious pizza delivery job. It's while working that he rediscovers his dad, Reese (Gary Cole) who abandoned Bobby when he was ten. Sympathising with his son's plight, Reese offers to bring Bobby back to his former glory. Some of his unorthodox methods include forcing Bobby to drive with a hungry cougar, dousing him with buckets of water, and strapping a bag of drugs to his car and calling the cops. Eventually, Bobby gets his confidence back, finds a new admirer, and faces off with Jacques for the Talladega 500.<br/><br/>While the plot of Talladega may be ""paint-by-numbers"", that doesn't matter, as the whole point of the movie, and others of its ilk, is how many laughs it gets. Plenty abound, including the aforementioned knife scene, which also involves Lucius and Cal trying to dig it out. Not to mention the moments when a post-crash Bobby runs around in his underwear, convinced he's on fire - which happens again following the failed time trial - to his pit crew's confusion. The film relies a lot on Ferrell's goofy personality (the same seen in Old School and Anchorman), letting the other characters play around him. McKay also pokes fun at the redneck community, including their homophobic, xenophobic outlook, and love for fast food.<br/><br/>In summary, ""Talladega Nights"" runs on the same vein as ""Old School"", ""Anchorman."" or ""Forty-Year-Old Virgin"" Needless to say, if you loved those movies, and Ferrell himself, then ""Talladega Nights"" will be right down you alley."

He was ably assisted, and at times upstaged, by a great cast including John C Reilly, Sacha Baron Cohen and most notably Houston Tumblin and Grayson Russell as the title characters rambunctious sons, Walker and Texas Ranger.

"pandabat","5","0","2","25 September 2006"," Not Ferrell's best work
","Disappointed is probably the best word to sum up how I feel about this movie. Having already sat through the appalling Disney/Pixar vehicle, ""Cars"", earlier in the year, I was looking forward to an altogether better movie based around motor racing this time around. The trailer was good and much of Ferrell's other work has had me on the floor laughing. Alas, it was not to be and at 108 minutes, this film's about 25 minutes too long for what it has to offer. Of course, much of it has been ad-libbed (you can see the actors almost about to laugh at what's going on in several scenes) but I felt it strange that some of the funniest material, both in the trailer and in the end credits, did not make it into the movie itself, which certainly could've done with them. It's not that you won't laugh at what is there, it's just that what is there is a little thin on the ground and interspersed with scenes and shots that are too long and lingering to help the comedy but which also do not sit well in a movie with a tone as obviously farcical as this one's. Some of the jokes also rely too heavily on, how do I say this, conservative sensitivities and, while funny the first time, do feel jaded after a few airings. Ferrell and Reilly do reasonably well, even if their catchphrase is overdone by the end, but Sascha Baron-Cohen never really fits properly into his part. It's hard to put a finger on it but it's probably down to the character not being his own creation: he's not sitting in his own skin so to speak. I'm sure that the Borat movie will make amends for this. Let's hope that that's not yet another disappointment. As for Talladega Nights, well, it's probably best watched with your mates on TV/DVD after you've all had a few beers."
"Corky1984","Null","0","1","24 September 2006"," Hit and miss
","This movie is essentially a series of sketches and one-off jokes. Some work, some don't, but on the whole, this is likable, if instantly forgettable fun that will keep you entertained for a short while. Will Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a man who has taken Nascar by storm with his win-or-bust approach to racing. As he makes his millions and wins plenty of races, a challenger appears in the form of Sacha Baren Cohen, playing a gay French driver from Formula One. The two then battle for supremacy etc etc. The plot isn't really important to be honest. Certain set piece scenes were very funny, such as the shocked reaction of the sports commentators on finding out the Frenchman bats for the other side! Somewhere in this film there's a message about how wonderful it is to love your family blah blah blah, but ignore that and just enjoy the jokes. I have to say I'd much prefer to see proper coverage of the real Nascar here in England, but in the absence of that, I'll watch pretty much anything to do with it."

","Born in the back a car going over 100 miles per hour, Ricky Bobby has been a speed freak, with a creedal of ""I wanna go fast"", and ""If you ain't first, your last."" In a brief look at his childhood, Ricky wants speed and the love of his father. Jump to adulthood, Ricky Bobby works in the NASCAR pits. Soon Ricky is out of the pits and soon the number one driver of the circuit. Life friend Cal Naughton has always been loyal to Ricky, even to the expense of his career to boost Ricky's. With his ego running overdrive, Ricky hits a bump when French driver Jean Girrard, ruins Ricky's career and life.<br/><br/>Written by Will Farrell and Adam McKay, with McKay also as director, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, is a flashy NASCAR, without the grunt or muscle. Done by the same team as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights follows the same suit and style of comedy as Anchorman, but something is missing. While not finding Anchorman a brilliant comedy, it has its charm; and the amazing Steve Carell. The comedy is flat, running off overly drawn out jokes.<br/><br/>A prerequisite would be not to watch the trailer. All the good jokes were in there and knowing them before hand, left nothing good to laugh at. The chuckles are small and spread to far apart. There is fun to be had, spikes of humor come out of nowhere, but then drops back to flat-line.<br/><br/>Will Farrell shows what he's good at, and he is good. Not as outlandish as Ron Burgundy, Farrell puts a nice balance between Ricky's hubris and hollowness, and actually looks realistic during Ricky's downfall stage. John C. Reilly is also good as Cal, who sticks through thick and thin. Sacha Baron Cohen seriously, seriously, hams it up as Jean. The accent is stretch far beyond caricature, but ultimately works.<br/><br/>While there is some interesting sub text and playing on clichÃƒÂ©s on ignorant Americans, homosexuals and NASCAR scene, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, could do with a lot more kick to it."

","Anchorman was a genius piece of satirical comedy that literally had me crying with laughter. There were of course pieces of the film that were slap-sick and I enjoyed them, unfortunately Tala Nights was missing that element of satire and that for me is why it was so average.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it for what it was, an average no brainer comedy flick, but thats all it was. Ferrell seemed almost apologetic in his delivery of some of the more obviously crude lines. If you are expecting Anchorman on Nascar then you will be disappointed. However there were a few very funny lines, and I cannot say I wasted an hour and a half, its just a shame it did not live up to the high standards Anchorman set."

","""That was something else."" Those were the words I uttered as I left the theater. Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby was, indeed a strange, and unique film. It's the story of a none too bright man from the state of North Carolina and his passion for going really, really fast. His struggle against a rival from Froggyville (also known as France) and his no so real battle with a paraplegic condition. There's heartbreak, there's excitement, and last but not least COUGARS! The movie starts out with the birth a boy...a very special boy whose story would be told for generations on end...little baby Jesus. Wait, no...sorry. Got ahead of myself. No, it was the birth of little Bobby Ricky who was born in the back seat of a Camero (?). Thus, our story can continue. We see Mr. Bobby's childhood progress during the first few scenes/ whether it be stealing his mom's car or having his deadbeat dad show up for career day high as a kite in March in Chicago. It is during the situation with his father that his life motto is created: ""If you're not first, you're last"". That motto would carry him to one of the greatest career's in the history of stock car racing history; but, as they say ""The bigger they are, the harder they fall"" While his magical, but bizarre career was going wonderfully (He would always finish first and his best friend Cal Naughton, Jr. who was played by the Academy Award Nominated John C. Reily) The film's antagonist enters. A dastardly Frenchman named Jean Girrard, one of France's top formula one racers, comes to America to challenge Ricky Bobby (and, in the process of challenging him, breaks his arm like a twig). Though with a broken arm, Bobby accepts the challenge and they're both off to the races (literally). The races changes both of their lives drastically. For Girrard, he becomes a superstar for Bobby...well, he crashes and goes into obscurity. He loses his wife, his home, his best friend, and the little bit of sanity he had left. The only one who can save him is his deadbeat father Reese. Though you probably wouldn't believe it by my review, Ricky Bobby is a hilarious film. I suggest it to anyone with a sense of humor and a love for the random/stupid."

His past movies have felt like he started with some good plot lines and some awesomely memorable scenes but the films all get to points where the jokes and gags get weird and the script dries up in long stretches. The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is the one film in which Ferrell finally gets to string along some consistently funny scenes and keep you involved until the end of the movie. The casting was great! He risked getting upstaged by several characters (a role he's played in a couple other movies) but Ferrell maintains on-screen supremacy. John C.

A few years, and a 2-minute montage, later, Ricky Bobby is the #1 driver in all of NASCAR, complete with a hot wife, two wise-cracking children, a mansion, and a couple million dollars to spare. However, at the height of his career, a new French teammate, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, threatens to steal his glory and dethrone him as king of NASCAR.<br/><br/>Sure, the plot may come across as a bit bland (and, in all honesty, typical), but if anyone can make this work its Ferrell. Add in the brilliant comedic performances of John C. Reilly and Michael Clarke Duncan, and ""Talladega Nights"" will far surpass any expectations of mediocrity that you may have. In fact, there's not a whole lot not to love about this movie. Ferrell practically makes every scene he's in worth watching, and his character's often-dry quips will keep you chuckling consistently. The only thing that hurts this movie is Cohen's performance of a gay, French, Formula 1-turned-NASCAR driver. For once, he fails in portraying a foreign stereotype, largely because his portrayal of the character is so utterly obnoxious that you'll be begging for him to get off the screen. Even scenes in which he and Ferrell exchange humorous jabs fail, largely because of Cohen's presence. It is a potentially funny role, but Cohen makes it absolutely unbearable.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Talladega Nights"" succeeds not because of the plot, but the comedic performances of the majority of the cast, who, except Cohen, perfectly play their roles. Like most Will Ferrell movies, there is enough comedic material here to warrant repeat-views, and a DVD purchase. Hell, any movie that can reference ""Manimal"" and mention butt cheek-spreading can't be all that bad can it?<br/><br/>The answer is ""no.""<br/><br/>Directing: 4 out of 5 Stars Acting: 4 out of 5 Stars Writing: 5 out of 5 Stars Overall: 4 out of 5 Stars"
"JimD73","8","0","3","17 August 2006"," Ricky Bobby delivers the laughs with more efficiency and speed than Anchorman
","Is stupid always a bad thing? Not really. Just look at some movies like Billy Madison and Dumb and Dumber. By normal standards, those movies would be horrible, but they manage to be funny enough to become must-haves. Then there are the clever stupid movies, like Airplane and The Naked Gun, which are actually recognized by bigwig critics as classics. However, stupid usually is a bad thing. Plenty of dumb movies fall short, relying on terrible sight gags and offensive material to try to squeeze out a laugh. One of the more recent entries into the category of bad stupid movie is Anchorman, which surprisingly many critics liked. Well, I pretty much hated Anchorman, with Steve Carell being the saving grace. So, despite my misgivings for Anchorman, I went ahead and saw it's spiritual sequel, Talladega Nights. While it does have it's fair share of dead moments, Talladega is a much better movie than it's predecessor and guaranteed to be at least good for a laugh.<br/><br/>The plot of Talladega is much like you would expect from a movie co-written by Will Ferrell. It's simple and stupid, but does have some foundation. In fact, this movie actually does have a plot that is passable. It follows the life of Ricky Bobby (Ferrell), a pit crew member who gets to fill the shoes of his team's racer after he quits midrace. After catching up spectacularly and placing third, he is noticed by many corporate sponsors and becomes the NASCAR champ overnight. He marries racing bimbo Carley (Bibb), manages to get his best friend Cal (Reilly) as his sidekick driver and makes millions upon millions of dollars. After his career has hit a peak, he is challenged by French Formula One champion Jean Girard (Cohen) and ends up in a horrible wreck during the race which leaves him traumatized and afraid of speed. The rest of the movie is basically about the downward spiral his life runs and how his estranged father (Cole) returns to give Ricky his balls back.<br/><br/>Like Ron Burgundy in Anchorman, Ricky Bobby is a completely self-obsessed asshole who allows his kids to threaten the elderly and takes his friendship with Cal for granted. Unlike Burgundy, Ricky actually has a turning point, and that alone makes Talladega a better movie. While in Anchorman, Burgundy was always a total dick, Ricky Bobby actually manages to garner some sympathy, even if he is a little stupid, which actually gives the plot some substance, albeit very little. In short, it makes the movie easier to watch for those who appreciate something to string together the laughs.<br/><br/>Oh, and the laughs are plenty. While there are definitely some bits that flounder, such as basically any scene with Girard, there are plenty of chuckles and a solid amount of big laughs. The movie is definitely at its best when things are hectic, such as when Ricky stabs himself in the leg and his crew chief (Duncan) tries to use another knife to pry it out or the incredible sequence where Ricky re-trains with his father. The conversations in the movie are also so outlandish that they are hilarious, most notably one conversation debating whether or not to pray to Baby Jesus or the grown up one with a beard. There may not be something for everyone, but if you laughed at any time during the trailers, you're bound to find something enjoyable in Talladega.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast in the movie is pretty amazing. Will Ferrell is, as always, a lovable dumbass. No one can do blind panic humour like Will Ferrell, nor can anyone be so believably dumb. The supporting cast is full of Oscar-calibre actors such as John C. Reilly, Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan, as well as comedy standbys Molly Shannon, Gary Cole and Sacha Baron Cohen (better known as Ali G). Reilly is easily the standout from the supporting cast, stealing every scene he is in as Ferrell's even dumber sidekick. Gary Cole also turns in a hilarious performance as Ferrell's estranged father, especially during the training scenes. Duncan is also great, but he doesn't seem to have enough material to work with (though he does have one of the better outtakes at the end of the film). The only disappointment is Cohen as Girard. Sure, Cohen is game and plays the part well, but his scenes get a little dull and repetitive after a while.<br/><br/>As a side note, this movie is easily the most advertisement raped movie since The Island, and possibly even moreso. Granted, the film uses the ads as comedy for the most part, such as how Ricky Bobby is contractually obligated to mention PowerAde at each meal's grace, but it does seem excessive. At one point, a commercial for Applebee's is played in the middle of a crash sequence. Since it is NASCAR, most of it is making fun of the blatant advertising present (especially in one sequence where Ricky stars in a slew of commercials, the best being ""If you don't chew Big Red then f*** you!""), it still is a little too much.<br/><br/>All that Ricky Bobby ever wanted to do was to go fast. Well, this movie is definitely fast with delivery of gags that are much more hit than miss. Sure, the movie isn't without it's problems, but it is funny enough to make up for any missteps it takes, with a great cast to back it up. If you liked Anchorman, then you'll love Talladega. If you didn't like Anchorman, still give this one a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>86%"

","I was not expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did. As I reflected on it, I figured out why. This is broad comedy - but broad comedy written and performed by sophisticated people.<br/><br/>Every comic thread in the movie has a social critique behind it. Yes, the movie has more product placements than any movie ever made. But that is just a satire of NASCAR itself, where the cars and drivers are 100% laden with ads. Every square inch of a NASCAR race car has an ad on it - so every square inch of this movie has a product placement.<br/><br/>The movie lampoons the fascination with Applebees that seems to be a part of blue-collar culture in parts of the South (they could have used Olive Garden to the same effect), it lampoons the religious right (the grace scene is absolutely hilarious), and the ""invisible"" fire shtick is a comedic riff on something that actually does happen (albeit in Indy Car racing). Indy cars use ethanol fuel, which burns clear blue - very hard to see. Years ago I remember watching a race where the driver actually was on fire and hopping around, and the announcers were explaining that you can't see the burning ethanol on TV.<br/><br/>There is actually intelligent social commentary undergirding the jokes.<br/><br/>If you've never watched NASCAR or never spent time in the South, you might not get some of the jokes.<br/><br/>If you're a huge NASCAR fan, you might not realize when the movie is making fun of you and your friends (and you might not appreciate it when you do!) <br/><br/>But if you've watched enough NASCAR to know that you don't like it; if you think of NASCAR as professional wrestling on wheels (complete with ""bad guy"" and ""good guy"" drivers), you'll love this movie.<br/><br/>And if you stop to think about WHY the jokes were put in the movie, if you think about the social critique the movie is offering, you won't even have to feel guilty about having laughed as hard as you did!"

That's the whole play here is that it makes fun of NASCAR but only within the characters that play the parts. It is not a direct attack of NASCAR per se, but rather a silly little story of how dumb can one group of people be. I mean a GAY Frenchman racing in NASCAR?? NEVER! That is the absurdity of the kind of humor that this movie has.<br/><br/>Unlike all of Farrow's other movies, he is NOT allowed to go too far over the top. He sticks with the humor and the lines that were given to him. Some other comedy actor probably could have done just as well in the part as he did. Will Farrow carried the part as well as anyone else could have.<br/><br/>There were parts in this movie where the whole audience was practically rolling in the aisles.

There were a few lines that didn't go over as well as intended, but the laughs were strung out through the movie and if you see it with the right attitude, most people will enjoy it. This is not a movie to see if you pick everything apart or want to learn something, but if you just want to have fun and relax, the laughs come often. There is a scene that made us laugh so hard that we couldn't get our breath. Instruct your children beforehand that behavior seen in the movie is not acceptable for children, as the children's remarks go a bit overboard. There are a couple of slow spots, but they don't last long enough to visit the refreshment stand. Make sure that you stay for the outtakes at the end or you will miss some really funny stuff. Will Ferrell does an admirable job playing a crazy character in a movie that we would see again, just to be sure we didn't miss something because we were laughing.

"rgardner-6","7","0","3","14 August 2006"," Hilarious movie that transcends flaws (Minor spoilers)
","Criticizing Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby for its pretty, red-headed deus ex machina, plot holes, and the crimes of putting the best gags in the out-rake reel at the end is like beating a puppy.<br/><br/>No other comedy this year works harder (and stupider) to make you laugh. Will Ferrel is his clueless, awkward-honky best as Ricky Bobby, a race car driver who's lived his life by the adage ""If you aren't first, you're last."" His birth and early life are hilariously recounted in the beginning and segueway into a very funny scene of grace at Ricky's table.<br/><br/>Adding to the mayhem, is the cast of caricatures that surround Ricky. Gary Cole as his degenerate father is a boozy hoot, as are John Reilly as his dimwit teammate. Ferrel's wise-ass kids deliver their foulmouthed dialogue in the cutest Southern accents. <br/><br/>The movie cruises through its predictable riches to rags and back plot, but you don't notice because you're laughing too hard.<br/><br/>The dialogue was mostly improvised, and in every scene it's clear that they're about to burst with laughter. Will Ferrel and Sascha Baron Cohen had to work especially hard to avoid laughing. Look closely during their exchange at Cohen's character's house and you'll Cohen lose it just before the scene-shift.<br/><br/>None of the Frat-Pack (Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Jack Black, Jason Bateman, etc.) make an appearance--to the movie's benefit. The movie stays above the lameness of recent Frat Pack efforts (Envy, Starsky & Hutch, DodgeBall), and maintains an energy these movies don't come close to.<br/><br/>Now the nitpicking: Amy Adams' character appears out of nowhere to help Ricky Bobby at the end. Look closely for the pretty red-head in the beginning, so when she shows up at the end you won't be scratching your head.<br/><br/>Adams' absence highlights another weakness in the film: a lack of groundedness. OK, this movie isn't meant to be realistic and it isn't, but having a character or two that isn't a complete nut, if only for the need for a straightman, would have highlighted the jokes. Adams character, fleshed out, could have been this, but given little to do and missing for two-thirds of the movie, she isn't.<br/><br/>Also, some of the funniest parts appear in the outtakes. Some of them, clearly, couldn't be in the film, but others are funnier than what made the final cut.<br/><br/>If you like Will Ferrel's brand of comedy, you'll like this movie. If you don't, but suspect you might be able to converted, this will be the movie to do it."

","OK, so Will Ferrell is funny. I loved Anchorman. But this movie does not have the same magic. Talladega Nights is missing something. The improv was funny but only so because you know it's not written script (you can definitely tell when it's improv and when it's not). If you like Will Ferrell you will want to see this movie, and like me you'll probably be a bit disappointed. <br/><br/>The problem is that there were just SO many parts that were just begging for a laugh but were simply not funny. These long, drawn out comedic pauses where people are supposed to be laughing end up being met with an uncomfortable silence in the theater. These scenes shadowed the actually funny parts of the movie. The whole movie just seemed to be a disjointed bundle of some funny, some bad, some awkward, and some just completely unnecessary scenes. Also, some of the script in itself was just so bad(namely Ricky Bobby's sons' lines) that even some of the well-known actors(Molly Shannon and Michael Clarke Duncan) didn't know how to make it funny, and it showed. Put all that together and you get a somewhat funny but very forgettable movie. As a matter of fact, the outtakes at the end seemed to be the funniest part.<br/><br/>All that aside, I laughed many times, and so will you. It's also got an awesome soundtrack. This movie is strictly for the Will Ferrell and the NASCAR fans. For someone who enjoys neither, you will ""wanna go fast"" away from this movie."

There are times when the over-the-top acting gets a little old, but the cameos as well as the continuous humor help offset these incidences. Whoever the comedy writers were for this film really know how to get an audience laughing. You won't be disappointed if you are used to Will Ferrell movies, this lives up to some of his past films. Stereotypes also play a big role in this film, in a good way, but be prepared. And be VERY open minded going into it: you never know what Ricky Bobby is capable of!"

","Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is without a doubt the funniest film of 2006. If you liked Anchorman and The 40-Year-Old Virgin and seeing Will Ferrell play a silly Nascar driver sounds funny to you then you better rush out to the theater and check this one out. I haven't laughed this hard, or consistently since Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang; Talladega Nights is the one of the best rides of the summer. Will Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a superstar Nascar racer that fires up the race track winning race after race will the help of his trusty sidekick and long time best friend Cal Naughton, Jr., played well by John C. Reilly. The two are a dynamic duo in the race world and things seemed to going great, that is until a gay French Formula One racer named Jean Girard, played by a slimy Sacha Baron Cohen, with a ridiculously hilarious accent. Jean hits the Nascar circuit like a hurricane and just like that, Ricky Bobby finds himself out of the league and forced to deliver pizzas to make money. But with some good old fashioned ass kickin' help from Ricky's long lost father, Reese, played to absolute perfection by the great Gary Cole (you might remember him as the boss from Office Space); he'll be back on the race track in no time to duel with the slimy Jean Girard.<br/><br/>Talladega Nights brings on the laughs and loads of silliness right from the start and never really let's up. And I would go as far as saying that this movie does top Anchorman in not only laughs, but overall entertainment as well, but on the downside, the film does seem to miss a few good opportunities here and there. David Koechner is underused and not really given enough to do, which is a real shame considering how funny he was in Anchorman and Thank You for Smoking, and the story is a bit predictable, but always hilarious. But if you can forgive the thin plot and some of the one-note characters I think you'll have one hell of a fun time. Anchorman director Adam McKay has assembled a great cast with plenty of comedic talent, and as we watch them have fun they don't forget to bring us along for the ride. Talladega Nights is a pure laugh riot of silliness for both racing fans and non-fans alike, and it works so well for the majority of the time it's hard to walk away feeling the slightest bit of disappointment."

That just made it sound way more serious than it is, it does not take itself seriously.

Better than Wedding Crashers and any Ben Stiller movie since ""...Mary"". I'm not sure why this movie is not a 10 of 10 at IMDb. What do people want from movies? You go to a comedy to laugh. You go to a sad movie to cry, to a ""horror"" movie to be scared. If you don't laugh, cry or scream, then it's not funny, sad or scary, and you've wasted your time and money.<br/><br/>Must have been uptight NASCAR fans and drunken right wingers. Hmmm. Are those adjectives modifying the right nouns? Generally I think people go, see, enjoy or not, and leave it at the theater. Maybe get a few lines for the water cooler the next day.

You laugh so hard or at least my wife and I did, that it is hard to remember individual lines or scenes that doubled you over. There are so many funny lines, sight gags, and twisted punch lines that it will never be said of Talladega Nights, ""It went from the sublime to the ridiculous"". Talladega Nights stayed in the ridiculous. There is no takeaway here. That is not a bad thing. Certainly not for Ferrell and the production company. I could go back and watch it again and buy the DVD also.<br/><br/>Speaking of takeaway, this movie reminds me of Chinese food. As the old saying goes: You eat until you are stuffed, but an hour later you are hungry again. That's what Talladega Nights is...the Chinese food of comedies.

Anchorman was a much better movie for Will Ferral. Much of the movie could have been changed to make it a little more edgy, it was a little to watered down for my more adult tastes. I think the studio where trying to market the movie to a wider audience and made the writers hold back on some good jokes. However I feel if I watch the movie again the story will grow on me. NASCAR is such a obvious target for humor these days, many more jokes could have been made. Plus the plot was very thin and the characters where not developed well."

","This was a hysterically funny movie. For those of you who say it was bad (such as dinnerbellbishop) I am angered by your ignorance and naivety. You don't see this movie for the unpredictable plot twists and amazing content, you see it to laugh. This is a classic Will Ferrel Movie, portraying his outlandish comedy acting style and superb improvisation. Denoucning this film only shows that you lack a sense of humor. This film satirizes the Christian religion and Nascar, but in a very innocuous manner. I could not stop laughing at the ridiculousness of Ferrel's dialog and loved every minute of it. If you are a stiff, stubborn person with no sense of humor, you will no doubt detest this funny film."
"rushgirl4","8","0","2","8 August 2006"," Surprised that I liked it!
","I am definitely not a NASCAR or Will Ferrell fan, and I generally HATE the sort of dumb humor the previews implied was in this movie. So pretty much the only reason I went to see it was that my niece and nephew were staying with us and it was the only thing they could agree on seeing.<br/><br/>But as fully prepared as I was to dislike this movie, I found myself cracking up at many of the jokes. Surprisingly, I found it to be a very enjoyable movie, with writing that was more clever and entertaining than I had anticipated. Not the absolute best comedy I've ever seen, but it's definitely one I wouldn't mind seeing again.<br/><br/>If anyone's looking for a cohesive, well-crafted plot, forget it. This is the standard comedic plot structure you see in thousands of movies. But comedies should not be judged by depth and creativity of the plot (that's for dramas and romantic comedies), but by the humor and entertainment level. Complaining that a comedy doesn't have much of a plot is the equivalent of complaining that a Twinkie doesn't have much nutrition. Of course not, but that's really not the point, is it?"
"Chris-Stewart","6","0","2","8 August 2006"," ""Ricky Bobby"" straddles the fence, but avoids damaged goods.
","I am now entirely convinced that Will Ferrell is not leading-man material, but a fantastic supporting actor. His brand of humor can never stand up to 2 full hours of scrutiny, but when tossed in intermittently among contributions by other comic actors, he performs splendidly. For example, ""Old School"" was arguably the best dumb comedy of the decade, because it combined his hilarious outbursts with the more subtle talents of Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn. The same goes for ""Anchorman"", where he was aided by the incredible Steve Carrell among others, and Zoolander, where he played second fiddle to Ben Stiller. His leading roles, however, tended to drag on and lose my interest very quickly, such as in ""Kicking and Screaming"" and the atrocious ""Bewitched."" He simply can't yell loudly and talk in a strange voice for 2 solid hours and expect people to be continually captivated by the same stuff.<br/><br/>With that said, ""Talladega Nights"" falls right between the two categories. Ricky Bobby is clearly the principal character in the film, and the primary supporting characters just aren't funny at all, except in instances of superb writing that no one could screw up. However, Ferrell and McKay were clever enough to dole out screen time to unexpected people, and rely frequently on physical comedy, so that I was never fed up. The people who gave this movie a 10 (a shocking 24%??) are clearly under 14 or think that new-age comedy is the only film genre there is, buttt I'd still say it was a satisfactory experience. I'd probably see it again if I was asked, and I still chuckle sometimes remembering the more hilarious bits."

","You know, this movie was fantastic. It was very funny - and not just in some crude slap-stick humor, but it was so much more. The dialogue was extremely fun. So, pay attention to that! Some people say that the French guy's accent was bad, but that was the whole point of the movie. He wasn't supposed to be accurate in any way - which is part of the brilliance of the movie! Everything from the way Ricky Bobby raced to the way he said the dinner time prayer was excellent in comedy.<br/><br/>Maybe it was just me, but the beginning was kind of dull. But it paid off well later. Though this may not surpass the hilarity of Anchorman, it is kind of close! It was very funny, and it was stupid, but that's what we love to see every now and again."

Okay, so I hate it. So this was some funny spoofing on that. The only reference I don't think it had in it was somebody marrying their sister.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie is when the kids, Walker and Texas Ranger, just go off on the grandpa Chip every time he opens his mouth. <br/><br/>They totally tee off on him.... CHIP!! DON'T MAKE GO APE $H!T on you!!! Anybody else remember what all those kids say to Chip or Ricky's mom when they first meet her? <br/><br/>Another funny quirk is how he is always praying to baby Jesus, and his family corrects him on how he's not a baby anymore. <br/><br/>Gary Cole's character was funny. Always slinging a beer can out the window. (Notice how at the end they all pile in with him driving even though he's drunk? Good stuff.)<br/><br/>I'm not sure I would have had a frenchie as the bad guy. Seems like maybe they should have cast Jeff Gordon or something. The french guy was kinda funny, but kind of annoying. <br/><br/>Overall a good movie for anybody that likes to be entertained by stupid humor (me) for an hour and a half."
"MsMusical216","8","0","2","7 August 2006"," Will Ferrell demonstrates his comic genius once again and proves himself as a bankable movie star!
","Will Ferrell's brand of humor is a funny thing, you either love it or hate it. Having been a fan of his for almost 10 years, I have loved most every movie he's been in. The great thing about Ferrell's movies are the hilarious one-liners that he delivers with such dead-pan sarcasm and dry wit. There are some great performances in this movie. I was surprised at how funny John C. Reily was. This was a great departure from the serious characters he usually plays. Ferrell's two you sons, appropriately named Walker and Texas Rangers had some great one liners as well. ""Grandpa, I'm gonna jump on you like a spider monkey.""Gary Cole was great as Reese Bobby, the alcoholic Will Ferrell has certainly proved he can carry a movie and is a bankable movie star, especially among the teen and young adult crowd.He is as funny now as he was four years ago when he left SNL. He can do all sorts of comedy and deliver a funny line like no one else. I think this movie will be the equivalent of what ""Wedding Crashers"" was last summer.People will be quoting this movie for the rest of the year. Like a lot of people, my favorite scene was the dinner table prayer. ""Dear Lord baby Jesus, lying there in your ghost manger, watching your Baby Einsteins and learning your shapes and colors."" If you are looking for a laugh-out loud comedy with great one-liners,check out Talladega Nights."
"johnnymonsarrat","8","0","2","7 August 2006"," Jon Monsarrat review: hilarious, but not really for racing fans
","The secret to this film is that it is not really for NASCAR racing fans. The film makes fun of such people to such a degree that they would have to be really good sports to take it lying down.<br/><br/>However, I'm not a racing fan and I'll gladly laugh at someone who's so religious that they believe in angels. Although not quite as good as Anchorman, Talladega Nights is laugh-out-loud funny throughout and appealing to the intellectual, unlike many of the Saturday Night Skits which come through as simplistic and repetitive. They have a trick where they shoot every scene multiple times and try ad libbing and it works wonderfully here. Someone is doing a good job with the comedic timing in the editing room. Lets hope that Will Ferrell can keep this winning streak going.<br/><br/>As for the supporting cast, Gary Cole was perfect (the dad), but I didn't really feel an original vibe from anyone else in the supporting cast. I think if they're going to pull together an ensemble cast they need to pick brighter stars. Or make the next film simply focus more on Will Ferrell himself.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Everyone, but use caution if you're in the group targeted as likely to be offended<br/><br/>-- Panther-loving deadbeat dads who Wanna Go Fast! I'll give ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" an 8 out of 10."

This movie is in many ways a long indictment of the mindset that drives people in our country to believe that we are the best of the best. The sheer arrogance of Ricky Bobby is delightful. <br/><br/>Will Ferrel is basically playing Dubya from his SNL days. <br/><br/>Go see this movie, right now. <br/><br/>If you think you've seen Will Ferrel at his best, then you haven't seen anything yet."

It seemed improved which was why it worked so well. The trailer betrayed very little of what made the movie funny. I get so disappointed when the movie trailer has all of the funny parts but this movie had so much more to offer.<br/><br/>If you didn't think this movie was funny, then you won't like most Will Ferrell movies. It's one of his best by far. It is right up there with Anchorman!<br/><br/>I think I would definitely see this movie again.

"Soujiro","7","0","2","7 August 2006"," An amusing satire that leans slightly to the left...
","If you're hoping to see the Nascar culture of the South (and midwest)mercilessly skewered, this movie will not satisfy your liberal bloodlust. It does lean a little left, but ultimately it's not picking sides and is a funny film that even intelligent people can enjoy.<br/><br/>Will and crew have good comic timing, and Will somehow once again channels his idiot man- child character in a way that makes you actually care about him. Jane Lynch is awesome in Guest mockumentaries, but is wasted here. Leslie Bibb is dead on as the gold-digging bombshell and Amy Adams nails her inspiring monologue although her character is clearly tacked on. John C. keeps pace with the zaniness of Will F. and has many of the funniest lines. Michael Clarke Duncan is there as the token bait for African Americans. He is not given much to work with, and the whole second knife thing is a bit insulting (although funny). Gary Cole is funny and believable. <br/><br/>You're not going to laugh until you cry, but you will laugh often. The film tries to make fun of product placement with product placement which kind of sort of works. It's a bit like Fight Club pretending to be anti-Hollywood... not really convincing. The soundtrack is well chosen especially at the end, and the movie has by far the best on screen kiss in recent memory that actually makes you feel hopeful for the future of the country.<br/><br/>The only negatives for me were the annoying children. Once again the tired, ""make kids say foul things"" trick was used, and it still isn't funny. Luckily Jane Lynch comes to the rescue, and I heard several cheers from the audience when the childish antics are silenced. <br/><br/>As usual, there are several extremely low reviews on the site posted by people who have clearly not seen the movie. Some of them even cut and paste the same vague sentence over and over to make the minimum word limit. Now that's laziness. Just to make it clear, the n- word is never uttered, there is no anti-Semitism, no nudity, and there are only a few raunchy jokes (mostly erection related). For Tom Cruise's sake, The Naked Gun is more offensive than this film. <br/><br/>The real reason this movie inspires hatred, is that it is effective as a satire of the absurdity of both the ultra-male, Christian-lite homophobic Nascar culture (the fainting from the gayness scene cracked me up), and the over the top extreme-left, pseudo-cultured in your face liberal credo.<br/><br/>The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is not fall out of your chair funny, and it's not as awesome as Highlander, but it's miles and miles better than the atrocious Wedding Crashers and is surprisingly well made for a Hollywood comedy. Everyone in the audience (except for a couple people who were clearly waaaaaaay too sensitive about Jesus) had a good time."
"jordan2240","5","0","2","7 August 2006"," Not as funny as expected.
","The movie was entertaining enough, but I never found myself ""cracking up"" at it, and some of the funnier scenes I saw in the previews didn't even make it to the final cut. I found myself laughing the hardest at some of the line's from ""Ricky's"" sons, and I did enjoy the prayer segment (which I don't think should have been offensive to anyone). Regarding product placement, who cares! Unless you're a complete dolt who buys things just because they show up in a movie, you shouldn't be affected by it, and as others have already noted, it would be a bit tough to avoid in a movie featuring NASCAR. What I do find annoying are the commercials they play before the movie even starts, most of which we see almost daily on the television. You'd think they could at least come up with something akin to the super bowl commercials, but I digress. Anyway, to summarize, mildly entertaining fare, but if you've seen the previews, you've already seen most of the funny stuff."

Some of the things included in the movie might offend some people though so if you are easily offended you might want to refrain from seeing this. It doesn't have anything too bad though.

From the get-go the movie is portrayed in a slapstick frenzied atmosphere and (thankfully) never takes itself too seriously(whereas Wedding Crashers gets a bit schmaltzy towards the end). The fact that Ricky Bobby is constantly making a fool of himself provides the audience with exactly what it desires; two hours of zany jokes as well as plenty of lines and quotes that will be around for a long time. Ricky Bobby is a silly but likable character that ranks up with Ferrell's other noteworthy ones such as Ron Burgundy or his relentless Robert GOULET!!

It seems that every time we go to see one, it's a bomb, so we have been waiting for everything to come out on DVD or a cable movie channel... Not this one. We even recorded the Brickyard race to go see this one in the theater, and we were not disappointed...FINALLY!! Will Ferrell is great as Ricky Bobby, the racer with ""two first names"" ;) The movie is quick to start and easy to follow. The scene of saying grace at the table is hilarious, but I think the two sons are what make the scene. Their quick-popping' responses to Grandpa are awesome, and had us both laughing out loud. The NASCAR scenes are typical of racing movies, you know, the kind of moves are made that would NEVER happen at 200mph on the track, but still fun to watch. I was delightfully surprised to see all the cameo's by the real commentators and drivers that we watch every weekend.<br/><br/>All in all, another great movie from Ferrell.

The movie doesn't really have any subtext or real meaning behind it; it's just a good loose yourself-while-laughing movie. It's a movie with no intent other than to make people laugh, and the movie succeeds in doing so.<br/><br/>For those who want to see a movie that is funny and has a deeper meaning, don't see this. This has nothing to offer other than people doing stupid things and making other laugh. That is the beauty of Will Ferrell's movies.

You can't make a legitimate NASCAR spoof without using the actual cars and actual sponsors. That just goes to show you why people don't understand the comedy in the movie. Every time they showed a sponsor sticker or car, or even had him saying their name, they just showed the life of a racer. I personally loved it all, because almost all of the time it was all in good fun.<br/><br/>I personally thought this movie would only be funny in certain parts, but I have to admit I didn't stop laughing all the way through it.

Also this movie concentrates on Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrel) a lot more than nascar so don't worry, it is not a movie all about nascar. You'll like it even if you don't like nascar. I would say that you need to be a fan of Will Ferrel's humor before you consider seeing this. If you haven't like WIll Ferrel movies in the past you probably shouldn't see this.

","From the first time I saw it I was definitely an Anchoman fan. I loved the characters even though the storyline was kind of typical. I thought that Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby was as funny or even funnier. This was the best comedy I've seen in a while. So many of the comedies that have come out lately have been flat for me. They start off well but fall short and many times have to resort to bathroom humor to survive and hold an audience. One of the reasons that made Anchormen work for me was that there were so many quotable lines. Talladega nights had more quotable lines in the first quarter than Anchorman had in the entire movie...for me at least. Also the storyline kept my attention around the humor. After Kicking and Screaming and Bewitched...Will needed a movie like this. It will most likely put him in the forefront again."

Tallageda Nights pokes gentle fun at not just the Nascar culture, but a whole lot more of us, too. Taking ourselves too seriously can be funny in the hands of masters like Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, who are at their best in the Ballad of Ricky Bobby. The laughs have not been sanitized by the politically-correct police, but the humor is not mean-spirited: it's more like a chiding consciousness-raising. Here's another big plus: this movie has redeeming value! Unlike the last humorous movie I saw (Clerks II), I did not feel like a naughty voyeur as I slipped out of the theater. Rather, I felt a surprised, renewed faith in Hollywood's ability to make the audience laugh without resorting to worn-out dirty tricks and trying to out-do the last ones."

In Taladega Nights you have a similar plot, almost identical but somehow this was more well thought and had an interesting plot line as it may seem.

The second viewing (DVD) will probably be even funnier. Loved the scenes with NASCAR announcers, drivers, etc. Many scenes and dialog supported the PG13 rating, while pushing the envelope to ""R"" without a few certain words. References to other cultures and some really crude humor silenced the audience and made some uncomfortable. Not the kind of language and scenes for under 14 kids.

","Fantastic concept and hilarious movie. Playing upon Will Ferrell's amusing southern accent, bringing in NASCAR and a French foil element, you have a recipe for the summer's funniest film!<br/><br/>Will Ferrell plays the ""gotta go fast"" Ricky Bobby who grows up in a highly dysfunctional family. He makes it to NASCAR as part of a pit crew of a lowly race team. When the driver decides to get out of his ride and take a break in the middle of the race, the crew chief implores a member of the team to get in the car and drive it. Ferrell takes the wheel and drives from the back all the way to third. He impresses the owner and ultimately gets his own ride. Ferrell then goes on a tear and becomes NASCAR's greatest driver, earning him accolades from even Dale Earnhardt JR. <br/><br/>Ricky Bobby must face his nemesis and he does in ex-formula one racer Jean Girard. The French driver is a walking crude stereotype of the French, all the way down to Girard being openly homosexual. Ricky Bobby must face his fears and find himself to rise up and be a champion.<br/><br/>Laughing essentially throughout the film. A barometer for success in a comedy would be my wife who tends not to laugh out loud, yet still enjoy a comedy. She was laughing out loud throughout the film! Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G) was very funny as the driver of the 55 Perrier car.<br/><br/>Humor is not crude in any way, so it is fine for the whole family.<br/><br/>Shake & Bake baby!

"gcd1707","7","0","2","5 August 2006"," Solid, but not quite in Anchorman territory
","I had high expectations for Talladega nights, most of which were met. But part of me thinks there is a more tightly woven, funnier movie that could have come out of the premise.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, there are plenty of hilarious scenes, great one-liners, and clever details that'll make repeat viewing entirely worthwhile. Ricky Bobbly's son Texas Ranger's line ""I'm gonna come at you like a spider monkey"" hasn't stopped amusing me, nor has his dad's line ""Shut up you little pot licker, or I'll stick you in a microwave!"" NASCAR is ripe for parody, and there's plenty of it to keep things rolling.<br/><br/>The major faults lie in setting up the conflicts in the movie and its PG-13 rating. The first third of the movie is the weakest part because it's essentially an exposition to introduce a deadbeat dad, turn Ricky Bobby from a member of the pit crew into a dominant driver, fashion a rival from an effete Frenchman, and create a conflict with a team owner bent on replacing him. That's a lot to throw on the plate from the start, and it shows. Furthermore, presumably for marketing reasons, the movie was edited to get a PG-13 rating. I can only imagine how much comedic gold is waiting for the DVD version because it would have brought about an R rating. This probably has a lot to do with the early stagnation, as well.<br/><br/>That said, things pick up once the onus of trying to create a real plot has been lifted. I laughed consistently from the middle of the movie right down the outtakes. Some movies lose momentum as they go on; Talladega Nights only gains momentum like a stock car coming out of turn number three as it roars to its conclusion. Molly Shannon and Sascha Baron Cohen put in great supporting work (that sadly seemed a bit underutilized), while newcomer (to me at least) Amy Adams has a great scene with Ferrell in a bar.<br/><br/>It's worth the price of admission, that's for sure."

","Oh Dear God I have never laughed so hard.<br/><br/>If you have kids that throw your dad's war medals in the river, you won't find this funny. Otherwise, it is a laugh riot! My wife and I loved every single minute of this movie, and I will recommend this movie to anyone who loves NASCAR or not. It's not about the driving, it's about the comic genius that is Will Ferrell. Where else are you going to find grace that lasts for 15 minutes, a cougar in a Chevelle, and ""A Mighty Wind's"" Jane Lynch laying down some ""Granny Law"" This has GOT to be seen to be appreciated!<br/><br/>Thank you Baby Jesus.

","In comparison this film, like all of Will's movies...<br/><br/>Are popcorn flicks...<br/><br/>His 2005 movie campaign wasn't really that spectacular in my opinion, Bewitched, KAS, and even his Wedding Crashers cameo wasn't up to par with his talent.<br/><br/>So I came in to see if Will can come out, put a nice movie out.<br/><br/>First off, the plot line has too many holes to fill, but that really doesn't matter since this is a parody of Southerners and NASCAR, and Cocky Patriotism.<br/><br/>Will's performance mad me happy, as he once again showed us that he severely capable of being a SNL Performer on the small screen, and be able to go to the Big Screen and achieve similar success.<br/><br/>MC Duncan, and his crew parts were exactly that, pit crew with no real storyline or plot needed, but just to add more fun.<br/><br/>The part I liked the best about the movie was JC Reilly's role as the dim witted friend of Ricky. Not exactly steeling the show material, but he outplayed the role very well.<br/><br/>Rating (Plot) - 5.6/10 Rating (What it truly is... a summer popcorn comedy) - 8/10"

","I went to see this tonight with my son who is 10. I enjoyed it but some of the content was not appropriate for a 10 year old. It's always tough deciding which pg-13 movie might be OK for a child under that age these days.<br/><br/>As long as you explain to your child what certain things mean and that it's done for the movie to raise some laughs it might be a bit easier for them to reason with. In this case there were several things that took away from the humor for him.<br/><br/>Again, adults will enjoy it if you like those ""stupid humor"" types of comedies. Will was his usual hilarious self."
"hatrick714714","5","0","2","4 August 2006"," Not terrible, but we have definitely seen better from Ferrell
","Alright, I'm not saying that this movie was a big bust, but when compared to the past works of Ferrell, (and the movies I mainly refer to when I say this are Old School and Anchorman) this just isn't that funny, and the sad thing is, it definitely has the potential to be a great film! It has the goods for a great goofy comedy: great comedians, screwed up characters, and a gay guy, but it doesn't use these pieces to its fullest extent! It seems as though through every scene we are left waiting for that one funny part that just makes us crack up, as we are to expect from Old School and Anchorman, but we never get those big laughs (excluding a select few scenes), and this is a disappointment. The part that I laughed the most at was the bloopers at the end, and that usually isn't a good sign for a movie. I'll keep the review short and sweet, and I wouldn't highly recommend this film. Die-hard Ferrell fans will still see it anyways, and they will probably come out liking it only because they expected to. For anyone else, I might stay away from this one if I were you, it had the potential, but just never clicked."
