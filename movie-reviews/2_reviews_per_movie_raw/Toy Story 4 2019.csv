"DJKwa","9","824","1116","16 June 2019"," A sequel that didn't need to be made...but I'm glad it was!
","As far as conclusions to beloved franchises go, Toy Story 3 is hard to beat. The film tugs at the heartstrings, as we learn that Andy's toys are no longer his, and cuts deep with the realisation that growing up means letting go.<br/><br/>Naturally, I had a lot of trepidation heading into Toy Story 4. It wasn't so much about whether the film would be good or not, as Pixar have been pretty reliable in that regard. Rather it was about whether, despite the best efforts from everyone involved, Toy Story 4 would be able to shake off feeling unnecessary. Well, I'm happy to report that not only is Toy Story 4 a triumph, but the film's heartfelt finale feels like a proper send-off for Woody and his friends and proves that it was a story that needed to be told.<br/><br/>The best way to summarise is that Toy Story 3 is the end of Andy's story, while Toy Story 4 is (likely) the end of the toys' story.<br/><br/>While essentially a roadtrip film, the story focuses on the toys finding their place in the outside world for the first time and it's hard not to draw the analogy between young adults moving out of home. The film captures the feeling of uncertainty but also the new found possibility that leaving a place of comfort entails and it's a joy to see the series mature along with the kids who first watched Toy Story back in 1995.<br/><br/>It is also, undoubtedly, the funniest Toy Story film, largely due to a bevy of hilarious new supporting characters. Forky is a definite highlight while Keanu Reeves steals his scenes as Duke Caboom and Key and Peele bring their expert comedic timing to a pair of carnival-prize plush toys who are attached together by their hands but bounce off each other like rubber balls.<br/><br/>Thanks to a consistently funny script, the film is a blast to watch when it's not making your eyes well up, but either way the film will likely leave you crying. If you're still skeptical about the film, let me just say that, nine years may have passed between sequels, but the series' heart is beating as strong as ever."
"erikpaulh","2","542","882","2 July 2019"," Beautiful picture boring story
","The picture is amazing! Really one of the most beautiful animations I've seen yet. The story however was boring and disappointing, when comparing it to the previous films.<br/><br/>In a previous Toy Story Buzz says: ""The important thing is that we stick together"". - in Toy Story 4 Buzz loses all his previous personality. He listens to his ""conscious?"" Seriously? It was funny and very concrete thinking as Buzz often can be at times. But let's not forget who Buzz was in previous films. He began as believing he truly was a space ranger. When he finally comes out of that he realizes he's not a ranger but a toy. When he finally figures out his importance and value in his family of toys, he becomes as loyal and committed to Andy and the rest of the group as Woody is. Together they get rid of Sid, fly to the van, and conquer all sorts of missions in the next movies. Buzz takes the lead in toy story 2 to help track down and save woody. But in Toy story 4 it's like he's a drone. All he can do is listen to his little toy commands. He's straight up clueless in this film. At one point he actually abandons woody at the antique shop when the odds were highly against them, because his push button told him to??? Really? That's not the buzz we know and love!! The buzz we knew almost died with Woody in a furnace! He would go to the ends of the earth for his buddies. They were a team and a family. But not anymore. Now Buzz is a drone with little thoughts for himself anymore. He does whatever his buttons tell him to. ""Goodbye Woody, sorry if you die in the antique shop, but my conscious told me to quit"". That's all it took? Really? Ok?<br/><br/>Woody was a fearless leader in all three movies. Until this one. Yes he still had a heart of gold. But, he went from Bo Peeps hero and Sharif that she looked up to, to his whipping boy. She straight up tells him at one point that he's essentially stupid and doesn't know what he's doing and needs to get in line and follow her. Really? Woody went from her hero to her little
Boy. He literally follows her around apologizing with his tail tucked between his legs. Goodbye Woody, it was nice knowing you... now you're this wimpy cowboy doll who lets all the girls beat the crap out of you and basically tell you, you're worthless - you aren't played with anymore (you stick to the closet while the cowgirl is the new sheriff in town), another doll unapologetically rips your pull string out, because she feels this is the only way to get her own worth - so you just turn over and take the abuse, the love of your life says your basically washed up and need to follow her lead because of how stupid you are. This is not how I imagined Woody going out of the franchise.<br/><br/>If only the Gabby doll would have showed an ounce of remorse for what she did to woody, it would have driven home the sacrifice he made for her to allow her to take his pill string and start a new life of her own. No, the villain takes what she wants and never shows a bit of gratitude to woody.<br/><br/>These new carnival characters feel like they were pulled out of the new pets movie. They had some great comic relief at points, but felt like they were in the wrong movie. They felt really out of place.<br/><br/>The kaboom guy was another completely random and useless character. It felt like he was another insert to try to make people laugh, as though that was his only purpose for the film.<br/><br/>We never get to see bulls eye, Rex, and the rest of the gang. They literally were extras in this film unlike the other three movies.<br/><br/>Forky was a creative spin on things and added some great comedy. But, really the emotional connection to the characters we poorly done in this film. I was literally bored and just waiting for the next thing to happen. I didn't care about the end clips when the credits rolled. This story was so weak.<br/><br/>It was a poor way to say goodbye to our beloved characters. We didn't even really get to say goodbye to most of them, they were hiding in the RV the whole time.<br/><br/>I thought this would be a tear jerker, but I don't really care that Woody is not a part of the gang anymore. They took away all the elements that bonded these characters together in the first place.<br/><br/>The franchise should have ended at 3."
"dussaultjulien","10","283","467","21 June 2019"," I haven't cried in a movie theater in such a long time, but boy did I for this one
","I've been watching, and rewatching all of the Toy Story films for years now and have loved them all, and never wanted them to end, because I could never see an end to such a beloved series of films, but everything eventually has to finish out, and Toy Story 4 does it beautifully. I'm a guy who usually doesn't cry in movie theatres, heck it's a rare sight to see me crying, but I was bawling at the end. They did leave it to make other films, which I hope that they do, but if they left it like this I wouldn't be sad, because it closed all the emotional doors that needed to be closed, for me personally, and even opened some I had never knew could open before. Highly recommend 10/10."
"feypoth","1","361","608","26 June 2019"," Depressing vibes from the beginning...
","Well...I prefer considering ""Toy story 4"" as a side story that someone, who doesn't know anything about the characters, made just for fun. As a big fan of Toy Story for years I was very disappointed with the whole plot. First , our beloved characters like Jessie, Bullseye, Rex , Ham, Mr and Mrs Potato Head, Slinky Dog and Little Aliens almost got no screen time. Buzz barely got some time and even then it made him look dumb and as if he wasn't so serious about finding Woody. And all these happened for the shake of the new toys,who were interesting and sometimes funny, but it wasn't necessary to see them all the time. Something else I want to mention is that if you know the original characters, you know it's impossible for them to just sit in a van and do nothing to help their friend who needs them. I don't think finding Bo Beep again and giving her all the screentime was a positive thing as she was nothing special from the beginning. Also Bonnie suddenly loving a fork more than the toys she promised to take care of, shows than she never really deserved to have them! Yes, it was fine that in Toy Story 3 the whole gang ended up at a new home that someone would play with them again, even though it was a big change. Because of that I had a hope that it may end like this, happily starting a new life with a nice new kid that will take care of them,but no...Toy Story 4 came to give us a depressing plot twist and, in my opinion, a terrible end for Woody. Separating the gang for whatever reason is so heartbreaking for a fan who heard the news about Toy Story 4 and was excited to watch it. Especially for a reason that doesn't represent Woody's personality and values. In conclusion, a movie good for kids and anyone who haven't heard about the original Toy Story."
"conferfm","1","339","574","24 June 2019"," Does NOT compare to the first 3 films
","Toy Story has become an integral part of our lives. It reels us all back into childhood and keeps our innocence alive. Toy Story has had the privilege of taking us all on that journey. Sadly, Toy Story 4 has brought our childlike innocence to a screeching halt.<br/><br/>Although, it really goes without saying, the toys should have never been given away to Bonnie. To keep the nostalgia alive, in Toy Story 3, Andy could have kept his toys in the attic. The ending could have shown glimpses of Andy getting married and having children. The ending of part 3 could have very easily been bittersweet to see Andy's toys given to his own children and Woody and Buzz's legacy of faithfulness to Andy's children continue.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 felt like a slap in the face to not only all the fans of Toy Story, but the hope that this film brought with it. The main charachter really focuses on solely Woody, which becomes apparent by the end of the film. In no way is this taking away from the laughs the film brought, because it is quite amusing. The plot felt scattered and pointless. As an adult whom had favorite toys saved in the attic for the my children,Toy Story 4 was a huge disappointment. ""Gabby Gabby's"" character felt quite selfish. In leaving Woody in the condition that they left him in didn't feel selfless; it felt robbed of his loyalty. Although the stuffed bunny and chick were funny, their characters felt like Pixar was looking for ways to find laughs. Finding ""Bo Peep"" as a conclusion to the story was not a good enough reason to create Toy Story 4.<br/><br/>A sad misstep in Toy Story's legacy. Having mixed reviews from the audience in Toy Story 4 after a long love from the inception is just saddening."
"kellylane17","1","362","618","23 June 2019"," Heartbroken
","I love Toy story. It probably is one of my all time favourites. I was lucky even enough to have an original buzz light year toy, So obviously when I found out toy story 4 was being released I couldn't wait. I love all Disney. But it was good to know that I could watch a film that wasn't a remake. I could go into this film feeling like I did when I watched Toy story for the first time.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this film so much. And don't get me wrong the animation was beautiful. The first scene was brilliant. It felt like the good old days. And I was hopeful for the rest of the film. But unfortunately this film just didn't sit right.<br/><br/>One huge problem for me is that it wasn't believable. Woody was being forgotten about and being left at the back of the closet. But Toy story 3 would have you believe that Bonnie loved Woody and after the heartbreak of watching Andy give him to her at the end, was okay because you thought she would love him just as much.<br/><br/>Second of all. I know that it's all about the kid. But it isn't. It's about the toys friendship. Leave no you behind. So why would Woody choose to leave all his friends. It just doesn't make sense. The whole set up for this film from the beginning was to make you feel comfortable with woody leaving. But it's just not in his character.<br/><br/>All our favourites Slinky, rex, Hamm, bullseye, Jessie to name a few got next to no screen time. Buzz got some but still not enough! He was almost made to come across as an idiot. For what, some cheap laughs.<br/><br/>This film was scary the dummy's were nightmare worthy but the actual protagonist just wasn't deep enough. No where near Sid, Stinky Pete or lotso. Probably so you could like her and be happy she found her kid. It just felt far too forced for me.<br/><br/>Overall I wish this film didn't exist. Watching the RV drive away made me honestly feel heart broken. I felt as if I truly had lost someone important. And how would Andy feel knowing that the Toy he so dearly loved, the Toy he entrusted to Bonnie was now lost.<br/><br/>Toy story should have ended with 3 or at the very least Woody should have been taken to college with Andy where he would have been Loved."
"kratos_training","1","387","668","27 June 2019"," Childhood ruined
","The film felt like a quick money grab. The characters developed over the last 20 years were cast aside with the majority limited to one line. Woody flip flops between his morals and the ending was incredibly disappointing. Toy story 3 wrapped the series up superbly and it should have been left there."
"andres-54460","6","225","382","22 June 2019"," They ruined the essence of the trilogy
","Definitely they should stop with the third movie. They separated buzz and wood. Bonnie is the real villain (?)."
"MrsBKG","1","343","593","22 June 2019"," This was hard to watch. So disappointing
","I knew there was absolutely no way they could do a better ending than Toy Story 3. Toy Story 4 was disappointing, really disappointing. It was eerie, dark, and lacked all the heart of the first 3. It completely contradicts the underlying theme of the first 3 movies and throws it into a 180, leaving us with a sad, lackluster, way too ""hey, kids- reality's not easy"" ending. According to this latest installment;
1.) You don't have a friend in me.
2.) Whatever life throws at you, it's not going to be okay because you can't count on your friends & family to be there for you to infinity and beyond.<br/><br/>So many elements to this movie were just flat out depressing. Woody is trapped, defeated and dismembered, being robbed of his voice box and yet, we're supposed to somehow completely be ok with that because the eerie attacker is the one who the story writers want to aim sympathy toward (??!) The other horribly depressing part of this story is Buzz Lightyear is reduced to a brainless sideshow coward who has somehow lost his heroic persona. Also, Bo Peep is so cold with zero emotion!<br/><br/>A seriously contradictory and downright depressing ""final chapter"" to what used to be one of the finest kid movies American pop culture ever had. Completely void of charm and heart. So bad!"
"eelen-seth","10","297","519","18 June 2019"," A sequel that not only works as an ending, but also as a new beginning.
","The announcement of a fourth Toy Story chapter, felt like an easy cash grab for Disney, after the huge success that was the concluding Toy Story 3. After seeing the first trailer and synopsis, I still wasn't sure if this was gonna work. So being a bit cautious of seeing these beloved characters coming back nine years after we said goodbye to Andy, I can say - no need to be afraid. The toys are dusted off and look better than ever!<br/><br/>The film opens with a flashback to a rainy night where our toys are still happily living with Andy. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Bo Peep (Annie Potts) are getting ready to rescue RC-racer - a radio-controlled toy car - that's been stuck in a gutter and is about to be dragged into the sewers, if not saved in time. This is an exciting opening to get you right into the story and remind you of the bond these toys have with each other. ""No toy gets left behind"", like Woody would say multiple times throughout this franchise. This scene also shows how close Woody and Bo's relationship just was, which gets torn apart moments later when the lamp that houses her and her sheep is given away.<br/><br/>Almost a decade later, after Andy has passed his beloved toys to young Bonnie, we see her playing with all of them, although Woody gets pushed aside more often as time passes. He gets left in the closet with some of her baby toys. But when Bonnie has to attend her orientation day for kindergarten, Woody sees an opportunity to sneak into her backpack to look after the nervous girl. In class, a selfish kid grabs Bonnie's art supplies and drops some in a bin, where Woody jumps in to save some of it - along with bits of rubbish - which leads to Bonnie creating Forky (soon discovered to be a toy, voiced by Tony Hale), a spork with popsicle-stick feet, googly eyes and pipe-cleaner arms. The family has a new member.<br/><br/>Bonnie adores Forky, but having an existential crisis, this spork knows it's trash and feels like his only destination is the trash can, his safe haven. Woody, so longing for a purpose, takes it upon himself to keep rescuing and returning Forky, which will only get harder when Bonnie and her parents embark on a road trip in an RV. A journey on which we will meet carnival toys (Ducky and Bunny - voiced by Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele), a Canadian stunt-motocross action figure (Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom - the coolest and most breathtaking toy ever created) and a manipulative vintage doll (Christina Hendricks as Gabby Gabby) who's stuck living in an antique store, ready to do whatever's needed to live a blissful life.<br/><br/>
The emotions run high, with stunning animation and imagery all around. New characters that will win over your heart and make you laugh out loud with the funniest one liners. Did I really expect anything less, after three exceptionally strong films in this franchise?! Shame on me.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is an adventure full of subtle messages and metaphors, that carries on the legacy of its original trilogy. Disney/Pixar has done it again - a sequel that not only works as an ending, but also as a new beginning. When we get to chapter 5 (because let's be real, this is gonna kill it at the worldwide box office), these characters will have seen so much more than just the walls of Andy/Bonnie's room and have experienced what ""letting go"" really means."
"kilpatrickarlo","1","228","395","27 July 2019"," Why?
","Toy Story - 1, 2 and 3 were all amazing. It's hard not to tear up at the end of 3 which was the perfect ending to (arguably) Pixar's best franchise. This film completely ruins Toy Story's legacy. It didn't take long for me to realise this film wasn't going to be good and that it's only purpose was to make more money of a beloved franchise. The story is forgettable, all of the new characters are either uninteresting or underdeveloped and almost all of the original toys are dismissed and barely in the movie. This felt like a direct to dvd sequel and I'm going to pretend that it isn't the official end to the series. I'm not going to spoil the ending but all you need to know is that it's completely unsatisfying. I'll admit, I felt emotional at the end. I felt very sad. But not because the movie was moving me, I was sad because of how disappointing the ending was and that this is the official ending no matter what I think. I'd advise you to skip this movie and let Toy Story 3 be your final memory of Toy Story instead."
"danieljoshuabraid","5","521","932","20 June 2019"," Major letdown...and here's why!
","Now before I get started I've got to make it clear that I'm one of the biggest Toy Story fans out there. In particular the moving nature of the third instalment genuinely brought me to tears as I'm sure it did with a lot of you all.<br/><br/>While I had major concerns about the 4th movie's existence in general, I was willing to give it a shot. And don't get me wrong while Toy Story 4 is certainly not a bad movie, it's also not something that will sit in the hearts and minds of this generation any longer than a brief passing moment.<br/><br/>The problems start with the randomness of the plot, and the amount of themes that it is trying to cover in one movie. Is it primarily about getting Forky home to Bonnie, about Woody finding Bo, about Gabby finding an owner or about something else entirely? None of it is made particularly clear to the audience.<br/><br/>The beauty of the first 3 movies were that they had a clearly defined main plot: Toy Story was about the battle between Buzz/Woody and getting back to Andy from Sid; Toy Story 2 was about getting Woody back to Andy, and Toy Story 3 was about escaping the day care centre. Unfortunately in Toy Story 4, an actual coherent main plot is removed in favour of action sequences, the favouring of new characters instead of beloved old ones along a few amusing gags here and there.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 remains unsure what it wants to ultimately be about and I guess that blurred vision comes from the variety of 8 (yes 8!) screenwriters who are credited for their input into the story. Regulars such as Jessie, Rex, Hamm, Bullseye, Slinky Dog and the Potato Head are all given next to no screentime which is a massive disappointment. Keeping them in the van for most of the movie is a lazy and ultimately boring decision for many of these beloved characters who each found much better things to do in Toy Story 2 and 3 in particular.<br/><br/>Instead the barrage of new characters makes things far too confusing for the audience. The movie needed to be about Forky or Bo - not both. There wasn't any tension in finding Bo nor was there any in getting Forky back to Bonnie. A more wild-cap adventure separating Woody and Forky from the gang and finding Bo at the very end of the film might have had a better pay off but unfortunately neither mean all that much to the audience given the other issue of spending so long at the Antique Store.<br/><br/>Meanwhile another huge part of the movie - Buzz is a shell of his former self. He has precious little to do that actually affects the plot and really needed to be in more actual danger and peril or more useful in saying Woody and Forky.<br/><br/>Finally put, everything just feels so low-stake compared to the first few films. There's no fear of being incinerated, getting trapped on a plane to Japan or being torn apart by a crazed kid. Instead it's just all a bit simplistic and the film lacks any real dramatic tension. Perhaps they needed to make Gabby more evil before her transformation? Or use the height of the ferris wheel for a bigger finale at the top somehow? It all just felt too warm and fuzzy and lacked the energy of all the films that have come before it.<br/><br/>Yes this movie still has its moments - Duke Caboom is an amusing and welcome addition, Forky is a very likeable addition too and the ending was a nice send off - but unfortunately the setups all seemed too rushed that it didn't have the emotion it ultimately should of. I think by having too many writers the ultimate vision for this film got lost and the movie is all the poorer for it, which is a real shame!<br/><br/>Kids will still like it and you'll find a few laughs, but this is certainly a step down from the original 3 films."
"taylormade-1111","1","261","464","22 June 2019"," It should've ended at Toy Story 3.
","I really truly believe Pixar could've came up with a way better story line. There were so many avenues to pursue after TS3 ended. The commonality of all TS movies is the beautiful animation portrayed. With that aside, this one has way too much focus on Woody and Peep to start...<br/><br/>I was 10 when the first Toy Story came out. I'm now a 34 yr old mom of two kids- 6/8 who love toy story, as we all do. I leave this review with open minded opinion that it has been nine years since the third one-we can get fixated on an ending and expect otherwise- and yet- the fourth one feels overreached and lacking those ""clever"" scenes the previous three all have. Contradictions glaring. There were maybe two times the heart of the Toy Story we all know prevailed in the movie. Other than that, I felt no warmth of connection to the plot. It was like; ""let's just create a movie and see what happens!"" The entire script was a complete heartbreak.<br/><br/>""Forky"" was cute for a scene. Woody's obsession to please Bonnie keeping Forky around seemed overdone- Bonnie didn't want to play with Woody since the opening scene anyway. I was more interested in how Woody was going to transcend this form of rejection. Afterall, Bonnie loved her ""cowboy"" in TS3. He was the last toy Andy gave to her!<br/><br/>Woody convincing Forky (who wants to be trash and free) that he's ""lucky"" to have a kid and Woody actually ends up leaving the kid to be ""free.""<br/><br/>What about Andy not wanting to play with Woody in the past? Was Andy more worthy of a kid than Bonnie?? (Woody could've left years ago?)<br/><br/>Woody is a loyal cowboy and would ""never give up on you"", yet, he leaves everyone. To be with Bo. Who's character, albeit, is strong and well characterized, lacks connection between the two. We knew nothing much of Bo prior?!<br/><br/>Toy story for 24 years has been about the kid. A toy is a toy and purpose fulfilled when with a kid. That was the imagination beauty to these toys that have lives with THE KID. The toys are selfless- that's their beauty! Now it's about the self approached ego toy? This left a ""What's best for Woody"" human- feel. He's not quite a toy now- he's a robotic person doing what he wants when he wants. ""I'm going with Bo so we can be toys living as people out here in the wilderness. You guys just keep getting played with and when Bonnie's done, just leave her too."" Who's next? Each ""toy"" for their own? What is this nonsense?<br/><br/>The dummies were frightening. My son had a difficult time watching the ""villains"" attempt to take and sew up Woody to remove his voice box. Did Woody really need to go through ""surgery?""<br/><br/>Rather than add to the Toy Story family like the previous ones did, how we grew to love characters like Ken and Barbie, Mr/Mrs Potato head, the aliens and ""the claw"", etc. It was sad, sadistic and filled with new toys who's characters appeared over exaggerated to fill in a plot which appeared to not even have one in the first place. Less Buzz, Rex, Slinky, Bullseye and other favorites as well. I couldn't wait till it was over. Of all the amazing films coming out this year so far, (2019), I'd say Aladdin and Detective Pikachu surpass this one.<br/><br/>Maybe I am older now and set in my grown ways of watching this toy family stick together through everything. Or maybe it is just the effect of classic movies being produced simply because, well, they can? You still paid to see it, didn't you?"
"jamesjustice-92","10","136","236","20 June 2019"," Not a kids' story
","What if I told you that nowadays cartoons are not for kids anymore? They never were actually because the art of drawing has nothing to do with age, it's only about making something new and making a difference as with every kind of art there is. Toy Story 4 doesn't break borders of imagination by its once revolutionary computer animation but it sure has a very pretty picture. The story is same as the premise of the third part of the franchise but only this time it deals with a much wider variety of topics: self-association in the society, loyalty, shattering of dreams, search for your purpose in life, definition of friendship, dissatisfaction with your current life status and the list goes on. Kids are only looking for fun and jokes to keep them entertained and they will not be entertained by Toy Story 4 what I clearly saw sitting in the movie theater - this is a movie that has grown with its viewers and is almost a quarter of a century old now. All in all this is a sweet, touching, meaningful, thought-provoking story and is a worthy addition to the franchise that I would gladly be coming back to along with all of its three installments."

The new characters get really no back story or introduction and you are just suppose to care about these characters like you do about the ones that have been around for 20 years.<br/><br/>The big complaint is how it ends. I wont spoil it for people who havent seen it, but it goes against everything all the other toy story movies go for (including the shorts). Sure some will say its a story about growth and change, but it completely ruins the whole franchise.

","Toy Story 4 (2019)<br/><br/>Watching this animated film as an adult, I was thinking during the first half an hour why was this even made? Why am I watching a cartoon about a pathetic looking spork made of chewing gum and why all the fuss about it? Couldn't they come up with something better in 9 years? As it went along, the story improved and at the end I did enjoy it but no way near as the previous ones.<br/><br/>The new toys are different from what we saw in the earlier movies and have some interesting personalities which lead to good toy-chemistry and some funny moments. The plot has some originality but at times feels repetitive with decisions being forced and characters acting inconsistent to their personalities not to mention some of them being left behind as a whole. Also, the fact that the entire plot hinges on a spork, makes it difficult to fully appreciate despite the philosophical points and messages that it sends.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the first 3 Toy Stories but I felt that this one fell short of its predecessors in establishing an emotional connection and leaving me with a feeling of overall wholesomeness by the end of the story which is sad because this is what Pixar has always been known for. As an adult, I would not say that this one is a must watch unless you are a die hard fan of the franchise or have children.

","I'm sorry, but I didn't feel the love behind Pixar on this dud. When it comes to Toy Story, I am the biggest fan, having seen every one in the theater, bought the DVD's to pass onto my kids.
Luckily I saw this in the Philippines, where I didn't have to fork over a bunch of money to see it.
The popcorn I ate was the highlight of my movie experience.
Where was the plot? Where was Andy? If you want to finish a saga, finish with a bang! There are way too many supplemental characters that I just don't care about. Are my expectations too high?
Very few LOL moments.
Plot very soft.
Wait for the DVD/download."
"lkwwesley","3","91","156","27 June 2019"," Terrible ending
","As much as I love the Toy Story universe, this one is that bad, that I would wish to not remember watching it at all.<br/><br/>The film did make incorporate a lot of nostalgic elements and over-the-top jokes that you would be sure to have a laugh and smile a bit.<br/><br/>But the plot itself is incoherent and not a bit faithful to the trilogy. It forcefully introduces a scene that has never been mentioned at all in the previous Toy Story films, and it drives the entire plot onwards. The ending was also abrupt, and the friendship and romantic buildup in the past 3 films seems completely ruined just within a few minutes at the end.<br/><br/>The ending was abrupt also because I felt like the story was supposed to continue while it suddenly came to an end. There were so, so many questions left unanswered that even should Pixar make another sequel, it will never be able to address all of them.<br/><br/>The message of spreading individualism and feminist-esque hints throughout the film seems to be screaming out too much at points in the film.<br/><br/>The individualist aspect also defeats the values of the ""Toys"", precisely every admirable act by Woody in the past seems to be meaningless and ""wrong"", simply he was not thinking for himself."
"amitbeyond","1","180","322","23 June 2019"," Really disappointing
","The first 3 parts of toy story were great but this one is made just to cash in on the success of previous 3 parts. Their is no character development, no proper antogonists, no emotions like what we had in previous 3 parts. They should have just stopped the story on part 3 itself. This has completely ruined my experience with the toy story franchise itself. Doesn't even deserve 1 star to be honest."
"eparazak","10","141","250","28 June 2019"," Emotional, funny and heartfelt, Toy Story 4 goes to infinity and beyond to prove its worth as a part of the franchise.
","Toy Story 4 was brought to us by new director Josh Cooley and, as the title implies, is the 4th installment of the Toy Story film franchise. Sometime after the events of the first film, Bonnie begins kindergarten and crafts a toy named Forky. Forky doesn't know his place in the world, so Woody attempts to show him the ropes and teach him what being a toy is like. While doing so, the two are separanted from Bonnie and the rest of the toys, where Woody learns more about the life of a toy.<br/><br/>I went into this movie cautiously and with high expectations because at first glance, this movie feels like a cash-grab. The previous film ended the franchise perfectly, and seeing a fourth on its way, I felt baffled. Leaving the theater, I was beyond emotionally satisfied, and pleasantly surprised with it!<br/><br/>On the surface, this movie is consistently hilarious. Every joke had me and the audience laughing. There are many different running gags present throughout the movie that really work both comedically, and through a storytelling point of view. Forky has a running joke where he throws himself in trash cans, which I found hilarious, and the joke didn't overstay its welcome. Ducky and Bunny are two characters played by comedy duo Key and Peele, and they're easily the funniest aspect of the entire film. They have hilarious one-liners and fantasies that had the audience bursting out laughing for long periods of time. The abundance of comedy here is also an indication that this entry is far more lighthearted than the previous one.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 also surprised me with how well it appeals to its adult audiences much like the previous entries. It has some intersting commentary on advertisement, loyalty and products that are considered faulty. Like the previous films, it also explores aspects of life. Where the previous three looked at redundancy, retirement and death, this film looks at independence. I found it to be a very interesting take on the matter that has had me thinking about said aspect since I left the theater. I really enjoyed seeing Bo Peep again, as she brings some nice surprised to the table. I thought Gabby Gabby was an interesting villain, especially as we learn about her in-depth and about her true intentions. The movie also has its emotional moments, and they're present the most throughout the last 20 minutes. It has its moments that are both very heartwarming and have the ability to make you cry.<br/><br/>I was really surprised to see that Toy Story 4 eceeded my expectations and gave us a fourth movie to the beloved Toy Story franchise that feels fresh and worthy of being part of the franchise. My only complaints for this movie are just nitpicks, so why should I care when the rest of the movie goes to infinity and beyond to make a phenomenal film?<br/><br/>10/10"
"TheGamecockNurse","1","185","333","4 July 2019"," More like a Dark and Greedy Villian than wholesome family movie
","I created an IMDB account purely for the purpose of reviewing this movie. This movie was terrible, perhaps that is a bit unfair - this movie was twisted, demonic, pointless and without the uplifting light that had been in previous versions of the franchise.<br/><br/>Do I think this is harsh? No. Disney claimed after Toy Story 3 there would be no further sequels - and while TS3 was very dark as well, it was a fitting conclusion to the final chapter of the trilogy. I am a fan of nearly all things mouse, but Disney has taken a decidedly dark turn recently. Cinema (especially children's cinema) is about escapism, happiness and good messages, this was not that.<br/><br/>Now to the review: Toy Story broke the mold when it came to the creation of animated cinema. Toy Story 4 felt like a mashup of Mission Impossible meets Child's Play. The usual sight gags, and innuendos are not there, instead jump scares, refuse jokes and poor dialogue were utilized for a few cheap laughs, that left a theater full of children mostly silent, and their parents chuckling a couple times.<br/><br/>The central theme of the movie seems to be that Woody can't let go of making sure that Bonnie (the new Andy) is happy. Woody reconnects with an old flame - and a love story is born, where there didn't need to be one. Time drags on as Woody (who is sans Buzz for most of the movie) tries to rescue this lost toy again and again, ultimately failing on his own without the help of a new group of toys.<br/><br/>Buzz for his part is turned into a bumbling idiot, who hearkens back to when he first discovered he was a toy. Repeatedly pressing the buttons on his suit believing they are his ""conscious"", and making poor choices based on them as well.<br/><br/>The antagonist is a toy very similar to Lotso (TS3 villian) who hasn't felt the love and affection they want, steals from others to get it, so children are taught that as long as what you take benefits you - it's OK. Ultimately the antagonist is partially redeamed at the end, just in time for the gang to get back together again.<br/><br/>Except - remember the love story above, Woody abandons his previous position of making his child happy, and instead decides to throw it all away for the woman of his dreams, in a very channeling of Jerry McGuire Woody splits up the dynamic duo of Woody and Buzz and instead decides to go play house for all the misfit toys.<br/><br/>Two final notes, there is no mini movie beforehand, and the after credits scene that use to be bloopers are instead some more garbage in the vein of the end of the movie. Highly disappointing, saddening, and depressing to see that Disney instead of allowing a Franchise that revolutionized an era to remain on high, instead is bringing it crashing down for it's insatiable love of green."
"shawneofthedead","10","241","442","19 June 2019"," A masterpiece of film-making, story-telling and animation. Delightful and devastating in equal measure, it might well be the year's silliest and most soul-stirring film.
","THE LOW-DOWN: 24 years ago, Pixar's Toy Story quite literally changed the face of animation as we know it. The film presented an entirely new way of telling a story, bringing characters to life via CGI - pixels over pencils, so to speak. At the same time, Toy Story set a new high standard for storytelling in film, proving conclusively that animated movies aren't just for kids. In the intervening decades, the franchise has even made a strong case in favour of sequels - demonstrating that they're not necessarily soulless cash-grabs. Toy Story 4 is very much a part of that grand tradition. This is smart, soulful, sublime film-making: somehow entertaining and profound all at once.<br/><br/>THE STORY: Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is trying his best to adjust to life with Bonnie (Madeleine McGraw) - the little girl who inherited Andy's beloved childhood toys at the end of Toy Story 3. Even though he's forgotten more often than not, Woody remains intensely focused on Bonnie and her happiness. This means going into full babysitter/bodyguard mode when Bonnie creates Forky (Tony Hale), a spork with twists of wire for hands and clumsy wooden popsicle sticks for feet. As Woody tries to keep the trash-oriented Forky safe, he's swept into an accidental adventure - one in which he meets old friends and learns new truths about who he is and who he has yet to be.<br/><br/>THE GREAT: Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Toy Story 4 is the fact that it feels like the natural, necessary final chapter of a story told in four parts. There's no way that any of this could have been planned when Pixar first introduced us to Woody in 1995, but the progression in both narrative and character development feels utterly organic. Woody has spent the last three films grappling with his existential fear of being lost, forgotten or replaced, from his first meeting with the brash Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) to the day Andy outgrew him and went away to college. This film challenges Woody - and his audiences - to think hard about second chances, about changing how you look at yourself, about finding and embracing a new purpose in life. As such, Toy Story 4 might be the most philosophical movie you'll see this year, in the best possible way.<br/><br/>THE NOT-SO-GREAT: There actually isn't all that much to complain about. The plot machinations can feel a little clunky at times, but Stephany Folsom and Andrew Stanton weave so much joy and humour into their screenplay that the film still zips along. As this is very much Woody's movie, fan-favourite legacy characters like Buzz and Jessie (Joan Cusack) inevitably end up taking a back-seat. Even then, however, they each still get moments to shine. You might find yourself both thoroughly amused and mildly annoyed by the antics of Ducky (Keagan Michael-Key) and Bunny (Jordan Peele), a symbiotic pair of new characters who were clearly inserted into proceedings for comic relief.<br/><br/>FORKING FUNNY: Give it up for Forky, surely the best new animated character of the year. Voiced with a bewildered tenderness by Hale, Forky is a delight - a walking, talking identity crisis created out of one little girl's love and imagination. Even better? With his magnetic attraction to all nearby trash-cans, Forky is a fandom meme just waiting to happen. A close runner-up is daredevil stuntman Duke Caboom, who reportedly owes his ridiculously charming posing and personality to current internet darling Keanu Reeves' commitment to the role. Toy Story 4 even manages to make its main antagonist, Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), both terrifying and endearing - although there are fewer shades of grey when it comes to her ventriloquist-doll minions, led by the determinedly creepy Benson.<br/><br/>COWBOY BLUES: Ultimately, Toy Story 4 belongs to Woody, and rightfully so. He is this franchise's Captain America, in more ways than one. This film pays loving tribute to Woody's big heart and unwavering, self-effacing loyalty, even as it shakes up his life and world-view when he encounters old friend and possible paramour Bo Peep (Annie Potts) again. (Bo, by the way, is now super-cool and as far away from a fragile damsel-in-distress as anyone can be.) Woody's decisions and revelations about himself will make you weep with the most complex and bittersweet of emotions. There is joy and sorrow here, hope and heartbreak, final farewells and new beginnings, often in the same moment. In other words, it's the stuff of life itself, and it's glorious.<br/><br/>CREDITS WHERE CREDITS ARE DUE: You'll definitely want to stay throughout the credits of the film, which are peppered with closing scenes that are essential to tying up the overarching narrative. At the very end, you'll even be rewarded with a happy ending for one of Toy Story 4's most minor of characters.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDED? In every possible way. Toy Story 4 is a masterpiece of film-making, story-telling and animation. Delightful and devastating in equal measure, it might well be the silliest and most soul-stirring film you'll see this year."

"murlac","3","121","214","25 June 2019"," Pixar's biggest mistake.
","Toy Story 4 fails to convey the nice universe of our favorite toys. For starters, the writers seem to have forgotten the personalities of the original characters and the bond they share or simply they didn't care about it. It's a shame how they portray characters like Buzz as dull and plain dumb, just following a very forced narrative. Jessie hardly makes any statement nor she shows the least interest in Woody anymore. Woody easily forgets about Bullseye and I can't get the picture of him not having a leader spirit anymore. He's relegated by Dolly taking his place. He used to be the one that gave purpose to the group, instead this film wants to make him the forgotten toy that has lost all true essence. Not a single toy he lives with tries to help him out. The rest of the characters just lay aside, briefly shown and without any engagement. They focus a lot on the new characters, which is not a bad thing but the problem is how they disregard everything else, losing all logic and trying to force the plot.<br/><br/>To be honest, it feels like a lot of short films were made and they tried to put them together through a general line that doesn't get through. It goes without saying that it has its moments though not enough to accomplish the pixar film element, also, not enough for the Toy Story quality. There's a lot of references that may be a lot for children, making it weird sometimes.<br/><br/>Visually stunning, great music, a few funny jokes, entertaining in general, lacking plot, quite bad old characters' development, ok new characters but not remarkable.<br/><br/>This film shouldn't had been made, not with the Toy Story name on it. If they wanted to make a story of some new toys it could have been a fine spin-off but not involving the original story line. I'm sorry to give it such a low review as Toy Story was of such a big influence to me. This might be the worst movie Pixar has developed and biggest mistake."
"ncruz-77996","7","123","219","23 June 2019"," And I Thought This Film Would Suck...
","Introduction:
Like many people, I thought this film would be the weakest in the series, and a pointless sequel. But man, I was wrong. We were all wrong. From the first trailer, I thought it would have been disappointing, like I was with 'Incredibles 2', but I can say with much confidence, that 'Toy Story 4' was another satisfying entry in the 'Toy Story' series.<br/><br/>The Story:
After the third film, me, like any other thought there was nowhere else to go with the series. As it felt like the perfect final chapter. However, it turns out you could still expand the story. As the writers thought of a perfect ending to the story of Woody. As in the film, Woody feels as if he doesn't belong, as cowboy doll is likely to not get the attention a little girl. Which leads to a satisfying ending to his arc. Not only that, but this is probably the most mature film in the series, as it deals with themes of independence, and being loved. The film also has very good comedic writing, in my opinion. This film is a logical progression of the story of the 'Toy Story' trilogy.<br/><br/>My only real issues with the story, is the fact that the other characters take a lot more a backseat than the other movies. However, this is Woody's movie, so I should expect it to not focus on them. And it is only a small criticism I have with the film's story.<br/><br/>The Characters:
Both the new and old characters are either, just as good as they were in the previous films, and the new characters are nice additions to the 'Toy Story' series. They all go through a logical progression and grow as the film goes on, and the same thing goes for the new characters.<br/><br/>Animation:
Like the previous films, the animation is just as good, and true Pixar level 3D animation. Of course the good animation quality is gonna be good, it's Pixar. But I still felt it's something to praise.<br/><br/>Conclusion:
In conclusion, this film is an entertaining watch, a logical progression of the story, and a surprisingly satisfying film. It was worth the 9 year wait, and I loved this movie as much as the other films in the franchise. And some of Pixar's best work."
"joepvt","7","115","204","30 June 2019"," No magic
","Toy story was special because of the bonding between the toys themselves and between them and Andy. Now that they are with Bonnie, you'd expect to get that same feeling. It did not develop. In contrast, she bonded with Forkie and the gang was an excessory."
"tigerized","3","98","172","8 July 2019"," Just OK. Ending Left Me Very Unsatisfied
","I had a hard time not puddling up at the end of TS3, even though I'm now an old man who grew up on all things Disney. But I started to have my suspicions about TS4 when visiting Disneyland recently, when I saw the pre-release merchandising of the Bo Peep and Forky characters. Wow, what kid is going to warm up to a spork (other than Bonnie?). After seeing the film, I can only conclude that TS4's primary goal is simple; sell more stuff. Very pale when compared to the previous ones, the supporting characters are now mere afterthoughts, Buzz has been dumbed down (weak batteries, perhaps?). The rest of the gang, who all had fully developed individual personalities, have very few lines this time, seemingly only there as window dressing.<br/><br/>Bo Peep, however, becomes the new focus of the film. No longer shy, sweet, and demure, she's now Bo Rambo flexing her considerable physical skills with cold detachment. I have no problem with strong female leads, but at what cost to the TS story line? She's no longer the Bo we grew to know and love. Run, Woody! Run!<br/><br/>Ah, well. They should've stopped at TS3, and not ruined much that they achieved with the dark and disturbing ending of TS4. No longer celebrating a toy's altruistic higher calling, cynical self-interest is the new path to a happy ending."
"knaylor112","2","149","269","23 June 2019"," Entertaining but Ending Will Leave You Empty Inside
","No need for a long review. Movie did not need to be made. Characters made decisions that made no sense based on their actions of the previous three films. You had no time with all the characters of the previous three films instead we are treated to trendy new voice actor characters. Keanu Reeves (Duke Kaboom) etc... feel forced in there to replace all the characters that we went to see the last 25 years! The ending was terrible. Toy Story 3 was an Oscar contender for best film. Toy Story 4 is a contender for Pixar's grand cash grab of the year. Take the kids for fun but don't think of it as Toy Story canon."

People just want to relieve the past thinking what was good in the past is same now........no its not. As a parent I don't recommend the movie, Because of surreal settings that seem more gloomy and depressing than happy and cheerful. At some point I can't believe this was a Disney movie it's hard to believe it was. I feel sorry for the parents who brought their five and six-year-olds to this movie because if they did those poor kids will have nightmares right after.

They summed down Buzz's character which was a pity since we saw him evolve so much through the first 3 films. He was behaving as though he was fresh ""out of the box"" again with limited understanding of himself. My 11 year old couldn't sleep last night because he was so upset with the way things were left off. Very disappointing.

The story seemed to be written for an entirely different era. Not even 90's, this creepy depressing film was written for the early 80's but not in a cool throwback sorta way. There was almost no story or plot and they tried way too hard to get emotional to the point where one toy after another was just trying to outdo the other to see which toy had the biggest disappointing and depressing rejection and separation issues with children. Hey Pixar, here's a little refresher....it's 2019 and kids don't play with any of these toys. Sheep and skunk remote control overplayed. First time a toy was controlled in a way that is not possible and seen by people. Just bad bad bad from start to, well, I assume finish, for those die hard who actually endured to the end of this animated yawn fest. There were a few scattered laughs but they were far and few between. The old antique toys were as creepy as the Annabelle doll so I figured I might as well go into the next theater over and see the new Annabelle if I want to see a creepy doll. Don't waste time taking kids to this. They were getting fidgety and some started whining and crying by the time I left."
"aciessi","10","135","244","23 June 2019"," To Infinity and Beyond.
","Toy Story. The animated franchise that has defined me as a filmgoer, filmmaker and writer. I'm turning 24 next month, and Toy Story has damn-near been in my life for all of those years.<br/><br/>The first film was released on Thanksgiving of 1995. I was 4 months old, sleeping in cribs, without any indication of what movies where, or for that matter, any kind of entertainment. But little did I know it would be the first film I would ever watch. The VHS was released the year after, and as I was learning to walk, talk and play, Toy Story played in the background. Something inside me clicked while I watched it. I was enchanted by it's world of make-believe. A world of talking toys. What more could a little kid want? My mother swears that I knew every line of dialogue from the film by the time I was 2 years old. Woody and Buzz where my bread and butter. I had both of them as toys of my own. To me, I was no different than Andy, because Andy was every kid in the world. What Toy Story so astoundingly captured was the bond between a child and his toy. It's unmistakeable and iconic. Needless to say, Toy Story was the family film we never knew we needed, as as a feat of technological genius, one of the finest films ever made.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 was released 4 years later. By that time, I was old enough to see it in a theater. I'm happy to tell you that I still haven't forgotten the memory of seeing it nearly 20 years ago. My parents took me, and I took my Woody doll with me. We went on a cold and snowy November afternoon. I placed Woody next to me in my seat as the theater lights dimmed to darkness. We loved it. Not to mention, not a single dry eye in that audience during Jessie's ballad, ""When She Loved Me"". But from that experience, I vividly remember leaving Woody behind in the theater, and we had to drive all the way back to retrieve it. Life imitates art.<br/><br/>The gap between Toy Story 2 and 3 was 11 years. That's an eternity to a child. That's your entire elementary and middle school years in the books. I had enough Pixar movies in between to hold me over. By the time Toy Story 3 was released in the summer of 2010, I was already finished with my freshman year of high school. This time, I didn't see it in theaters, and I still don't know the reason. Was I going through a phase? Was I becoming cynical? Did i think I outgrew the material? Lord knows. I watched it when it premiered on cable later that year. That same spirit still stuck with me. The trilogy was complete, the toys left Andy and there was nothing else left to say.. or so we thought.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is here. I wouldn't blame you if you feel weary about that. If ever there was a film franchise that shouldn't be milked to death and exploited until every last capital of it has been exhausted, you are looking at it. To even justify a fourth installment, they needed to work hard and get it right. The weekend isn't over and the jury is still out, but i have my verdict. Toy Story 4 is necessary and beautiful. To all fans of the series and any fan of animation, drop what you are doing and see this now. This is worth an hour and change of watching non-streamable content. This is how cinema lives on in the year 2019. For me, as a grown man, this brings it all full circle.<br/><br/>We pick up right where we left off, with the toys belonging to little Bonnie. Still going on grand adventures in the bedroom. It's the first day of kindergarten for Bonnie, and she's too shy and scared to make any friends. Lucky for her, Woody comes to rescue and provides her with supplies to make her own friend. From there, we meet Forky. The product of what happens when toys play God. He's a stick figure made out of a spork, with a serious existential crisis. He keeps throwing himself in the trash. That's right, Forky is suicidal. You couldn't have a Pixar movie without throwing in a little dark social commentary. Bonnie and her parents take a road trip to an amusement park and the toys come with. But Woody gets carried away while guarding the troubled Forky. Woody and Forky get left behind after another episode, and vow to catch up to the park in the morning. As they walk into town, a vintage antique store catches Wood's eye with memorabilia attributed to Bo Peep, the toy that got away long, long ago. The antique store is filled with lost, abandoned toys, including a lonely girl doll named Gabby Gabby who's only friends are creepy ventriloquist dummies who stand upright on their own.. yeah, they are just as creepy as they sound. Forty is captured and Woody escapes the store. He lands in a nearby playground filled with even more abandoned toys, where he is reunited with none other than Bo Peep. It's been a long time since Woody has seen her and she's gotten a 2019 upgrade since. She's a swashbuckling badass now, accompanied with her tiny adorable sidekick, Officer Giggle McDimples. Woody and Bo join forces with Buzz , two smart-ass plush toys (voiced by Key and Peele) and a Canadian daredevil biker (voiced by Keanu Reeves) to save Forky and return him in one piece to Bonnie.<br/><br/>I could gush about this film for hours. First, on a technical level, Toy Story 4 is the most gorgeous looking film of the series. You can see every scratch, blemish and texture on every toy. Gone are the awkward polygons and fuzzy graphics of the Windows 95' generation. I was captivated by everything, from the photo realistic backgrounds to the shining reflective porcelain that gleams off of Bo Peep. It's as sharply funny as any of the Toy Story films, with enough adult asides to keep anyone in the audience from being alienated. It brings the series to an appropriate end that, while wasn't entirely necessary after the third film, concludes the journey of Woody and friends in a totally satisfying way.<br/><br/>Do I envision watching Toy Story 5 at 40 years old? Or 6 at 60? I don't know, but if indeed they are in the works, and if they are as lovely as all 4 previous films have been, I'll warmly invite the opportunities to see more. These movies awesome.

"tcsintampa","3","70","121","4 July 2019"," Massive Betrayal of the Toy Story Series
","Watching Toy Story 4 provided a similar experience to viewing last year's Incredibles 2. In the darkness of the theater I appreciated elements in both movies, but in the light of day upon further reflection afterward, I found many discrepancies and disappointments with both films. The main difference between the projects, however, was that Toy Story 4 made me angry.
In many ways, the teaser trailer was accurate: the arrival of Forky, a good idea with a bland execution, singlehandedly derails the series in a weak plot that seems fit for an extended short more than a feature film.
Bo Peep may have been Woody's love interest in the first film, but she was also quick to switch allegiances to Buzz when he wowed the toys with his gadgets and abilities, declaring ""I've found my moving buddy"" when the space toy enters the scene. (She ironically calls Buzz her moving buddy in this film also.) Beginning the fourth movie with a touching moment of Woody and Bo Peep saying goodbye was to set up the later story arc, but it falls short and feels disingenuous. Perhaps years of being on her own, away from the toys in Andy's house may have hardened her, turning her into a badass, but it doesn't ring true. Instead it feels like a set-up to make sure she fits the Disney mold of how strong women characters behave. The audience is also left to wonder how in the world she changed out of a porcelain dress. Was the switch to pants one of the ingredients needed to complete her badass makeover? I don't see her character making such a drastic change. As in life, women in films can still be strong while preserving a less in-your-face demeanor.
The movie's main conflict is based upon weak premises. Buzz Lightyear's unexplained character metamorphosis is disquieting. While the ensemble approach worked well with the previous films in the series, Toy Story 4 is too focused on introducing new characters while relegating the ones we already love to the back of the RV. The villain, Gabby Gabby, while given sympathetic motivations, was clumsily written. This didn't feel like a Toy Story movie overall.
The part that completely ruined it, though, was the ending, which was telegraphed but not motivated. Not only was it predictable based on the trailer and comments from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen about the last scene, but Woody's leaving everything behind feels completely out of character. It's a regress of his arc from all the previous Toy Story movies. How is his leaving the gang to be with Bo different from leaving the gang to be with Andy in college? After all, the arc in that film was all about letting go. Why does suddenly not being Bonnie's favorite compel him to leave her behind? After all, doesn't he have her name on his boot? How is staying with Bo different from going to Tokyo with the Roundup Gang if his kidnaping had been delayed by ten years? Acting on selfish impulse goes against Woody's core character and beliefs. What's worse, the rest of the gang freely let him go when in actuality, they would have insisted he stay like they've done in the past, while asking Bo to join them. Won't Andy be upset if he finds out that Bonnie lost Woody, especially since he was hesitant to give him up? After all, Andy asks Bonnie to look after his toys for him; he doesn't give them to her outright.
Also, the mid-credits scenes basically reduce Woody to a common criminal, which not only teaches a horrible moral lesson but goes against his principles. When Woody meted out justice in Toy Story 2 and 3, he did it to great effect and only because the other toys (Stinky Pete and Lotso) had it coming as payback for how they had behaved against all of them. The retribution was not because of a personal offense against Woody himself. What did that poor carnival worker ever do to him? Woody hadn't even known about Buzz getting tied up at the carnival, so there's no reason for him to act so heartlessly. And it is hard to miss the irony that his motive in giving away so many of the carnival game's toys was to make sure they were each given a chance to be adopted and loved by a child, the motive that had kept him with Andy, and later with Bonnie, all along.
The scene of Woody leaving was too rushed and felt clumsy. The way Bonnie's parents drove their RV to be in position for it to take place strained credulity in a movie that had already asked viewers to do so on previous occasions. (Just how long would it take a 12-inch tall doll to walk more than 5 miles?) Even if the writers were going for the romantic angle, it did not ring true, since Woody and Bo's reaction upon finding one another again was no more than cordial. Honestly, if it ended with Buzz and Jessie going off on their own for some reason, that would make a little more sense, because Toy Story 3 established their strong romantic connection. Woody's letting go of Bo would have been a much better ending. Some people predicted from the trailer that Bo would become a villain, but even though she officially doesn't, she appears darkly manipulative, leading Woody away. If it was all about Woody moving on because he is a natural leader, then that doesn't justify joining Bo since she's already the established leader of that group.
This movie has been rightly compared to Ralph Breaks the Internet, and even though Vanellope's motivations for leaving felt rushed (and, like Toy Story 4, featured a highly telegraphed ending in the trailers), it worked better because it felt relatively consistent with the character arcs of both her and Ralph. Plus, at least that movie left open the possibility of the lead characters seeing each other again. In Endgame (SPOILERS!), the reason Captain America's ending works is because not only has his love for Agent Carter been long established, providing believable motivation for his choice at the movie's conclusion, but he also has been feeling out of place in the modern world since The Avengers. Endgame, even with its major death, feels more satisfying because its conclusion fits with the arc that was established over multiple movies (End Spoilers). Toy Story 4's ending feels wrong because it was built upon hastily-constructed motives that are supported nowhere else in the franchise. If Woody's departure was inevitable, then framing it around an older Bonnie giving up the toys after years have passed would have made more sense. That would have given Woody slightly better motivation other than simply being upset about not being a favorite (again), even though Bonnie could easily just be going through an anti-Woody phase. This way, Buzz's line about Bonnie not needing him would make more sense. It also would have worked in real-time since years have passed since the third and fourth movies, just like the gap between the second and third.
If Toy Story 4 had been a stand-alone film, it would not be receiving such high praise. The only reason we cry at this ending is because we love the bond established in the previous three films. True fans of the series would do their best to ignore that this ever happened and cap the series at 3 (as well as the Toy Story Toons and TV Specials). It's only the second-worse Pixar movie because it wasn't as boring and forgettable as The Good Dinosaur.
Indeed, if ""story is king"" at Pixar, it is clear the monarch has officially been dethroned."

","While Toy Story 3 was bad, it felt like decent finale because the whole film was about closure, as opposed to the final 3 minutes because of a character's decision to say goodbye forever.

WHAT THE HELL!!!!!!). I personally think that 2 was a good, satisfying ending, but that's just me(and every smart moviegoer). Here's the plot: A toy who doesn't want to be a toy manages to escape, Woody goes after him, they talk their problems out, get back in time, the self-hating toy learns to accept himself, and the ending of the movie sets up a female counterpart of a character established in this movie; Sound familiar? I thought so. Also, and this is the biggest sin of the whole bunch, they had Keanu Reeves. Not only are they banking on the meme, but they even messed up on that. If you're going to use the man of the year in your movie, make it so we know it's him. While he didn't add ANYTHING to the movie, his existence raised this movie from a 2 to a 3 because we should all be more like Keanu, the perfect specimen of mankind.

Woody feeling lost. Again, more sadness. The story line fell completely flat. More forgotten toys. Come on!! There must be more ideas for a great kids' movie in your idea room somewhere?? Buzz's beloved wit and spark were gone. It was as if they removed his little toy brain. He couldn't think for himself, didn't know what to do, was reverting back to pressing his buttons to know what to do. *Face palm. The new characters were ok. But somehow missing the heart of the original characters. The antique store scenes were dark. The dummies were close to terrifying but the worst was the unbelievably horrible scene where Woody's voice box was surgically extracted and given to another toy?!? There was NO spark to this movie. At all. And the end was overly disappointing. You can't separate the toys!! This may have been labeled a kids' movie but the only thing ""kid"" about it were the toy characters. The theme was definitely way too mature for kids. My Kids were not impressed, but left feeling so sad. What a horrible ending to a wonderful empire.

","After just seeing Toy Story 4, it was an enjoyable film, but definitely the weakest. Now unfortunately my complaints are spoiler filled, sorry about that. My main issue is the connection between woody and Bo peep, and why he chooses to stay at the carnival. I'm sorry but there really was no established connection between these two in the original 3 Toy stories. And cramming it into one film feels rushed and not well executed, especially woody's decision. The final scene was not only predicable, but made no sense. After Bonnie ""stops playing"" with woody, he realizes he wants to help other toys find their kids and stays with bo peep, which reminder these two barely talked to in the first two movies. The reason this makes no sense is because this is what happened IN THE FIRST FILM. Remember when Andy stopped playing with woody? But he was still always there for him. He never gave up on Andy. Here he's just like ""well Bonnie will be ok with out me by guys!"" Like what? This makes no sense. He even says he never gives up in the movie, except he just did. He gave up because ""Bonnie doesn't play with him"". You see what I mean? A forced ending to pull at your heartstrings to make you sad. An unsatisfying ending to a not needed sequal. That's not to say this movie is terrible. It's got some great animation, great music, and the dummies were really creepy, and I loved the shining reference. However the ending really ruined it for me. I left the theater with an ending that wasn't as satisfying as the third. In my eyes the ending was the third film and this is an alternate timeline. Not a must watch but it's enjoyable."

","I know I'm about to parrot what everyone else is saying, but it's true. Toy Story 3 ended on a very definitive note. It felt the like the final chapter had closed and that there didn't need to be another film. Not to mention that after having created what is generally considered one of the strongest film trilogies ever made, Pixar would be tempting the fates by creating another one. But they did it! Toy Story 4 is an utterly entertaining film.<br/><br/>This film's feel seems to be created to directly contrast with 3. Whereas the last movie was darker and felt stretched out, this film feels more lighthearted and fluidly compact. This is the installment that is trying the most to have fun.<br/><br/>Don't consider this purely a frivolous film. The ending is almost as strong as in the last movie, and I felt that one was only better only by a thin margin. Things get pretty emotional.<br/><br/>The entire film is about Woody (Tom Hanks) having an existential crisis. Once a favorite plaything and the leader of Andy's toys, Woody is now one of his new owner's least played with toys and being a newcomer, no longer the leader. His whole journey is pretty compelling.<br/><br/>The biggest reason this movie justifies it's existence is that not only do we have closure for Bo Beep (Ghostbuster's Annie Potts), but her character is finally given justice. In the original film, it seems she was part of the cast just because they needed at least a couple female characters. Her role didn't serve much purpose other than to be Woody's girlfriend. Same with the sequel. You could've cut the character out, and it wouldn't affect anything. Then, in number three, she was just out of the story entirely, having already been sold to a new owner. The writer's reasoning at the time was that due to the heavy action scenes, I'm guessing primarily the moments where the toys are roughed up by toddlers, Bo Beep being porcelain and fragile was difficult to include. Here she's finally give her due. She has more personality, she has agency, and she is finally part of the action and story.<br/><br/>New character Forky (voiced by Veep and Arrested Development's Alan Hale) is an inspired creation, a handicraft toy made out of a spork who's dealing with sudden sentience. He works well interacting with Woody as they share questions about their existence in the world. I actually felt the character was underutilized a bit. (It did annoy me a little that the writers were selective about how much or little knowledge of the world Sporky had.)<br/><br/>The new villain Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks) is yet another emotionally damaged toy. Don't worry about her being a clone of the last two. They go down a refreshingly different path with her.<br/><br/>Though I enjoyed the story, I do admit that the movie basically copies the formula of the first two films by having a few characters separated from the others and going on a journey. The movie may as well be called Woody Story as the majority of the cast is sidelined for the film and even Buzz is more of a supporting player. A lot of time is spent on the new characters. Though I can't complain much as they all are pretty entertaining. (Ducky and Bunny (Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele) bring us the funniest joke in the entire series.)<br/><br/>I'd rank this only under number 2. TS4 is a blast and I recommend this to all Toy Story fans."

","I don't know how to feel, maybe this movie just wasn't for me. I mean, I am a 22 year old man at this point but that shouldn't really matter. The previous movies have character and a plot that makes sense. This movie was just all over the place. We can start with the pacing, it was all over the place. The movie went from a slow moving plot to a montage in moments. It didn't feel coherent at all. The characters that we have gotten to know through three whole movies where no where to be seen. I mean we barely got any time with Buzz Lightyear or Jessie or any of the rest of the gang. Instead we got a story about Woody still being sour about not being the favorite toy anymore (the plot of the first Toy Story anyone?) and how he finds his purpose in getting his kid to be happy behind the scenes. And the ending, I mean in what world would Woody leave the gang after 20+ years together just to be with one other toy? The whole plot of the other movies are that what matters most is friendship and being loyal? What happened to that. Nonsensical plot, weird pacing and most of all it destroyed the great story that the three previous movies had built up over the course of two decades."

","Toy Story 4.... a sequel that nobody asked for after how perfect the ending was to Toy Story 3, now I love The Toy Story series, it's always been the most perfect movie trilogy ever, clever, funny, meaningful, the animation is revolutionary, wonderful characters and so much more, this is what made Pixar who they are today, so I was quite scared for a fourth movie, I mean what else can you do with these characters?, instead of John Lassiter and Lee Unkrich, it's now Josh Cooley as the director of this new adventure with Woody and the gang, Pixar was nice enough to release it in the UK the same day as the US, I saw it on the 22nd of June, successfully avoiding spoilers and...... wow, this series of films just get better and better, so let's talk about it.<br/><br/>While at Kindergarten, Bonnie who is now the new owner of Andy's toys, with Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jesse (Joan Cusack) and many more, she creates this character named Forky (Tony Hale) using arts and crafts materials, Forky may seem like a innocent toy, but he thinks he's not a toy, he thinks he is considered trash, so Woody has to stop him from going into the garbage, it makes it worse since Bonnie and his family are taking a vacation, Woody and Forky get lost, they end up in a antic shop, where Forky has been help captive by Gabby Gabby who is a creepy doll that has been in the shop for a long time, so Woody has to find him and get him back to Bonnie, now... where do I begin?, first off this is a really well crafted story, it has messages and themes throughout the entire movie just like the other movies, but the themes here are more meaningful and it can connect and relate to those who find the themes in the movie amazing, it is also funny, lots of clever humour and funny moments sprinkled throughout, it still has the same amount of heart that it always had, it's touching and especially emotional towards the end (don't worry, I won't give anything away), it's entertaining throughout and it put a big grin on my face, it had a lot of amazing ideas put into it as well and... the ending, It's such a heartbreaking and super sad ending that yes.... I cried, I cried with tears coming down my face, a popular example of a sad ending was Avengers: Endgame, I didn't cry at Endgame personally, but this movie.... this movie still had me thinking and I was still emotional after seeing it, the Pixar team did the best they could with the material that they got, they created a fantastically well put together plot, with strong writing, great humour, entertainment, wonderful heart and a really tear jerking ending that is a wonderful way to end the saga.<br/><br/>The animation is just unbelievable, Pixar has come along way with their animation, the first movie's animation was groundbreaking and new, they improved film by film, but here they really outdone themselves, this attention to detail in the animation is just incredible, each character has a wonderful design to them, the new characters look especially interesting, with Forky being the best looking character with what he can do, the backgrounds are photo realistic and beautiful, it's got great character animation and movement to it, when it comes to the fair ground, there's colour and beauty to it, the antic shop is old and grey but also somewhat scary, it has amazing lighting and cinematography to it, not much else to say but a visual achievement by a incredible animation studio, they went from groundbreaking animation, to mind blowing and jaw dropping animation, this is why Pixar is amazing at that they do.<br/><br/>The characters are truly wonderful, old and new, Woody is a even more fleshed out character then before, there's
More purpose to him, he has a goal and hard choices to choose in the course of this movie, but still charming and loveable as ever, Buzz is still the loyal friend to Woody who would always help him whenever he needs it, Jessie is still a entertaining and likeable character, in fact the rest of the supporting characters from the other movies like Hamm, Rex, Slinky, Bullseye, Mr. And Mrs. Potato head are still funny and entertaining, the toys that Bonnie have are also the same, Bo Beep returns and is even better then she was before, her chemistry with Woody is wonderful and funny, now for the new characters, there's Forky who's charming, funny and plays a somewhat big part in the movie, Gabby Gabby was one character I didn't expect to love, but she was great, there's more to her then you would expect, Bunny and Ducky are really funny supporting characters, Duke Ca-Boom is a lot of fun, not only are the characters just amazing, same can apply to the voice acting, Tom Hanks is just incredible as Woody, Tim Allen is amazing as Buzz, Joan Cusack is wonderful as Jesse, everyone from the previous movies are amazing, the new characters have great voice actors too, Tony Hale is charming as Forky, Christina Hendricks is quite intense as Gabby Gabby, Key and Peele are funny as Bunny and Ducky, Keanu Reeves is surprisingly great as Duke Ca-Boom, the characters fully represent what it's like to be a toy, they have humour, heart, entertainment, whit, charm and great voice actors behind them, it's what make them truly a wonderful group of toys.<br/><br/>Wow......, this series feels completed now, after Toy Story 3 I didn't know how the fourth movie was going to top it, but it found a way and it did it in a amazing way, Toy Story 4 is a strong Pixar movie with incredible writing, animation that is mind boggling, characters with humour, heart and purpose along with terrific voice acting, Josh Cooley did a amazing job directing this movie, now... there is NO and I repeat NO need for a fifth movie because there is nothing else you can do with these characters, so I just want to say.... Pixar, thank you, thank you for all the good times with these characters, they made me laugh, they made me cry, they are always fun and entertaining, the movies have been incredible and moving, not one bad bit of filmmaking, but like all good things, it might come to an end and this ended off with something truly powerful and perfect, Toy Story 3 started the decade off in 2010 and now the fourth movie is ending the decade off, so it has been fun being with these characters and their adventures, we don't need anymore adventures, we have what we need for a saga... or should I say the best saga ever!..... so for that I want a big heartfelt and honest thank you to Pixar, I will continue to watch and support what you make and I do hope... that you continue to do more amazing stuff, hopefully Onward and Soul will be amazing also, so it's been fun but we made it to Infinity and Beyond...<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 most certainly gets a 10/10!."
"vivifan","2","33","55","3 August 2019"," Toy story 4 is a waste of time, stupid story, pointless, lacking charm, heart, passion, soul of what made the first three films special. Do not watch if you are a fan.
","Toy story 1 2 and 3 were amazing films, great animation, music, story's, comedy, drama and characters. Toy story 4 is in my eyes one of the most over hyped, boring, forced, stupid, lackluster and disapointting films. Politics and social justice being put in this film don't help it either. The animation may look great everything else falls flat. The new characters are underdeveloped, lame and unintresting. The plot is childish and has a lame ending, the old characters are bearly in it and stay in a van throughout most of it, the acting is ok, the writing is lacking those great morals and themes found in the previous films. Buzz is an idiot which doesn't make sene since in the last three he was a smarter character then this. What was the deal with the inner voice c''p?! the villain is weak and doesn't feel as good as previous villains. To me the villain was lootso from toy story 3 but a poormans version of him. The jokes are mostly c''p and can get old real quick. Bo makes a return and they made her a mary sue, Bo at the start of the film said she is leaving woody for hardly any good reason she just says i have to. Bo doesn't have a backstory about how she became this tough fighter. This film should be avoided at all costs and it ended fine with three. Toy story 1 2 and 3 are awesome films, 4 tho hack no. It doesn't derserve all the hype it's getting."
"T-ZER0","4","78","143","24 June 2019"," A Major letdown hear me out
","When I heard there was going to be a Toy Story 4. I was unsure at first, but then I shrugged it off. I thought to myself, maybe they can do it. Then John Lasseter left Pixar and Disney and I started to worry. They never did a Toy Story movie without him, so I was very scared.<br/><br/>Then when I heard about the new plot revolving around Forky. I had a bad feeling inside, like this one wasn't going to be that good. Reluctantly, I saw the film.<br/><br/>I can say I know why people like this film, but for me it was a major letdown, which I will explain:<br/><br/>Andy gave Woody to Bonnie hoping that she will take care of him over all the others, but she brushes him aside for a piece of garbage like Forky. Also, how did Dolly become the leader of the toys? It's like they are subliminally forcing Woody out of the franchise. So they go on a road trip, Woody keeps trying to prevent Forky from committing suicide. (Which I admit sounds dark, but was really funny. Nice touch Pixar). Then Woody notices Bo's lamp. On the way to find Bo, they encounter the so-called ""villain"" of the film Gabby Gabby. She happens to be the worst villain out of all the Toy Story villains because she serves no purpose other than an annoyance.<br/><br/>But she's got Forky I guess, so Woody gives up his beloved voice box to make that whackjob happy. To make a long story short, Gabby Gabby ends up finding a kid (and still has Woody's stolen voice box!). Woody decides to stay with Bo Peep and gives up his Sheriff star to Jessie. I like that it symbolizes that she's his successor, but it never would've happened if dumb Bonnie hadn't done it during playtime in the beginning.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure Woody and Bo are even a couple. They didn't act like one during the movie. I sort of wish they kept the original script of this movie, which was Woody missing Bo Peep, then him and Buzz go on a mission to bring her back home. Speaking of Buzz, he's dumber in this movie. For some reason he thinks his voice box is his ""inner voice"". When he should know that it's not because he figured that out on the first film!<br/><br/>Then the two dumb stuffed animals voiced by Key are in this film. They are so annoying as well. In the past Pixar made characters that we all could love, now, without Lasseter, it seems like they are just frustrating!<br/><br/>There's not much to say about the other toys, because they were barely in it! But I'm sad also that Bullseye didn't go with Woody. I mean, is he Woody's horse or Jessie's horse? Make up your minds!!<br/><br/>As a fan of the first three films, I wouldn't recommend this film to others, but if you do watch it, don't get your hopes up. It's not as good as you think."
"somethingobscure-79455","4","38","65","10 July 2019"," A TV movie stretched to nearly 2hrs. starring a forgettable minor character
","Was it really needed? No. But then again, although a good movie, was Toy Story 2 needed?<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 continues in an even lesser memorable vein than Toy Story 3 did aptly falling in line with the law of diminishing sequel returns.<br/><br/>What should've been a TV movie or direct-to-home-video / streaming release got stretched into a mildly entertaining 1hr. and 40min. feature-length romp.<br/><br/>The plot follows an underdeveloped, nearly-unintelligible, toddler by the name of Bonnie. Bonnie has gone onto to adopt Woody, Buzz, Jessie The Yodeling Cowgirl & the rest of the original Toy Story 1 & 2 cast of characters (Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, RC, Hamm, Slinky Dog, Rex, etc.) from their previous 1&2 owner, Andy. The original toys this time are supplemented by Bonnie's line of unoriginal totally forgettable generic (mostly) stuffed toys. The toys, along with her and her family, set out on a road trip in an RV to an unnamed destination.<br/><br/>The plot is kicked off when Bonnie creates a makeshift toy out of a spork (her only contribution to the story), and other craft accoutrements, flies out the window of the RV sending Woody on a wild goose chase for the self-loathing overtly zany toy. Woody and Forky end up finding themselves in a dusty antique shop where Forky manages to get himself captured by a creepy vintage doll by the name of, Gabby Gabby, aided by her creepy vintage ventriloquist doll henchmen. Her only motive for being malicious is wanting to get Woody's voice box in order to get rid of her long deteriorated one.<br/><br/>In order to save Forky, Woody needs some help and, luckily, ends up running into the previously minor character of Little Bo Peep, who has now become an ownerless swashbuckling adventurer who is familiar with the territory of the underwhelming antique store. The rest of the movie consists of them scrambling around the floor and shelves of the store while running into new mildly amusing forgettable characters such as an Evil Kenevil-esque toy and two neon-colored stuffed bears estranged from a carnival all led by Bo Peep.<br/><br/>For a simple straightforward unoriginal uninspired plot of a rescue mission, the movie sure does get dragged out. Dragged out by what? Nothing. The original Toy Story characters we've all come to know and love, when cut back to every now and then, are relegated to some of the most meager speaking parts for any iconic movie characters with minor animation of briefly coming to life only to immediately go back to acting inanimate whenever the clumsy Bonnie barges in on them. For the most part, except for Buzz, they remain trapped motionless in the RV.<br/><br/>The two spearheads of the series, Woody and Buzz, don't have much to show as Woody comes off as a more frantic version of his usual good hearted, ""saddle up even though you're scared"" persona with Buzz coming off as a total drugged-like jittery moron who constantly consults his pre-programmed voice box for advice the entire movie. As for Jessie The Yodeling Cowgirl, all Toy Story 4 has to say to her is, ""Who?"".<br/><br/>Let's talk Little Bo Peep. Why make a movie center around an infinitely minor character, who isn't a toy, but instead a porcelain lamp? You got me. It seems as though the scriptwriters couldn't come up with anything for her other than she's an exaggerated annoyingly stereotypical version of Marion Ravenwood from the Indiana Jones franchise. Except here, Bo Peep, has a fatalist dark attitude about remaining a Mad Max-type loner in the land of misfit ownerless toys. Despite all these vein attempts at trying to make her compelling, she remains a cardboard cut-out of a character who cannot carry the movie in any impressive way as all she does is bark orders and has several airborne moments. She's the equivalent of a bit-part character actress carrying a multi-million dollar movie.<br/><br/>In the end, there's virtually no conclusion. Forky ends up rescued and now considers himself a bonafide toy with his previous attitude of being makeshift garbage gone. The villainess of the movie, Gabby Gabby, does not get reprimanded for holding Spork hostage and cutting out an unconscious Woody's voice box but instead a sob story of a character as all she really wants is to be the toy of a loving little girl - which she gets! The only Toy Story movie where the baddie does not face consequences for their wrongdoings but instead gets rewarded. You think, at least, there would've been some sort of climax where Woody and Bo fight off her creepy henchmen, but no. They disappear into thin air.<br/><br/>Woody shrugs and then goes onto become a ""misfit"" toy with Bo Peep as he gives the nearly non-present Jessie his sheriff's badge and literally watches the script's final pages nosedive into the ending. The original gang of toys drive off into the night leaving the viewer with the feeling like the shooting script may have been the first draft.<br/><br/>By the time the credits roll, Buzz hasn't gained anything. Woody is in limbo. The other toys didn't have showtime so they can't earn anything. That is aside from the rewarded pop-out-of-nowhere Jessie who gets promoted and the uber-quirky Forky's lame internet motivational meme self-esteem booster lesson. As for Bonnie, this has to be the only main character to not be a main character.<br/><br/>Is the film a cliffhanger? Hopefully not.<br/><br/>As much as I've bashed this new entry, I have to ultimately say that it did have its harrowing and funny moments and kept me entertained but as for whether or not you should see it I'll remain agnostic."
"kjunkin-24748","2","22","35","6 August 2019"," A ""progressive"" and ""woke"" take on Toy Story
","As an adult its easy to pick apart the faults of children's movies. However when the target audience doesn't like a movie its probably the most damning evidence of all. My two year old who is normally a holy terror most of the time, will sit and watch all three toy story movies in a row and barely move. No matter how many times he watches them, its still the same thing, his full attention is on the movies. When we watched Toy Story 4 in theatre (his first time ever at a theatre as well) he stopped caring about a third of the way through. That probably says it all. From my own perspective though, this movie is a piece of garbage. The animation is incredible, which is about the only good thing you can say about this film. The list of its sins is much larger. Shoehorning ""progressive"" values throughout the movie, turning woody and buzz into idiots who can't think for themselves, Bopeep treats Woody like garbage, at one point another toy asks if Woody is Bopeep's friend, and she replies something like, no he's my doormat, then throws her hat and coat at him for him to carry. The ending completely contradicts the concept of the preceding three films; woody has a slavish devotion to his kid throughout the movies, and all that is upended because he decides to run off with some liberated toy who treats him like garbage. What was the point of the previous films if it all comes down to that. A lot of the elements of the movie are parts borrowed from the previous films, but usually with a stupid twist. The list of things this movie does wrong goes on and on. But as I said, these things are easy for me to see as a parent. But a little boy who adores the previous films not liking this movie says more than I could"
"TeddyKeaton","1","57","102","7 July 2019"," Sigh...
","I would consider myself an above-average fan of Toy Story. I kinda grew up with them. I even have a couple of the figurines of the Pizza Planet aliens on one of my bookshelves. And I always love when 'the gang' comes around again, and this time was no exception. For me, Toy Story 3 ended perfectly, and I honestly didn't think they'd make another one! So much to my chagrin, they have. I went in tonight with no expectations, other than the hopes that film would bookend (hopefully) what came before. I have to admit, the beginning was overly sad, almost morose, while the middle got increasingly bizarre, leading to an ending that felt, well, off. It didn't feel right. You can argue all the live-long day about why the filmmakers are brilliant in their choices, or why they did what they did with this film, but ultimately what matters is how the movie made you feel. This movie doesn't FEEL like Toy Story. It feels like an off-shoot of the series, with the characters we know (and actually sorta love) acting OUT of character. The finale is peculiar in that it didn't leave me smiling as I left the theatre like the previous three did. If I were to wager a guess, I think, perhaps, what happened here is that Pixar didn't have enough people going, hang on, are we getting this right? It's how I imagine The Last Jedi got made... too many 'yes men.' I remember reading a story where Rashida Jones left this project because of creative differences. I wonder now if she was, perhaps, the only one with the nous to stand up for what Toy Story has always been about... sticking together. The creators behind this one certainly didn't."

It just goes against the philosophy of all the other movies. Toy story 3 showed us a heart broken Andy that unwillingly leaves his old toy so that Bonnie could give it the love that he deserved again, in this new movie bonnie is completely over Woody and doesn't play with it anymore.

"Red_Identity","Null","93","174","25 June 2019"," Absolutely fantastic.
","This was a fantastic, fantastic film. Although there are some more noticeable flaws than in past TS films (the handling of Buzz being the biggest flaw, as I thought it was a downgrade to his character), I think the highs of the film are up there with the highest highs of the entire franchise. The same trademark humor, dialogue, and emotion is in this film as we've come to know from the past, with perhaps even funnier scenes than in past films. The adventure at its core is handled brilliantly, and the new characters are incredibly well-developed and have some of the best arcs of the franchise (Gabby as an example). With that, however, comes a much smaller role with the characters from the past we've come to know and love, although this seems fitting in a way considering the way the film ends. This is Woody's story through and through, even more than in past TS films. Although many thought this would be un unnecessary films considering the perfect conclusion of the third film, this story that serves as an epilogue actually does feel necessary now that all is said and done. At least for Woody's character, it closes his arc beautifully, in a way that opens another chapter in his life. In many ways this really would be the final ending, but it could also serve as a new beginning for its main character and I could see them continuing the franchise (although I really, really hope they would stop).<br/><br/>As another note, Bo Peep is such a great character but she also seems completely different from how we knew her in the first films (and I don't just mean after all of the years have passed, but even in the scenes that take place in the past)."
"vangondour","4","50","89","30 June 2019"," Underwhelming doesn't even begin to cover it
","It's probably cliche as hell to say this at this point but the point still stands, Toy Story 3 was one of the most perfectly conceived and executed endings to a trilogy in movie history. So when it was announced by Pixar that a fourth movie was in the works I was sceptical at best and terrified at worst. And boy was I right to be worried. Sitting through this movie was an incredibly dull experience for me and my friends, we were willing to give it a chance yet it still disappointed. The plot is paper thin and covers all the old ground of the other movies but significantly worse, the voice acting was passable with Tom Hanks probably giving the strongest performance, the animation and lighting was easily the most enjoyable part of the film, this is Pixar's best looking film and it's a marvel seeing how far they've evolved since the original Toy Story. This isn't enough to save the movie however as the amazing visuals are constantly overshadowed by the mediocre writing and story.
Overall this movie doesn't really try in regards to the story, the animation really showed how much effort was put in to make this the best looking Pixar film, but beyond that it's pretty shallow. Check this movie out if you just want to see Woody and Buzz again, but if your looking for a movie that is anything above mediocre you'll be severely disappointed."

"kjproulx","10","96","181","21 June 2019"," A Worthy Addition to the Franchise
","Like many movie lovers who grew up in the 1990s, Toy Story was one of the staples of childhood when it came to watching films. After the release of Toy Story 2 in 1999, many believed the franchise had ended, until a third film came along over ten years later. Really putting a capper on the Toy Story story as fans knew it from the beginning, Toy Story 3 was a definitive conclusion. So why was a third instalment even in the works? Until the release of the movie, that was the question on many viewers' minds. Personally, upon the initial announcement a few years back, I was against this movie, but I've loved these films since the beginning, so of course, I was going to check this one out, and I'm glad that I did. Toy Story 4 has earned a worthy place in the franchise in my eyes.<br/><br/>Picking up pretty soon after the events of the third film, we now see how our favourite, loveable toys have moved on from their previous owner (Andy) and how they've settled in with their new one in Bonnie. Without getting into the specifics of how or why a new toy (Forky) is introduced, I'll just simply state that Bonnie builds him at school and he miraculously comes to life, giving Woody a new job, so to speak. The plot really kicks into gear, However, when Forky is thrust onto the street during a family vacation, and the Woody/Forky excursion begins. Each toy has a moment to shine, but this truly is a film about Woody.<br/><br/>I could immediately dive into negatives and say that Buzz Lightyear doesn't have enough screen time or that reference and lines of dialogue from previous movies are slightly repeated too much throughout the duration of the movie, but that would just be me complaining about an otherwise near-perfect animated film. I had nitpicks here and there while watching the movie, but I just have to be honest and say the overall movie surrounding those inner quarrels were just scratches on a canvas that was painted beautifully as a whole.<br/><br/>As always, the animation is astounding and life-like at times, which feels a little funny when comparing it to how simple the animation was in the original film, so the movie was beautiful to look at. On top of that, this is a film filled with heart, that cares about its characters, and even takes the time to introduce many new, memorable faces along the way. From Ducky and Bunny to Duke Caboom, these new characters will actually remain in my mind as memorable side characters, which is what many sequels fail to do these days.<br/><br/>In the end, fans of the first three movies are more than likely going to love watching this instalment, newcomers will get a fresh story now that a previous chapter has been closed, and fans of comedy will also get many clever laughs here as well. I'm not ready to call Toy Story 4 my favourite film of the franchise by any means, but in terms of character progression, emotion, and an overall extremely enjoyable film, I would be lying if I didn't say that I loved it. Yes, I have minor issues, but they are so small that I just feel like giving this one a perfect grade, which I haven't given to many films in 2019. Toy Story 4 is a wonderful time at the movies and I highly recommend it."
"Anurag-Shetty","10","92","173","23 June 2019"," A fitting finale to the Toy Story franchise, we didn't know we needed.
","Toy Story 4 continues with the adventures of Woody(Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen), Jessie(Joan Cusack) & the rest of the toys. A new toy named Forky(Tony Hale), joins Woody & the others. A road trip with old & new toys shows how massive the world can be, for a toy.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is a mind-blowing film. Director Josh Cooley has wonderfully brought us a very unique & unforgettable Toy Story movie, after the superlative Toy Story(1995), Toy Story 2(1999) & Toy Story 3(2010). I was skeptical when I first found out that Pixar was making this film. Toy Story 3(2010) was the perfect conclusion to this franchise. However, I stand corrected. Toy Story 4 fantastically wraps up the adventures of Woody, Buzz, Jessie & the rest of the gang. The animation is top-notch. The 3D is eye-popping. The humor & emotional scenes, have been perfectly balanced throughout. The vocal performances are the highlight of the movie. Tom Hanks is spectacular as Woody. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear. Annie Potts is outstanding as Bo Peep. Tony Hale is hysterical as Forky. Keegan-Michael Key & Jordan Peele are amazing as Ducky & Bunny, respectively. Christina Hendricks is excellent as Gabby Gabby. Keanu Reeves is hilarious as Duke Caboom. Ally Maki is good as Giggle McDimples. Joan Cusack is incredible as Jessie. Madeleine McGraw, Jay Hernandez & Lori Alan are superb as Bonnie, her dad & mom, respectively. The supporting cast is good. Toy Story 4 is a must watch for all Toy Story fans & families.

","The funniest scenes were in the previews. The rest was either boring, predictable or a cheap laugh. I only actually laughed out loud ONE time! I was very disappointed. I went into the film with a low bar set since the idea of forky was pretty lame right off the bat. But it didn't get better. The first film was great, the second better than the first and the third better than the second. Then there was this movie... this was a unnecessary continuation of Woody's story. The best thing in the movie were Bonnie's other toys and they were barely in it. I'm just horribly disappointed. I wanted to like this, but just like Ralph Breaks the Internet, it didn't live up to the hype put on it. Only thing good was the animation."

","Toy Story 4 is directed by Josh Cooley, you may recognize him from Inside Out, he was one of the writers, and it's his first full length feature movie. Writing Credits: John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Josh Cooley, Valerie LaPointe, Rashida Jones, Will McCormack, Martin Hynes, Stephany Folsom.. (original story), Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom.. (screenplay).
And starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Joan Cusack, besides some new members like Tony Hale as Forky, Keegan-Michael Key as Ducky, Jordan Peele as Bunny, Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom and Christina Hendricks as Gabby Gabby.<br/><br/>Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) has always been confident about his place in the world, and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that's Andy or Bonnie. So when Bonnie's beloved new craft-project-turned-toy, Forky (voice of Tony Hale), declares himself as ""trash"" and not a toy, Woody takes it upon himself to show Forky why he should embrace being a toy. But when Bonnie takes the whole gang on her family's road trip excursion, Woody ends up on an unexpected detour that includes a reunion with his long-lost friend Bo Peep (voice of Annie Potts). After years of being on her own, Bo's adventurous spirit and life on the road belie her delicate porcelain exterior. As Woody and Bo realize they're worlds apart when it comes to life as a toy, they soon come to find that's the least of their worries.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the Toy Story saga, I loved all the predecessors, I think Toy Story 3 is one of the best movies of all time, and the first Toy Story movie is one of the best comedies of all time.. also Toy Story 2 -as lots of people agreed, myself included- is one of the best sequels of all time!
I thought TS3 has the best conclusion to this amazing saga, and I didn't expect a TS4 at all, and when they announced it, I had no clue how this movie will go after the amazing emotional conclusion we had in TS3... Untill the trailer that I really loved, but I also THOUGHT that it showed too much, why did I say it like that? 'Cause I was wrong, and everyone who thinks that the trailer showed too much, I respect your opinion, but it didn't.. at all!
I don't wanna spoil anything until everyone gets to see this masterpiece in theaters, but I'd say that the trailer misguided us, in a perfect way, don't get me wrong.<br/><br/>Okay, where do I start?... Let's start with how people was truly trashing this movie, before even the trailer! I mean I understand that people were afraid, but at least give it a chance.. I guess now they would, because the movie got some pretty serious amazing reviews everywhere.. and I'm so happy, cause this movie is a blast, I was totally blown away of how well-made this movie is! From the cinematography to the funny scenes, to the score, the animation, the new crew, characters -old and new-, the emotional beats to the conclusion, maybe.. we still don't know if it's the last or not, but they gonna make it as wonderful as the saga is, go on, I'm in!!<br/><br/>Let's talk about the cinematography, it's Josh Cooley's very first full feature movie, and I was concerned a little bit, because John Lasseter did an amazing job with the first two, and Lee Unkrich was magnificent also, he did a fascinating job with the third one. So did Josh Cooley with TS4, every scene was just beautifully directed, with a great animation... Actually, TS4 has the best animation of ALL TIME, Pixar really did an amazing job with this saga, from the very first CGI animated movie, to a very great improvement, to the best of the recent time, until TS4.. the best so far.... It never was that realistic before, even Incredibles 2 wasn't that amazing.. this is the animation of the decade, every shot felt SO REAL!!!!<br/><br/>The score was amazing.. again! As a comedy, this movie made me cry from laughing like 3 or 4 times, and all the rest of the movie was really funny too!
People were actually asking if they have to bring some tissues with them, I'd say.. yeah, bring a lot, cause my theater was wiping, I lost it even more than I did in TS3.. it has a very good emotional conclusion and I loved it!
The plot, is really cool, no spoilers, it's just.. surprising.. go with no mentality and have fun with it, cause whenever you feel like it's another episodic Toy Story movie -as the trailer showed us- the movie won't stop surprising you!<br/><br/>The new members were really great.. Bunny and Ducky are really funny, Forky, the one that I was really thinking that he's going to annoy me, he was great, really sweet and cute, and of course adds a lot to the movie. Duke Caboom is amazing, it's a great role for Keanu Reeves, there's a story behind him, I felt it was unnecessary, but it helps the movie somehow.<br/><br/>As flaws, finally.. in this year, I found none.. this is a perfect flawless movie, the one and only so far that really deserves the highest grade, best movie of the year so far, but I don't think that something is gonna surpass it actually, to be honest.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is NOT just another Toy Story movie, it has a great message to EVERYONE, so emotional, funny and beautifully animated and directed, Toy Story 4 of course gets an A+!<br/><br/>Alright, guys.. thank you for reading my review, look forward to more reviews really soon, especially the Toy Story saga reviews which is really soon...

","Just when I thought Toy Story hit its peak with 3, the fourth chapter comes out of nowhere to offer up an equally effective helping of smart, emotional and funny storytelling that made its predecessors timeless masterpieces resonating with all ages. The writing remains top-notch, exploring thought-provoking dilemmas that have the protagonists (and audience) often second-guessing themselves and make the villains and their motivations understandable and investing. I also found 4 to be the funniest of the series. Forky, Ducky and Bunny (played by Tony Hale from Arrested Development, Key and Peele, respectively) are the comedic highlights; I was legitimately laughing out loud at their dialogue and antics. Toy Story 4 is far from the cash grab many thought it would be. It's sharply written, beautifully animated and brings the series to an emotionally satisfying conclusion. What a journey."

Tom Hanks and Tim Allen really get back has the voices of Buzz and Woody perfectly, has well the other gang. Keanu Reeves steals most of the movie has the voice of the daredevil toy Duke Caboom. I also like the way it never really ends the way you think it will. Just a fun adventure for the whole family.

","After the first three incredible movies, it didn't even feel necessary for the franchise to be continued. Many people, myself included, felt satisfied with Toy Story 3's ending. There was a lot of pressure placed on this seemingly unnecessary addition, so I'll keep it short and sweet.<br/><br/>The plot was messy, focusing on re-introduced and new characters, except for Woody of course. The original characters barely had any lines let alone screen time.<br/><br/>The message/focus was very unclear. The whole movie felt like it was absorbed in this 'new beginnings' concept, which is especially strange considering it is the final movie.<br/><br/>The movie compromises everything the other three stood for; friendship and loyalty. Woody finds himself on a journey of self discovery, and faces the concept of being 'kid-less' and independent.
He chooses this new, selfish life over his friends, In a scene which is the literal complete opposite of Toy Story 3's ending; when he chooses to stay loyal to his friends.<br/><br/>I could complain about this movie forever, I don't understand the point of it at all. It's ruined what was previously left to the imagination after Toy Story 3, now I sadly know there is no happy ending. Hence I will be pretending it does not exist, I wish I never watched it."

"sweidman-28016","8","37","65","29 June 2019"," Another Enjoyable Addition
","Toy Story 4 Review:<br/><br/>When a new toy called ""Forky"" joins Woody and the gang, a road trip alongside old and new friends reveals how big the world can be for a toy. This was written and directed by Josh Cooley, the man who also wrote one of my favorite Pixar films, Inside Out. So obviously most everybody had the same reaction to the making of Toy Story 4: Why are they making a fourth one when the third one ended it perfectly? Yes I thought that but honestly I wasn't nervous for it. There hasn't been a single just good Toy Story film. They're all great. Naturally I assumed it would be good but a little unnecessary. I thought this was another great Toy Story film. I don't really need to get into voice acting that much because it's basically the same people and was all great. The person I was most nervous for was Tony Hale as Forky. The character was also my main concern for the film. Until I saw it the thought that consistently went through my head was: They made a movie about a spork. I thought Forky was a good addition. He actually wasn't as annoying as he was in the trailers. His voice seemed annoying and irritating in the trailer. I didn't want to sit through a 100 minute movie with that constantly. But he was actually one of my favorite parts. The relationship between him and Woody was one of my favorite aspects. The relationship between all the characters in this added so much to the story all thanks to a wonderful script. I thought the plot of the film was good. It's a little weaker than the first and third but there's so much heart in it that it makes up for it. The many conflicts that arise, from making Forky to funding Bo Peep, kept the story going without a single slow moment. The emotion and tone consistently sets the mood well. Some are saying this has a sad moment, even more than the end of Toy Story 3. That moment was kind of bittersweet like the previous film, but I thought the sad part was just a little before that. If you've seen it, you probably know what it is. Overall it's a good script with meaning. The only thing I'd change is Buzz just kind of felt off for me almost the whole film and the end sort of makes me upset but that's just me. Also there's some dummies that really have no purpose but to look creepy and to chase them a little. It's not how they looked but I just didn't like them. Now the animation in this is absolutely stunning. In particular there's a scene with a thunderstorm and everything looked real except for the toys. I thought Coco had the best animation but now I think it's this. That is something amazing an animated film can do: have great animation and an amazing script to make it actually seem like it's plausible to happen in real life. Also just a quick random fact: Throughout the franchise there's many allusions to The Shining so look for them in this one. I'd highly recommend seeing this. If you haven't seen the others I'd suggest maybe watching those first but if you have basic knowledge you should be good.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"
"mkvinson","4","41","73","14 July 2019"," Should Have Stopped at 3

"FrenchEddieFelson","8","52","95","29 June 2019"," Yes, I canada!
","As usual in the Toy Story saga, the script is secondary and based on the same pattern: a toy is missing and must be rescued, no matter what, as in any brotherhood. The sophisticated dialogues, the plot twists, the hilarious and subtil interactions between the manifold characters, ... this is truly an excellent family movie and definitely not just-another opus conceived in a mercantile or even mercenary purpose.<br/><br/>The new characters are awesome, especially Duke Caboom (interpreted by <a href=""/name/nm0000206/"">Keanu Reeves</a>) and Forky (interpreted by <a href=""/name/nm0355024/"">Tony Hale</a>).

","For most of the film, it was everything I've come to expect from a Pixar movie. It was fun, creative, and funny. The animation was spectacular. They've come a long way since the first film.<br/><br/>The ending, however, was a complete disappointment. For one thing, it flew in the face of what we had come to know about Woody from all four films. It wasn't consistent with the character. But more important than that, the message/lesson was that it's ok to be selfish. Woody had built his life and reputation around loving and serving others, and he threw all that away."

","I'm a lifelong Toy Story fan. I had been aggressively looking forward to the fourth installment for years, since the day I first learned it was in development back in early 2015. Saw it opening weekend and walked out feeling I had been robbed. The film starts out wonderfully in the first few minutes, it goes back it in time to the glory days of TS2. Then it switches to present day where it dramatically collapses under its weight. I was always a bit cautious of this film's production given how TS3 was the definitive closure to the series and the perfect send off to all the characters I grew up with and cherished so much. However I had genuine faith and allegiance to Disney that they would do no harm to Pixar's most beloved franchise. Most of all, I had faith in John Lasseter. Say what you want about him as a person, but the man is a creative genius. He literally put Pixar on the map, and nobody understands the lore and essence of the Toy Story franchise better than Lasseter. Plus I truly do believe that he cared about these characters like family, and wouldn't have wanted to make another installment unless it felt necessary and that there was a remarkable story to tell. I understand that Lasseter's original vision for the film was fundamentally different. He was scheduled to co-direct with Josh Cooley and wrote a film treatment with Pixar's Andrew Stanton. The first was originally to be released in June 2017 before being delayed to June 2018 and eventually June 2019. Lasseter was fired from the project in mid 2017, while Rashida Jones & Will McCormack (the film's original writers) withdrew in late 2017, citing ""philosophical differences"". This is where I believe things started getting fishy and the film went from being a passion project by the creators of the franchise to a film by committee.
Sigh... this movie just gets it all wrong. From the the pacing to the thinly-veiled and dramatically unconvincing plot to characters & scenarios that only exist as macguffins, to classic characters being sidelined in favor of new ones that are hollow, one-dimension and can't stand their own ground and are un-riveting/ off putting to the audience. So many character decisions that contradict their decisions/ideologies from previous films. There's one character in particular whose personality and character development from the previous films is completely obliterated for no justifiable reason, and its just depressing for fans to witness. There are some pros tho: the setting (which funnily enough they don't make the most out of), the stunning visuals, Annie Potts' performance of Bo Peep. Also it was fun seeing Woody and Bo reunite. Some may argue that the film existed to complete Woody's arc, but I beg to differ as I believe his character arc had perfectly reached its end in TS3. But the worst of all, the ending. The pseudo-emotional ending felt completely contrived, unfeasible, flat and too short. Overall Toy Story 4 felt like a soulless cash grab unfortunately and just doesn't resonate like the previous ones do. The only positive to come out of this is that it made me appreciate TS3 on a whole new level and everything it stood for. Now THAT was the real ending to the series and was the lighting in a bottle that Disney shouldn't have tried to recapture. But in a way they did though, since this film made over a billion worldwide. Unfortunately Disney always gets the last laugh."

","When I heard about the 4th movie is coming, like everyone else I thought it wasn't necessary. But after I learned that movie will be about Bo and Woody, I'm starting to get excited. Because I wanna learn what happened to her. And I am also happy, our friends (Buzz,Jessie,Rex...) and Woody will go in a another adventure. But things didn't go the way I hoped. The old friends that we know from the other 3 movies have nothing in this movie. Buzz is my favourite character in Toy Story. He's just like a new Buzz in this movie. He just acting like a stupid and thinking himself a space soldier. Like as they reset him in the third movie. When watching this movie I thought are they reset him again? Jessie just blew the wheel in a 100-minute movie. So many new characters. And actually I don't know what you think but I don't care them. I just wanna saw the old friends that I know from my childhood. I just wanna see them doing thinks together.<br/><br/>I actually liked the story. (Not the ending, ending is the worst ending i have ever seen in a long time.) If this adventure was not only include Woody, If it's include Woody and the rest of team (Hamm,Rex,Jessie,Buzz...) that can be great. By the way, The Woody that I know never left his friends. (Especially if you watch the second movie you can see what i am talking about.) And I wanna say something about Gabby Gabby. She stole Woody's jukebox. She's selfish, she just thinks herself since the beginning. Did you really expect us to be happy for her in the end? However, this movie still has beautiful,enjoyable and laughable moments. That's why I am gonna give 4/10.<br/><br/>If you like it, I'm happy for you. I really want to like it before I saw it. But I don't.

","Am a big fan of Pixar and have been for two decades or so. Have not loved everything they've done, 'Cars 2 and 3' and 'The Good Dinosaur' (to a lesser extent too 'The Incredibles 2') disappointed though certainly didn't dislike any of them. Their best work though are masterpieces, for me the previous three 'Toy Story' films, 'Inside Out' and 'Coco' fit this distinction as do most of their short films.<br/><br/>Was in two minds when hearing that there was going to be a fourth 'Toy Story' film. Am somebody who would see the latest Pixar film, regardless of critical reception, at the earliest opportunity, not for nostalgia but for being an animation fan and having appreciation for high quality stuff. But it is very understandable that people are saying that they questioned the point of this being made and that 'Toy Story 3' was a perfect end, that was the very first reaction felt when first hearing of it. Those who weren't bowled over by this shouldn't be crucified for feeling underwhelmed and feeling that it was unnecessary.<br/><br/>My aforementioned initial reaction was still not completely quashed finally seeing 'Toy Story 4' for myself. Thought actually it was still a good film, namely on its own, but if quickly getting any comparisons out of the way it is quite a bit below the quality of the first three 'Toy Story' films and as far as Pixar films go it's towards the bottom in my opinion. Which is actually not a bad thing, it says a lot about how brilliant much of their work is. A lot of great qualities, but the disappointment from some is understandable.<br/><br/>The story is a slight one and can feel over-stretched, especially when in the latter antique store scenes. This is the only 'Toy Story' film where the pacing was flawed in my view. It is a shame too that most of the original gang are underused and their material not being much of note.<br/><br/>Buzz didn't have the same spark and it was like those involved had not remembered what made him so memorable. The ending is proof that the ending of the third film was the perfect note for the 'Toy Story' films to go out on, because this one is one of the most anti-climactic and unsatisfying-in-outcome for any recently seen film (for me that is).<br/><br/>However, the animation is superb and the component that actually improved with each film, although that in the first is ground-breaking. Was transfixed by the vibrant colours and rich background and character details, toys and humans. The antique store and fairground settings are vividly done. It was great to have Randy Newman back on board again, not easy to imagine a 'Toy Story' film without him and the magic hasn't been lost. Reprising ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" was a genius move and that was what stuck out most memorably in this particular regard.<br/><br/>Enough of the dialogue is witty and sharp, 'Toy Story 4' is far from laugh a minute but it is a long way from humourless. The best laughs coming from Ducky and Bunny, Duke Caboom was fun too. 'Toy Story 4' is not without soul either, found Gabby to be one of the Pixar's most empathetic and interesting supporting characters of their 2010s output (a ""villainous"" character that is not really a villain). Forky is likeable and his chemistry with Woody, on top form, is charming. It was great to see more of Bo Peep and her personality more developed, a mix of sympathetic and sassy. Her chemistry with Woody, which one really feels, is one of the film's biggest pleasures.<br/><br/>Voice acting is terrific, Tom Hanks, Annie Potts, Christina Hendricks and Tony Hale standing out. Didn't recognise Keanu Reeves either.<br/><br/>Overall, good film but not a great one. 7/10"

","I would rank the 4 movies in the series in order of best to last 1, 3, 4, 2.
This is more plot driven than the others, to bring the series to an end I suppose, with chuckles and laughs spaced far apart.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Buzz Lightyear is seen sparingly so the give and take between Woody and Buzz is missing, replaced with Woody alone front and center. There's no Bullseye, the other characters really aren't involved to the same degree of the others. Rather dark but not as bad as #2. Just average, go to see how they end the series if for nothing else. Entertaining, but not their best effort."

It's more of an uncritical depiction of human behaviour rather than a true and useful lesson.<br/><br/>There's a flurry of harshly negative reviews at the top of the list here, but somehow this cash-in is rated above 8?

","Character development was thrown away from the previous three films to make way for the final installment. Buzz was a drone throughout the film, never showing his guts and making him foolish. Woody had blind loyalty and never gave up on his kid until this film. He had the heart to help the another toy but became a sacrifice lamb and then gives up on his kid at the end. Gabby Gabby is the villain and not misunderstood as Disney tries to make us believe. She kidnaps a toy, holds him ransom to steel something of Woody's, then we are made to feel sorry for her without any true reason. Not being played with because of a broken voice box does not make me feel bad for that character after she's created an evil scheme to fix her own problem. Most of the main characters/toys from the original films barely had a part. I figured with Bonnie, we'd have a lush story with her toys and Andy's but that was ignored.<br/><br/>Comical performances from Tony Hale, Key and Peele, and Keanu Reeves were enjoyable but not necessary to a film that lacked character structure and arc. Their comic relief was not suited for this film.<br/><br/>I personally won't consider this film as part of the canon. It ends on the third film beautifully. This film ruins the original three."

","There's going to be people who are going to hate Toy Story 4. It's pathetic that people go to the movies wanting to hate this movie and that every time they see a flaw, they're going to talk about it too much, and bring out the film as if it would be bad. We're here. It's definitely not a perfect movie. When was the last time we saw a flawless animated film. For my part, it never happened. In the first few weeks, people will love the film but the more the weeks go on, the more bad reviews will come out. That's what happened with Incredibles 2. For those who will pay to go trash against the movie, try to enjoy all the excellent moments that Toy Story 4 offers us. I've always been a fan of the trilogy and when I knew they were going to make a fourth film, I was a bit worried but I didn't think it was going to be terrible and when I went to the movies I wanted to love the film. In the end, I adored it. Josh Cooley has demonstrated that he loves the trilogy and the characters. A few people will say that they were missing minutes on screen for several characters but we had a lot in the last film. Directing, cinematography and animation for this movie was arguably the best of the Toy Story films. The pacing wasn't quite perfect and at one point it looked episodic but it was a film with beautiful morals and very touching moments. The first 40 minutes or so were more than excellent. The ending (without spoilers) was sad but not as much as Toy Story 3. Yet it was heartbreaking. It's the funniest Toy Story movie from my point of view. The villain was very well written and her acolytes were scary. Forky was hilarious. Tom Hanks vocal performance was his best. All in all, the movie is really great and it is my favorite movie of the year so far. For haters, enjoy the film and do not try to put everything on small details."

"williamjosephmaples","5","15","24","8 August 2019"," Concept over story
","These four movies have largely had the exact same plot which revolves around lost toys finding homes and strangers seeking companionship. While the third really elevated the simplicity of these movies for me by showing the darker emotions that stem from being cast out, the fourth is such a weak return to form that it leaves me wondering why it even needed to exist.<br/><br/>The plot is only there to service the statement that the creators wanted to state, which I will leave out if you haven't seen the film yet. A non-existent villain, weak time constraints, a very on-the-nose new character, and a whole lot of melodrama about growing old that is not unique to this movie make me wish that the final ""revelation"" about the toys was fit into the third entry or just ignored altogether. It's something that sounds sweet outside the movie, but the point is hammered into your brain so blatantly that it loses the deftness with which Pixar so famously tells their stories.<br/><br/>All in all, the film felt mediocre and served as a weak goodbye to these characters that already cemented their friendship powerfully in the previous movie."
"mikogaid","10","49","93","28 June 2019"," It's Surprisingly Amazing!
","Toy Story 3 seemed like a perfect ending for so many, which is why they hated the idea of a fourth film. But for others, especially the Pixar crew, the journey's not over yet for Woody and his pals. To quote Anastasia's grandmother: ""It's a perfect beginning.""<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 culminates welll the character that shaped the series as a whole-Woody. It gives Woody a whole new perspective in his post-Andy life, that is to reach out a toy in need to make its life worth enjoying, and he did it through Forky and Gabby Gabby. His reunion with Bo Peep, now better than ever, even strengthens that purpose.<br/><br/>About the new characters, I find them to be enjoyable and funny (thanks to Ducky and Bunny, both voiced by the witty Key and Peele). Duke Caboom is one Canadian standout, and not too stereotypical. I also like the way Gabby Gabby stands out from most Toy Story villains who are toys just like her. Stinky Pete and Lotso are bullies who have grown to hate children and never believe in love. Gabby Gabby however, treats the heroes (especially Forky) and her minions well and wants to be loved by a kid and believe in it. That opportunity has been sadly hampered for years by her broken voice box, leaving her abandoned in an antiques store. She reminds me of two Toy Story 2 characters: the aforementioned Stinky Pete (a vintage doll yet to be played with for decades) and Wheezy (abandoned due to an internal defect). Moreover, she is the first Pixar villain to be redeemed onscreen without being defeated, and I like it!<br/><br/>The movie has a meaning of giving a second chance, which is shown in Gabby Gabby's path towards redemption. No wonder the antiques store has a fitting name to it.<br/><br/>Overall, it's the movie I enjoyed for something most fans thought would fail."

","We're only half way through the year but I think it's safe to say we may have already discovered our favourite cinematic character of the year, in the form of an animated fork, named Forky.<br/><br/>But I digress, more about Forky later, as the colourful new addition to the beloved Toy Story universe is but one of the reasons why this at early times surprising fourth film in the billion dollar franchise is yet another big win for Disney and Pixar studios, in what's likely to be a crowd pleasing box office smash.<br/><br/>Filled with the ever expanding workmanship and eye-popping craft of Pixar's evolving and stunning CGI work (from rainy nights, to the glistening porcelain of the returning Bo Peep), Toy Story 4 sees debut feature filmmaker Josh Cooley bring back the whole gang for a whip smart adventure that touches on a number of themes and conversations that centre around finding ones place in the world and ones meaning when life around it is constantly changing.<br/><br/>As usual however, these themes are wrapped around a big old barrel of fun, something that's always been a prevailing factor in the Toy Story films and what made them quickly become such a worldwide favourite and with some great new additions and a fairly wild ride for our characters to partake in, Toy Story 4 is arguably the outright funniest film yet in the franchise's history.<br/><br/>As Woody, Buzz and the gang (who it must be said get a relatively brief screen time in this yarn in one of the films mild disappointments) set out on a mission to rescue new addition Forky from an at times downright creepy antique shop run by the devious Gabby Gabby, Toy Story 4 throws in a number of genuinely laugh out loud moments that are mostly instigated by the films newest additions that include Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele's Bunny and Ducky, Gabby Gabby's ventriloquist doll henchman and Keanu Reeves scene stealing stuntman extraordinaire and proud Canadian Duke Caboom.<br/><br/>It's a joy to watch these colourful rag-tag bunch of characters interact with their even more vibrant worlds and from carnivals, playgrounds, kindergarten rooms and the core antique shop, Toy Story 4 is an imaginative treasure trove of sight gags, witty dialogue and personality beats that culminate to make a highly entertaining all-ages affair that will have adults and children laughing (and more than likely shedding a tear or two) in equal measure, especially when Forky is first finding his feet in the great big world his been bought into.<br/><br/>When weighed up against its predecessors, the ground-breaking first film, the thoroughly entertaining second adventure and the perfectly judged ""finale"" in the form of the third film it's hard to say exactly where Toy Story 4 fits in the overall scheme of things, as while it is a comedic gem there is a sense it's not as emotionally powerful as previous entries (despite its strong finale) and you can't help but wish there was more group activities with the original gang, with the film more than ever focused on Woody (which isn't a bad thing thanks to Hanks voice work), with even Buzz feeling more like a side player within the films narrative.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>A visual and comedic delight, Toy Story 4 is another impressive feat of film-making by Pixar and one that's sure to charm fans of old and newcomers alike. While its slightly disappointing more of the original crew don't prominently feature, Toy Story 4 ensures the new additions to the universe keep things ticking along all the way until a fittingly emotional finale.<br/><br/>4 trash cans out of 5"
"RforFilm","5","115","236","21 June 2019"," Playtime is a bit messy. Toy story 4 has a jumbled script and side characters set aside, which makes this more of a ""meh"" story
","I can say now tat one of my favorite memories of going to the movies was when my dad took my brother and I to see Toy Story back in 1995. It was the first all CGI movie ever, but that wasn't why I loved it. Unlike a traditional movie from Disney was old fashioned in a good way, Toy Story felt like a modern, fresh breath of air that gave us a unique perspective of the world. It did help that both Woody and Buzz Lightyear were such memorable and likable characters, that toys of them were requested in my letter to Santa.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 built on Woody, Buzz and the theme of being a toy and their purpose. Toy Story 3 catapulted to deep, emotional levels as the toys had to figure out what to do now that their child had grown up. These three movies make up a rare perfect trilogy that gave us a harmonious saga and the world of movies seems better with this. So when a new movie was announced, I immediately got the feeling that this was more of a cynical cash grab then a needed continuation. But I'm open to seeing what can happen. Let's look at Toy Story 4.<br/><br/>Now that the toys have moved on with Bonnie, Woody (played by Tom Hanks) still tries to look out for her and her well being, despite not being a favorite toy of hers. She'll play with Buzz (played by Tim Allen), Jessie (played by Joan Cusack), Rex (played by Wallace Shawn), Hamm (played by John Ratzenberger), Slinky Dog (played by Blake Clark), but Woody is usually left out. But this doesn't stop him when he tries to introduce a new toy, a handmade spork figure named Forky (played by Tony Hale).<br/><br/>Forky has an existential crisis when he feel like he's trash rather then a toy, and keeps trying to throw himself away. He almost does when he throws himself out of an RV when the family goes on vacation. Woody goes to retrieve him while telling the others to hold on. Woody and Forky try to make it back, but make a detour into an antique shop. Here they encounter a broken Gabby-Gabby (played by Christina Hendricks). Along with her, they also encounter Duke Caboom (played by Keanu Reeves), Bunny and Ducky (played by Keegan-Michael Key & Peele) and even Bo Peep (played by Annie Potts). This throws Woody into his own existential crisis over what to do.<br/><br/>I shocks me to say that Toy Story 4 is only an okay film. It's certainly not a bad movie. It's a movie that still tells a Toy Story tale fine, but it's also a complicated one based on what it's trying to do. It obviously wanted to not only give Woody a new arc, but to bring back an old element. The hearts in the right place, but it needed another rewrite to make it happen. But let's go into better detail.<br/><br/>The problem with Toy Story 4 is that it's a movie with very little at stake. At first the goal is that Forky is cared for and to help him through his crisis. Not only is he not that funny of a character (there is a gag about him throwing himself away that goes on a little too long), but his arc is kind of abandoned midway through in order to focus on Woody. I'd might have been okay with that, but Forky rarely is ever contributes to the story or even as a character.<br/><br/>Not to mention that the other Toy Story movies kept giving the side characters a lot to do. Most of them including Rex, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, and even Jessie are stuck on an RV, so we don't get to see them that often. Even Buzz, who does get plenty of screen time, seems too out of character by being unconfident about his decision making, even though he had no problem with this in the other movies. Though I got a couple of laughs from Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom, Key & Peele voices feel too modern and out of place. I think it has to do with how their playing themselves and not characters.<br/><br/>I'll give this five Woody the cowboy dolls out of ten. I'll be curious to see how families and kids will respond to this. I'm sure it'll have plenty of fans, but not too many saying that Toy Story 4 is the favorite. Perhaps to Infinity and beyond isn't always the best way with making more movies. Perhaps Disney should have stopped with Toy Story 3."

At first the thought occurred to me that I was simply unaccustomed to full-length cartoons and it seemed to me that it was so magnificent against the background of everything that's comes out this days. But, recalling the review of the last part of ""How to Train Your Dragon"", I can say with confidence that the high rating of the fourth part is fully deserved.<br/><br/>First, I did not expect to see such an abundance of new characters. There is a huge number of stories that are perfectly served, and the characters are perfectly disclosed. Each part of the franchise taught us something, projecting toys into the real world and real situations. Here we have no repetitions and parallels in comparison with the previous parts, although many people could thought this way according to the trailer.<br/><br/>Second.

","I think most peoples initial thoughts when they heard about this film were along the lines of ""is this film really necessary?"" After all, the third film in the trilogy seemed to wrap everything up so perfectly and was as sweet and sentimental as it could be. Yet here we were with a fourth installment. I'm sure Toy Story is a lucrative venture for Disney and Pixar so that could have been reason enough from a financial stand point. Having seen it a few days back I have to say, this film continues the trend of quality and I found it to be a perfect mix of emotion, comedy, and loveliness.<br/><br/>Our toy friends are now living with Bonnie, who is now starting school. While at school she creates a toy made from a spork and other surrounding trash. One day, this spork (Forky) escapes and Woody goes after him. Along the way he runs into Bo Peep who was given away years ago. Woody must try to keep Bonnie happy as he is quickly becoming less and less relevant in her eyes. There's a whole lot more to this film that I don't want to get into. All of our wonderful toy friends are back, what more could you ask for?<br/><br/>I'd like to start off with how good the animation was. There is an animated cat in this film and just looking at this cat is proof of how far animation has come as a whole. Its incredible. The film provides a good dose of laughs that will please both adults and their kids. I loved the Key and Peele voiced duo and having Keanu Reeves doing voice work for this as well. Buzz has become less relevant in the main storyline but is as entertaining as ever. Forky seems to built from nothing but he is such a complex character in the way he finds his way, don't let that get lost in the shuffle.<br/><br/>The major toys have arcs that they need to complete. Its such a well written film that did not feel necessary at first but then you see it and feels like it was the perfect ending to the series (if it ends there). Its an emotional punch which goes to show how great this series is at evoking a strong reaction. I liked this film better than Toy Story 2 and maybe even Toy Story 3. It proves itself to be an essential addition, strange as that seems. Just all around a perfectly good time, which for me was great.

"rustonreviews","9","39","74","27 June 2019"," A wonderful surprise.
","When it comes to beloved franchises, very rarely do fourth instalments stick the landing, let alone deserve an existence. Occasionally, some break free from the mould of disappointment and successfully win the hearts of audiences. Suffice it to say, the announcement of a fourth Toy Story made me incredibly anxious. Toy Story 3 (2010) concluded the trilogy perfectly, and I was adamant that a fourth chapter would taint the franchises excellent track record. Two years have passed since Andy donated his beloved toys to Bonnie. Although all appears well, Woody (Hanks) struggles to find his place in a world without Andy, and often mistakes Bonnie's name for Andy's under moments of pressure. A crucial aspect of Woody's pride were his talents for leadership and authority, but those days are far behind him. On Bonnie's first day of Kindergarten, she constructs a makeshift toy named Forky (Tony Hale) out of a spork, googly eyes and broken sticks. Much to Woody's surprise, Forky is magically brought to life, only to plunge immediately into an existential crisis, resulting in Woody striving to teach him the great significance of what it means to be a toy.<br/><br/>Within minutes of Toy Story 4 I was completely swept away, and all my apprehensions about the film were vanquished. Pixar have made stunning leaps and bounds with their animation, and this is without a doubt the most beautiful looking film of their repertoire to date. This heart-warming fourth chapter doesn't just focus on the humorous existential woes of a spork, but also reintroduces Bo Peep (Potts) into the fold, who was given away by Andy's little sister nine years ago. Bo was never a fan favourite, but Toy Story 4 makes sure to rectify this by reinventing the once one dimensional character entirely by finally awarding her with character depth. The dynamic shared between Woody and Bo is one of the films greatest strengths, because this time their relationship is something much more substantial than what we've seen so far in the previous films, and it's absolutely wonderful to watch. There are plenty of new introductions, too. Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are hilarious as Ducky and Bunny, two plushie carnival prizes waiting to be won by a potential owner. They're witty and absolutely bonkers, effortlessly stealing every scene they're in. Keanu Reeves features as Canadian stunt-man Duke Caboom, although his role is fairly minimal. I had my concerns about Forky heading into this film, fearing that he would be overbearingly annoying, but thankfully, Forky is an oddly charming addition to the franchise.<br/><br/>Elements of horror have been largely absent from the Toy Story franchise ever since Sid's cannibalised toys wreaked havoc across the nightmare child's back garden in the 1995 original film. Folsom and Stanton's script reintroduces aspects of horror to the series in the form of Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), a 1950's doll who isn't as friendly as she appears on the surface, as well as her creepy ventriloquist dummy henchmen. Much of the film takes place in an antique store, which allows for some effective moments of Goosebumps level chills.<br/><br/>At the very heart of the film is the universal theme of belonging. The Toy Story franchise has always spoken to both children and adults, and Toy Story 4 is no exception. It's a truly heart-warming and entertaining film that delivers a beautiful conclusion to the series, and I was relieved that Pixar managed to pull it off in the way that they did."

","As with every Pixar film you have your small, genius details and beautiful animation that brings there films to life. But here I found that there was no substance behind the beauty. Lots of our beloved characters were given minimal attention and seemed somewhat useless to the story. The story seemed impulsive with little direction, our characters jumping at anything that moved. The films villain seemed like subplot and didn't seem like a real threat. The first 20 minutes were my highlight. It seemed reminiscent of earlier Toy Story films and explored experiences that we can all relate to. Despite an uninspired villain, chaotic plot and underdeveloped characters I still enjoyed myself. Within the film there was so much creativity, humour and some genuinely moving moments. I just couldn't help but feel disappointed when this film is compared to its predecessors in the franchise.<br/><br/>(Also please stay to the very end of the film, you will not be disappointed)"

"Here_2_Review","9","36","68","25 June 2019"," The conclusion we did not know we needed
","Toy Story 4 is the final film in the Toy Story franchise and is the conclusion film we did not know we needed for this unforgettable Pixar series that is about family.<br/><br/>We thought we had the end of Toy Story with part 3, which ended with Bonnie being the next owner of Andy's toys, but this is not the case. This story is mainly about Woody, especially considering he has been the first head of the series, besides Buzz in all four Toy Story films.<br/><br/>This movie is about Woody doing his absolute best to make Bonnie feel safe and happy, since she is now in kindergarten and is extremely nervous, as we all probably were when we were little. Of course she decides to make herself feel safer when she constructs her own toy from scratch, a spork named Forky! This handmade toy comes to life and we have our journey! Of course the toy considers itself as trash, literally, since Woody quickly pulled a spork out of a trash can and threw it Bonnie's way.<br/><br/>After keeping tabs on Forky for so long, he manages to escape and Woody goes on his journey to make sure Forky returns to Bonnie safe and sound, but chaos happens along the way!<br/><br/>This is I think the best story in the series since Toy Story 2. This is another personal story and is very touching and heartwarming. Don't worry, this is not a sad or distraught movie like I thought it would be for some reason. It's a very understandable story and I am happy with its ending. The ending to this story is one of the most heartwarming finales I have seen in a long time!<br/><br/>Of course we got new characters, which are all fabulous and well cast! To name a few, Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom, Keegan-Michael Key as Ducky, Jordan Peele as Bunny, and Christina Hendricks as Gabby.<br/><br/>Each character is no character that is just there to be there, they have some key role in the story, and of course Pixar being Pixar, they wouldn't have any characters they didn't need for the story. Every character in this movie is lovable and I think my personal favorites that are new are Duke, Bunny, and Ducky!<br/><br/>Idek where to start with the visuals in this film. Each shot is just BREATHTAKING..... It's amazing the advances that have been made with technology over the years! Of course the characters look better, but the environments looks real as can be! It's insane! Each frame looks a real photograph!<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10! A Pixar gem that is a wonderful conclusion that could not have been done better, and it is the best one since Toy Story 2!<br/><br/>This review I think could be written better, but at the same time I tried to be as vague as possible without giving anything away....."

"jon.h.ochiai","9","36","68","25 June 2019"," ""Toy Story 4"" is Something Very Special
","In Pixar's beloved narrative mythology of the ""Toy Story"" movies, the toys come to life and speak, only when no one including children is present. Screen writers Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom, and story writers John Lassiter, Andrew, and Director Josh Cooley bring Disney's animated ""Toy Story 4"" to life once more.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks voices stalwart Cowboy doll Woody, who 'raised' grown up Andy. Tim Allen voices bold spaceman toy Buzz Lightyear, the reluctant best friend to Woody. Woody now belongs to kindergartner Bonnie, voiced by innocent Madeline McGraw. Apparently, Woody has been replaced by self-constructed Forky, voiced by youthfully naïve Tony Hale. By the way, Forky is the spork (hybrid spoon and fork) rescued from the trash.<br/><br/>Wide-eyed Woody regretfully confesses to doll Little Bo Beep, played by spirited Annie Potts, about losing Andy and now Bonnie, ""I don't have anything else..."" Andy loved Woody, then eventually moved on to college. Bonnie loved Woody. Now she's moving on to school, with Forky.<br/><br/>Recall Taylor Hackford's ""An Officer and a Gentlemen"", where Louis Gossett's Sgt. Foley coerces Richard Gere's Zack Mayo to quit the officers' training program. Zack tearfully yells, ""I got no where else to go... I got nothing else.""<br/><br/>Director Josh's ""Toy Story 4"" is Woody's transformational reckoning, albeit for a toy. Yet, the narrative wonderfully underlies the unique duplicity of ""Toy Story"". Children love their favorite toys with all their hearts. In a sense, the toys care for them. In ""Toy Story 4"" Woody loves Andy and Bonnie back. Life moves on. Eventually, children shall move on to their next love, be it another toy or new friends.<br/><br/>In one sense, the toys - Woody and Buzz are much like parents on the journey as their children transform into adults. I'm not a parent, yet I see that as our affinity to ""Toy Story 4"". What happens when your love is replaced? Rather, what happens when the ones you love so dear move on? Maybe, we too continue to find our next love?<br/><br/>In ""Toy Story 4"" Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the Toy Band are back together, now with little girl Bonnie. The first 20 minutes occurred as nearly perfunctory storytelling with Bonnie and her Mom and Dad voiced by, solid Lori Alan and Jay Hernandez, taking a family road trip. No doubt, high jinx awaits. Yet, what unfolds is far from predictable, perhaps even poignant.<br/><br/>Woody reunites with Bo Peep (who goes by Bo). Woody has always been in love with Bo. They separated 9 years ago, when Woody chose to stay back to look after Andy. Subsequently, Bo became a ""lost toy"" - the childless toy.<br/><br/>In the disturbingly bizarre narrative reveal, the broken doll Gabby Gabby, voiced by brazenly vulnerable Christina Hendricks, generates surprising gravitas. Her 'voice box' unlike pull string Woody, no longer works. Gabby Gabby resides in an antique toy shop, accompanied by her eerie ventriloquist doll squad. These dolls are extremely creepy. Nearly distracting. Really.<br/><br/>Yet, on the upside we observe Gabby Gabby's incomplete toy life. Christina brilliantly nuances Gabby such that we get a sense of what she wants most: To be loved. That's the human eloquence of ""Toy Story 4"": We all deserve to be loved.<br/><br/>The Pixar crew's animation in ""Toy Story 4"" astounds from the emergence of Forky or the Toys tampering with the accelerator pedals on the speeding family rental van. Comic relief arises in the carnival stuffed animals, Ducky and Bunny voiced by hysterical Keegan-Micael Key and Jordan Peele. Renaissance movie icon Keanu practically highjacks every scene he's in as Evel Knievel-lite stunt biker toy Duke Caboom. No one commands ""Whoa."" - like Keanu.<br/><br/>In the end ""Toy Story 4"" touches our hearts, because of the history and partnership of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. Everyone deserves to be loved, even a toy. When Buzz says to Woody, ""She'll be okay..."" We get it. We do, because we love. I loved ""Toy Story 4"". It's something very special."

","It was a real fear for me that after one of the greatest movie trilogies that Disney had decided to cash in and put a film that would ruin it but my fears were allayed, this film is as good as the rest.<br/><br/>I did find this a bit of a different from the rest, it has grown a bit with its audience, although it wouldn't be a let down for little ones it still works on that level. My teenage sons loved it just as much as me so the film is pitched brilliantly on lots of levels. There are also tearful moments as well.<br/><br/>There are plenty of new characters to mix things up but the old favourites remain.

","The quality of PIXAR productions has been down ever since ""Wall-E"" and the ""Toy Story"" franchise is already limited in what it can do, so, in hindsight, this movie's lackluster existence shouldn't be unexpected.<br/><br/>""Toy Story"" is limited in what it can do, because what all really can toys do other than get lost and try to get back to their owner? Throw on the usual themes of children growing up and things changing and voila, you have a ""Toy Story"" movie. These ideas are all fine, but this is the fourth film in the series and thus the fourth time they've done this. It's all recycled material which results in the film feeling tedious.<br/><br/>What is different this time is the movie's focus on Woody and Bo Peep's relationship. Every other original and fan-favorite character is tossed to the side to follow a story involving one of the least interesting aspects of the ""Toy Story"" series. A new group of characters takes their place as the side characters, and they either don't stand out are really annoying.<br/><br/>Now that the formulaic themes and story is in place and the annoying characters are all set to go, ""Toy Story 4"" just heaps them all together in a forced and poorly written plot.<br/><br/>""Toy Story"" handles the theme of replacement better than ""Toy Story 4"" does. ""Toy Story 2"" handles the theme of change better than ""Toy Story 4"" does. ""Toy Story 3"" is a better and more satisfying climax to the series than ""Toy Story 4"" is. Just remember those films and you've essentially seen all ""Toy Story 4"" has to offer, but much better"

","In comparison to most films and even many Pixar films, Toy Story 4 is an excellent film. In comparison to the other Toy Story films, this is by far the weakest. For the most part, the characters are still there along with the warmth, sentimentality, and kindness evident in the other Toy Story films. The sight gags and jokes that work are scarce. Though the animation is far superior to the preceding films, some cuteness and simple joy is lacking from the vastly more detailed characters."

","Toy Story 3 wrapped up Pixar's signature saga on such a pitch-perfect note that the decision to follow it up with another instalment made no sense at all. Nobody asked for this sequel. Nobody wanted it. And nobody was looking forward to it. However, if there is one thing that this animation studio has done too many times over the years and more consistently than any other studio on the planet, it is to defy the odds, exceed every expectation & set all-new industry benchmarks in the process. And with their latest feature, Pixar has done it yet again.<br/><br/>Proving us wrong & putting our fears to rest by delivering an impeccable blend of high-quality storytelling & jaw-dropping animation, Toy Story 4 doesn't dent an already perfect saga. Instead, this latest entry enriches it by embracing everything that made its predecessors so great. The story is immaculate, characters are vibrant & compelling, themes are addressed with care & compassion, animation is breathtaking, and the film as a whole brims with a genuine sense of heart, warmth, tenderness & finality. A final goodbye we didn't know we needed, Toy Story 4 is another masterpiece in Pixar's bag."

"cruise01","8","31","58","22 June 2019"," The fourth Toy Story delivers the charms, characters we love, and a great emotional ending that we deserve.
","Toy Story 4 (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 delivers a great concluding story after believing the third film in the series was the last. Toy Story 3 was good and it had an emotional satisfying end with the theme Andy growing up and going to college. He is growing distant with his gang of toys with Woody and his friends. He passes his collection of toys to Bonnie. Sure, the film does answer a question about Bo Peeps absence in the third film. Which the film begins with a flash back several years ago explaining Bo Peeps absence. Now, the present time Bonnie has been having a great time with her toys. She has been distant with Woody which he has been placed inside the closet. But when she starts Kindergarten. And makes a new toy out of a spork. She becomes obsessed with the spork toy she made and called him Forky. Forky believing he is just a kitchen utensil and belongs in the trash. Woody tries to babysit Forky and keeping him close with Bonnie. As they go on a road trip. They lose Forky on the road. Woody decides to chase him down and to bring him back to Bonnie. Along the way, they come across a carnival and an antique store of unwanted toys. That is when Woody sees Bo Peep again. When he comes across another toy of a doll named Gabby Gabby. Who wants Woody's voice box so she can talk and maybe get a child to take her along. Buzz Lightyear embarks on a mission to find Woody and Forky and to bring them back.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 delivers another great sequel. It did not feel like Disney was aiming for another cash grab and an unnecessary sequel. The story does conclude some characters arc. The theme of where do toys go when the child no longer wants them? And what do the toys do next? It does have another emotional ending which is sad and satisfying. The animation is beautiful and colorful. I remember the first movie being one of the best animation films ever. The fourth film comes along way. And is one of those film series with all four movies having a theme and a story that works so well.<br/><br/>The characters of Woody and Buzz are back. There are some new additions like Forky, a confused spork. He is adorable, funny, and entertaining. Bo Peep is back as a stronger and an independent woman. Then, there is Ducky and Bunny which they are a funny duo. Duke Caboom voiced by the noticeable Keanu Reeves was entertaining. And the villain Gabby Gabby can be menacing with her several dummies that she commands. She was also a fun addition.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Tim Allen and the rest of the voice talent were all great with their roles. I did feel like the film was a bit anti climatic with characters rescuing and escaping while getting side tracked. But the film is pure enjoyment for adults and kids.<br/><br/>Overall, Toy Story 4 is a good film. It has a great theme and story that makes it a perfect conclusion to the series. The characters are fun. The animation is beautifully done. The voice talent is amazing. This sequel is definitely worth it."

I was happily caught by surprised,when he invited me to join him and his family in seeing Toy Story 4 at The Printworks today.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Opening the toy box after 9 years, PIXAR display the remarkable progression of CGI from the opening scene of photo-realistic rain and the shiny reflections on plastic toys. Soaring on a dynamic atmosphere, the director Josh Cooley plays with giving shots the appearance of long ""one take"" panning shots, highlighting the bursting with colour character designs (which includes evil dummies!) and the pristine animation being filled with a real attention to detail of each background/setting, (from an antiques shop to inside a RV) being packed with interesting objects and visual gags in every corner.<br/><br/>Whilst Buzz Lightyear (who has a very funny ""inner voice"" running gag) moving to a supporting role is notable, the writers unexpectedly make the near decade gap from the third evaporate, by the arrival of Forky taking the themes of friendship,growing up,belonging and existing which have run across all the films,are gathered together into bringing closure to the toys which they have given their owners. One of the few animated films to not have a all-out baddie, the writers unbox new toys and smoothly fit them in with the classic range,thanks to the mix of hilarious set-pieces, (such as Woody trying to stop Forky seeing himself as ""trash"") and striking warmth, (such as avoiding from making Gabby Gabby a mere boo-hiss villain) making this toy one which can be played to infinity and beyond."

The characters where also amazing especially Forkie who had the most laughs from me what an interesting creation for this amazing franchise.<br/><br/>This franchise never dissapoints and I've loved every one and Woody is one amazing character and the journey he takes in this one is amazing he tries everything to do thinks right and be the best toy he can be I also like how he's not truly over Andy that was amazing.<br/><br/>Verdict. 9.7/10 a great movie and wonderful addition to the franchise Woodys journey is amazing and old friends returning makes for some nostalgic moments.
Just a great film Toy Story never dissapoints no matter what age."

","There is something of the same entertaining and emotional connectivity as Incredibles 2 (2018). There's a point in Toy Story 4 that made it appear that this sequel would be decent if not great movie, but then later on as the movie literally worn on, it became stronger and stronger until by the end the compelling and heart-felt storyline blossomed fully by the end of the movie. There is an important conceptual insight about the perceptions and assumptions about human nature that oddly enough results from an animated feature about toys themselves. This is a solid, funny, sad, and humanly amazing experience about both toys, human beings, and relationships."

","TOY STORY 4 REVIEW :-<br/><br/>
Toy Story is one of those rare Franchise which can be considered as complete series. We had few other franchises too but Toy Story has that 'One Complete Film' every freaking time, that's something brilliant. I remember how hard i cried after watching Toy Story 3 and since then i always felt like this is the Perfect End, Pixar shouldn't take it further. There were many reasons for that such as Emotional Connect, Heart touching End and one of the Most Important reason was matching the high level phenomena is Impossible. Others might have failed but Pixar does it again. Toy Story 4 is 4th Classic in a Row for the Franchise and if i am not wrong then this is the First and only Franchise to achieve this feat.<br/><br/>The way Toy Story 3 ended i couldn't imagine any sequel and if i had to imagine then it has to be a Classy as hell. That time it was about Human's Emotions for the toys and this time Toy Story 4 deals with Toys emotions towards Humans. I hope everyone here is friendly with every character of the film and may be that's why Pixar tried connecting our emotions with the Toys. Fortunately they succeeded. Toy Story 4 has perfect mixture of Entertainment, Freshness in the Script, Sacrifice, Friendship values and last but not the least That Emotional Connect. You may not cry for the Goodbye this time, because this Goodbye has vibes of New Beginning hence making Toy Story a Franchise to remember to the Infinity and Beyond.<br/><br/>Taking the story forward since Toy Story 3, this film has some new entries and also some old friends reuniting. The conflicts remain same but the emotions and the perspective is changed. You feel for New Toys, Old friends, thier Friendship, thier sacrifiece and most importantly you feel for Woody and that's what Pixar wanted. At the very next moment the race of Classic Film is won by Toy Story 4. Although it failed to match it's predecessor but you know Toy Story 3 is unmatchable therefore going somewhere close to that film is a Big Achievement and that is done in soul stirring way here. In final words, Toy Story 4 adds another glorious Chapter in Toy Story Franchise and Pixar's basket. If you connect with the Toys of these franchise then believe me you can't to miss Toy Story 4.<br/><br/>RATING- 8/10*"
"rgkarim","8","28","52","22 June 2019"," Unnecessary But So Good On Levels. Two Thumbs Up On So Many Levels
","Pixar, one of the two big animation studios vying for the spot of number one in the great world of movies. In competition with Walt Disney Studios, though supposedly working together for the big company, the studio that blew our minds long ago is back with another ""new"" movie. Having difficulties launching new ideas, Pixar seems to fall back on their time-honored films in an attempt to expand upon their timeless characters. While often good, how far the movie can go is always the question, but these guys have managed to find the magic time and time again. So I am here once more to review the latest installment to see if Pixar can keep in time with their storytelling. Robbie K here and get ready for another review this time on:<br/><br/>Movie: Toy Story 4 (2019)<br/><br/>Director:
Josh Cooley
Writers:
John Lasseter (original story by), Andrew Stanton(original story by
Stars:
Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts<br/><br/>
LIKES:<br/><br/>Animation

Funny
Good Pace
Evolution Of Bo Peep and Woody
Three-Dimensional Villain
Super Emotional to Grip You<br/><br/>DISLIKES<br/><br/>Trailers Revealed A lot/Predictable
New Guys are Okay/Gimmicky
The Ending Makes The Points In Three Pointless
The Older Characters Are Not Utilized Well<br/><br/>Summary: It's Disney and It's Pixar, you know the animation is going to be awesome as beautiful, and improving, graphics are integrated with color and sound design to bring the world to life. Throw in the voice acting and once more the movie has crafted the usual media to bring their characters to the forefront of Disney heroes and heroines. And through their magic they have crafted fun characters, their army finding a way to bring comedy and emotion to the movie and produce a fun paced movie that entertains many ages and preferences. Yet what impresses me in this movie, is how well they developed some of their characters once more. Bo Peep, a character who had little involvement out of snarky comments and a crush in the first two installments, is back with a complex story that is balanced, poised, and realistic to really latch onto. Woody's ever evolving tale matches perfectly with it, a lock and key that push these characters to new levels and somehow bridges the issues of the first installment. Even more impressive is Pixar's way of adding depth to the villain, somehow managing to put more layers in outside of just megalomaniac personas that are famous in Disney movies. This utilization of storytelling and character development, is the example of Disney's ability to make emotionally gripping tales that pulled me into the adventure once more, keeping my interest and I believe pulling younger members in as well. It's those emotional moments that somehow seem to complete the movie and leave you with yet another satisfied conclusion, until they need more money and make the fifth movie.
Yet, the movie still runs into the art of predictability, not entirely, but certainly enough has been ruined by the copious trailers to have given much away. And much like the trailers and specials, Toy Story also has a new cast of characters to merchandise off to the younger wards. The new characters are fun, and serve their purpose of bringing laughs, quotes, and new ideas for toys. They contribute their points, but unlike the original bunch, the involvement with them is not quite as engaging as previous installments. Through in that the older characters we have grown up with over the last two and half decades are rather poorly integrated and you have some disappointing components to me. I'm from the school of if you are not going to keep them integrated into the story meaningfully, why put them in to begin with, and this was especially true for Toy Story 4. Finally, and probably picky, the conclusion of this movie sort of overwrote all the hard work of Toy Story 3 for me. Certainly there are new lessons to learn at a new stage of the journey, but given the time frame between three and four, I would expect them not to so quickly displace what the gang did in three. But hey that's just me.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is still a work of art, showing that despite ending the movie well, they can find way to keep it going. Toy Story 4 has heart, class, and does such a good job of expanding its main characters to continue the supposed hero's journey. The new characters are fun, the world is still colorful, and it's all presented in an entertaining and meaningful pace that I thoroughly enjoy. Sure the tale is still predictable, the characters are imbalanced, and the ending did offset three for me a bit, but the truth is the movie is a fantastic tribute to the art of the animation studio that is Pixar. No surprise it is worth a trip to theater so take the family, or yourself and get out to enjoy it as the emotional tale of the summer hits theaters this weekend. Otherwise, it's definitely one to go on the must see at home list for me.<br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5
Movie Overall: 8.0"
"TheMovieDiorama","8","28","52","22 June 2019"," Toy Story 4 is packed with heartwarming fluff pulling at your voice string.
","With the third instalment wrapping events up more neatly that Bo Peep's glistening china complexion, and causing grown adults to weep uncontrollably, many will approach this fourth chapter with much trepidation. Is this an unnecessary money making behemoth, or does it have substantial purpose to the story and Woody's charismatic arc? Well, the answer is both. Whilst I strongly believe that the outstanding trilogy that preceded this sequel would've created an ever-lasting legacy, there's just something about Pixar's effortless storytelling that made me fall hopelessly in love with these characters yet again. Bonnie, along with her family and toys, go on a road trip to which her newly made trashy ""toy"" Forky becomes lost midway through. Naturally, it's up to Woody to find him and get him back safely.<br/><br/>The narrative structure of Andy's (woops, I mean Bonnie's) toys venturing out into the wide open world to recover yet another lost plaything, is used once again. And unfortunately, using this structure for the fourth time, it suffers from overfamiliarity. You can scream ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" at the top of your lungs on the tallest skyscraper all you want, but there is no denying that this chapter succumbs to blandness from its repetitive plot devices. Mostly during the infiltration of the antiques store (Sid's house, Al's Toy Barn and Kindergarten) which sees Gabby Gabby (Sid, Stinky Pete and Lotso) attempt to keep Woody for personal gains.<br/><br/>However, and this is a testament to the deities working at Pixar, the colossal amount of pure innocent heart that is injected into these plastic/fluffy/china toys makes the familiar story infectiously charming. Primarily focusing on Woody, everybody's favourite cowboy. Exploring his inner search for requirement and purpose. Developing his overwhelming emotions when reunited with Bo. Questioning his stance on loyalty to children and toys alike. It's a transformational story purposefully written for him. It works! It really does. No longer is it just a study on the human condition, but now a true saga of its own. Owned frivolously and confidently by one loveable sheriff.<br/><br/>Pixar literally took ""reach for the sky"" and did just that! The whole gang is back to bask in that gloriously animated sun, with a plethora of new memorable characters joining in on the fun. Duke Caboom (clever use of Reeves' voice, I must say), Canada's greatest stunt man was certainly one of the standouts with a hilarious backstory. ""Yes we Canada!"". Forky, acting as the primary plot device, is a reflection of Woody's impenetrable ethos. However the most intricately designed, both literarily and artistically, character was Gabby Gabby. A multi-dimensional doll that subverts the typical villainous archetype for a sympathetic and understanding motive. Refreshing yet involving, trust the writers to make me tear up to the proposed antagonist of all characters! And yes, the mass amount of characters and intent narrative focus on Woody and Bo resulted in fan favourites like Buzz, Jessie and Rex acquiring minimal screen time.<br/><br/>But it all boils down to that last scene, with every toy involved. The scene that nearly, oh so nearly, made me cry like a banshee. Even reflecting upon it now, is making me smile. An emotionally satisfying conclusion for the entire series. Nuff' said. Need I even comment on the animation? It was sublime. Flawless. Perfection. From the tiniest of fur strands, to natural and artificial light reflecting off of Bo's endearing face, nothing was out of place. A truly impressive and submersible sequence was the introductory rainfall. Blew me away within the first second!<br/><br/>Listen, reviewing these films is just an exercise in expressing thoughts. They will not sway your intentions, because they were already solidified before any review was released. It's a nostalgic series that many hold closely to their heart, and rightly so. And despite the overfamiliarity, consequently forcing this to be the weakest chapter of the franchise, it's just so warm. Like receiving a glowing hug from your grandmother. Woody and the gang make their final outing exceptionally brilliant. And we shall always remember these classic ""to infinity, and beyond"". Just, no more please. Don't tarnish this perfect story!"

But when I saw the movie I did not regret it because it was so good and at the ending when Woody left everyone for Bo Peep I was happy for Woody and it just shows how Tom Hank's and Tim Allen's friendship has grown over the years.

"movieman6-413-929510","8","27","50","27 June 2019"," Again good life lessons and answers to unanswered questions in Toy Story 4
","Toy Story 4 is the newest part of the Toy Story film series. The film is directed and partly written by Josh Cooley, who previously only directed two other short Disney movies.<br/><br/>In the film, Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen) and the rest of the toys are now from Bonnie (voice of Madeleine McGraw). Their job is therefore to be there now for Bonnie during her good and bad days. When Bonnie goes to kindergarten for the first time, Woody sees that she is unsure about this and tries to be like a toy to her. At school, Bonnie makes a new friend called Forky (voice of Tony Hale) during manual labor. Woody sees that Bonnie sees Forky as her new best friend and that means he means a lot to her. Forky himself does not understand anything of life as a toy and thinks he belongs to the garbage. Woody must try to explain to Forky what it means to be a toy in the life of a child and to ensure that Forky does not place itself in the garbage.
When Bonnie and her parents go on a family trip and Forky leaves their camper on the way, Woody has to find him again and convince him how important he is to Bonnie. During this search, Woody is reunited with his old lost friend Bo Peep (voice of Annie Potts) who has changed a lot since Woody last saw her. Together with Bo and some of her new friends, Woody tries to bring Forky back to Bonnie.<br/><br/>After the successful completion of the Toy Story trilogy with the end of the third part from 2010, the news of a fourth part was a bit shocked and used by fans of the series. Many thought that this fourth part would only be an attempt by the film studio to only earn money with it, because this is usually the case when film studios try to add a fourth or more films to their film series after a trilogy. . This was also the case with the Indiana Jones films, for example.
Fortunately, this is not the case here, because this fourth film answers the unanswered questions of the first trilogy about what happened to the character of Bo Peep, for example. Just like in the other Toy Story films, these films contain good life lessons, which in this film is mainly about missed opportunities in life and that change in your life can be difficult, but also good.
What also returns a bit in this fourth part is a slightly creepy aspect, because there are belly puppets in this film, which can seem scary to young children. These puppies run in a scary zombie-like way. Despite the fact that these dolls can be a bit of a fright, they are used more in a comical way and the film remains a beautiful family film for young and old.<br/><br/>The animation quality of the Disney Pixar animation studio has also improved. The backgrounds and environments in which the toys roam around seem as if they are walking around in the real world. For example, in some scenes the film appears as if you are watching a live-action film.<br/><br/>The voice acting is also done properly and appropriately by the cast. The returning cast from the previous films are doing great again in their familiar roles, but unfortunately most do not have such a big role as they did in the other films. Especially Tom Hanks, Time Allen and Annie Potts their characters get the most time in this movie. In this film many new characters are also introduced such as Tony Hale's character Forky. Comedy duo Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele also get a lot of time in this film and record many comic moments. Action actor Keanu Reeves also has a role in this film as an action figure."
"robbiehirst-95168","9","27","50","26 June 2019"," Didn't think a 4th film would work. How wrong I was!
","I've been a Toy Story fan since the very beginning and I'd even argue that it's one of my favourite Disney Pixar films ever.
I will admit though that I went into this film feeling ready for disappointment. I always worry with films like this that when they have a really solid story that ends (basically Andy growing up and giving up his toys) but yet they make another and you're left thinking, ""what can they really do with it that will justify prolonging something that was at its peak?""
Well...
For the first 20 minutes admittedly I was thinking, ""hmm, where is this going?""
But then it managed to turn into exactly what we all love about the film!
Adventure, loyalty, rescue, moral dilemmas, great new characters and a very welcome return of a character we never really got to know before. They even managed to make it slightly creepy in places which I think was a brilliant move.
The movie in places felt like it had genuinely matured and the heart warming ending left me wondering if that's actually the last in the franchise? Maybe? Maybe not?
If that is the end, then I think it paid of really nicely.
Overall, a fantastic film! I've only just watched it and I want to watch it again already lol.
Well deserved 9/10 from me."
"hiraishinnojutsu","8","27","50","22 June 2019"," Tearjerking, again.... with a mature message
","One of so few of a franchise whose movies are all good, that what Toy Story is, and Toy Story 4 is no exception. Though I must admit, this is not my favorite, neither is the ending (that goes to Toy Story 3) because I have the funny feeling that Toy Story should have ended with the third movie, and the fourth one are just there to explain that ""not all who wander are lost"" or ""not all who are seem to have lost are actually lost"". Good message yes, nonetheless, resonate with the spirit of young adults all over the world. Props to the animation team for the hyper-realistic raindrops. And the writers too: good comedy, good characterizations (and development), good messages, good animation, and good almost everything that I could count with the fingers on both of my hands. But the ending, sorry...., not as remarkable as the ending of Toy Story 3. Rumor has it that the fourth movie would be the last installment of the Toy Story Saga, I mean this time, unlike Toy Story 3, it would really end, for real. And it would also mark the end of sequels for Disney Pixar. Well then, so long partner!!!!"
"Vic_max","Null","27","50","22 June 2019"," Enjoyable Story with Cool New Characters
","Kudos to the new writers for coming up with a charming new story to tell. It's definitely got its moments.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it was interesting to see some interesting new characters like Forky, Gabby Gabby, the Benson puppets (Gabby Gabby's spooky henchmen!) and especially toy motorcyclist Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves). Even Bo Peep, while present in Toy Story 1 and 2, is nicely re-freshed. This was a good move to prevent audience fatigue with existing cast -- it worked.<br/><br/>However, the stakes in the story are somewhat mild. There's no big catastrophe or catharsis involved. As such, it can't go as emotionally deep as its predecessors. Still it's really good - but just short of great."
"ThomasDrufke","9","27","50","22 June 2019"," ""To Infinity.... And Beyond""
","I was always excited but hesitant for Toy Story 4. It felt largely unnecessary but intriguing. Other than wanting a boat load of money, why would Disney/Pixar want to go back to what may be the greatest trilogy of all time and take a chance at messing it up? Well, your answer is they wanted to close Woody's arc in the best possible way. Mirroring his story with Buzz in the first Toy Story with his new relationship with 'Forky', the Spork turned toy, Woody very well may have the best arc in cinema history. Or perhaps the most complete and full circle story. But the film is still very funny, introduces us to plenty of new memorable characters, and is directed/written as well as the best of Pixar's films. They even made Bo Peep incredibly cool. If it wasn't for HTTYD 3 earlier this year, I would say Pixar has the Oscar locked up.<br/><br/>9.7/10"

","I just got out of watching Toy Story 4<br/><br/>I didn't want this movie to be made, as I consider the original trilogy perfect. Possibly the greatest trilogy ever. So it was with some trepidation I went to see it on opening day.<br/><br/>It is not quite as incredible as the first 3, but it is still superb entertainment in its own right. It focuses a lot on the characters and their relationships, and it can work as a stand alone movie too.<br/><br/>All the cast are back and some are given more to do than others, meanwhile, Keanu Reeves is great as the Evel Knievel-style stuntman, Duke Caboom.<br/><br/>It also delivers an emotional finale which will have you in tears. You have been warned.<br/><br/>Oh and stay until the end of the credits. There are several mid/end credit scene's (maybe 5)"
"bankofmarquis","9","34","65","25 June 2019"," Another triumphant TOY STORY film for Pixar
","When I first heard that Pixar was going to make a 4th TOY STORY film, I found myself firmly in the camp of ""why are they doing this? The 3rd film tied off the trilogy marvelously well and 4th film was not needed"" But...I trust Pixar, and when it was revealed that both Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were back on board after reading the script, my fears were alleviated quite a bit, but I still had some unease in the pit of my stomach.<br/><br/>I shouldn't have worried. For TOY STORY 4 is a wonderful addition to the adventures of Woody, Buzz and gang. It fits in nicely with the other films in the series and brings just the right amount of joy, fun, adventure and emotional heft.<br/><br/>Picking up the adventures of these toys as they now belong to Bonnie (after being gifted to Bonnie when their original owner, Andy, went off to college at the end of Toy Story 3), things have progressed realistically enough. The ""order of things"" in Bonnie's room is somewhat different than in Andy's. Woody, the old Cowboy doll, is relegated (more often than not) to the closet while Bonnie plays more with Jessie, Buzz and others. Into this group comes ""Forky"" a plastic spork that is made into a toy by Bonnie at Kindergarten. In a nice reversal of the first Toy Story film, Woody works hard to ensure that Forky is accepted into the group.<br/><br/>Without revealing too much of the plot, the gang (including Woody and Forky) go on a roadtrip with Bonnie in her parents' rented RV and end up in a small-ish town where a carnival is taking place across the street from an Antique store that houses Woody's old flame, Bo Peep. New characters are introduced, old characters are given a moment (or two) to shine and adventures and shenanigans ensue, with an emotionally satisfying climax - you know, a TOY STORY film.<br/><br/>This one continues to progress these toys ""lives"" and adventures in such a smart, natural and clever way that I did not feel that I was watching the same film again. I was watching characters I love continue to live, learn, grow and progress - a very smart choice by these filmmakers.<br/><br/>As always, the voice cast is superb. Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear), Joan Cusak (Jessie), Wallace Shawn (Rex), John Ratzenberger (Piggy) and even the late Don Rickles (Mr. PotatoHead) are all back and contribute greatly to the finished result. It is like putting on an old, comfortable sweater on a somewhat chilly day. You get a reassuring shiver of warmth.<br/><br/>But the filmmakers don't stop there - Annie Potts is back as Bo Peep (she - and the Bo Peep character - were in the original Toy Story). Add to these voices, the marvelous work by Christina Hendricks (Gabby Gabby), Key & Peele (Ducky & Bunny), Carl Weathers (all the Combat Carls) and Tony Hale (wonderfully quirky as Forky) and we have quite the ensemble of interesting, quirky characters - growing and enriching the ""Universe"" they are in (quite like what Marvel has done with their ""Universe""). Special notice needs to be made of Keanu Reeves work as Canadian Daredevil toy Duke Kaboom (the Canadian Evil Kneivel), it is the most entertaining - to me - of all the new characters.<br/><br/>But...make no mistake...this film belongs to Tom Hanks as Woody. It has taken me 4 films to realize this, but Hanks good guy ""everyman"" portrayal of Woody is the heart and soul of these pictures and this 4th film is Woody's film - as his character comes full circle from the paranoid toy who wants to keep living his safe existence to something much, much more in this film. It isn't hyperbole of me to say that I would be just fine for Hanks to receive an Oscar nomination for his voice work in this film - he is that good.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, Pixar brought in a novice Director, Josh Cooley, to helm this film. It is his first feature film directing experience, but he is a veteran Pixar face - having written INSIDE OUT and was the main Storyboard Artist for UP - his direction looks like someone who was comfortable in this medium - and with the style of film that Pixar (usually) goes for - and he does terrific work here.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the journey of the characters (especially Woody) in this film. I need not have worried about Pixar making a 4th Toy Story - they nailed the landing again.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A<br/><br/>9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)"

"aaronjbong","9","49","98","21 June 2019"," Beautiful Epilogue to a Masterful Tetralogy
","""Toy Story 4"" comes 9 years after ""Toy Story 3"", giving us another tale of the toys after their saying their goodbyes with Andy. To be honest, I felt ""Toy Story 3"" was the perfect conclusion, given that Andy had been the toys' owner over the course of the film series, and their separation and Andy moving on just felt like the apt place to end things. I was a bit skeptical that this installment would feel unneeded, and out of place, because what could possibly be there to explore. It would be a shame if a redundant installment ruined one of the best trilogies of all time, but I'm glad to say it may perhaps make it one of the best, if not the best tetralogy of all time.<br/><br/>This installment is mainly focused on Woody, dealing with the aftermath of no longer being with Andy, and being left with Bonnie, leading to questions of his self-purpose and what-not. Bonnie is an adorable character but she's no Andy, and perhaps because of that, I associate ""Toy Story 4"" as more of an epilogue instead of a full-fledged installment. It's not a bad thing, but it does stand out being the only movie where Andy is not in the background.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of new characters here; Forky, a newly made toy struggling to cope with his sentience, Duke Caboom, Canada's greatest stuntman voiced by everyone's favorite actor right now Keanu Reeves, Ducky and Bunny, the fluffy duo brought to life by the comedy duo Key and Peele. These characters are plenty of fun to watch and each of them have their own unique charms. They are excellent characters and an appropriate amount of screen time is dedicated to each of them. That said, this means that the characters we have been familiar with (Jessie, Rex, Mr. Potatohead, etc.) are sort of given the backseat. It would have been great if they had been given a more central part in the action but it's understandable to manage the time to give to the newcomers.<br/><br/>The story itself is beautiful and not as dark as Toy Story 3, with Lotso essentially transforming the kids' center into some sort of prison camp. It deals with questions of what it means to be a toy and what a toy dreams life should be. I feel it to be somewhat more existential questions than I had expected, especially with the arrival of Forky, a newly created being brought to life from trash. Perhaps with age comes the boldness to ask more challenging questions. This is after all, a 24-year-old franchise.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful and some of the scenes just stood out as being immaculate and gorgeous. Some of the scenes are set in a carnival with lights and serving as a backdrop with all the lights illuminating in the background, it was just a feast for the eyes. That said, I have to point out that the movie does not really have a wide setting, it's pretty much limited to certain locations. It's more expansive than ""Toy Story 3"" but not as diverse as ""Toy Story 2"". Somewhat with the ever-growing ensemble of toys, it also is narrower in scope.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Toy Story 4"" is an amazing movie and wiped away any notions I had that this movie would be a letdown, considering how ""Toy Story 3"" acted as a very sweet conclusion. I personally think ""Toy Story 2"" is still the best and this one particularly acts as more of an epilogue, but it is a damn good one."

","I'll never forget seeing Toy Story 3 in the IMAX. Especially the ending.
That heartwrenching moment when our main character has to grow up and put his childhood behind him is burned in my memory and is a surefire way to make me cry during a movie. It wasn't so much what was happening that made it such an impactful scene, it was what it meant for each of us on a personal level that made it just... work so well.
Toy Story 3 was the perfect spot to end the series. The ending of that movie was a perfect bookend to the story.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4, therefore, is the three or four additional chapters tacked onto the end of a long novel that should've been left on the cutting room floor. Take the heart and adventure of the first 3 films and the emotionally wrenching conclusion of the third one, suck all the life out of them and you have Toy Story 4 in a nutshell.<br/><br/>From what I saw, I couldn't pick out any distinct message the film was trying to portray, really. Maybe it's something that requires another viewing or two; I have no idea. But my first impression of this movie is that it's just... pointless. It's fluff. It shows that Disney is fine putting out a story about growing up and leaving your toys in the past only to rush right back to them as soon as its nostalgic enough to turn a decent profit. I guess it worked; it performed well at the box office (and, yes, Disney sold me the BD combo pack) and it apparently got a high rating (likely for the sake that it's a group of animated things that resemble the characters you know and love. They felt like hollow shells of themselves, however; lacking anything of substance.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie left me with a sour taste in my mouth. The original trilogy were such perfect pieces of storytelling, each serving its purpose, telling unique stories and developing the characters. This one, if anything, undoes that. It's a presentation of these characters for no other reason than that Disney knows we'll buy it again.<br/><br/>I really hope this is the final instalment in the Toy Story series. Anything beyond this will enter into self-parody. It should've ended on the third one, but it didn't, and now we can only hope that this is the last toy story."
"prhayhurst","4","7","10","9 October 2019"," The only problem is, that it was made now and not a few years earlier!
","I love the Toy Story films, 1,2 and 3, were fun and incorporated all of the toys, each having some screen time, but focusing mainly on Woody and Buzz.
This one however, seems to be the Woody show, with Buzz as a cameo appearance, and Bo Peep taking his place as Woody's side kick.
Buzz and Woody are Toy Story, though due to Tim Allen and I assume Hollywood trying to minimize him at every opportunity, Buzz has been reduced to an idiot that is hardly worth being in the film!
Bo Peep has been made into a kick ass female that can do whatever she wants, yay feminism (sigh!)
This makes the movie the lamest of all four, it hasn't got the rewatchability of the first 3, although it was enjoyable but, forgettable."
"kiddtrek","4","28","53","1 July 2019"," Very sad, alil creepy.
","I think what I disliked about this movie was the emotional connection. The first three reminded me of being a kid playing with toys, being a kid. This movie had none of that. ZILCH. The connection with Andy, and the toys with each other. This movie kinda failed at that. Then for Andy to go off on his own, and leave his friends behind, kinda broke my heart alil bit.<br/><br/>Creepy are the ventriloquist dolls..."
"jbalser3","4","28","53","26 June 2019"," This is a movie that didn't need to be made.
","If the primary reason of the film was to tell us what happened to Bo Peep, just apologize and print a Golden Book about it. As it is, we don't get that answer until halfway through the movie.
There's nothing new here. We've already seen the creepy toys (dismembered baby doll & melted soldiers & screaming monkey) so what does a ventriloquist dummy (or three) add? We've already dealt with the lost/abandoned/forgotten/unplayed-with/fallen-out-of-favor tragedies of toyhood. We've even seen the embittered, mafia-esque villains, super-capable Barbies, and carnival-prize extras. The newest idea, exploring what it means to be a toy vs trash, barely scratches the surface when it turns out Forky is just the McGuffin to get Woody and Bo back together again, but again it takes half the film and a montage to get that far. Bo Peep is somewhat interesting as a hardened survivalist, but there's no substantial emotional tension between her and Woody, who were obviously in love with each other in previous episodes. Bo's callousness and Woody's accusations seem forced, attempting to add tension with no build-up. Whether they come together in the end doesn't matter because they've spent hardly any time realizing what the audience already knows, and that's a poor shortcut on the part of the writers: assuming everyone watching is invested in the relationship so their principals don't have to *feel* it on screen.
Speaking of the writing, why is Buzz Lightyear obsessed with his ""inner voice?"" While humorous, that's a thread best done in Toy Story 2, after Buzz understands he is a toy, but before he has to lead two rescue missions outside Andy's house and help his best friend make life-altering decisions.
The best part of Toy Story 4 is the cinematography. The details were amazing: I don't remember seeing the starbursts of Woody's irises before. From dust bunnies to cobwebs to Forky's pipe cleaners and the chandeliers, Toy Story 4 is very pleasing to see and take in. But this is not a travelogue where stunning scenery carries you past disjointed storytelling. The three plot lines (Forky, Bo Peep, Gabby Gaby) are better suited as STV specials, but not as a unified story. At the end, I'm left wondering if the filmmakers even bothered to watch the previous three Toy Story films to remind themselves of where their beloved characters have been, and what they've become, that culminated in one of the most powerful and satisfying endings to a franchise in animated cinema: Toy Story 3. Pixar should have left it there, because you don't want the latest thing you've done to detract from the best thing you've done."
"Ryan_Barbakins","8","18","32","2 July 2019"," An Epilogue you won't want to miss!
","Is Toy Story 4 a necessary film? This is the question that I has been wondering since they announced the film back a few years ago. Toy Story 3 had what was in my opinion the greatest ending to a trilogy ever! Not only did it punch you in the heart, but it just felt right. Andy is grown up and his story is over. However as we learn in this movie, not everyone's story is over.
Yes. I think Toy Story 4 was a necessary film. As mentioned near the beginning of the movie, Woody never got over Andy, and Bonnie has grown out of Woody. His character kind of went full circle since Bonnie didn't care too much for him anymore just like how Andy didn't care too much for him when he got Buzz. But of course in this movie, Woody doesn't try to kill Buzz so there's that.
Woody's adventure in this movie shows that there was still a story left. It was Woody's retirement as a kid's toy. They didn't focus too much on the other characters, because THEIR story was completed at the end of the 3rd.
All of the new characters are great. Forky, Bunny and Ducky, and Duke Ca boom, are all hilarious. Gabby Gabby however is such a great character. She isn't the villain, she is instead a lost toy longing for a kid. Her moment at the very end when she gets her kid feels so rewarding, because we saw how devastated she was when Melody rejected her.
The amount of cohesion and foreshadowing in this movie just shows how self-aware they are about every little decision. The moment we see Bo Peep again, we already know just from one line of dialogue that she has moved on from her previous owner, and loves the life of a lost toy! And at the end when Woody stays with Bo Peep it feels perfect, because Woody's purpose as a child's toy has been fulfilled, and now he wants to retire with the love of his life.
However I do still have some issues, such as what they did with Buzz's character. Buzz Light-year is much more than just a funny gag. They made him seem stupid in the movie for not understanding what a conscious is, and even in serious moments using his voice box for guidance. We have seen Buzz make meaningful decisions in all Toy Story movies. He is a wise and good minded character. I was expecting him to eventually go against what his voice was telling him because his REAL voice (conscious) would tell him otherwise. However in the one scene where that could have worked perfectly, he still listens to his voice box. Very much a missed opportunity, but at the end of the day, it isn't really his movie. Ducky and Bunny got kind of annoying at some points. I kind of wish they expanded on what it means to be a living toy. They had a good opportunity in there with Forky, but it didn't really go anywhere.
The comedy in this movie is actually pretty great. It balances the tastes of the new generation, and the generation that grew up with the first 3 pretty evenly. There are a few edgy jokes like something you would find in the first and second movies, and there are some light heart-ed kid type jokes for the little ones.
At its essence, this movie is a welcomed epilogue. It gives closure to the main character of the films, and is just a really fun ride. You could watch Toy Stories 1 2 and 3 and feel fulfilled, but something about Woody and who he is just gives the impression that HIS story isn't over. Pixar were well aware of this and made sure to focus the movie on HIM and not the others. Honestly, this movie very easily could have been Hot garbage, but what we got was not that. That is why I am satisfied with this movie, even if it doesn't outdo the 2nd and 3rd in my opinion. My rankings of the movies: 1, 4, 2, 3. I dearly love all of these movies, and 1 and 4 feel interchangeable when I think about it, but I think that since Pixar was able to pull off another satisfying conclusion to this series, it needs to be just SLIGHTLY above the 1st. Also the 1st is the only Toy Story movie that doesn't make me cry. Yes I cried during the 4th, but it took me 2 times to watch the ending to get to that. Every character in this series has a satisfying ending that we can stick with for Infinity and Beyond."
"shimenpf","8","18","32","28 June 2019"," Pixar is back
","I was highly concerned for this movie. Toy Story 3 was a great conclusion for the franchise and to justify a 4th installment it had to be not only a good film but a superior one to the third. And it is. The dilema Woody faces is the toughest yet and therefore the most interesting to watch, and what makes this one the best Toy Story yet (and hopefully ever). His decisions, according to the dilema, are actually suprising, and really show who Woody's character really is. The comedy is actually pretty good. The ending is heartbreaking and the journey is filled with all kinds of emotions.
My only complain, maybe small to some, is the exclusion of most of the classic characters, like Slinky, Rex, or Mr Potato Head (who, I think, gets a single line of dialogue in the whole film). Other than that, Pixar has come back after a, in my opinion, not as good spree with Cars 3 and Incredibles 2 (to Pixar standards). I loved it."
"BirrJameson","8","17","30","1 July 2019"," I thought I was just going to cry on Part 3 only :(
","Part 1 and 3 are still favourite! This is bittersweet. Not really about Toys being played with but looking out for one another, adapting to change, choosing destiny, etc. Some hilarious scenes, fun enough for adults to enjoy. I wish that wasn't the ending though. Happy and heartbreaking at the same time.<br/><br/>Maybe if Pixar intends to make a 5th.... All toys and characters reunite at SunnySide, Woody and Buzz making sure kids don't take home the toys from school kinda plot, maybe?"
"ericlassiterthesecond","8","16","28","27 June 2019"," A Beautiful Ending To The Franchise
","Summary: Toy Story 4 follows Woody, Buzz, Andy & all of the other toys who go on a road trip with Bonnie and Woody meets Bo-Peep there who is a lost toy. All of these toys discuss how the world can be so big for a toy.
My Thoughts:
Toy Story 4 is complex and satisfying ending to our three predecessors. The characters are all memorable here such as the nice new additions who get lots of humorous moments. Woody is better than ever as his character is nice and he's trying to find kids for other toys. His whole character understands how sad it can be for a toy to not be played with. He soon at the end of this film learns to let go of being played with and he leaves this past behind. Buzz Lightyear has a strong relationship with Woody now and his character also still has an emotional friendship with Bonnie. The New additions to the franchise all stood out such as Forky who first was very suicidal and his character thinks he's trash. His character soon realizes that Bonnie cares about him. He's used as a plot device though in this film. Ducky and Bunny are both humorous. Key and Peele are charming as they keep your attention with their energetic character's personality. Duke Caboom has his funny posing moment and Keanu Reeves fits this character.<br/><br/>The Themes are really deep here such as friendship which is shown between all of our characters and letting go of our toys which is what every kid soon has to do when they Grow up. The ending is emotional without killing characters off but Woody learns to let go of Bonnie and he's living his life at the barn with Bo-Peep. Both characters have let go. The characters have strong relationships with each other. The suicidal aspect though when Forky thinks he's trash is a lot for a G-Rated film which is a theme that kids won't fully understand.<br/><br/>The Climax is emotional and unexpected. It ends Woody's story and Bo-Peep's too. They both have retired from their past.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film that ended the franchise well but the 3 problems I had were that the suicide theme was a lot for a kids film, this film definitely is somewhat dependent on the first 2 like Toy Story 3 and Forky's used as a complete plot mechanism."

","I was contemplating rescheduling a family holiday so I could see this on the release night, I was that excited....I'm glad I went on holiday instead. I never thought I would be bored whilst watching a toy story film. Toy Story is a film franchise I have grown up with and it should have finished when Andy drove off at the end of Toy Story 3 and never returned. Also, to split up Woody and Buzz at the end was a wrong move for me. Very disappointed and feel the team have rushed this film and not thought it our properly"
"althric","5","9","14","17 January 2020"," Going out without a bang.
","As the supposed end to the Toy Story series, this film is extremely underwhelming.<br/><br/>This sequel didn't really need to exist, and it never really feels like it justifies its own existence other than to answer a single question that arose from one line in Toy Story 3 that I felt we didn't really need answering.<br/><br/>For some reason, in this film, Buzz Lightyear is suddenly an idiot and truly believes his voice box is his inner conscious and spends the entire film making decisions based around that. Why they chose to go for this kind of route instead of something like Toy Story 2 where a small group of them go out on an adventure baffles me.<br/><br/>There's not much to say about the story on a whole apart from the ending, which I was really excited for after hearing reports that the voice actors couldn't finish their lines without crying. And then it happened; Woody left. But the issue is, I felt nothing, and I don't feel like that's my fault. The toys Woody was saying goodbye to after all these years had been stuck inside an RV whilst Woody was out doing his own thing. Most of them barely even say anything throughout the entire film. Even during the goodbye scene, barely any of them say a word and nobody gets a special farewell even though so many of these characters have unique personalities and would all react differently to their best friend and leader leaving them behind. It just felt very poorly handled.<br/><br/>It's not all bad, however. The animation is undeniably beautiful, which is obviously a given for a Pixar film, but this one makes it unique by playing with the depth of field so we really see the world the way the toys see it. And somehow, even now, Pixar manages to blow my mind with their photo-realistic environments and water effects. Couple this with the aforementioned use of the DOF, and the look of this film really stands out compared to other Pixar films. Besides the obvious, there are plenty of details on every single character, especially signs of wear on some of the older toys; just signs that the character designers and animators really put their A game into every single frame. It just makes it all the more frustrating this below average script that makes no sense was wasted on such gorgeous animation."

"kermez","1","10","16","1 September 2019"," Creativity is gone
","First, I suggest avoiding looking at total score and instead reading reviews, it's much better for understanding viewers feedback as, unfortunately, a lot of scoring is paid and performed by pr agencies so we can see that especially Disney movies magically get rather high scores on IMDb.<br/><br/>Regarding movie, this is just another standard Disney sequel intended mostly for reheating their franchise licensing business. It felt like some spin off, instead of sequel. And with ending really loosing a touch with main message of all previous parts. Story is weaker than any of previous three parts so question was - why even making this unless there was a story at least strong as in previous parts to be told? But after cars 3 this was hardly a surprise, at least we will get some nice socks and lunch box with Buzz and friends.<br/><br/>Now with Pixar claiming they do not plan any new sequels for some time, let's hope that there is any creativity left, as not only they failed to push new original ip for quite some time, but even sequels are lacking a spirit of originals."

It's a heartfelt film and the Pixar team should be proud of the impressive series they've created. Toy Story finally introduces a wide variety of new characters, most sequels would fail at this introduction, but not Toy Story. This series is now in new and unknown territory, and you couldn't be more invested. Toy Story 5 wouldn't be the worst idea, and considering the current streak they have, it's worth another risky sequel. It's sad, but so was Toy Story 3.

","Just seen the film and unlike others I'm way behind
the rest and when it hit the screens. Like a lot of the people reviewing this film I saw Toy Story from when it first opened in cinemas, bought the original Toys for my children etc ( who are now adults). What I can't believe is the negative reviews. 1,2 and 3 have been excellent, but, like most films that continues for ever and a day this had to come to an end. Please, please, please don't make a 4,5,6 etc.
As a film with a conclusion, at the heart of the story it hit all of my targets, you had funny, you had sad, you had action and a good story line in my opinion. The only thing which I wasn't happy with was the bodyguards of the so called baddie as they were very creepy and didn't need to be shown in this way, ( think back on the original Toy Story and the baddies, even though we knew they were on the wrong side of good, they were still ok characters without being creepy). As we knew this was the final chapter and how the toys sorted themselves out, I thought the last dialogue between Woody and Buzz said it all and left me happy with outcome. Many remarks have been made about Forky and being silly in its concept. I'm the wrong side of 60 and also made toys and as far as I'm concerned the toy that can can give you most enjoyment doesn't necessarily have to be a toy that comes out of a shop."
"mystikal-25343","5","4","5","22 December 2019"," Enjoyable but the weakest of the 4.
","I'm a massive Toy Story fan and I really enjoyed the first 3. For me, the order is 1 is the best, followed by a very close 2nd for 3, then 3rd place for number 2. But all 3 were executed very well. I had such high expectations for number 4, I never read any review and watched it for the first time last night. And I was kinda disappointed.<br/><br/>The animation was brilliant, there's no denying that. But what spoilt it for me was the weak storyline and stupidity. The first 3 did their best so that the toys were never alive seen by people. In Toy Story 4, it was like people were stupid not to see these toys bouncing and moving about everywhere, from the stores, the roads, and the amusement park. I mean the Skunk mobile was ridiculous. And how people failed to see any of the toys alive made it daft.<br/><br/>Some will argue, ""Oh this is an animation and nothing is meant to be real, blah blah blah"". That's not what my point is. It's about Toy Story being this wonderful world where toys come to life when people are around, not toys who blatantly wondering about in front of dumb people who are oblivious to it all.<br/><br/>I gave this 5/10 for the animation and the few laughs I got. But it was a big disappointment for me overall."
"damorejj","5","4","5","1 December 2019"," As Forky would say, this movie is trash
","I am a huge fan of the Toy Story series, and the 3rd ended perfectly with a very emotional ending that left you happy. The series couldn't have ended better. This movie was not necessary. But I gave it a chance and I was disappointed majorly.
Not only is the premise of a toy made from a spork ridiculous because those kind of toys are cherished for about 10 minutes tops...but the story itself revolved around trying to get this cheap piece of trash back as if Bonnie's life wouldn't be the same without it. Woody, I really thought you were smarter than that. And the ending undid everything my favorite toy sheriff has stood for over the entire series, a toy's purpose is to make a kid happy. The whole ending with him deciding to abandon his life long friends, Bonnie, and his purpose in life just to be with Bo living in a moving carnival is absolutely the dumbest way to end this series. Very disappointed in Disney and Pixar with this one. Should've quit at 3."
"regexfan","6","4","5","18 November 2019"," I did not recognize THIS Buzz Lightyear at all!
","Toy Story 1,2, and 3 were great, probably better than great, they were all connected and solid. They had all the Pixar signatures in them: great animations, good character development, original script, character realism, animation realism, funny, and all around fun. But this.... this feels like a different movie than the other Toy Story franchise. I did not recognize the Buzz Lightyear in this movie AT ALL. Who is this Buzz? Buzz used to be very confident, he was second in command after Woody. Sure he was a delusional ""space ranger"" when Andy first got him, but after all of that confusion was over, he became confident and calm. In Toy Story 4 he suddenly became as dumb as a rock. I thought that was Rex's personality? Maybe they got the characters mixed up, heaven knows. Even Rex now seems smarter than Buzz.<br/><br/>And at times this feels more like a Disney movie rather than a Pixar movie. The animations of human characters in Toy Story 4 looked like animations of human characters in Frozen, they lacked realism at times. For example, when Bonnie woke up one morning, she did not act like how a child (or any human being) would act waking up and her hair clip was still nicely clipping her hair. Pixar used to care about all little details like this in all their previous films, which made them so great. So this is more like one step down for a Pixar film.<br/><br/>And the story..... while I do feel that the premise is promising (Woody finding greater meaning of being a toy), the craft of the story is pretty weak. However, having said that, the ending was still pretty satisfying. Maybe that was the only thing that actually saved the movie. Though I would prefer a better exchange between Woody and Buzz at the end, I mean, they were best friends for a long time and they were not going to see each other ever again, I expected an exchange that would satisfy long time Toy Story fans, something to be remembered for a long time."

But I for one didn't rate this nearly as much as 3 or the previous 2 before that one.<br/><br/>So 9 Years on we get Toy Story 4. Now at the time, I was looking forward to it. But as I grew older I started to lose interest as it was taking so long. But because as the years have past I started to notice a trend in films & sequels much like these child animations being tarnished & corrupted with Political Correctness! Incredibles 2 is a prime example of this.<br/><br/>Seen the first film back in '04, loved & never seen a sequel for over a decade (14 Years) & because it was (& still is) in the peak time for PC to be shoved down peoples throats, the sequel was badly tarnished with female empowerment in the left wing & 3rd wave form! I was actually looking forward to it but completely forgot about the PC treatment, so now with this & other films I've been always apprehensive with sequels or remakes/reboots because of that very reason.<br/><br/>But this one wasn't too bad, yes it had the PC treatment but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Though you could tell from both dialogue & the visuals that is what it was trying to do, making Bo Peep a badarse type character & woody & the others dumb or stupid, not good! I mean you could see it clearly & it just annoys me why this so called movement has to be done in THAT way? It makes me wonder if they make these sequels just for that reason alone? Mmmm...<br/><br/>But the visuals were good, the villain was good. The animation & voice over work was good as always, but the ending was a bit crap & not happy. or nearly as emotional as the 3rd film. But I liked Forky, the new character.<br/><br/>Overall Ok, but VERY unneeded & made only for the excuse of PC & money! 5/10"
"AndrewRMButcher","4","23","46","2 July 2019"," Not what I was expecting
","I grew up with the toy story films as a kid and fell in love with the characters. Toy story 3 was a fitting end to the franchise, so I was not expecting a fourth film. I went to see this film thinking it would be sweet, fun, and a pleasure to watch. Instead I ended up getting deep meanings and messages from a kids film which was unnecessary, not only that, but they basically abandoned the whole gang we are used to and made this new toy 'Forky' the focus of attention. While it was a nice film, there were too many issues and political messages in there that are not needed in a kids film. My first problem is Gaby, she was made out to be the villain and ripped woody's voice box out but then they were all fine with her and helped her out. And it's only because she was a female. Also, the ratio of female characters to male ones was not equal at all, it was 2 males to the rest of the cast being females. Woody was made out to be some sort of idiot for trying to help out a toy in need and everyone hated him for it! Why?! Too many issues and the film wasn't needed. Also, don't make Bo Peep this big deal in the final film when in the first three she's hardly there, in fact, she's almost missable. Shame that they had to ruin such a good, original franchise."

","The visuals are great. That's one thing they get right.<br/><br/>Everything else is just not ok!! It's a good film for young kids who have no attachment to the originals - but if you know and love the originals; Toy Story 4 will break your heart.<br/><br/>Woody's sidekick toys, the ones who often add a bit of humour to the story, are only there to continue on the story that they exist. They barely have any screen time, not even Jessie and Bullseye. In fact, even Buzz's appearances are limited and he's suddenly dumbed down with an annoying theme of him having to check his inner monologue for the answers to any situation he finds himself in?<br/><br/>Now, the overwhelming theme to all of the Toy Story films has been friendship and loyalty. Something that made the films absolutely heart warming. This film shatters those concepts (here come the spoilers)<br/><br/>Woody, leaves his child, his friends, and Buzz lightyear - his best friend, to reunite with Bow Peep.... I was gobsmacked. That is not how this film should have ended that is not a happy ending that is not what the audience wants to see - we do not want Woody and Buzz separated for the rest of their lives! (How do toys find each other in the big wide world, ever again?) That is the sad and depressing ending.<br/><br/>And on a side note. Bow Peeps new feminist wardrobe and space in the spotlight, is a blatant too obvious over the top attempt at revamping the series to make a woman the hero and just as capable as any man; yes good message, but unnecessary and out of place in an already cast established and loved film with Jessie filling at least part of that role. Could have been covered much better in a more subtle less in your face way, which wouldn't have turned the whole direction of the franchise away from the bond between Woody and Buzz.<br/><br/>Very sad end to a lovely franchise that was, sadly was, once about friendship."
"rmirchandani","10","5","7","18 September 2019"," Toy Story 4 is a delight to watch and just a feel good movie!
","The fourth installment in the Toy Story franchise did not disappoint and capped off Woody's story arc in a beautiful and emotional way.<br/><br/>To be honest, I was not expecting that a fourth movie would even be made because Toy Story 3 ended perfectly. I thought that Toy Story 4 would completely damage the franchise and receive negative reviews. However, after watching the movie I can genuinely say that I was wrong.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 brought back a beloved character Bo Peep and finally revealed how she was given away by Andy's sister Molly. After years of not seeing each other, Woody and Bo Peep finally meet at the carnival.<br/><br/>The film introduced multiple new characters that were endearing and hilarious. Bunny and Ducky were two of my favorite characters in the movie. Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael Key voiced Bunny and Ducky perfectly. Keanu Reeves voiced Duke Kaboom and took me by surprise while watching this movie. I knew that Keanu Reeves would be voicing someone, but I did not know who.<br/><br/>The ending where Woody decided to leave Bonnie and stay at the Carnival with Bo Peep was heartwarming and emotional. I even cried a little when Woody was saying goodbye to Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the toys. When Buzz said that Bonnie is going to be fine my heart was broken. It felt like the end of an era for Woody.<br/><br/>To conclude, Toy Story 4 made me smile, laugh and cry. It is just as good as the previous installments in the franchise. It may be my favorite animated movie of the year."

Boy was I disappointed.<br/><br/>One thing which grates on me is the fact that woody and buzz gain new phrases in each film. (I doubt there were patches for updating the voice boxes) but the characters which have been built up for over 20 years were destroyed in this film. Buzz became a thoughtless golem, Jessie sat back and did nothing, all the other usually strong supporting characters were limited to droll one liners and woody was just pathetic. Bo Peep was built up far too much and was really just a shallow typical rebel stereotype.<br/><br/>Overall there was just far too much taken away from the original 3 films that even the few positives, great animations and superb direction and editing.

"ojford","3","7","11","5 August 2019"," Worst of the series, with some fun
","Some good jokes, it will keep the kids quiet for an hour, but it doesn't compare to the others. There's no real antagonist or conflict. The new toy Gaby Gaby is alright for a bit, and there are some very creepy dummies. But then Gaby Gaby tells us her sob story, we feel sad for her, and Woody gives up his voice box.<br/><br/>She makes a kid happy and goes off. Which is nice, but means the movie lacks the danger and excitement the other ones had. This is a series of disconnected problems rather than a single story. And Woody at the end is no longer a toy loyal to his child. He's grown up and runs off with Bo Peep. Which is a plausible development for him, but takes away from his character as a toy who sticks with the other toys always and reminds them to be loyal to the children who own them. Buzz is also extremely underused.<br/><br/>I would say it's a bad development. Toy Story worked because of the fantasy of your toys coming to life when you're not in the room. To have them go off and live by themselves takes away that fantasy, and the feelgood factor of thinking about your toys really caring about you. Toy Story 3 ended it well with the toys having another kid who loves them and who love her back. This film ruined that."
"lukepiraccini-82505","6","65","154","21 June 2019"," So Disappointing That I Left The Theater Upset
","To start this off, I didn't think that a fourth Toy Story was necessary in the first place. But I decided to give it a fair shot. The movie simply doesn't capture the magic of the first three and left me confused. The movie starts off with Woody being the only toy left in the closet while Bonnie plays with the rest of her toys. But at the end of Toy Story 3, Bonnie loves Woody and even calls him her ""cowboy doll."" Seeing this, Andy gives his old pal to her so she can take good care of him... and this obviously doesn't happen.
The main gang (Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex, Jessie etc.) sees very little screen time too. This takes part of the spirit from the previous three movies away and by the end of the movie, something felt missing and sure enough it was this. Throughout most of the movie they just sit in the van and are kind of useless until the end.
The antagonists are also fairly weak in this movie. Gabby Gabby is a weird doll (along with her other strange dolls) who wants Woody's voice box so she can work properly in order to get a kid of her own. This is odd and almost creepy especially when they attempt to rip Woody's voice box out from his back. In the end, her little sob story works and Woody gives her his voice box in exchange for Forky. I get why Woody makes all the decisions he does in the movie but it's just overdone and kind of unnecessary.
Also, Buzz seems to be kind of stupid in this movie and is kind of a shell of his original self.
In the end, Woody stays with Bo Peep and leaves Bonnie and his friends. To me this ending is not satisfying at all and ended the movie on a sour note for me.
But there are some good things about the movie too. Duke Kaboom (Keanu Reeves) steals the show every time he's on screen and is a unique character that I enjoyed. Ducky and Bunny (Keegan Michael Key and Jordan Peele) are very funny and are also great additions to the story. Tom Hanks of course nails it as Woody and the animation is fantastic. The movie itself is also very funny.
Overall, Toy Story 4 falls short compare to the first three. The movie ends up feeling very weird and it's not the ending to the series that I had imagined. The plot is good but not great as it some things seemed almost forced. There are parts where a character's mind wanders off and they stop and look at something else which totally throwing the momentum of the movie off (this happens multiple times). This movie really disappointed me and it didn't even feel like a Toy Story movie. They should've ended with the third movie if I'm being completely honest. I grew up watching all these movies and for it to end like this just made me sad."
"bradleyyount","4","2","2","24 April 2020"," Step backwards
","Everything the Toy Story 1, 2, and 3 lead up to was demolished by this movie. What was the point of this story? Really!? Woody was bullied continuously until the bully got her way. The ending of Toy story 3 set in stone that Woody will always be loyal, that is until the end of toy story 4. The main toy character in 4 only wanted garbage. How do you explain to kids that toys don't really like garbage. Just all around not appropriate for any age. First Pixar movie that my kids have refused to watch a second time."
"2001mmFilm","7","2","2","4 March 2020"," 'Good Film But Unwelcome Sequel'
","Essentially, the story of, well, Toy Story, ended perfectly, with Andy passing on his collection to Bonnie, a small girl who shared the same love and appreciation for the toys that defined his childhood. The third film in the series is easily the best, boasting an epic sense of scale and an emotional weight, which is DESERVED by the third film in any good trilogy. Every character, from the Potato Heads to Slinky Dog have their climactic send-off moment, and the plot truly builds on and refines the themes of the previous two films. The camera pans up to the iconic blue sky and white puffy clouds, and the story has been told.<br/><br/>Then, nine years later, arrives Toy Story 4, a movie which feels more like a spin-off about Woody and Bo-Peep and less like the natural continuation to the three prior films. The ""4"" in the title is unwarranted. Major characters of the original trilogy, primarily and shockingly Buzz Lightyear himself, are given little to do. You simply can't do this. A sequel must always build on the characters and world of the original film/s in some way. Buzz's character here feels dumbed down. He resorts to listening to his ""inner voice"", a useless gimmick both for the story and the intended comedy. Audiences don't get the sense that this is the same heroic Buzz Lightyear who once led a daring troop of toys to rescue Woody from Al the Toy Collector in Toy Story 2 (1999). It's not authentic narratively. Buzz would never abandon Woody to brave the antique shop alone because of the aforementioned ""inner voice"". Whatever happened to his romance with Jessie, set up in Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3? The movie chooses not to answer this question. The focus is Woody. In this film he appears to have been neglected by his owner Bonnie. Kids are like this. They like certain things and certain ages. However, Toy Story 3 put such an emphasis on Bonnie's affection and love towards Woody, so to disregard all that in this follow-up feels unearned. The transition between films is flat as a result.<br/><br/>Even stranger, the film feels smaller than Toy Story 3, there's less going on and less to care about. The majority of the runtime takes place in an antique store, run by a weak villain with a predictable Pixar-ish resolution. Gabby-Gabby doesn't compare to Sid, Stinky Pete, or Lotso in ANY way. The threat is minimal, so we don't care. Forky is a fun character, and we should be invested in Woody rescuing him, but realistically, we have it in the back of our minds that he IS in fact a Spork. Bonnie will grow tired of him as soon as she turns five. The other new characters in this film dominate the screentime. If this movie is supposed to be the ending to the three predecessors, why are we spending more time with THEM than the characters of those movies? The new characters' jokes, which only occasionally land, don't add anything of emotional weight to the story. Cut them out and have more scenes of Buzz talking to Woody, or ANY of the original characters doing something other than sitting around in an RV.<br/><br/>Bo Peep is a new character altogether here. She looks and sounds different despite being voiced by Annie Potts of the first two movies. People's voices change over time, but her updated look adds no sense of consistency between sequels. Her romance with Woody is sparingly touched upon in a way that actually gives the ending any greater pay-off. She's not that big of a deal in the first two movies anyway, and the third just writes her off through a piece of dialogue that says more about Woody's relationship with her than this movie tries to.<br/><br/>Despite this, the film works well when it wants to. The intro showing us how Bo Peep became a lost toy feels like a segment right out of the first two movies. The animation is stunning and life-like. Pixar truly outdo themselves. The scene where Woody berates Bo for not knowing ""loyalty"" and how he has ""nothing left to do"" but to care for Bonnie is great, and a genuine character moment. Old musical cues from the previous films provide ample nostalgia, and it's nice to see Randy Newman is still composing for the series. Duke Caboom has an epic and cathartic final stunt, even if his arc adds nothing to the broader story.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is superfluous. Worse yet, it's very existence makes Toy Story 3 superfluous. One is so clearly intended to be the ending, and the other is an optional extension you can live without, even IF it takes the protagonist Woody in an unforeseen direction. The ""to infinity and beyond"" climax will never be as stirring as Andy's last playtime, and the incinerator scene is still one of the most emotional scenes in cinema history. Additionally, this movie feels nowhere near as enjoyable or rewatchable as the original trilogy. It's cut from a different cloth, whereas all three previous movies feel like a family. Pixar has been losing their touch lately, and while Toy Story 4 certainly isn't an offender, it carries the name of a series which demands more than simply; great."
"FireHead322199","2","2","2","20 February 2020"," Beautiful animation, mediocre story
","It is surprising that instead of just leaving Toy Story be Pixar decides to make another sequel. Only this time the story feels almost like a rehash of its predecessors instead of doing something new and original. Not only is the film unoriginal but after watching the film a second time it some how got worse. That's not to say that the film is the worst movie ever it just not on the same level as the previous three films. Toy story 4 more or less feels like an epilogue to a series that has already had a satisfying ending. However, ending on a more positive note the film does take full advantage of utilizing advanced technology to create a beautiful looking film that just shows how far 3D animation has come since the original Toy Story."

","TOY STORY 4 is an addition to the original trilogy that really shouldn't have been made. I thought part three was pushing it a bit, a late-stage addition that somehow tied up things nicely with a real sense of nostalgia and time moving on, whereas this feels more like a cynical cash-grab. There are flashbacks and reunions in order to get the main characters in familiar settings, but the rest feels very tired; once again there are separations and rescues and quirky supporting characters. Some of the new voice actors are amusing enough (hello, Keanu Reeves) but otherwise this offers nothing new whatsoever - aside from improved animation."

"GiraffeDoor","8","2","2","31 December 2019"," I'm glad they made this.
","I thought that the third one was an impeccable swansong that wrapped up the saga in a nice little bow.<br/><br/>This latest entry makes the story a cool trilogy plus one more rather than a solid tetralogy but that doesn't mean it didn't justify its own existence.<br/><br/>Furthering the series' main them of lost purpose and obsolescence, they hit the ground running with yet ANOTHER scene that had me tearing up. The main plot shows a very believable new problem for Woody as he (rather admirably) adjusts to a new home and a new pecking order.<br/><br/>There's something rather heart rending in watching Woody do what he clearly thinks is the right thing but also obliquely expose his own fears and insecurities. Despite having undergone three movies' worth of character development already, they really brought it with both the physical and internal conflict propelling the movie in an intelligent way as two estranged friends reunite and respond to the opposite life choices the other has made.<br/><br/>The antagonist is fresh and distinctive and also provides complex motivations and grey morality in a way which completely enriches the movie. There are also strangely erotic undertones between them and another new character (not that I'm complaining).<br/><br/>This truly is a story about Woody. They do try to give all the old favourites the screen time they deserve but the truth is their character arc is over. Jessie provides some logistical support and Buzz some comic relief with a running gag.<br/><br/>All the humour and perfectly executed set pieces are there. I can't think of more to say about them.<br/><br/>There is a moment...I don't want to spoil it but the sense of restrained dread it creates is powerful. In this one sentence the writers of this showed more talent than so many horror movie writers do in their careers. I do love a good horror but they totally get that balance between heavy handed and too subtle. You'll know the moment when you see it.<br/><br/>I felt this was a convincing and heartfelt effort to further the series in a way that enriched it. It is not a cash in sequel, although it is not the masterpiece that the third movie was, it is still a sincere depiction of the conflict between enduring love and our desire to be loved that, if you commit to watching on its own terms, will provide you with the finale to the series that will leave you more than satisfied."

"mariatbaldwin","5","28","61","24 June 2019"," Completely out of character - disappointing
","I was a freshman in college when the first Toy Story movie came out and I was an instant fan. The characters are so endearing, including the new ones added as the series went on. They do a great job at developing their story lines so you become emotionally invested in them. I had reservations going to see the 4th one as the 3rd one seemed like the perfect ending but off I went with my kids.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I was let down. Yes, it was funny and entertaining and my kids loved it but I didn't. The new characters were hit and miss. Forky was a well developed, complex character and Duke Caboom had a good story line as we can all relate to getting a new toy that did not live up to the expectation set by the TV commercial. However, he was in the movie for only a few minutes and Forky went from main character to ""lost"" toy we hardly saw again. As for Ducky and Bunny and Giggle McDimples, I didn't feel like they added much to the movie and I would have rather spend more time with the original gang, which we hardly got to see.<br/><br/>Gabby Gabby was not a good villain and she didn't have a believable story. If she was defective from the factory, how did she pass inspection? How come the antique store owner didn't fix her voice box in order to sell her as a collectible item? She was an annoying bully who stole Woody's voice box and I didn't have much sympathy for her but at the end I am supposed to care for her?<br/><br/>The worst was the movie's treatment of the main characters we've come to know and love. Woody, Buzz and Bonnie behave in ways completely out of character. What are the chances of Bonnie leaving out ONLY Woody at play time? And Woody having a mid life crisis and abandoning his kid and friends? Buzz believing his recordings are real? Even Be Bop went from a sweet ceramic shepherdess to...a broken Lara Croft? How and when did this all happen? Perhaps that would have been a more interesting movie, however, in the movie these changes happened overnight and we are supposed to go along with them. Very disappointing."

"crosswalkx","3","7","12","11 October 2019"," This is the worst Toy Story movie that I've seen Woody let me down and Forky is annoying.
","I have seen this movie and I was very disappointed in it. What the heck happened to Woody that we all know from the first 3 Toy Story films? Woody is a weak character, Bo Peep is a selfish jerk who roped Woody away from Bonnie. What happened to Bo Peep, she put Woody down, this is not like her that we know her from Toy Story 1, 2 when she was kind and gentle. I don't like it that they made her into a bossy character and put Woody down.<br/><br/>I didn't like the Spork character Forky, he was very annoying, Seriously Woody was weak, yes I know that he had issues with jealously but he changed after that. Also why is Buzz so clueless, he wouldn't hesitate in the first 3 movies. Except when he found out the truth that he's a toy.<br/><br/>This movie continues right off when Woody and the Gang are donated to Bonnie, Bonnie goes to kindergarten and is scared, Woody helps her make a craft called Forky who turns out to be very annoying and talkative. Woody and the Gang go on a road trip in a trailer. Woody and Forky jumps out of the window and they wind up in the small town where a carnival is going on. Woody meets a girl doll named Gabby Gabby at the antique shop, they meet the dummy doll guards who kidnaps Forky, Buzz Lightyear now relies on his voice box to tell him what to do.<br/><br/>Woody meets with Bo Peep who was donated away and she become sassy and bossy and takes control of the whole thing and they meet new toys including Duke Caboom and Ducky and Bunny. They fail to rescue Forky in their rescue mission. Woody decides to give his voice box to Gabby and the gang stalls the trailer with a flat tire and then having them drive around the carnival. Gabby finds one girl who didn't care about dolls but then finds another girl who's lost and crying and is taken away. Then Woody decides that Bonnie no longer cares for him anymore and decides to be a lost toy and has the kids cheat at the carnival games while the rest of the gang leaves Woody behind, then Forky's girlfriend is made. And this movie ends in somewhat of a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>What happened to Pixar and Disney? They made 3 of the best Toy Story movies. What happened to the Woody we knew? I didn't like how he decided to become dishonest and help the kids cheat at the carnival shooting gallery games. I am ashamed of Woody in this film.<br/><br/>Also what happened to Bo Peep? She was kind and gentle in the first 2 Toy Story films. Why did become so rude and bossy? I didn't like her very much and how she bullied Woody, put him down and roped him into staying behind. They should've had her still be kind and caring and think about others instead of thinking about herself.<br/><br/>Also what happened to Buzz Lightyear, he's now clueless and has his voice box telling him what to do. I'm very disappointed in Buzz, why would he abandon his mission, that's not the Buzz Lightyear I know, Also why didn't they give Jessie and Bullseye enough screen time.<br/><br/>I'm very disappointed in this forth movie, they should've just had Jessie the cowgirl be the main star instead. They should've had a different ending with having Woody and Bo Peep coming along for the ride instead of staying behind and helping kids cheat at the game and maybe running into Andy at college.<br/><br/>Don't they realize that cheating at the carnival games will cause prices to go up? What message is Pixar and Disney trying to teach us? That it's okay to be dishonest and cheat at Carnival games? I don't like cheating or stealing, toy prizes should be challenging to get not easy to win. This was the most disappointing ending I've seen to Toy Story 4, it should've ended at Toy Story 3, this forth movie ruined it for me.<br/><br/>Also why didn't they do a spin off TV series, it would've been better and giving Toys like Hamm, Mr. Potato, Slinky Dog and Jessie their own adventures. I would've enjoyed watching the Toy Story TV series. If they plan on doing Toy Story 5 which I hope not, they better have Woody and Bo Peep reuniting with Andy and maybe Jessie's gang.<br/><br/>In conclusion I will forget this forth movie ever existed and watch the first 3. I would've liked to see Andy at College meeting his girlfriend, get married and have kids of their own, that would've been more interesting to watch. In the Meantime I'll watch Toy Story 1, 2, 3 which are far better than this forgettable forth film."

","As someone who's grown up with the toy story franchise, Toy Story 4 is an unnecessary entry that ruins the perfect, satisfying, and emotional conclusion of 3, and instead leaving the franchise with an unneeded ending that doesn't feel earned, emotional, or gratifying in the slightest.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 pushes away a majority of the characters we have grown up with, even Buzz who is given an extremely dumbed down role in the film, in favour of a slew of new characters that aren't given nearly enough time to be new franchise favourites, even if they are entertaining in their short moments onscreen (besides the snooze-inducing villain).<br/><br/>While Woody's journey in this film does have interesting moments, Toy Story 4 feels far more linear and uninspired than any of the other movies, ranging from boring, to frustrating when the film ends on a moment that is meant to be tearjerking and heartbreaking, and is instead incredibly frustrating as it feels like a waste of everything in the series so far, rapidly throwing away the character relationships we've grown up to love and cherish as audiences.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the beautiful animation is not enough to accommodate for the uninteresting story and completely baffling ending."

It revolves around ""forky"" who I absolutely hated so it was off to a bad start early and large parts of it are set in an antique store which proved to be both a boring and a creepy setting. Kids were scared by the weird ventriloquist dummies. All my children rated this as the worst toy story movie and I definitely agree with them. The stand out was bo peep as a rough tough independent woman, but woody really needed a much more exciting story and a better supporting cast. Regretted spending the money to go to the movies for this."
"davidmvining","10","5","8","17 January 2020"," The best of the Toy Story movies
","There is no reason that a movie about toys should be this emotional affecting, but there's no denying it. Woody's journey in this movie feels as real to me as any in recent memory. It takes the fantastical situation of living toys and applies a recognizable metaphor that relates to the human experience, all done with possibly the most realistic visuals of any animated movie and in a lively idiom that can appeal to children at the same time. It's a delicate balancing act that the movie pulls of perfectly.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 seemingly left off at the perfect spot. The toys had said goodbye to Andy, their previous kid, and they were placed in the hands of a little girl named Bonnie. All seemed well with the world, and there should be nowhere else emotionally for them to go. Well, they found something really good for Woody, and that was uselessness. Bonnie just isn't interested in playing with Woody anymore. This is a very different dynamic than when Buzz showed up in Andy's room in the first film. Woody had his long life with one kid and is trying to start another, but it's just not taking. He doesn't feel indignation at a lost place, because he's never had it with Bonnie, but simply uselessness. He's spent his life giving joy to a kid, and now he's in a position where he can't help.<br/><br/>When Bonnie goes to kindergarten orientation and isn't allowed any toys along, so Woody sees his chance and sneaks along, helping her to find solace in the creation of Forky, the new marketing opportunity for Disney. Forky, though, is a handful, and requires Woody's every attention as he tries to throw himself away, convinced that he's nothing more than trash. What makes this Forky bit really effective is that Forky is a mirror image of Woody in every way. Forky is thrown together from a spork and other simple materials while Woody was lovingly crafted decades before. Forky knows his purpose is to be trash and not help a kid, but Woody is effectively trash and knows that his purpose is to help a kid. Their bonding helps provide Woody with the beginning of clarity that maybe his time as a kid's toy is done.<br/><br/>That doesn't come to complete fruition, however, until Woody meets Bo-Peep again. Lost for more than seven years and without a kid, Bo has lived her life of freedom to the fullest, getting played with by random kids but never tying herself down to a single kid. The two are at odds because Woody is desperate to get back to Bonnie after having been separated from her and Bo simply cannot understand why he would want to continue in that life having given so much already. Out of their past friendship, though, Bo helps Woody track down Forky after he's been taken by Gabby Gabby, the queen bee toy of the local antique shop.<br/><br/>Gabby Gabby has a similar journey as Woody. She's useless, in her mind, because of a broken voice box and all she wants is to fix it so she can appeal to Harmony, the granddaughter of the woman who owns the shop. When she eventually gets the voice box, she gets as rejected as Woody has been by Bonnie, and she enters a deep depression.<br/><br/>There are four characters in this film going through similar and related journeys, which is a lot, but the movie makes it work specifically because they're similar and related. They're all touching on the same idea of purpose and just approaching it from different directions. The other key is that three of them play as support to Woody's journey. They help inform Woody's emotional reality. Through Forky, he can see that his purpose isn't always to actually play with a kid. Through Bo, he can see the value of living without a kid. Through Gabby, he gives away a part of himself that makes him a toy in order to help another find a kid. When Woody eventually lets go of his life as a kid's toy, it's a decision that makes perfect sense for him, providing him with an enticing alternative life with Bo. It reflects, in a certain way, the empty nest of a parent who's seen their children off to college, looking for a new life to live not centered around another person dependent on them. It's a relatable feeling that bridges the emotional gap between living people and a rubber toy in a movie.<br/><br/>In addition to the movie's strong emotional and narrative core, there are strengths abounding. The voice acting is great. There was a technical innovation that provided Pixar the ability to more accurately reflect light levels that gives the visuals a far more textured and realistic look, making the whole affair more sumptuous to simply look at. There's a wide array of side characters both old and new (from Buzz and Jesse to the new Duke Caboom) that fill out the edges of the frame to entertaining effect.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, the film is thematically rich, entertaining, and a joy to watch. This is one of Pixar's best films."
"generationofswine","10","5","8","14 January 2020"," An Honest Review
","I THOUGHT I saw Toy Story 2, I know I didn't see Toy Story 3, and, honestly, that doesn't matter.<br/><br/>What matters is that parts of 4 are HYSTERICALLY CREEPY, not in the child inappropriate kind of way, but still creepy enough to add a decent amount of humor for adults that sit down and watch it.<br/><br/>So, it looks like we are getting back to the 80s and 90s where cartoons add things for parents and not just wine moms, single cat owning aunties, and children. There are actual jokes here that adults in the room will be entertained by, and that is all I ask for in a children's cartoon, throw something in it for the people that have to take their kids out to see it so it doesn't feel as much like a chore."

"neibrad","2","5","8","20 October 2019"," Not a Toy Story sequel
","This is a very disappointing movie. It's disappointing in the same way that the new Star Wars movies are, and for the same reasons: whoever wrote this garbage is not a fan of the previous movies and have obviously only watched them so that they can work on the project.
The characters don't act in ways that have been built in previous movies. Buzz is a moron. Woody doesn't care about his family of toys anymore. Bo, who only had minor roles in previous movies seems to have morphed into a manipulative psychopath who's only goal is to break up the toy team.
As other reviewers have noted, the ending is terrible. For me though the worst thing about this movie is that it's dark and there are some really immoral things happening. Is it OK to teach kids that stealing is fine if it makes someone feel better and you won't be punished for it?
The new stunt bike toy is probably the highlight of the movie, but that's because it's Keanu. The dolly is scary as are her mob and shouldn't be in a kids movie. The spork is amusing for 10 seconds and then is just a pain In The a$$. The rabbit and angry bird made me want to throw something at the screen.
The movies should have ended at 3."

Well, somewhat different in this one is that Woody always needs to be told what to do & when to do it by Bo Peep. This is not surprising given Hollywood's current need to portray women as strong & noble and men as weak & nasty.
And then there is Gabby, who is alternately sweet(ish) & evil. The only thing more creepy than Gabby are her accomplices. How/why did they decide to make Creepy Story with main themes being emancipation and emasculation?"

Yet I was clinging to that routine and life. without it, my reality would be a complete void. That's what woody is dealing with, all his life he found meaning through making Randy happy, the last one who cherished him. But, now he's owned by Bonnie things don't seem to go well, as he ends up unused in the closet. So he tries to force a scenario where he makes her happy not for the sake of ""making her happy"" but for the feeling of fulfillment, even indirectly by protecting sparky. However, he ends up realizing that life changes and chapters go by. and like any other toy story film, this one is also an epopÃ© about moving on, not the same way as the third where the moving on represented growing up. here the moving forward is accepting the unknown, embracing the changes of wind and trusting your guts. it's an existential tale disguised as a kid's story. and god, how touching, relatable, emotional and funny it was!

"davideo-2","9","5","8","4 September 2019"," A risky gamble, but pays off in the end
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Woody and the gang are back, and their new owner Bonnie is preparing for her first day at Kindergarten. By a freak accident, Woody gets taken with her to Kindergarten, where Bonnie ends up creating a toy of her own- Forkie, made with a discarded plastic fork and some accessories. When Forkie gets separated from Bonnie, and the little girl gets upset without her favourite toy, Woody, driven by a sense of duty to keep his owner happy, embarks on a desperate mission to find him, leading him into all sorts of triumpths and trevails.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3, the last Toy Story film, was already released over ten years after the previous film in 2010, which shows how it was already seen as a sure fire box office success even back then, and therefore safe to regurgitate after such a long lapse since the last one. Toy Story 4 emerges with less (but not much!) of a time gap in the shape of nine years since that film, but once again there's the feeling of the studios being in desperate need of something safe and easy to make a quick buck. And, that aside, three is the magic number. Things were wrapped up nicely that time around, with the grown up Andy going off to college, and handing his beloved childhood toys over to the little girl Bonnie, who is the focus of their attention here.<br/><br/>And yet, from this new stand point, director Josh Cooley, making his feature length debut, still manages to evoke the magic and charm that made the first three such successes, albeit from a different stand point. While not featuring massively in the film, Bonnie's attachment to her toys (especially the one she created!), and their reciprocated affection makes for as endearing a film as any of the others, with Woody's devine sense of duty and loyalty to his owner shining through. Buzz fits in nicely in a background role, as contrasting and wise cracking a sidekick as ever to his mismatched counterpart.<br/><br/>There is a feeling of pushing the boat out too far, tarnishing the originality and magic, certainly of the first two, and even the third film, but Cooley proves them totally unfounded, creating a production that, certainly for the most part, maintains the magic and excitement of the last few, whilst keeping the same high standard of spellbinding animation. Nobody could rule out a fifth film, but on the basis of this, I'd at least give it a go first. ****"

","After watching all of the Toy Story movies over the past week, I can confidently come to the conclusion that the hierarchy goes 3>1>4=2. Toy Story 4 falls into that animated movie category where you feel like you had a decent time but the story will never stick with you. Like all of the films in the series, the characters discovered new and interesting things about themselves and there was an overarching lesson to be taught, but Toy Story 4 is ultimately much more forgettable than previous installments."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Yes, it's another instant classic from Pixar. No, we shouldn't be surprised. Their track record is beyond compare. But I can't help it. How the heck do they do it time after time, movie after movie? We have known (most of) the characters for 25 years now, and this fourth entry seems every bit as fresh and creative as the first one. We like these characters, and it doesn't matter that they are animated. We laugh and cry and worry about them as if they are our friends.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks returns as our favorite cowboy Woody (yes, he still has a snake in his boot), and Tim Allen is back as Buzz Lightyear (still unable to grasp that he's not a real space ranger). Also returning is Annie Potts as Bo Peep, now a strong, independent ""lost"" toy with excellent survival and scavenging skills. Some new toys and voices inject real pizazz to the adventures. Christina Hendricks charms as Gabby Gabby, a doll quite desperate for her own kid; Keanu Reeves shines as Duke Caboom, a showboating motorcycle stunt rider who may not be as daring as his big talk; and Tony Hale turns Forky into a lovable little cockeyed spork-toy. Also bringing fun and a new comedic element are the hilarious team of Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key as Bunny and Ducky, respectively.<br/><br/>The opening sequence takes place 9 years ago, and we see how Bo Peep became separated from the others, and how the toys transitioned to Bonnie and how Bonnie transitioned to Kindergarten, and how Forky transitioned from trash to toy. And fear not, the old favorite toys are all here: Wallace Shawn as Rex, Joan Cusack as Jessie (I expected a bigger role for her), Timothy Dalton as Mr. Pricklepants, Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Blake Clark as Slinky Dog, and courtesy of archival recordings, two posthumous appearances by Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and Bud Luckey as Chuckles the Clown.<br/><br/>With his first feature film as director, Josh Cooley follows up his screenplay for the brilliant INSIDE OUT with a touching and superbly funny film. The screenplay comes from Andrew Stanton (2 time Oscar winner, FINDING NEMO, WALL-E) and Stephany Folsom, while the original story credits are many, including John Lasseter in his last project with Pixar. Even though the film is Rated G, it should be noted that it's a pretty complex story for youngsters, and the Charlie McCarthy dolls are kind of terrifying - at least to me and Forky. TOY STORY (1995), TOY STORY 2 (1998), TOY STORY 3 (2010) get the send-off they deserve, so ""move your plush"" and go see it! Randy Newman is back with a new song, as well as the familiar melody and lyrics from his Oscar nominated ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" ... a friend indeed."

","Having grown up with the whole gang and the superb ending that was Toy Story 3 with the final playtime, I went into this movie feeling it was already not needed and wouldn't surpass Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>From the get go, the animation is incredible with photorealistic scenes and textures throughout, and especially impressive with the water effects and lighting, you are sucked in and it all looks believable. Beyond that, the movie had plenty of good in it. Many of the new characters are solid at supporting the plot and add their own fling, though usually in a cliched way, the new locations are also very fun and have opportunities to add a new flare. There were many positive messages throughout and I won't deny that a couple parts had me (a grown man) tearing up, especially after preparing for this movie by watching the first three, I was connected. The new antagonist was relatable and not really a bad guy, but provided conflicts in grey area that made her more realistic and empathetic, her arc was natural and a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Past all this, I am highly disappointed and sad they even made this movie, for it really felt like a side story. First off, the story follows our main protagonist, woody, but leaves out and really neglects the original cast that we've grown with. Buzz himself also gets fewer scenes and comes off like he hasn't gone through the growth the other movies provided. Beyond him, the potato heads, slinky, Jessie, and so on had barely any lines themselves and neglected their built characters to sit back in the RV and let the story go on without them. Bo Peep the returning protagonist was predictable and had no real values that she didn't change to support Woody as soon as the story needed it.<br/><br/>The ending was a major disappointment and totally out of character for the whole gang to break up; This felt like a betrayal, having grown up with the gang from the beginning to this point. I teared up at this part, only because Buzz and Woody splitting up was unexpected, and ridiculous with all the films having main themes revolving around the importance of friends and never giving up on each other. Was this a move by Pixar to truly end things in some ""surprising"" way, or just to set up new movies in new locations?<br/><br/>Also, are we all tired of the gang not believing Woody in each movie? They immediately don't believe him when he tells the gang something that actually happened and then feel bad later to kickstart the conflict and journey, they need to move past this coil, we had enough of that after the second movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I understand why they made this movie, to usher in the new generation of kids and ultimately make money off that nostalgia, but because this movie was made, it detracted from the previous ending of Toy Story 3 that, in my opinion, was perfect. The main cast was neglected and had their built character cast aside for new, generally cliched characters. I hope they don't make anymore, having restraint is more powerful with such an effective IP as Toy Story and that so many grew up with."
"John_Roland","1","8","15","20 November 2019"," Feminist garbage!
","I liked the first 3 toy stories! But not this one...
It has the same feminist BS in it, that seems to be present in a lot of recent movies. With some questionable morals.<br/><br/>All the male characters are stupid, or are a slave of some female, and all the female characters are awesome and heroes.<br/><br/>Suddenly Woody doesn't know what to do, and follows Bo around like a puppet. A female sheriff has taken over, and Bo basically says that he has to shut up, and follow her. Buzz also doesn't know that to do anymore and behave like a mindless dummy. Also the gang isn't a gang anymore just sitting in the van most of the time.<br/><br/>The Gabby doll is just evil. She want his voicebox, because that the only way she can be loved. Woody has to just roll over and hand it over.
What kind of moral is this?!
I recommend to see the first 3 parts of Toy Story, and leave part 4 alone"

","Unnecessary. Forced. Repetitive. Redundant. Mediocre. All words I could easily use to describe Toy Story 4, without fear of being unfair. While not as bad as other previous Pixar misfires, this sequel sadly does a disservice to a perfectly crafted trilogy that had its sunset... but now is reborn out of necessity and not quite as well-shaped as its predecessors.<br/><br/>I had to see Toy Story 4 because I believed the producers would not allow their prized movie series to be tainted by Disney's requests for cash-grab sequels. Surely they had something in mind that could surpass the third installment. What could it be? I had to see it. Sadly, it was nothing worth it.<br/><br/>The movie repeats the previous movie's general plot (lost toy tries to go back to it's kid), but not as cleverly. It's tiring and repetitive, with the same rescue scenes again and again, making the whole thing seem tiresome and badly paced. There was nothing new that was brought by this film that wasn't already covered or portrait in previous films, but they just had to do it. It sticks out as a bad outlier, as an anticlimactic finale.<br/><br/>While not necessarily bad, it pales in comparison, suffers from pace issues, has a terribly unmemorable antagonist and taints the third film's ending and purpose.<br/><br/>Like Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I say, stick with the trilogy and forget about this one."

","Review:
What a great movie! The animation was on point, along with the storyline and the various characters, who all brought an emotional and amusing tone to the film. The plot goes from strength to strength, as we follow Woody and his pals on an epic journey to get Forky to his true owner, and with the additional characters like Gabby Gabby and Duke Caboom, who cracked me up, I was glued to the screen from the start. There is enough material to keep adults and kids entertained, and the simple but detailed storyline has proved that Pixar is the kings of animation. We all fell in love with the Toy Story characters after the first movie, but the 2nd and 3rd films in the franchise, didn't do as well, and when it was announced that this was the last rodeo for Woody, I didn't know what to expect. Now that I've seen the film, I'm extremely happy with the direction that they took characters, and I highly recommend it to all movie-goers. The film is set nine years earlier, following the events of Toy Story 2, were Bo Peep and Woody attempt to rescue RC, Andy's remote-controlled car, from a rainstorm. Just as they finish the rescue, Woody watches as Bo is donated to a new owner, and considers going with her, but ultimately decides to remain with Andy. Years later, a teenage Andy donates them to Bonnie, a younger child, before he goes off to college. While the toys are grateful to have a new child, Woody struggles to adapt to a new environment, where he is not the favourite as he was with Andy. On the day of Bonnie's kindergarten orientation, Woody worries over her and sneaks into her backpack. After a classmate takes away Bonnie's arts and crafts supplies, Woody covertly recovers the materials and various pieces of garbage from the trash, including a plastic fork. Bonnies uses these to create a bipedal fork with googly eyes, whom she calls Forky. Forky comes to life in Bonnie's backpack and begins to experience an existential crisis, thinking he is garbage rather than a toy and wishing to remain in a trash can, which is absolutely hilarious. As Forky becomes Bonnie's favourite toy, Woody takes it upon himself to prevent Forky from throwing himself away. When Bonnie's family goes on a road trip, Forky jumps out of the RV window and Woody pursues him. After Woody explains how important he is to Bonnie, Forky decides to accompany Woody and return to her. Near the RV park where Bonnie's family is staying, Woody spots Bo Peep's lamp in an antique store window and goes in, hoping to find her. Inside, he and Forky encounter a talking doll called Gabby Gabby, who desires Woody's voice box to replace her broken one. While Woody is able to escape, Gabby captures Forky. At a playground, Woody is reunited with Bo Peep and her sheep, who now live as ""lost toys"" that aren't dedicated to one child. Bo agrees to help Woody save Forky and get back to Bonnie. I won't go into the outcome because I don't want to spoil it for those people who haven't seen it. With the introduction of some new characters to help Woody to save Forky (Tony Hale), who include Ducky (Keegan-Michael Key), Bunny (Jordan Peele), Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves) and Giggle McDimples (Ally Maki), the writers covered every aspect, right to the very end. Like most Pixar movies, the animation is supreme quality, and I really couldn't find a fault. In my eyes, it is a must-see for all ages, especially if you're a fan of any of the previous Toy Story films. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Josh Cooley, who also brought you George and A.J. and Riley's First Date, which were unheard of. For his first project, he had a massive task on his hands to put this franchise to bed. Luckily, he did a better job than the previous directors of the 2nd and 3rd movies, which were made by Pixar creator John Lasseter and Lee Unkrich. In terms of money, Toy Story made $407million, Toy Story 2 made $509million and Toy Story 3 made $1.06billion, which makes this film the highest-grossing in the franchise to date, and that's before it is released to buy. I just hope the next movie's from Pixar, Onward & Soul, live up to there expectations.<br/><br/>Budget: $200million
Worldwide Gross:$1.07billion<br/><br/>Genre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family, Fantasy
Cast: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts, Tony Hale, Keegan-Michael Key, Madeleine McGraw, Christina Hendricks, Jordan Peele, Keanu Reeves, Ally Maki, Jay Hernandez, Lori Alan, Joan Cusack, Bonnie Hunt, Carl Weathers, Jeff Garlin, Mel Brooks, Betty White, Carl Reiner, Bill Hader, Patricia Arquette, Timothy Dalton and Flea. 8/10"

"paulclaassen","5","3","4","6 November 2019"," It just didn't do it for me, I'm afraid...
","Having enjoyed 'Toy Story 3' immensely, I was looking forward to 'Toy Story 4', but at the same time I was worried the story had nowhere left to go.<br/><br/>All the main characters from the previous films join together once again for another adventure. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy 'Toy Story 4' as much as I did 'Toy Story 3'. This installment is aimed at a young demographic. Yes, obviously, being animation, but 'Toy Story 3' had a rather mature theme and it was action-packed and exciting. This installment - although also an action adventure - had a very simple premise: get to Bonnie. There were too many incidents reminding me of a cartoon rather than an animated feature. The adventure element was also more childish. Maybe that was their vision for this installment, who knows.<br/><br/>Forky was by far my favorite character. At times some of the other characters had so little screen time that I completely forgot about them. Mr & Mrs Potato Head, for example - who were so prominent in 'Toy Story 3' - hardly even features in this film. There are simply too many characters. The comic relief characters Bunny and Ducky were so annoying! The Dummies, on the other hand, were creepy characters, while Gabby Gabby was sinister. As with many Hollywood franchises (Ice Age, How to train your dragon), this one also became a schmultzy love story - Woody and Bo Beep. Hmf.<br/><br/>The animation is awesome. Some scenes actually looked like the real thing."

"Lew777","6","3","4","28 October 2019"," This is just a money-maker
","It's a shame this movie got made as the end of Toy Story 3 was a perfect ending to the trilogy, heartfelt & meaningful. This film, whilst a reasonably good film, really detracts from the sentiment the Toy Story films had built up - that the toys were there for their children. This film is really Woody - The Movie dressed up as a sequel to Toy Story 3. It's superfluous and is a capital attempt to milk the cash cow from this franchise, which it'll do very well with, I'm sure. Shame - but in due time, this will be the forgotten film while Toy Story 1-3 will be remembered fondly. Don't plan a Toy Story 5 to movie this story forward - it just isn't worth it anymore."
"garabedbaghsarian","10","3","4","21 September 2019"," Childhood Masterpiece
","Although none of the sequels have quite matched the originality of the first Toy Story, this is a sweet film and its fun spending time with old friends. We've definitely seen some of the images before - toys in peril, Woodys obsession with being there for his kid no matter the cost even when hes being overlooked in favor of another toy. But there are genuine laugh-out-loud and reach-for-tissue moments, and a genuinely surprising ending that felt right. I believe it's the best way to end this movie series"
"tomorsr","10","3","4","21 September 2019"," My childhood is complete
","I was 7 when I first watched the original Toy Story in a theater. I'm now a 31 year old man. Still until this day the magic and emotions of Toy Story makes me feel that life continues to be wonderful and worth living. I felt that number 3 was a worthy end to our beloved characters and yet this final installment still managed to capture the essence of my childhood back to my adult self.
I'm not a film critic by any means, but what I can say is that by the end of this movie my eyes were dripping with tears. This doesn't happen with many movies, in fact very very few! Maybe it is because the Toy Story movies have been with me most of my life, or that each movie is a masterpiece in its own right, either way I don't care, all I know is I could not have asked for a better journey. So from the very depths of my heart - Thank you Pixar! Thank you for showing us such a beautiful adventure!"
"silvermistvio","9","3","4","15 September 2019"," Touchable, sad and love toy story.
","Toy Story films are really a good film. Some people think that Toy Story animations are for kids, so, adults shouldn't enjoy them. But as for me, whether it's kids or adults, Toy Story animations are really enjoyable. They give us a different view to the hidden world of toys and also different tastes.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is not just about how toys act when the owners are away, but also it has a love story. At the same time, the story is really touchable. The way Woody can give everything just to save forky and he doesn't want the voice box back even she gives back after she knows it's not working. It reminds me of the story between Wei Wuxian and Jiang Cheng (the truth about the golden core) of Mo Dao Zu Shi (The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation). Of course there's a little bit of difference. When I saw that scene, it's touched me and so, I cried. Woody is the greatest doll of all.<br/><br/>I didn't expect to see the love story hidden in this animation. I really love how Woody could leave Boonie and stays with Bo. I really want those two to be together forever.<br/><br/>Sad thing is that Boonie doesn't care Woody. I really feel bad for him. It's really sad to see such a scene. As the one who loves to see happy scenes, that scene is too much for me.<br/><br/>All in all, Toy Story 4 is a great animation as every Toy Story animation turned out great one. The story is great and the animation is also great as it always is. I don't care other people say that it's bad, as for me, Toy Story 4 is really great and I've enjoyed every second of it. If they are planning to make the 5th one, I'll be waiting for it to come out because I really love Toy Story animations."
"fciocca","7","3","4","15 September 2019"," The end of a beautiful saga
","This saga has more or less my same age, and it is amazing that Pixar decided to end this it after 24 years, with an ending that does justice to the entire franchise. They did a really good job: the fourth movie is an amazing adventure to rescue a new toy. We find all the old toys that we love, plus some new funny characters that will make the movie worth to be watched.<br/><br/>I also like the setting: it is different and fresh, something that in previous movies we did not saw, a gigatic open world that made possible to develop more narrative options, all this by keeping the same animation style, mixing something new, with something old. The result is a movie that entertains because easygoing and funny.<br/><br/>I have to be honest: I was a little bit skeptical about this Toy Story 4. This is a movie that is part of the childhood of many, many people, so Pixar had to pay a lot of attention, the probability to ruin this saga were pretty high, considering also the latest remakes that Disney is releasing, but in the end they made esomething unique and I have to really thank creators for this gift. I will miss these characters, but it is better to end the story here. The perfect conclusion, for one of the most beautiful and game changing animation movies of all time."
"MovieNinjaGuy","6","3","4","15 July 2019"," Unnecessary
","I think this movie has a lot of problems. It gets very messy in the middle with introducing a lot of characters and almost became unwatchable for me for a few minutes. It does recover and ends decently but it is not a patch on the original 3 movies which were all about the characters doing everything in their powers to stay together. Most of the favourites are absent for a long time and Buzz is too much of a moron at times.<br/><br/>I think Disney are going overboard with milking their properties. Don't think it is going to end well for a lot of their franchises at this rate. In the end Toy Story 4 was not necessary at all after a stunning 3rd instalment which had a perfect, unbeatable ending.<br/><br/>Great visuals but that doesn't really matter."
"dan_tench","2","4","6","25 December 2019"," Should have ended at Toy Story 3
","I wanted to much to love this movie, but beyond the usually superb animation, the story and characterisation really let this movie down. I didn't find myself caring about any of the new characters and in this instalment even the villein was lacklustre. Ultimately Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending and pulled on every heart string, toy story 4 feels like a money grab with no real story or direction and tries to therefore continue something which already felt like it had finished meaning the movie really doesn't work.... I'm just going to pretend this movie doesn't exist and hope to god they don't destroy this franchise further."

It was the perfect ending, but when a fourth installment was announced I was excited, but also a little concerned. Luckily there was nothing to worry about. Toy Story 4 is yet another worthy addition to the franchise. The writing is just as strong as the previous entries, as are the voice performances.<br/><br/>It's impossible for me to write about Toy Story 4 without mentioning the absolutely breathtaking visuals. From beginning to end, the animation was consistently stunning and is one of the best looking computer-animated movies I've seen.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 was a pleasure to watch.

"alexandriahicks-10795","10","27","67","21 June 2019"," Fans won't be disappointed
","I gotta admit, I was a little skeptical about the idea of a Toy Story 4. I thought Toy Story 3 was a satisfying ending to a great series. It wasn't until I gave the new edition a chance that I realized how much the series needed this.
The most obvious thing about TS4 is the incredible animation. WOW. Looking back at the original, it's insane how much the animation has improved. When you watch, pay attention to the details, specifically the human characters. Some scenes look almost real.
A great accomplishment of TS4 is the balance of giving old favorites screen time and adding new characters to the mix. This is something not just every sequel can pull off, and it can make or break a movie. Although, scrolling through some reviews that have already been posted (seriously, how do you guys get these up so quickly?), it seems that some of the new additions aren't very popular. On the contrary, I thought the perfect amount of screen time was given to good ol' Jesse, Buzz, Rex, and Hamm, as well as enough given to new characters such as Forky, Duke, and Gabby Gabby.
I was glad to see Bo Peep again, along with seeing how things were going at the toys' new home with Bonnie. The opening to this movie, with the famous ""You've Got A Friend In Me"" along with a montage of Andy and eventually Bonnie playing with the beloved toys, is emotional and nostalgic.
And finally the ending. The ENDING. I shed a few tears (Nearly as much as I cried at Toy Story 3).
Overall, Toy Story 4 told me to not doubt sequels. Every single addition to the Toy Story series has been great. This is the first series that I have seen pull that off. I wouldn't mind a Toy Story 5, but for now, we'll let this be enough. :')"

"TheOvereducated","1","7","13","28 October 2019"," I deleted the movie from my memory.
","Let me say first, that I'm one of the few(?), who did not like Toy Story 3. I'm a big fan of Toy Story 1 & 2, I grew up with them. Toy Story 3 I didn't need to see! I didn't need to see Andy getting rid of his childhood's toys, I didn't need to see that horrific-for-kids 3rd act in the firing waste treatment process. What does this have to do with the lovely Toy Story 1 & 2 at all?
Anyways, I had watched an interview of Tom Hanks saying, ""Toy Story 4 is probably the best movie I've ever seen in my life!"" and talking about the ending of that movie franchise. So, I was like, ok, I shouldn't miss this. That said, Toy Story 4 is even worse than the 3rd. Here are the two highlights:<br/><br/>1) Do you remember that heroic, moral, soldier-like awesome character of Buzz Lightyear?! Forget it. Here, he does nothing else than listening to his ""consciousness"" aka pressing a button on his gear and following that ""advice"" throughout the movie. He's the comic relief in the movie. This works fine at the beginning. Maybe the whole movie goes by and you don't realize, how bad this is. But then, it ends and you're like... what the hell did I watch? What did they do with Buzz?<br/><br/>2) You know that pretentious ""Woman Power"" of the latest years? That Captain Marvel's ""you don't tell me what to do!"" and other ridiculous, cheap ways to depict women strong? I hate that. Well, somehow this is present here too. Woody becomes a drooling puppy for an out-of-nowhere over-feminist Bo Peep throughout the whole movie! You want to see authentic, strong female characters? Go watch Zootopia for Judy Hopps or if you want live-action then The Matrix for Trinity or Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation for Ilsa for crying out loud! There are indeed many good movies, where they do that properly!<br/><br/>I'll stop right here and advice you to not see this movie or try to forget it and stick to the first two, those two lovely Toy Stories for kids & adults with the core of the stories being the beautiful development of the friendship between a cowboy and a space ranger, the toys of a little kid that come to life."

Was. Horrific. This Toy Story movie was contaminated with horrific modern-kid-movie dialogue that doesn't measure up to any other Toy Story movie.<br/><br/>At least 40% of the dialogue was entirely unnecessary. Dumb and unfunny jokes are used dozens of times and mostly fail miserably each and every time. The same jokes are used over and over again and were never funny in the first place. The dialogue should have been written to support the plot instead.<br/><br/>New and worthless characters steal screen time from far more valuable classic characters....<br/><br/>The good: Bo Peep turned out to be a very well written character. Her and Woody are by far the most engaging characters and some of the only truly enjoyable characters in the movie.<br/><br/>But.... Do not get your hopes up, and you still might be able to enjoy this movie for what it is.<br/><br/>Easily entertained child-minded individuals may love this movie, but genuine fans of the Toy Story animated films will be less satisfied.<br/><br/>The original Toy story was a genuine work of animated art.

"stephen-eve","7","25","63","21 June 2019"," Disappointing finale to a finale
","There's something about the Toy Story franchise. It's something just a little bit magical. It has that feeling that I used to get as a kid when a new Disney came out, that anticipation of knowing something special was going to come on screen. This is how it has been with the first 3 films. Toy Story 3 was always going to be difficult to reach or surpass, and so it has proven. While watching 4, I was reminded of Ralph 2, great sketches in an overall disappointing film. If you love the Toy Story characters you'll be left wondering why they were ignored in favour of new characters. Just don't go on there with expectations raised.... I may be a bit naive but Disney feels just like all the rest of the studios, a money making machine."
"saadnaveed-10091","5","10","21","22 June 2019"," Major Disappointment
","When I first heard of the 4th edition to the Toy Story franchise, I had mixed feelings as Toy Story 3 had left off the franchise perfectly. I was worried that the 4th installment would disappoint and to my surprise, it was a major letdown. Although the movie started out well by explaining what happened with Bo Peep, it began to turn into a mess as soon as Woody and Forky arrived at the antique store. The plot became way too complex with many different things going on. Unlike its predecessors, Toy Story 4 did not have a clear plot and felt extremely rushed. Throughout the movie I never really felt a climax as I did with the previous movies nor did I feel much of a threat from the main villain Gabby Gabby. Sid, The Prospector, and especially Lotso were all very good villains and well developed characters which Toy Story 4 failed to do. Also by introducing many new characters, it left out many of the other beloved characters us fans had grew up with such as Rex, The Potato Heads, Slink, Jessie, etc. as they were stuck in the RV for most of the film. Although the addition of these characters brought about some laughs here and there, they weren't developed much as seen in the other 3 films. Lastly my biggest problem with the movie is the ending. Woody throughout the franchise learned his responsibility of being a toy with one then being loyalty to your kid and a toys job is to be there for him. By having Woody leave the group to stay with Bo, it completely destroyed Woody's character. To see Woody leave Bonnie to be with Bo even though he wasn't played with as much shows him as being selfish which was the completely opposite character he was in Toy Story 3. In conclusion, Toy Story 4 ruined a perfect franchise as well as my childhood."

A beautiful ending of a grown up Andy gifting the toys a whole bunch to a little girl, and they watch him drive off. End of one adventure, ready to begin another. Perfect end.
Now, whilst this film is still a brilliant film in itself, it's really just a woody film, with lots of new characters. The gang are barely in it, most of them only a few lines between them. And the end, thats just a no. Not a way to end a story that's spanned 4 films and a generation of kids. The end of toy story 3 was so much better suited for the gang of Andys toys."
"runner-24166","5","12","27","25 June 2019"," Too many cooks / crooks or the sequel that shouldn't have been made.
","Toy story 4 is about as entertaining as watching a strong franchise get mutilated and twisted which can be akin to how Cid treated his toys in the first movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a quick recap of the first 3 movies which was well done, but everything falls downhill after that. We are exposed to a scenario where Andy in good faith donated his toys to a young girl who he thought would treat his toys with just as much love as he did.<br/><br/>This turns out to be far from the truth, Woody who was the leader and moral support for the team while they were under Andy's care, is frequently left in the closet and left to feel useless by his new owner and the new toy team that he's been apart of.<br/><br/>Putting that aside for the moment the character of Buzz has been dumbed down to a shell of the character he became over the last 3 movies He is incapable of being able to think for himself and having to use his canned voice box in order to get direction. It's heart breaking to see two strong characters get mutilated for the sake of poor story telling.<br/><br/>On the note of mutilation the story takes a turn our boy Woody is put into a scenario to search for BoPeep, while searching he is introduced to a girl doll who's sole purpose as I can tell is to manipulate Woody into giving up his pull string voice box so she could have a chance at getting a new owner. She does this by listening to forky the crafted trash toy and learning just what to say in order to convince Woody to willingly give up his voice box. Then afterwords everyone is friends and works to getting the girl doll an owner after the one she chose throws her away. Confused, so was I.<br/><br/>Afterwords Woody decides to stay with BoPeep in the land of lost toys because he felt useless in Bonnie's world mutilated and alone, Buzz seeing this in his eyes tells him as such giving him an ok to go.<br/><br/>The movie is dark and an unfitting ending to the franchise. I went in cautious with high expectations and left concerned and disturbed at what I saw. I would prefer them rewrite 3 to have Andy keep his toys and look at them lovingly and have them for his children when he gets older."

"dan_o_toole","5","10","22","24 June 2019"," HONEST REVIEW - FUN BUT POINTLESS
","My three year old daughter and six year old niece were somewhat bored by Toy Story 4. As a 42 year old man I wasn't as bored as they were however I've lived through the other three films and noticed that this movie, whilst trying to appeal to everyone, lacked a solid narrative, depth, mystery, thrills and the Pixar magic that was so intricately woven throughout the fabric of the other three.
People my age and movie buffs will get the nods to films such as The Shining as well as some of the tongue-in-check adult humour but as a story it was weak. It started strong and established the characters well whilst setting the foundation for the plot however the plot was very thin and the mission was essentially Woody and his pals need to get 'Forky' back to its owner. Formulaic problems, creepy villains and physical tasks need to be overcome to achieve the mission but the other movies gave us thrills and really challenged the characters whilst throwing surprises at the audience.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 fails to deliver at the level of the former films which is a real shame. Most of the characters that we love take a distant 'back-seat' throughout the film as it focusses mainly on Woody, Forkie and a few other fairground toy 'prizes' that form the team to accomplish the mission.<br/><br/>Although the film is visually stunning with great music and never looked better, this is definitely an instance where style vastly out-ranks substance. When the movie ended I heard other mutterings around the cinema from adults close by asking questions such as 'what was that about?' and 'what was the point of that?'<br/><br/>The point was simple..... break a summer box office and make Disney a ton of cash. Let's face it, Toy Story 4 was always going to smash the box office regardless of whether it was any good and no doubt kids will want some of the action figures which, incidentally, appeared on the toy store shelves over two months before the movie's release.<br/><br/>The ending has firmly established the fact that Disney can't take this franchise any further and if they attempt to do so then they might destroy it. Just look at what they did to Star Wars with the Last Jedi... similar thing here.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that the movie was entertaining to a point and fitting for a rainy Sunday afternoon when you need to do something with the kids but you leave the theatre feeling a little short changed and almost as though you've just been subjected to an 'alternate ending' as though you were part of a focus group before the release of Toy Story 3, a film that is the 'real' ending and where the book should have remained closed."
"VS132","6","10","22","22 June 2019"," ""So Long, Partner......Or So We Thought""
","As a fan of the Toy Story Franchise, I can't help to be disappointed at Toy Story 4. Don't get me wrong, the animation is still colorful, the voice acting is good, (both veterans and new-comers), and I did buy Woody & Bo's relationship throughout. But it came at the cost of an engaging story, and great character development; something that the first three films excelled at. Here, the writing tarnishes Woody, rushes Forky's arch, and has TOO much plot holes. The only new character I ended up liking was Duke Kaboom as the others provided little to nothing; and I hated how the recurring characters were terribly side-lined. At the end of the day, it just ends up being mildly decent at best, which isn't surprising due the many red flags in its production; but I gave it the benefit of the doubt that it would subvert my expectations. This is the best that they could do I guess."

","I was 6 when Toy Story 2 came out. I can still remember the joy I got from seeing it in the theatre. I was 17 when Toy Story 3 came out. Now I'm 26 and I was just as excited to go see Toy Story 4.<br/><br/>In preparation, I took a trip down memory lane and watched the first 3. I honestly enjoyed the first 2 just as much as I remember liking them as a child. They were so clever and sweet and clearly made for children. The 3rd one still had some great moments, but it just wasn't the same. I appreciate that they tried to have the story grow up with the audience, but it just wasn't as fun or imaginative as the first 2.<br/><br/>I wanted so badly for this 4th one to bring back the magic of the first 2, but it didn't :( I felt like they tried too hard to make it a movie for the adults who grew up with the franchise and less for the children it was once targeted towards. I also thought it was strange that they didn't have Bonnie age the way they had Andy age in the last one. I was all for a story focusing on Woody and Bo Peep reuniting, but I think they missed out on a really great story opportunity.<br/><br/>Another issue I had was how they made Buzz seem stupid compared to Woody.<br/><br/>I think it's safe to say this should be the last Toy Story movie. To Infinity and Beyond!"
"ElMaruecan82","6","7","14","27 June 2019"," There was a time where Disney movies were telling stories, now it's all about sending messages...
","I know time is up to dust off a few gender-driven stereotypes. For that, ""Frozen"" was a landmark. But there's a fine line between creating new characters and promoting their differences and deconstructing old characters that belong to a whole other storyline in order to promote a difference, that's when I get the feeling that Disney is dangerously toying with its own legacy.<br/><br/>To make myself more specific, I would have no problem with a film centering on a gender exclusive romance and maybe that will be ""Frozen II"" novelty, but I would have a problem if they made a sequel to ""The Fox and the Hound"" in order to suggest that there was more than a friendship between Todd and Copper. Watching ""Toy Story 4"", I felt betrayed by the way the whole relationship between toys and owners, that took a trilogy to be built, was demystified in one single film to shine a light on Disney's 'new order'.<br/><br/>All the previous ""Toy Story"" movies had a specific story. The first was exploring the psychology of toys within their relationships with their owners. Anyone could relate to that, kids who own toys and adults who used to. It also sealed the friendship between Woody and Buzz, as two of Andy's favorites, not rivals. The second film established the issue of growing up through the Jessie situation and the impeding doom of hormone-driven rejection. Still, Andy and Woody realized that they were not articles among others or valuable items to be worshiped, having ANDY written on their feet was their value and it was perfect while it lasted.<br/><br/>The trilogy ended with the perfect tone (and note), Andy, now grown-up, realizes that the sentimental value of his toys depend on their current utilization as much as their past, so he gives all the toys, including Woody, to Bonnie. For the first time, there's a voluntary separation between the partners, it's an end of era but also a new start. And the toys' ""circle of life"" has always been about children having toys not toys having children, the song wasn't ""I've got a friend in you"" after all. In that fourth opus, there's such an obsession with that notion of ""having children"" that it felt like they were procreating them. I'm not exaggerating, it's used so many times it became a whole overarching theme.<br/><br/>But I didn't have a problem with that because the film started with a rather touching scene. Feeling rejected by Bonnie, Woody follows her in her first day at school and helps her create a new toy, ""Forky"", I just loved the way the ""Spork"" came alive on the sole basis that he was considered a toy, and the way Woody felt responsible in a fatherly that wasn't totally out of place in the film's context. Because the motive was still Bonnie: he didn't want her to lose her new toy, Woody was still thinking of his owner, and that's the way all toys behaved, not because that's the way it should be, but because that's the way it was established as soon as the series began.<br/><br/>This is why I just hated the way Woody admitted at the end that he did that because he had nothing else to do, as if toys were supposed to have an existence of their own, and being a lost toy was an option. Woody cared for Bonnie and Forky and it was out of character to describe this as a weakness. But the film constantly shows Woody as a weak character, both morally and physically, and for that, the studios came up with the right contrast: Bo Peep who is of course the incarnation of the Disney heroine, she's brave, bad-ass, perfect, not one ounce of vulnerability and nothing is impossible to her. Meanwhile, Jessie was relegated to a tertiary character while she could have been the female lead after all.<br/><br/>The character of Gabby Gabby was a great addition though, acting like a Disney villain (especially with her scary minions-automatons) but displaying a hidden depth that broke my heart. That Gabby had the potential, but Bo was such a caricature that I could hear the marketing strategy behind her creation ""let her awesomeness put Woody to shame"" and she did a great job at that. Naturally, she's proud of not ""having children"" which seems to associate parenting with a form of commitment a girl should be proud to reject. Quite hypocritical from a studio whose main audiences aren't seniors.<br/><br/>Now, maybe I'm overanalyzing, but when you also have two toys who insist on ""having children"" since they've been ""waiting for three years"" and they're males, it's of course a nod to the right for adoption, which draws the obvious parallel between belonging to children and having children. Which says in subtext, women shouldn't make raising families a priority but it's clearly one for those who've been denied this right. The message isn't wrong but just off-topic in the context of a series where a/ toys have always been the possessed ones not the possessors, b/ when the possession was a mark of friendship and nothing else and c/ when viewers could relate to owners, even from the toys' perspective. By over-humanizing them to make them timely relevant, something of the series' charm was lost.<br/><br/>My view is rather conservative but only in the sense that I wished the spirit of ""Toy Story"" to be conserved the way it was in the first three films, I enjoy a progressive film like anyone, but I wish Disney could do that with new characters, not with series whose arcs were perfectly closed. But I think I see where they're coming from, they're probably preparing a spin-off prequel that will center on Bo Peep, so maybe ""Toy Story 4"" is only a vehicle for her. Ironic that in the film, it's a skunk."

This is easily the funniest Toy Story to date, nearly every joke worked very well and the timing was excellent. The emotional moments were on a scale of depressing to full on tear jerking, especially with the interactions between Woody and Bo and that gut punching ending. And the animation is STUNNING. It is mesmerizingly detailed and the lighting is gorgeous. Pixar is constantly topping itself in the animation department and it shows as every film they have released has progressively looked better and better. The ending also left me crying even after exiting the cinema, but TS3's ending still has it beat as that movie had me violently sobbing during it's last few minutes. It isn't the best Toy Story, but it's still a fantastic movie and definitely worth seeing. Even though Pixar sequels are generally unnecessary, this one included, I'm happy with Toy Story 4 serving as the franchises conclusion."

","Toy Story 4 was so much fun! I hate to compare it to its predecessors because I feel as if each Toy Story film is very unique from the last. The fourth film in this franchise is no different. Don't go in expecting a continuation of Toy Story 3. Go in expecting Toy Story 4. It's something unique and brand new. While the storyline still had its heart wrenching moments, I feel as if Pixar had more fun creating this summer blockbuster. There wasn't as much pressure on Pixar to get it right as there may have been ahead of the third film, but they still managed to get it right nonetheless. The character development for these new characters was flawless. Each new character was given a solid backstory and the questions that we might have had about certain returning characters were all answered in entertaining and innovative new ways. In addition, this film was absolutely hilarious and by far the funniest in the series. Pixar did a great job of knocking down the fourth wall and addressing things that us audience members have probably asked at some point during the franchise's long history. If you are a Pixar fan, good news. This film is riddled with Easter eggs, but don't worry, I'm not going to spoil them for you. Lastly, I just want to say that I was very touched that Pixar not only dedicated the film to the late Don Rickles (aka Mr. Potato Head), but also to the late great Pixar animator, Adam Burke, who passed away in October 2018 from cancer. All in all, this film was a great tribute to Pixar through its exciting new ways of storytelling, historic Easter eggs, heart wrenching and comedic moments, beautiful score, and of course the characters we all know and love.

","My review title pretty much sums this one up. Before I wrote this, I glanced at the movie poster, which features Woody, Bo, Buzz, Forky, the two stuffed animals from the fair whose names I forget (see my point?), and Gabby Gabby with her minions.<br/><br/>It's a good popcorn movie for the family. I saw it during a movie night at the house with my two year old, four month old, and wife. My kid, I think, enjoyed it, and I wasn't bored. So, the movie accomplishes that end.<br/><br/>I grew up with the TS series. I remember when the first came out in theaters. So, I have seen each one since then. The first three were solid. The stories were good, and the characters had solid arches.<br/><br/>This one just...didn't. It felt like a big step backwards. By the end of the film, Woody parts ways with the whole gang, choosing a life with Bo at a carnival. Throughout the film, his new mission is to babysit Forky, reminding/teaching him who he is as a toy and what his purpose is, to be there for Bonnie, which is pretty typical for Woody's character, given the last three movies.<br/><br/>What I don't understand is why Woody backtracks on all the growth he made over the course of the past movies. TS 3 basically sends off Andy, with Woody and the gang making peace with their time with Andy being finished.<br/><br/>Now, in TS 4, Woody is forgotten in the closet while the other toys are played with, and it is as if all his growth from the first movies never happened. He seems to have lost his purpose, but this nullifies TS 1, where he learns to share the spotlight with other toys, in that case Buzz, and I believe one of his lines specifically said it didn't matter how much they were played with so long as they were there when Andy needed them.<br/><br/>On top of that, it makes his entire arch in TS 3 pointless. Why did he chose to stay with the gang instead of going with Andy to college, which is what Andy originally wanted? The reason is because he knew his time with Andy came to a close, and he needed to move on. However, this is a major struggling point for him in TS 4. He can't let go of Andy. So much so that he abandons his principle of being there for his ""kid"", in this case Bonnie, no matter what, to go live his own life with Bo.<br/><br/>I know I am getting deep on that, but part of what makes Woody so lovable is he always stuck to his principles. This movie throws that out.<br/><br/>Plus, the gang is split up at this point. I am not sure how they plan to make more TS movies, if they even intend to.<br/><br/>The villain, Gabby Gabby, was forgettable. She had a good set up but just didn't deliver in the end. Her lair, henchmen, and even her motivations were good.<br/><br/>By the way, I thought her lair was a nice touch and clever, but it was SLIGHTLY creepy with the dummies for henchmen. They reminded me of Slappy from Goosebumps, if you know what that is. That being said, if your kid gets scared or even creeped out easy, just an FYI.<br/><br/>After that, Gabby Gabby falls short. She gets what she wants but doesn't. Woody helps her and that's about it. There is no real climactic conflict between the characters or confrontation like with Buzz, The Prospector, and Lotso the Bear.<br/><br/>Anyway, there are a few moments that made me chuckle and one heartfelt scene near the end. The rest of the cast was enjoyable but, again, forgettable, leaving no lasting impact, which is such a shame, considering some of the talent they had.<br/><br/>Like I said, It's a good popcorn movie with the family. I just grew up with the franchise and thought TS 3 was a good stopping point but also a good cliffhanger, if they ever wanted to come back to it.<br/><br/>I'm just disappointed that this was the next adventure for the crew. In my opinion, TS 3 is the true final TS movie.<br/><br/>
Random side note: the opening scene bugs me. Lol!<br/><br/>It's a downpour outside, and the toys make a daring rescue when Andy's mom comes into Molly's room to gather toys to give away. She sees the window open with all the toys posed around it, and one of them is dangling (Slink) out of it. She just shuts the window on Slink and walks out of the room.<br/><br/>I literally said to my wife, does she not find it odd the window is open during a storm with all the toys dangling out? I mean, what??? Haha!"

","I found this movie very similar to Toy Story 2. Maybe at the end you lose some tears.
All movie has lot of content about the actual empowerment of women that I found interesting=> It's first time that the main ""rival"" of woody is a Woman toy; in the past was Scott, Sid, prostector and Lotso=> Also at the end Jessie took the sheriff badge from Woody that in the western past it was impossible (maybe if she is Calamity Jane) but world changed.
Woody give a gift to the girl so the movie talks about solidarity. The main character loss interest from her owner and he is alone, he was always take care and being so responsible about that, but at the end he decided to change view and become like a ""Hippie Sheriff"" with no more responsabilities.
I think Gabby's employee were terrorific, I like that also.
Bonnie asked for Woody when Andy visited her and gave the toys. But she complete loss interest for Woody! I hope next movie Andy goes to Bonnie's house and ask for Woody back to his Children."

It is a great sequel. This film did not need to be made, but it was, and surely many people are glad for that. This film contains amazing memories, memories that make all of us tear up, old pals, never ending friendship, difficult decisions to make, change, and new modern characters that make this film so much more lively as well. It's one of the best Disney films I have ever seen, and I had to admit that my eyes were reflecting under the light with tears, because of how far we have all come, how far Disney has come, and how lovely they have made this film, how simply relatable and loving it is for everyone. A reminder of simple and hard childhood, heartbreak, understanding. The villain of this story has a backstory and is not just a scary doll for everyone to fear. Although some people are broken inside, Toy Story 4 proves that friendship is everlasting and that they can make this film such a wonderful experience."
"harveywalker-69329","6","4","7","28 June 2019"," It was, regrettably, quite forgettable
","When I went to see this film, I was expecting something beautiful, funny and memorable, like the previous three films in the Toy Story trilogy were. I was quite disappointed to find that Pixar had only met one of those goals.<br/><br/>The animation was absolutely on point, which the graphics, scenes and attention to the smallest detail pleased me greatly. It was one of the only points of the film that is positive.<br/><br/>Some of the comedy made me laugh as well. It had a decent amount of humour and some quick one liners. However, they were nothing special, and I ended up forgetting most of them at the end of the film.<br/><br/>A quick note on the characters; I feel like there is too many to keep memorising and Pixar adding too many at the last minute in the middle of the plot. I often found myself wondering which characters were which, and mixing up the characters together. For example (SPOILERS!) Bo Pepe's Sidekick was often forgotten and the character Duke Caboom (that's his actual name and how it's spelled, I looked it up!) and the two stuffed animals just seemed out of place being thrown in during the middle of the film.<br/><br/>And now, for the worst part.<br/><br/>I felt like the film was completely forgettable, with the plot being below par and, honestly, kind of predictable. Toy Story's 1, 2 and 3 plots were good because they changed everything every time, for example Andy moving out of college completely threw me off guard during TS3. But this plot, as soon as the motifs of Bo Pepe were revealed, I predicted the ending soon enough. This made the ending, instead of tear-bringing and pulling at my heartstrings, made me cringe and bored. I went to see this with my mum, dad and brother and we all agreed: the plot was forgettable.<br/><br/>I went to see it for the nostalgia, not as a stand alone film, and that's how it should be, and only how, it should be watched in my eyes. If you grew up on Toy Story, I'd watch it anyway. But if you want to watch it as a stand-alone film, I wouldn't recommend it."

When I say Toy Story is one of my all time favorite movies (I can quote it from start to finish) it is not an exaggeration. This wasn't the hilarious, moving, touching film I've come to expect from Pixar but especially the Toy Story franchise. I was never close to tearing up at any point in time during this. I was really surprised by how big a role Bo Beep had; her character was 3rd tier so I'm slightly confused as to why her character was given so much focus. I truly wished they had stopped at the 3rd one because it ended on a much higher note."

","My initial thoughts for now:<br/><br/>Rushed ending (am I the only one who didn't cry here?), so many useless characters, and a way too stretched third act (as stretched as Finding Dory's third act). Keanue Reeves as Duke Caboom was a saving grace, as well as the photorealistic animation, the score (loved it), the humor (despite some falling flat), and of course, the presence of the two iconic leads, Woody and Buzz. Also, Gabby Gabby was a surprisingly well-written character. A particular scene with her brought out the feels (unlike the anti-climactic ending, which was big middle finger to the ending of Toy Story 3). Other than that, I was very surprised that in the past four years, Toy Story 4 turned out to be the biggest disappointment for Pixar (in my opinion).<br/><br/>It feels so unfortunate for me to give this a 3.5/5, making it one of my least favorite Pixar films (just above A Bug's Life, Monsters University, The Good Dinosaur, and Cars 2). The first three Toy Story films made up a holy trilogy for films, let alone animated films. This one was far from their quality."
"zkonedog","5","7","15","1 July 2019"," The Old Magic Is Largely Gone
","The first three Toy Story films comprise one of the tightest, most well-executed film trilogies of all time. Fans literally grew up with Andy and his toys (or could relate to the journey), and the ending of the third film is one of the best and most emotional in any franchise, animated or otherwise. When a fourth film was revealed to be in the pipeline, I was skeptical that it could never reach the heights of the original three. But Disney/Pixar kept reiterating that they had an idea that ""couldn't be denied"", so of course I was intrigued to see what the next chapter would bring. Unfortunately, though not a terrible film by any means, I found Toy Story 4 to be largely lacking that ""old magic"" that made the trilogy so perfect.<br/><br/>For a basic overview, Toy Story 4 sees Bonnie playing with Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), and the gang much like Andy had before her. But then Bonnie goes away to kindergarten and comes back with a new favorite: the craft-project ""Forky"" (Tony Hale), a spork who is technically a toy (even in the most rudimentary form). Despite Woody's efforts to guide Forky through the new toy's identity crisis, Forky escapes and necessitates a man-hunt (or toy-hunt, if you will) to keep Bonnie happy on the family vacation. While on the chase, Woody meets up with old flame Bo Peep (Annie Potts), now a completely independent toy who survives on her own without an owner. Being pulled in multiple different directions, Woody must come to terms with his destiny and make hard choices he has never yet been confronted with.<br/><br/>The main word I'll use to describe the experience of watching Toy Story 4: awkward. As an adventure tale it is a decent enough romp (Pixar can practically do that in their sleep), but in terms of the deep character analysis that the Toy Story franchise has become known for, this one just doesn't live up to the billing.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie is that it seems utterly fractured in what it wants to be. Is this a movie about helping a burgeoning toy come to grips with himself? Or is it a treatise on Bo Peep's independence vs. Woody's slavish devotion to an owner? Both of those are very interesting topics in their own right, but they don't function well together in a film that only runs about 100 minutes long. It really feels like one of those ideas should have comprised the core of this film, not both trying to exist concurrently. I think I would have preferred the latter approach, (as I do not believe the Forky character was a strong or important one, overall) really deepening the interplay between Woody and Bo Peep.<br/><br/>Another problem that overall schism leads to is that besides Woody, Forky, and Bo Peep, all the other characters serve a pretty limited function. Buzz has a storyline that seems pretty asinine, while the likes of Jesse (Joan Cusack), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), and Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) are hardly given any lines or really anything interesting to do. Of the new characters added, I only found Duke Kaboom (Keanu Reeves) and Combat Carl (Carl Weathers) to be funny or interesting. Vintage doll Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks) has an arc that just doesn't play out very well, while carnival plushes Ducky (Keegan-Michael Key) and Bunny (Jordan Peele) feel odd and out-of-place.<br/><br/>Of course, part of the overall issue with TS4 is still its three predecessors set such a high bar to clear. Most of the time, animate films directed ostensibly towards the children's market will not appeal to adults in nearly the same fashion. But Toy Story was the rare trilogy that had me laughing with and crying over the characters long into adulthood. Neither of those two things happened to me while watching TS4. I legitimately chuckled no more than a few times, and never did I feel that deep connection to the characters that I once had.<br/><br/>So, despite being a perfectly acceptable animated film, ""acceptable"" is just not enough when compared to the previous efforts in this series. My guess is that kids will still eat this one up, but adults may leave the theater feeling as if that ""old magic"" has been sapped from the proceedings."
"NarniaIsAwesome","9","7","15","23 June 2019"," Toy Story 4 is... Fun and Resonant!
","With all the newer projects Disney seems to be starting, it's nice when they take a break to follow up with characters from the past. The 'Toy Story' films started in 1995, and they're still thriving. For some franchises, this would be redundant, but 'Toy Story''s characters and plot are lovable enough to make it more than just work!<br/><br/>It's ample to say that the movie is a lot of fun, with both old and new characters who are very entertaining. The voice work is amazing, and doesn't feel cheesy and forced like in some animated features (really, voice talent is just as important as acting!). It's also nice to see people like Tom Hanks (Woody), Tim Allen (Buzz), and Annie Potts (Bo Peep) be the stars of the show; so many cartoons now want to cast stars that are faddish, like Justin Timberlake and Miley Cyrus.<br/><br/>And like most Pixar films, especially this franchise, be ready for plenty of emotion. The story is simple but sweet and touching, balanced with humor.<br/><br/>Ergo, I very much enjoyed 'Toy Story 4' and it is by far the best film I've seen at the theater all year. I highly recommend it and hope this marks a continuation of the series!"

My only complaint would be the absence of a true ""villain"" and the plot sometimes dragged. Besides that, really solid film!"

"miaharpr","4","5","10","24 October 2019"," Bo Peep ruined this
","I didn't dislike the movie. It was still well-made, but I don't care to rewatch it, either. The main problem for me is the transformation of Bo Peep's character. I get that we're trying to empower women, but it's so in-your- face, as with a lot of tv shows and movies nowadays. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for supporting women-be who you want to be, be strong and independent, and I'm a woman myself-and in the context of the plot, being an abandoned toy and all, I can understand why Bo Peep would change, and people change, so why can't toys? But the whole 180 was such a personal turn-off for me. She was so domineering and aggressive in this that I kept hoping throughout the movie that Woody would just leave her. She didn't seem like good company anyway. I don't understand how all of sudden she became the main character. She even had more air time than Buzz.<br/><br/>I also get that they were trying to make Forky happen, but it ain't gonna happen. Forky was mildly cute at the beginning then got old fast. I actually enjoyed the Gabby toy more. She had more purpose and actually tugged at my heart in a similar fashion as the first three movies. I don't particularly felt this instalment was necessary. The franchise should have ended with TS3...this just feels like they're forcing it to live on. Like Star Wars. You know, to get our money."
"CANpatbuck3664","9","5","10","14 July 2019"," Pixar Delivers Again, Toy Story 4 is a Sleek and Finely Tuned Addition to the Franchise
","We all know Woody, Buzz and the gang but we get plenty of new additions to the toy chest of characters we have in this franchise. Forky (Tony Hale) will be the most recognizable one from the trailers and I liked him more than I expected to. I wasn't as in love with the trailers as everyone else and I thought the Forky bit would get real old, real quick. They do find a way to organically work him into the plot and they pull back on using him too much. Bo (Annie Potts) gets a lot more to do and while her connection with Woody is sweet, she gets the job done all by herself. You have Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves) who is pretty funny, and my 2 favourite new characters in Bunny (Jordan Peele) and Ducky (Keegan Michael-Key) who had me laughing hard almost every time they came on screen. The small trade off for getting these new characters is that the older characters in the cast don't get as much time (Buzz was great but his arc in the movie was kind of disappointing) but the movie doesn't lose a step because of it.<br/><br/>Where Toy Story 3 was a prison escape movie that was made for kids, this is more of an adventure with a dash of romance thrown in. Woody (Tom Hanks) is on a mission to return Forky to Bonnie but he runs into his old flame Bo (Annie Potts) and they slowly rekindle what they had years ago. There's plenty of exciting scenes with this new road the movie chose to go down but I also want to note that I didn't get the same emotional gut punch that I got out of Toy Story 3. There are emotional moments that tug at the heart strings but it wasn't as gripping from a dramatic standpoint (I cried once in Toy Story 3 and was almost there a 2nd time). So you do have a strong through line with Woody finding out there may be something else out there for him other than playing with Bonnie or Andy but if you're worried about it being too tough to handle, you'll be okay. I also would note that while 3 had a very threatening and ruthless antagonist for Woody and the gang, the movie goes a different route with the obstacles placed in front of Woody and co. here.<br/><br/>I don't want to go on about the voice cast too much, the number of celebrities doing voice work in this movie is a long list and there isn't enough space to cover everyone. I love the characters in this franchise but I love the actors and actresses performances that help bring them to life. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack even Bonnie Hunt and Kristen Schaal have all been around the block and all perform with the required energy and emotion that we expect from this franchise. I loved a lot of the new additions and overall, the performances were well done.<br/><br/>As much as I'm praising this movie, I still think this is the weakest of the Toy Story films. Its got the sense of adventure, the eye-catching animation, the interesting characters, the emotional core to the story and the funny jokes but it still didn't hit that 10/10 level for me that Toy Story 3 hit. Those movies are not only iconic, they represent THE GOLD STANDARD in animated movies. So while this is truly excellent, its competition within its own franchise is as high as it gets. For less discerning viewers, maybe this won't be a problem but I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who has seen all 4 and say that this is their favourite.<br/><br/>I applaud Pixar for adding another stellar addition to this franchise. It has everything you could want in an animated movie and it will be a joy for everyone in the family to watch (unless you have a heart made of stone). Is it the best one in the franchise? My answer is a definitive no, but that doesn't make it any less good or dampen my overall praise for it. My reviews are usually a little longer but this is a movie that covers all of its bases and doesn't have any obvious flaws. If you haven't gone to see Toy Story 4, I don't know what's kept you but I recommend it wholeheartedly. My final note is that I hope this is the last one, you've done a great job Pixar but its time to hang the Toy Story franchise up before it starts to run out of magic."
"Martinito_08183","8","5","10","7 July 2019"," It may still be unnecessary, but it does many things right for a forth installment, which is very rare.
","It's been 9 years after Toy Story 3 was released and receiving critical acclaim from almost everybody and giving probably the best conclusion for the popular series that we know today and now 9 years later we got supposedly the final forth installment to conclude everything and after hearing the news for the new film, people started asking the questions: was it worth making a forth film after the third film's ending and does it have a story that is worth telling? For me the answer is yes and no at the same time, since we all knew it wouldn't live up to the expectations that people have, even Pixar probably knew that. After i watched it in the cinema i can say that i liked it, but it does have problems, which did bother me and it may be different for some.<br/><br/>The positives:
<ul><li>I thought the story was very well written, giving some great moments and having a nice ending of the series that started Pixar's reputation, but i don't think it's enough to make a fourth film for that reason;</li><li>Woody, Buzz, Bo Peep and the new cast of characters are all great and everyone has the perfect amount of screen time;</li><li>The animation is of course breathtaking and improvement over the previous three films with some moments that looks almost photorealistic;</li><li>The cinematography is great and every shot fits perfectly to the film;</li><li>Huge percent of the dialogue was great in my opinion with some nice lines here and there;</li><li>Ones again the acting is great from everyone, including Tom Hanks and Tim Allen;</li></ul><br/><br/>The negatives:
<ul><li>When the story is involving the old characters it's very weak, uninteresting and are the slowest moments in it and the beginning does ruin a little bit the ending of the third film (it's not a spoiler, since the trailers shows that Bonny isn't interested in Woody after she creates Forky, even thought she loved him in the third film);</li><li>The characters that we know and return from the previous films are barely used for the final chapter;</li><li>Randy Newman, who composed and wrote songs for the previous three films, returns again for the film and just like Toy Story 3, the music is very forgettable and unnoticeable and there isn't even one memorable track that i can remember;</li><li>There are moments that the dialogue is not great, especially some of the jokes that don't work as the writers wanted;</li></ul><br/><br/>Toy Story 4 may not be the film that everyone wanted and still having things that could have been better, but it has positives that deserve the praise, but i still think the second installment is the best one, the fist one comes a little close and the third one is the weakest, since it has the same story as the second film. Overall Toy Story is still one of the best series out there and can be enjoyed by not only children, but also by adults."

","For anyone who ever wondered whatever happened to the Bo Peep doll in Toy Story 3, this next installment believably answered that. And with that, Annie Potts makes a return voice appearance doing that character as for once, she becomes a really important part of the story with the theme of being independent and learning to let go when one becomes separated from one's closest friends for whatever reason. As she was something of a love interest for Tom Hanks' Woody voice, they wonderfully share the lion's share of scenes. But there's hilarity plenty still especially with the arrival of a new toy made by new owner Bonnie herself named Forky who for quite some time keeps going to a trash can... This was as worthy an entry for the series as the first three as I laughed and cried quite a bit during this one. So on that note, Toy Story 4 is very highly recommended.

However, it's simply not good enough to warrant getting the toys back out of the box. 'Toy Story 3' was an absolutely perfect ending to the series, expertly wrapping up all of the themes and character arcs in a very satisfying way, and the heads at Pixar said they would only make a fourth movie if they could come up with a storyline that was as good or better than that of the original trilogy. Unfortunately, this one just doesn't make the cut. It lacks the humour and wit of the first two films and the pure heart of the third, meaning that it's only a middling Pixar effort (though that is to say better than the majority of animated films out there). It has a strong opening act that sets up some nice, thought-provoking themes, however these are never really expanded upon and somewhat thrown out in service of other, less-interesting ones. Take the character of 'Forky' for example. The (highly marketed) theme and arc surrounding his character are very interesting, yet they are only one of many that are pretty underdeveloped and quickly resolved. That seems to be the biggest problem with the film as a whole: there are too many cooks in the kitchen. It has eight credited story writers and this is extremely obvious. Unlike any of the previous entries in the franchise, it lacks a clear through-line in terms of theme and this is a great detriment to the piece. What's worse, however, is that the message that the film finally settles on is completely contradictory to that of the original trilogy, and some character arcs fully go back on what was established in those prior entries. I can see what they were trying to achieve, and in its own right the message isn't a bad one, yet it simply doesn't work here as this is a direct continuation of the first three films. It's easy to say that you shouldn't compare this fourth entry to the rest of them and that you should take it as its own thing, but at the end of the day that's impossible to do as it's not it's own thing. Had it been a sort of spinoff, focussing on different characters in the same world, that wouldn't have been such a big ask. As it stands though this is definitely 'Toy Story 4', a direct follow-on exploring the lives of the same characters, so direct comparisons to the first three are inevitable, and it should have taken them and their character arcs into consideration. Another issue is that the original supporting characters, including Jesse who can sort of be seen as one of the leads, are severely underused here. Classic characters such as Hamm, Rex, the Potato Heads and Slinky only have a couple of lines each and add nothing to the overall narrative. Even Buzz, who is in the film quite a bit, doesn't really have much to do and he sort of seems out of character. This is a huge shame as those characters and their individual personalities brought a lot of the charm to the first three films. There are new side characters introduced in this film that get a lot of the screen time, but unfortunately they just aren't all that interesting and it seems a shame to have all of the great classic characters do practically nothing so that these new additions can just be okay. Like I initially said though, this is far from a bad film. There's definite enjoyment to be had here and it's attempts at exploring big ideas are admirable. It's just simply not good enough, however, when 'Toy Story 3' ended the franchise so perfectly. Had it been funnier, more exciting and more than middling Pixar, it wouldn't have been such a problem that it reopened the 'Toy Story'. As it stands though, it's unfortunately quite a disappointing return. 6/10"

","Life long avid Pixar, and specifically Toy Story fan/ collector here. I will be honest I was skeptical going into it considering the ending of Toy Story 3 was perfection. But I left the theater with a big smile on my face and tears running down my cheeks. There is an over abundance of new and reintroduced toys in this film. You have some of the new ones: Ducky and Bunny, Duke Kaboom, Giggles, Gabby Gabby, and Forky are the most prominent of the new toys. And we are reintroduced to Bo Peep, her sheep, and an appearance from RC. With the reintroduction and introduction of these toys, alongside the toys from the last film, it can seem like a lot. But each character is so likable and distinct, you don't mind the cluster of characters. Woody's decision at the end to leave behind Buzz, Jessie, and the gang to be with Bo and be a lost toy was very touching and got the audience choked up. It is a story that definitely resonates with the adult audience. Leaving behind your family and friends to be with the one you love, and to make new memories. A perfect ending to a perfect series. I will say that children under, I'd say 9 or 10, might be a bit too frightened by the dummies in this film. So just be cautious of that before taking very small children.<br/><br/>Overall I do definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is skeptical about it. The animation alone is worth the price of a movie ticket. It's amazing to see the evolution of computer animation from the first Toy Story to this one. Something I think is very cool to look at, is the difference between Sid's dog in the first film and the life-like cat in this one. Toy Story will forever hold a special place in my heart."

Picking up on that last one, the hero, and story, can only be as good as the villain (because otherwise there's no tension and the hero has nothing to surpass), and Gabby Gabby is nuanced, in such an interesting way (I understand her motives but I still don't agree with her, it's perfect). Woody is really the main focus of this movie, as it's always been, *reaaally*, and his character arc is completed here. The whole girl power thing was definitely present but not super pushed, so that was cool."

"Cineanalyst","8","3","5","20 November 2019"," Pixar's Love Story for Disney
","The ""Toy Story"" series has always had a clever double meaning that references itself. The first initiated the revolution in computer animation, but its narrative was fundamentally reassuring of a continuation with hand-drawn cartoons. Traditionally, at least, animation involves a series of still images, invented as opposed to recorded (as with live action), projected as motion pictures--thus, alternately inanimate and animate and created from nothing. Likewise, the ""Toy Story"" series features inanimate toys coming to life in the shadows. Like Forky in this fourth installment, from raw materials--in fact, trash--life, movement is created. Moreover, the sequels may be read as partially reflecting the sometimes-tumultuous history between Pixar and Disney.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 2"" (1999) was a mess: originally planned for the small screen, like Woody's ""Howdy Doody"" type TV puppet show, and subject to the merchandising strategies of Disney, and so we get a store full of Buzz Lightyears... and Barbies. Presciently, there's even a memorable reference to ""Star Wars,"" another future Disney property. In the last installment, ""Toy Story 3"" (2010), the first after Disney's acquisition, took a dark turn and, inevitably, the message becomes one of growing up and giving your toys away--in this case, Pixar being the toy and Disney the recipient. ""Toy Story 4,"" by contrast, is a love story. Superficially, it's between Woody and Bo Peep, as well as the usual one for children and their toys and adults and their nostalgia, but there's a hidden romance here involving Pixar and Disney.<br/><br/>This is an extensive adoption of Disney's business practices. It mostly takes place in a carnival, or amusement park--alluding to one of the company's most profitable and well-known divisions, theme parks. Additionally, people keep talking about the conclusion to the ""Toy Story"" series, but this franchise could conceivably continue indefinitely. Even if it were only on, say, the recently-started Disney+ streaming service. Disney is the champion of the franchise era of movies: Marvel and its cinematic universe, Star Wars, live-action and CGI remakes of its classic cartoons, Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones, the Muppets, Pixar and Disney's own animated pictures, the Alien and Avatar juggernauts and everything else 20th Century Fox... plus Mickey Mouse. The Disney name itself is the strongest brand in the industry. Good properties aren't left to die. Toys may change hands, be lost and found. Like Forky, trash is recycled. As with Bo Peep, broken parts are mended, and with Woody and Gabby, taken from elsewhere and otherwise stuffed and stitched back together. Antiques are rebooted and remade. Disney doesn't like to leave good toys on the shelf or in the closet for long.<br/><br/>You may choose to see only what you're intended to, like the human characters within the picture, oblivious of the toys' movements. Feel free to enjoy the manufactured cloning of human emotionalism, appeals to childhood nostalgia, or even the funny quips and Pixar Easter eggs, as CGI emotes and Randy Newman sings sentimental in the background, or look in the spaces where they suppose you unmindful to their machinations--where toys breath life and a conglomerate conspires for your affections. ""Toy Story 4"" is about us loving Disney. Disney wants you to love them, to hold them close, to take their merchandise home, play their games and enjoy their amusements... at a price, of course."

"westcoastladrech","8","3","5","29 September 2019"," A Fourth Installment Absolutely Worth Watching
","Despite pervasive threatening forces present throughout the Toy Story series, Toy Story 4 stands out by humanizing the seemingly negative qualities in antagonists. Characters that seem to bring harm are revealed to all suffer from internal trauma-a message that does well to speak to the internal resolve we can all find within ourselves and with the assistance of others.
But the depth isn't only contained within the darker characters. Woody showcases his maturity as a seasoned character brilliantly, making heartfelt sacrifices for those he loves while staying true to himself...no matter the cost. These sacrifices are yet another critical life lesson that go beyond any animated expectations.
All in all the plot line is 7 stars, nothing special there, but the screenplay is a perfect 10. Not to mention, you're in for a real treat with the three new hilarious characters of Ducky, Bunny, and Duke Caboom. A fourth installment absolutely worth seeing."

They had the best friendship! By the way while i was watching i recognised that i missed andy so much :( ..
so i think this one was the whorst of all. The 3rd movie was so emotional but since i have been watching toy story when i was a small child (and have watched over and over till now) this 4th movie really disappointed me... i gave 10 stars to all first 3 movies but this is a 6 to me :/"

There are surprising turns at the end. I'm uncertain about the future prospects of the franchise but I'm also a little excited about a reunion. It would be fine if this is the end but that would be a shame. This is a great franchise. If there is one that deserves to continue, there is non better than this.

A few minutes into the movie I wasn't overly expressed, but it got better as it went on.<br/><br/>I was stunned by the visuals, I thought they were beautiful and I loved how well it was animated! I wasn't overly keen on the Bo Peep idea at first, but her change fits in to the story quite well. Forky is an enjoyable character who surprisingly isn't annoying and gets better as the story goes on. The other characters introduced were amazing too and all of them were likeable!<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like was how Buzz seemed to be more of a 'comedic' act. Sure, in the 2nd and 3rd movies, he was someone who took the lead when Woody wasn't around, but at least in the 3rd the Spanish act actually fit with the story. This just felt like they didn't really know what to do with Buzz.<br/><br/>However, I really enjoyed this movie. The ending is much better than expected, and it doesn't feel like a cash grab!"

"ajzeg","9","3","5","15 September 2019"," When I first heard they were making a Toy Story 4, I didn't think it was necessary at all.
","Toy Story 3 ended the story perfectly, what more could be done with it? Not to mention that it's a Pixar sequel made in the 2010s, which don't exactly have a great reputation. Toy Story 3 was great, Cars 2 was bad, Monsters University was okay, Finding Dory was good but forgettable (no pun intended), Cars 3 was okay and Incredibles 2 was a lot of fun but not as memorable as the first movie. It didn't help that none of the Toy Story 4 trailers impressed me. I walked into this movie cautiously optimistic. I hoped it would be at least as good as Incredibles 2 but I was ready for the possibility of a disappointment. However, after seeing the movie, I can confidently say that they did it again. They made another great Toy Story movie. It has an engaging and emotional story, a lovable and memorable cast of characters, interesting themes and ideas, the most beautiful animation that Pixar has put to screen yet, pitch-perfect voice acting, and really great action and comedy! While Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending, I think Toy Story 4 is a great epilogue. This is probably where the story would go next, whether you like it or not. I do have some criticisms though. Some of the writing and comedic timing felt surprisingly clunky and off a couple of times and the ending does feel a little rushed. The ending of Toy Story 3 was definitely a better finale to the series as a whole, it was more epic and larger in scale, but this is more of a finale to the arcs of the main characters. I can't think of a more fitting way to end both this story and the 2010s decade of Pixar movies. It came in with a Toy Story movie and it went out with a Toy Story movie, and it looks like this is the last Pixar sequel we're going to see for a long time. It's been confirmed that there are no sequels coming out for the foreseeable future and they will be putting their focus on original films only. That sounds good to me! Overall, this is a must-see for any fan of the Toy Story movies. It just might be another instant classic. Highly recommended."

It deals with loyalty, friendship, sacrifices and liberation.<br/><br/>It really was a well put together film with tons of laughs and new characters that you can fall in love with all over again.<br/><br/>It is one of the only films in the franchise in my opinion that connected all the dots to the first installment of the film , and everything was pieced together really nicely,<br/><br/>If this is the last instalment of the franchise, as we have seen Tim Allen and Tom Hanks mention numerous times, then i am completely happy with its final adventure.<br/><br/>It just made me smile, laugh , cry and get that feel of when I was a little boy watching the first film in all it's glory and brought us back to great story telling of a boy who got joy out of his toys.<br/><br/>The boy has grown up, and so have the toys, and with our day and age with toys not being what they use to be - this film really brings it back to square one of hope, happiness and love, for the innocence of every boy and girl.<br/><br/>As stated, earlier, this might be just as good as the first installment of the series, if not better, but it definitely is an absolute gold mine of recapturing the kid sin all of us.<br/><br/>9/10 - Worth the buy, Watch and an encore"

It's very impressive if it is rated G because it's still really witty and funny. It's also so heart warming. I loved Keanu Reeves as Kaboom. Forky was a great addition and I loved how he always wanted to jump into garbage cans. It has a great message just like the other three.

","Toy story 4 is brilliant.With even better picture design,pixar has reached its top.
But most importantly,I believe that everyone of us can somehow relate to the characters of the movie.Woody....a really loyal friend who tries his very best to unite everyone of the gang everytime just to fulfill his duty.Isn't he tired?Isn't Toy story 4 the best timing for him to be 'him'?I don't understand why people keep saying toy story 3 is the best ending.Well that's a good ending for andy but definitely not the toys.This time the main theme of the movie circles around 'listen to your heart'.Well then what does Woody actually want?Bonnie??Really?A good master?Is it the best he can have?We all know that he deserves a lot more than that!He's been through so much.Why staying in a kid room?Go for his love!Go for his freedom!We can clearly see him not letting go of bopeep(in toy story 3).Why people can be that selfish saying that they should have stopped at 3???
As for the so-called 'villain' gabby gabby,she is literally the one everyone can relate to,well at least for me.She is so underrated.She is like most of us, trying our best to get someone's attention.She learned everything of harmony probably days and years.She thought that fixing her voicebox would change everything.But nope that's not how reality works.Harmony just thrown her away within a couple of minutes.Isn't it sound familiar?We put our best foot forward just to please the one we love or adore but turns out we idealize everything.We idealize the one we adore as perfect.So what happens when they don't want us is that we get hurt,like real hurt.

","As a huge fan of the Toy Story trilogy I got really upset after seeing this new sequel. It's so unnecessary, pointless, forgettable, and lacks the charm of the previous parts. The story is silly and weak, some of the new characters are unlikable and some others are confusing you don't know whether to hate them or sympathize with them. The previous parts were perfect and the story should have ended in part 3, I wish this part never happened cause it ruined everything. I think I'll act like it never happened and I never saw it, I'll keep the ending of part3 in my mind only."
"andresromerocompain","8","3","5","22 June 2019"," Pixar rising back up to the top
","When i first heard they were making a 4th installment to the Toy Story franchise, my first reaction was, ""What? Why? Why another Toy Story?"" So I pretty much walked into this with kinda low expectations thinking it would be a pandering sequel. Bit that's not what this movie is at all, as a matter of fact, I was proven wrong and rather blown away. Toy Story 4 is actually a really great movie, this is yet another great Toy Story movie which shocked the living hell out of me. As a matter of fact, this movie is up there with Toy Story 3 which to me is my favorite Pixar movie. The story is entertaining, funny, and incredibly touching, the animation is excellent as usual, and even the old and new characters in this are fantastic. Out of the previous movies Pixar has released from Cars 2 to this, this is by far the best Pixar movie that has been released, and its even one of the best sequels that Pixar has pit out. One last thing to note is that when I got to the last scene in the movie, i rather felt really satisfied and glad this was made."

You know what is going to happen in Toy Story 4 and with a cliched plot line about a villain doll trying to earn the love of a human kid is all but unenterprising, it just reduces the faith I have in Pixar.

Overall its a great movie with a emotional ending"
"ryandickerson-13612","8","4","8","1 October 2019"," Bittersweet film, with mixed emotions.
","The tone of the film is entirely different from the others but I wouldn't say that was a bad thing. Toy Story needed a different format as Woody had progressed from the life of Andy and that's been done over the last three films.
I actually felt this film had a lot of heart in it and viewers don't seem to be making the emotional connections with the themes involved with this film.
I would actually say this is an adult film and that is the target audience for the ones who have followed the saga over the years.
I really cried at the end of this and I don't know where the emotion came from but I think I'd felt a lot of these feelings, it's like when you leave home and say goodbye to your parents and you know life will never be the same again.
It's also like grieving, saying goodbye to people you love knowing you're not ever going to see them again, there is a lot of emotion in this and it's very bittersweet, you leave happy and sad which is a reality true to life and I think how the series should end or begin again because that is also life.
I would have put this up to 10 but there were just a few things in this film that didn't work like the others. Toy Story is usually so well thought out that every sequence has a purpose or inspires in someway.
I think there should have been a more sentimental moment with bo beep, or at look at her life maybe struggling as a lost toy to begin with in place of the stuntman toy or the doll in the antique shop.
Forky just didn't work for me as a character, from knowing nothing to knowing everything very quickly and I dunno, when something is silly for sillies sake and it's obvious it doesn't work for me. Whereas the aliens from the claw machine which are or par with forky in terms of being strange and different are unintentionally funny in how they act and behave.
But I think this is a really great film, maybe not really for children as I don't think its probably light hearted enough for a child and there's more trauma in this than humour so I think children would come away feeling upset or freaked out from some of the toys in the antique shop.
But thanks for making this, I loved it very much."
"vcolaluca23","4","4","8","24 September 2019"," This was not the Toy Story I knew
","So I watched this movie over the weekend and was excited because I heard some people say they actually enjoyed it and thought it was cute. Umm..I don't think those people were actual fans of the movie because this not only steered so far away from the original, but it steered completely in the other direction of what the spirit of the movie was all about. The charm was just...GONE. I was intrigued in the beginning with the premise of Woody basically not being the popular toy that his kid always wanted to play with and instead was being put on the back burner. I thought this was something different and I was intrigued to see where the story was going to go from there until the whole Forky character showed up and Woody being obsessed with making him believe he was a toy to please Bonnie just got too over the top and dragged on. I hated that they focused waaaay too much on all these boring, weird new characters who were so different from the original crew and basically took way too much screen time while the beloved side characters like Rex and Ham were demoted to just background characters with 3 lines each. You would think this being the last movie they would give them more screen time? And don't get me started on Buzz...did they give him a lobotomy?? I was so annoyed how they turned him back into an idiot toy by giving him a conscious that tells him what to do by pressing his buttons?? Why hasn't he done this in the previous movies? So dumb. And of course they split him and Woody apart (the best dynamic of the movie) for the duration of the movie just so Woody can go chase Forky and get into more unnecessary trouble which in turn takes away from seeing the rest of the toys. Ugh. This movie was so frustrating and I felt completely bored most of the time. Duke Caboom I admit was pretty funny at times but it didn't make up for the lack lustre plot. Bo Peep I get wasn't the same Bo Peep we last saw due to her new living experience not being someone's toy but she seemed like a completely different toy that I basically just categorize her with the new toys in this movie that I didn't care about. The Gabby doll and the rest of the Slappy dolls were creepy and would gave given me nightmares as a kid. I like that they had ""Sid"" vibes but because I was so bored I didn't care for it. The ending was sad and depressing and I can't believe they would split up Woody from the rest of the gang like that and the toys being ok with it. That wasn't believable to me. I knew it was going to happen but I still hated it. If you're going to have that kind of ending then at least make up for it by making the rest of the movie good and nostalgic for the rest of the original Toy Story fans by giving us more Buzz and the rest of the gang. Ughhhhh. Toy Story 3 was PERFECT. That's my ending not this cash grab."
"bodiealsip180","10","4","8","6 September 2019"," Loved it!!
","Toy Story 4 isn't really necessary but I am pleasantly surprised and so happy it exists. Going in I was really nervous because I felt Toy Story 3 was a damn near perfect way to end this franchise. With that being said this movie was almost as good in my opinion. So many references to The Shinning which reminded me of the carpet in Sid's house from the first movie. The animation in this movie is absolutely superb! Keanu as a Canadian stunt motorcyclist was great. I completely see why Tom Hanks and Tim Allen choked up on their last day of voicing Woody and Buzz. The last act pays off in an extremely emotional way. To infinity... And beyond! Go see it! <3"

"feuyoque","4","4","8","3 September 2019"," Toy Story Snore
","I was hoping for another great Toy Story movie, but this one was really boring. There is nothing unique about it. You get Woody's repetitive dialogue about why one toy is the most important thing to a child and blah, blah, blah...., been there, done that. Part 1, 2, and 3 were all different from each other and fun. Part 4 is just about saving Forky, a lame character. Forky adds no value to the franchise. I felt like Forky watching this movie, I didn't know why I was there. I was sadly disappointed."
"hxntjordxn","10","4","8","30 July 2019"," The end of Woody's story is, as you'd expect from the series, dressed in an abundance of hilarity, age-appropriate scares and dazzling animation.
","For the cynical amongst us (myself included), Toy Story 4's very existence seemed all but too bold a gamble; how could another instalment in what is arguably a perfect series not only match the outstanding quality of its predecessors, but also respectfully undo the thoroughly satisfying conclusion of a beloved trilogy? Pixar, however, have successfully negotiated both aspects of that conundrum, crafting an absolutely worthy story that answers both of those questions in the best way one could possibly imagine.<br/><br/>Debate the necessity of this chapter all you must, but despite the story feeling slightly detached from that which came before before it - Andy's ownership of the toys being the connective tissue driving the previous adventures, while still lingering to the right degree - the narrative truly feels organic. The screenplay asks all the right questions, and answers them with the same pathos that characterised the history of the franchise. In a masterful stroke, Pixar bravely humanise these characters further than ever before, developing the series' already mature philosophy on purpose and pondering what a toy is to do when their tenure of servitude to a child is all but over. In exploring such a theme, Toy Story 4 does the seemingly impossible and not only transcends the ending of Toy Story 3, but also invites you to reconsider whether it was indeed the perfect ending for Woody and company.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is absolutely the cowboy doll's story, bringing the series full circle and further rendering it a fitting conclusion. This, in addition to reintroducing Bo Peep following her absence from Toy Story 3, has the adverse effect of sidelining many of our favourite characters, including the main cast. While this is certainly notable, the likes of Buzz and Jessie had their arcs completed long ago, and it seems wise not to present them with redundant conflict for the sake of it. That's not to say that characters are underserved; even with a huge ensemble including many new toys, each of them offers a memorable comic moment all of their own. Woody, who is rightfully upheld as the heart of the franchise, remains prominent throughout, with a plot that tackles his ever fierce loyalty and provides him the opportunity to find the solace he so very deserves. Make no mistake about it; these toys have as much humanity about them as any of the greatest characters in cinematic history.<br/><br/>The end of Woody's story is, as you'd expect from the series, dressed in an abundance of hilarity, age-appropriate scares and dazzling animation, accompanied by original music from franchise staple Randy Newman. The pessimistic viewer will undoubtedly perceive the merchandising opportunities Disney will inevitably reap from this effort, but its heart, soul and creative motive supersede those doubts for one-hundred beautiful minutes. To infinity, and beyond."

"winnie_best","6","4","8","17 July 2019"," Ending ruined everything
","Leaving the theater, I was unsatisfied, angry. How can they did this? Woody was a loyal toy, and toys' purposes were staying with child. That's what the franchise told us through past twenty years.<br/><br/>If a toy want to find freedom, it's just like a tiny human who can't meet other humans. And if it can have freedom,maybe it also can meet other humans, make friends with them. But what's the fun if toys are so much like humans?<br/><br/>Even if the change in concept must be done, it could be more smoother. Woody hadn't be picked up three times this week. That's not enough. It could be he hadn't be picked up in 2 month, or half a year. Children's likes are changing all the time, so Woody couldn't be sure that he was unable to bring smile on Bonnie's face anymore. By the way, Bonnie still took Woody with her while traveling. If the ending was Woody telling Bo Peep that he would come with her, after being abandoned or being sure Bonnie need him no more, that would be better in my opinion.<br/><br/>Some places are off, too. Like how could Bo Peep's opinion change made others' mind changed as well immediately? And seeing Bo Peep, no one of the toys stayed at van questioned why she was here, and what the hell was this strange situation with Woody's sudden change in attitude. I mean, they knew Woody for decades, surely they would have something to say about his forsaking of principle. They just all acted surprised and accepted Woody's leaving. They had different personalities, OK?"

Soon, she takes Forky and Woody, along with Bo Peep making a return, they go on a quest to get him back.<br/><br/>I won't give anything else away. Of course the main characters are great and have stood the test of time. Also, the addition of two plush arcade toys named Ducky and Bunny, a Canadian daredevil named Duke Caboom and even Gabby Gabby make this movie really special.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I will tell you that I cried a little during the movie.

"schroederagustavo","9","6","14","23 June 2019"," I'm so glad they made this movie
","Like so many other kids, I grew up with the Toy Story movies. The first Toy Story is probably one of the films I've seen the most, simply because I used to play it endlessly on repeat on VHS when I was a kid. For me, the first three Toy Story movies are pretty much perfect, or at least as perfect as I would ever want those movies to be. So naturally, I was pretty nervous when I heard that they had decided to make another one. But I'm really glad they did because Toy Story 4 is a blast. Where Toy Story 3 was a very satisfying conclusion to the story since Andy grows up and goes to college, I was surprised to see the direction they went with in this one. Toy Story 4 is Woody's movie and it's a satisfying conclusion to his character, since this movie is pretty much about him growing up and finding his new place in the world.<br/><br/>First of all, the animation is just brilliant. The opening scene involves nighttime and rain and it just looks amazing, very much real. The animation is easily the best part about the film and the animators definitely deserve a very big shutout. I actually found the opening scene to be surprisingly emotional. And during the opening theme, I liked how it's a little recap of the evolution in going from Andy in the first movie, to Andy going to college and leaving the toys with Bonnie. It really emphasizes how, in Woody's perspective, a toy's purpose is to make a kid happy and the beautiful memories that come with the experiences with them.<br/><br/>In good Toy Story fashion, in this movie we get a bunch of new characters, all of which are great, but let's talk about Forky first. Forky is one of those characters that could potentially be super annoying if overused. Luckily, he is used very well in the movie and I liked his role in the film very much. The duck and the bunny played by Key and Peele are funny, but I do think they overstay their welcome a bit. The ventriloquist dolls are creepy and Gabby Gabby was a pretty good sympathetic villain as well. In my opinion, the best new addition was the Canadian stunt toy Duke Caboom, I thought he was awesome, by far my favorite new character in the film.<br/><br/>I thought Bo Peep was awesome here, as well. They made her this strong, independent woman who can handle herself quite well in troubled situations, and I really liked how they handled that, it didn't feel forced at all and it didn't feel like the creators were trying to push feminism for the sake of feminism (looking at you Captain Marvel).<br/><br/>In my opinion there are some minor flaws with the film, namely pacing during the second act, I thought it got a little slow and I think the movie could have benefited from being a little bit shorter (maybe 5-10 min reduction). And while the Toy Story movies have always been about toys solving problems in a really clever manner, in this one I do think it gets to the point of being a little bit absurd. I mean, instead of solving one big problem, it's like they jump between many different little problems and I think it hurt the focus of the film a little bit.<br/><br/>That being said, the ending was so good, my eyes got watery and although I didn't cry, my inner child definitely did. It was beautiful, and while this is definitely my least favorite Toy Story movie, that really doesn't say much, since all of the movies in this franchise are excellent. I am really glad they made this movie and if they decide to make this the final movie in the franchise I would be perfectly fine with that, since I think this is a really good conclusion. I said that at the end of Toy Story 3 as well, but here's a bonus. If they do decide to make another one, I will happily pay to watch it."

"deep_jethva","5","5","11","3 July 2019"," Average movie
","This was a good movie, if you are watch this as a stand alone movie. However, not preferable for those who have been following the whole series.<br/><br/>First, Toy Story 3 ends with Andy giving up his favorite toy to Bonnie and makes Bonnie promise to look after him. Bonnie then neglects Woody, and breaks Andy's promise. If that was the case then Woody would have been better of going to college with Andy and would still have a purpose.<br/><br/>Second, the previous series shows the strong relationship between Buzz and Woody. At the end of the second part Woody said that they will be together no matter what happens. One the things I enjoyed most is watching their friendship and it is disappointing to see them go their seperate ways.<br/><br/>Finally, the main purpose of Toy Story is to be their for the child when they need to be played. That is what Woody believes. So he goes against his own principle and choose to become a lost toy. it should have ended with Woody finding another owner and making Bo realise the importance of being a toy.<br/><br/>It was disappointing the way it was ended since Woody would not be another child's toy. If you haven't since the predessor or if you ignore the predessor, then it is good."

Toy story 4 has Stunning visuals, a good story, and a Heartwarming finale to the series (NO SPOILERS) Toy story 4 is a huge event for the summer that is definitely going to wake up your tear ducts again.

","When this movie was announced a few years ago i was horrified, ""surely the only reason to make a sequel to the best ending they could've possibly given to the franchise is driven by cashgrabbing"", boy was i wrong!<br/><br/>From the beggining the movie feels different, but fresh, and i was completly hooked, there was not a dull moment, not a single scene which felt out of place, absolutly fantastic.<br/><br/>As for many further installments in franchises, at some points the franchise moves the camera a little bit further, and shows the audiance the outer world of their universe, this move is usually risky, because introducing new characters means less focus on the usual ones, and also sometimes leads to an ""overdose of characters"" when the movie has to many characters for it's own good, Toy Story 4 decides to move the camera on this one and does it FANTASTICALLY! Some of our usual characters are more dormant than usual but the new characters are SO great they easily fill the focus, Each character brings a touch of it own, from laughter, to Horror, the universe of Toy Story was never more spectacular.<br/><br/>Lore-wise this movie also nails it, from the main narrative which is kind of similar to previous Toy Story movies but still somehow manages to feel very fresh, To the Characters themselves, as their challanges through the tale tranverse into beautiful lessons, for them and for us as viewers, and let me say it, the Villain in this movie is absolutly the best villain in the franchise!<br/><br/>Overall this movie was one of the biggest surprises i've had recently, as i was absolutly sure the franchise is fine as the trilogy it was, but like the title states, sometimes when you think you've got something going perfectly, a new chaper to your story might prove out to be something you didn't want, but ultimatly need.<br/><br/>A huge part of me really wishes Pixar would end it here and put it on the shelf, but another part of me also knows that if they do decide to make a 5'th, they will probably surprise me again."

","I just came back home after watching this. It was just like a dream.
I expected nothing but greatness, and that's exactly what I got. This was 100 minutes of your favorite toys finding themselves in action-packed, heart-wrenching scenarios time and time again. Woody's seemingly selfish actions have proved annoying in every single Toy Story film, but the audience always knows that, deep down, he means well. That's what his friends had to remind themselves every time Woody jumped into action in part four.
The flashbacks at the beginning were a tremendous help in further solidifying the emotional value of these toys and all that they have gone through together. All previous Toy Story movies have planted the idea time and time again that toys are meant to be there for their child, but this one seeks to challenge that, introducing the idea that not all who wander are lost.
Forky absolutely stole the show, highlighting just how important handmade creations can be to children, as well, and the pure lengths a toy would go to for his child. Sporks are now my favorite utensil.
Special appearances from past friends and new enemies who could give Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear a run for his money draw audiences in front the very beginning, making the theater explode in excitement and tear up just minutes later.
While younger children who might have only just been introduced to Buzz, Woody, and the gang probably found it meaningless, I didn't think I was going to be crying as hard as I did in that theater
This felt like a farewell to my childhood, and maybe it was Disney's way of waving goodbye to those who grew up with Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and Toy Story 3, saying it's finally time to let go."

","Me and my family are one of the biggest fan of the Toy Story Franchise and this movie was a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>The whole movie's plot felt so shallow and lacked substance, it's full of inconsistencies and contradicts what was established for the past 3 movies.<br/><br/>The humor, albeit funny, felt forced. Toy Story's humor was never about slap stick and cheap jokes. Toy Story's humor has always been witty.<br/><br/>It also broke the illusion of that Toy Story 3's perfect ending has left us, that the gang is in good hands and everyone's going to be happy.<br/><br/>It's also disappointing that the gang has limited to nothing screen time, Woody and Buzz who demonstrated their planning and strategy skills in Toy Story 3's breakout was non existent, they were reduced to Simple toys, which they shouldn't be.<br/><br/>The list goes on, but one thing's for sure. I hope they just let the Toy Story franchise end at 3."
"Benslie","9","9","24","22 June 2019"," A good family film but an obvious cash grab
","First of all, as I was leaving the theatre and was thinking about how great the movie was and I realized one thing that at certain points in the film it seemed rushed. At the beginning of the film, it felt fine and then more towards the middle of the film it started to feel rushed a bit. Like in one scene they would be doing something and then would just transition to something for a bit and then to something new. The movie is one-hour and forty-minutes and I think a longer run time could have helped out a lot. I really liked some of the new characters. They all were really funny but at the same time just seemed like ways so they could get more money with the new characters and could make more movies with them. With the old characters, I actually liked what they did with Woody and how he helped show the message of this film. From what I could tell the message is that sometimes you have to change in order to be happy or everybody doesn't just have one purpose but multiple or something like that? The animation in this film is amazing but I do wish that they kept it close to the original animation style but like I said the animation is still spectacular. I love the score composed by Randy Newman. In the end, Toy Story 4 is a good film but also feels like a cash grab film at the same time. Check it out if you grew up with the original three or just want to see a fun animated family film."
"Tweekums","10","2","3","12 March 2020"," Four films in and 'Toy Story' is still charming
","As this film opens nine years prior to the main action when Woody is still one of Andy's toys; his friend Bo Peep, is being given to another child. After this prologue we return to the present where he is now one of Bonnie, Andy's sister's toys. He finds himself left in the closet while she plays with the other toys. Then, on her first day at school Bonnie makes her own toy out of a spork, this she names Forky. He is her new favourite toy. Forky doesn't think of himself as a toy and only Woody's interventions stop him throwing himself into the trash. Then on a family road trip Forky is lost and Woody determines to find him and return him to Bonnie. In the process he meets new toys and is reunited with an old friend.<br/><br/>Each time a new 'Toy Story' film comes out I fear it will be the one that proves unnecessary and is disappointing... one day that may happen but it doesn't with this film. It provides a solid story, good action and some mildly frightening, in a child friendly way, scenes. Some may be disappointed that many of the old favourites amongst the toys have almost negligible roles to play; this is balanced by some great new toys; I particularly liked Forky, even though he was slightly disturbing with his mismatched eyes and desire to throw himself away. Other great additions are Duke Kaboom, a Canadian stunt-bike toy and Gabby Gabby, a doll with a faulty voice box. As before this isn't just about the toy's adventures; it is an emotional story which may bring a tear to the eyes of some viewers; particularly during the final scene. Overall I thought this was a great film which can be enjoyed by people of all ages."
"Offworld_Colony","9","2","3","10 February 2020"," Highly enjoyable...
","...almost more streamlined than 3 which was a more robust and complicated messy rich emotional film and 4 is rather more of a focussed and cleaner affair. It introduces some great new characters, and a couple of excellent locations, I for one would happily see Woody and Bo running the antique store that functioned as a sort of ganger film-lite. Bo Peep, excised from the last films, comes back with aplomb, a perfect foil for Woody and his arc, a brilliant character, and Woody has a brilliant arc in this film, a film dealing with the next steps of parenthood, after saying goodbye in 3, it's now about finding new purpose in later life. Not very often it's very funny, but it's quality over quantity, inbetween the laughs is a family drama with characters we've been living with for some time, it's like hugging a distant cousin that you forget you love so much until you see them again."
"RhapsodyReviews","9","2","3","3 February 2020"," Another Great Addition.
","Review:
'Toy Story 4' is a computer-animated comedy film directed by Josh Cooley. It is the fourth installment in Pixar's 'Toy Story' series.
Yet another great addition into 'Toy Story' franchise. They knew they had to change things up if they wanted to make another movie, and they pulled it off brilliantly.
Woody (Tom Hanks) has always been confident about his place in the world and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that's Andy or Bonnie. But when Bonnie adds a reluctant new toy called Forky (Tony Hale) to her room, a road trip adventure alongside old and new friends will show Woody how big the world can be for a toy.
The voice acting was on par with the previous film, with most of the original cast coming back. Tony Hale was fantastic as Forky too. He brought a new life to the film and his character truly fit in to the new world of toys.
Kids today build their own toys in school or at home via craft making so I bought into this story right away. You can not go into this movie expecting it to have the same feeling as the first three films. It's a completely different feeling and tells a totally different story. I see a lot of complaints about that fact, but while it may be different, it is in no way a bad film.
Overall, the movie has lots of heart and quite a few laughs. The voice acting really brings these characters to life and doesn't feel like actors portraying them as much as it feels like they are alive on screen.
4.5/5"

No matter if your a fan of the former Toy Stories or if this is your 1st times seeing a Toy Story it's good either way. Join Woody and the gang as they help little Bonnie adjust to Kindergarten and they meet there new friend Forky a friend which Bonnie makes in school. Forky thinks he's trash since he was made out of trash but he leans he's not trash that he's a toy and at that he is Bonnie's favorite toy right now. Woody goes out on adventures and finds his old friend Bo Peep who now don't have a kid she's out on her own and she thinks she's free. Woody gets involved in an antique story and runs into an old doll who wants Woody's voice box so she can have a kid like Harmony a little girl who is the grand daughter to the owner of the antique store. Buzz light year even gets hung up at the carnival as a prize and meets to fuzzy bunnies hanging there also.

There is so much well written humor, but also well written introspective dialogue and subtlety for people who grew up with the series.<br/><br/>It is an excellent movie for adults, and the best film of the year in my opinion. Sure, it has the benefit of characters that have been fleshed out over the span of 3 movies, but it does something new and beautiful with them. You will see Woody's growth, and sympathize with him as you have never sympathized with him before. This has set a new, and frankly ridiculously high standard for animated sequels."

","I really didn't expect much going into this. I am still a firm believer that the series should have ended with the 3rd. So, when I heard about a 4th coming, I wasn't giddy like everyone else. But if pressed, I don't really care all thatttttttt much.<br/><br/>This one just felt weak. Not a lot of comedic relief. Even the animation, although Pixar-Polished, just felt kind of status quo, which for Pixar standards is still good, but nothing to bail out the lack of memorability within the movie itself.<br/><br/>I liked the trademark, Toy Story, existential musings about toy sentience, and the security guard dolls in the antique store were mechanically terrifying, but I just don't think this movie should have been made. It should have stayed on the storyboard or in the minds of the writers as a nice ""what if"". Never to be realized and fully produced. That's just me.<br/><br/>Toy Story ranked: #1, #2, #3, #4. In that order."
"sholdstock","6","2","3","19 July 2019"," Mixed bag of awesomeness and disappointment
","Firstly, let's just say, TS4 is a must-see for fans. Because no-one can summarise it in a review. And for all it's let-downs, it is on par with the earlier trilogy for its laughs, fantastic (new) characters and it's charm.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>It's letdowns are many. It was a tough sell to bring back our beloved characters for a fourth instalment, and Disney pulled out all the stops to create some of the best new toys than any previous movie. I just wish that they'd spent as much time on the plot and overarching Toy Story themes that the first three films created and supported so well.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the film, suffice to say, the morals don't quite fit the 'You've got a friend in me' vibes. It also blurs the line a bit between good and bad, which could be confusing to a young child - or maybe even an adult like me.<br/><br/>While each of the previous Toy Story movies had their own 'scary toys', I'd say this one trumps them all. And they play a heavy part in the films' plot, so young kids beware. This film better suits the returning Toy Story fan than a young kids' movie.<br/><br/>For big fans of some of the smaller sidekick toys, this film could be a little bit of a downer, with a lot of the main characters sidelined for most of the movie. But a good outing for Woody, Buzz, Bo and a host of other new (brilliant) characters.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, a decent watch, and will be better remembered if they follow it up with a sequel (fifthquel?) to explain some of the unanswered questions the movie raises."

","Initially I was nervous when a fourth installment was announced because the third was a 'perfect ending', but because the third was so amazing I decided to trust that this one would be great as well; but I was disappointed.<br/><br/>I think the true problem lays with the fact that there is about three different half baked storylines in the film rather than one comprehensive one. It's unclear what the through line is and what the main takeaway is even supposed to be.<br/><br/>Personally my biggest problem is that Woody ultimately makes a decision that is so contrary to the character established over the lengthy franchise. It seriously doesn't make sense. For someone whose fierce loyalty has always been his toy family and his kid to just leave that for no apparent strong reason?<br/><br/>The only way that this decision would have remotely made sense and fit with one of the attempts of a takeaway of 'the most noble thing a toy can do is be there for a kid in need' is if Woody would have left Bonnie and the gang for a kid who needed him more. It feels a much more logical route to have gone and would have remained true to Woody's modus operandi.<br/><br/>But finally I must say: the animation was phenomenal. Absolutely gorgeous and intuitive and consuming. Every texture, light, and interaction between toys and objects is so mesmerizing. Animation is by far the crowning jewel of this feature."

","While the animation is gorgeous and the voice acting is great as usual, Toy Story 4 unfortunately fails as a film and a sequel to one of the best trilogies ever.

"MissSimonetta","6","1","1","15 March 2020"," The six rating is generous because deep down I hated this
","Three good things: the animation is drop-dead gorgeous (seeing young Andy in this movie, it's amazing how much CG animation has evolved in the last quarter of a century), Forky is not as annoying as he could have been, and the gags are generally funny. That being said...<br/><br/>What did they do to Buzz? Why is he suddenly dumb? I know he was never the most cerebral space ranger in the ship, but now he's so dumb he uses his randomly generated voice options to make crucial decisions? I'll tell you why: A) his stupidity moves the plot along in ways it would not have if he was still intelligent and B) the writers have no clue to do with the characters that are not Woody and Bo Peep.<br/><br/>Why is Woody going through the same identity crisis about not being needed AGAIN?<br/><br/>Why are the supporting cast-- from Jessie on down to the Potato Heads-- essentially given nothing to do? This hurts the movie more than you might think: the ending has this ""Woody saying goodbye to the gang"" shot that might have worked in TS3 where all of the characters were integral to the story, but not here, where their presence feels more like an extended cameo.<br/><br/>On a related note, the toys all splitting up is just.... wrong in so many ways. The last three movies, beyond their allegorical treatment of acceptance of mortality and the transience of life, emphasized the importance of community and friendship. Andy might grow up but the toys would stick together and find meaning in their bonds with one another. Not now, I guess.<br/><br/>Also, the script is a mess. While the main plot is ""get Forky back to Bonnie because she needs him for comfort,"" the writers introduce a myriad of subplots and one-note characters for us to keep track of-- this is a messy, messy story, a far cry from the simple, elegant structures of the first three movies.<br/><br/>TS4 might not sink to the lowest levels of your average cash grab, but do not be fooled: this is a cash grab. There is no reason for it to exist. The first three movies were as perfect a movie trilogy as one could have wished for-- like THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, this is better off ignored."
"TheOny13","5","1","1","1 March 2020"," Everything wrong with Pixar
","I got the chance to see this movie along with a couple of my friends and although they've enjoyed a little (and I can totally understand why someone would enjoy such a movie) i just didn't.<br/><br/>From the first minutes I had my doubts that this movie is going to be any good... and here is why: Boring plot. Nothing interesting happens, things just happen and there's a time jump and then more things happen and the plot just gets more and more complicated. Having a plot that gets more complicated just as a pretext or excuse for a lack of an interesting story is a lame way to try to write a good story. Which brings me to the second point of this review. And namely that there are way to many unnecessary complications. Everything just complicates and complicates and it becomes really hard to follow the plot and unerstand what's the point of this movie and what message it's trying to transmit. Everything is convoluted and that is not how you write a good story. On the contrary the story must be simple enough to be followed but at the same time complex enough to be interesting and captivate the audience. This movie had none of the above. That was accomplished mainly through dumb decissions from almost all of the characters. Many of the characters made no sense in the universe they were a part of and just making weird decisions in order to move the plot forward is not an excuse or a trait of good characters or good story. Most of the new characters were anyway very annoying and uninteresting with the exception of 3 new characters 2 brothers and a doll whose stories and conclusions were one of the better parts of the movie. Aside from that there was an obvious political agenda making Bo Peep such a strong character and making Woody look like an incompetent or idiot most of the times. Typicall feminism propaganda.<br/><br/>The only good parts were as I mentioned before the 3 new characters and their stories. The ending was a bit more like old style Toy Story action and suspence, but the road until there was very rough and bumpy. Very boring story with uninteresting and boring and at times annoying new characters but a gourgeous animation. However, a good animation is not what makes a good movie, right? 5/10"

","As one of the biggest Toy Story fans, I was slightly disappointed by this movie. I didn't dislike it though, but it lacked something, that little something that has made this franchise magical and endearing.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 was not bad, but it deserved a better plot and a better ending. What is strange is that I find its ending to be fair and logical for the main character Woody, but at the same it felt unsatisfying because the gang of toys without Woody would seriously lack flavor if Pixar decides to make a fifth movie (which I doubt).<br/><br/>What I loved about the first three movies was the endearing relationship between Andy and its toys and the mystery behind the adventures they're living behind closed doors, THIS is what makes Toy Story... TOY STORY. Here, I didn't feel any particular connection between the toys and Bonnie which kinda bugs me.<br/><br/>But the scene that really touched my heart was the goodbyes. The background music for this scene really helped carrying out the emotions, which I absolutely loved.<br/><br/>Anyway, I loved Toy Story 4, it was enjoyable, it was cute, it was emotional and I certainly would rewatch it, even though it's my least favorite one out of the four movies."

","I have watched all the previous movies however I have to say I only partly remembered what happen which is also partially why I think I was able to enjoy the movie more because I was watching it as a stand alone movie. This being said from the start of the movie it was very bizarre how Woody the main character seemed to be a supporting character rather than main although this does change that did strike me as a bit odd and was disappointed. The plot is generally engaging and easy to follow although I agree that the some of the main characters have been side lined and during some parts I would feel a bit shocked to see some of the ""main"" characters. There are funny parts in the movie and definitely some surprises, it is well made however, it isn't always easy to relate to the character of the spork, he doesn't stand out and quite frankly it's a bit difficult to believe that a spork could be a childs favourite toy to the point where they would panic if they couldnt find it however, for younger audiences this may not be significant. I enjoyed the movie, got some laughs, surprises out of. It was something to watch on a plane ride where other movies were just not that good and this was the one I could actually stick with."

There were plenty of adventure sequences that were fun to watch, and some that were not that much. Probably one of the most grabbing sequences of the film is most of what goes on in the antique store. Creepy elements emerge as to throw a different vibe, and done it successfully as the new villains seem quite frightening, much like Sid and his monstruous ""spider baby"" toy.<br/><br/>The most tear-jerking moment comes at the key scene near the end, that will change everything that was pre established by earlier films. The problem arises with too much focus on Woody, Forky and Bo, leaving practically no screen time for the rest of our beloved characters. It doesn't feel like an honest and deserving send-off to them, which makes me question the very existence of this film, because they reached perfection in Toy Story 3, which cannot be surpassed, and if anything, anything that comes after it was going to be disappointing because the bar was set up really high.<br/><br/>It is still a good Toy Story film if you look at it objectively, but not as good, entertaining or emotionally cohesive as the ones that came before."

","This was an average entry into the Toy Story franchise. I liked the way Woody risked himself to get Forky back to Bonnie, and it continues the franchise's theme of loyalty and introduces some good new characters like Gabby Gabby and Kaboom the stunt driver, but it could have been done better. I still liked it though.<br/><br/>** 1/2 out of ****"
"Jamie_IMDB","8","1","1","7 December 2019"," Toy Story 4 is more like Toy Story 3.5
","""Toy Story 4"" comes almost 10 years after the third - and what I had presumed to be the final - instalment in the beloved Pixar franchise. Yet, somehow, it feels as if no time has passed at all. I didn't have a Buzz Lightyear-shaped hole in my heart because frankly, I was satisfied with the way the story of Andy's toys had concluded. More than satisfied. It was cathartic. It was the perfect ending.<br/><br/>So when the trailer for a fourth film came bounding out of Pixar's toy box, I was confused. Why would they make another? After all, there had been plenty of Toy Story animated shorts in the interim to answer any questions about how Woody and the gang have been getting on with life with their new owner, Bonnie.<br/><br/>But there is something about the craft of ""Toy Story 4"" that makes it impossible to dislike - even if it is arguably an unnecessary addition. It is ultimately Pixar at its best: a charming blend of terrific voice acting, groundbreaking animation, and a story that is fairly deserving of a place in the franchise.<br/><br/>So, the story. Simply put, Bonnie, Woody's new owner, makes a toy fork and brings it home. Forky runs away, Woody follows, adventure ensues. The plot is fine, and as usual it is undercut by a heart-warming message about what a ""lost toy"" really is. It works well.<br/><br/>It's the same rag-tag gang of toys, too, save for a brand new addition: a plastic fork. The purpose of said fork - named ""Forky"" - is not just to be the film's main form of comic relief, but also to help unfold this narrative about what it truly means to be a toy. I'll be honest, I didn't take well to the character, but I *get* what he brings to the narrative, and it's appreciated. In the same way, I appreciate the return of Bo Peep with her totally refreshed look and even more refreshing companionship which she provides Woody on this all-too-familiar adventure (I think I've tired of the 'toy-gone-bad-because-their-owner-treated-them-badly' narrative, but that's just me).<br/><br/>On the other hand (and what has really pulled that review from a generous ""9"" to a solid ""8""), Buzz's character really lost me this time round. His confusion about the notion of an ""inner voice"" was poorly executed and kind of pushed him back in the direction that he's spent 3 films moving away from.<br/><br/>Much more can be said about the plot, but there is truly little to set it apart from the films that came before. What I will add is that Randy Newman's score is as prominent and brilliant as ever before - it's Newman at his best.<br/><br/>From an animation standpoint, TS4 is a visual masterpiece. It's so pleasing, so intricate, and so technically brilliant (lighting, I'm looking at you) that I almost missed the film's underlying flaws.<br/><br/>On the whole, TS4 is a truly excellent film, and certainly is worth your while. Simply put, it just doesn't live up to its meatier and more necessary predecessors - no matter how much I wanted to."
"ssnape3","5","1","1","2 December 2019"," A Sequel to Far
","My rule about movie franchises is unless it's Star Wars they should stop at 3 - if the Lord of the Rings can tell their story in a trilogy then any other franchise should be able to and that goes for the Toy Story movies too, and actually Toy Story 3 was a perfect ending to the trilogy, if the ending didn't make you cry you don't have a soul but Disney being Disney they had to go for more money and make another one - Toy Story 4 was Ok as its own movie although it pretty much rehashed the plot of the 1st three movies, and it was fun to see the characters again but it undercuts all the messages and good feelings from the first 3 films - at the end of Toy Story 3 Andy entrusted his favorite toy Woody to Bonnie as he went off to college, but instead of loving Woody she apparently just abandoned him in a closet to gather dust, so much for that feel good ending, Woody would have been better off going to college with Andy - and the guiding principles of Woody for the first 3 films were leave no toy behind and be loyal to your child but at the end of this movie Woody abandons his friends and leaves Bonnie to pursue romance with Bo Peep and be a lost toy with her - So after all he went through Woody doesn't care about a child's happiness anymore just his own and doesn't care that he is never going to see his friends again, the friends he abandoned Andy for? - really? - Toy Story 4 is a sequel we didn't ask for and didn't really need, you are better off keeping your good memories of the first three films and skipping this one."

"LigerTamer100","8","1","1","22 November 2019"," Good sequel, but not great
","Back in 2015 or 2016, I heard that Pixar was going to make a Toy Story 4, I wasn't sure what to think. I thought the third movie and a few shorts and specials was enough for the Toy Story franchise. And what do I think of the movie? It's better than I thought.<br/><br/>It's not as good as the previous movies, but at least it wasn't like Cars 2. I really like how Bo Peep became an amazing character with skills instead of being in her dress and a pole. Ducky and Bunny are very funny, I laughed so hard when they were telling Buzz and Giggles their ideas and how they explained their ideas during the post credits.<br/><br/>I think the only character I didn't like very much was Gabby Gabby, the reason why is because I don't find her much as a villian. Her backstory is that her voicebox is broken and she needs a new one so she can have one last chance to be with a child, meh, that's not much of a villian type of story, I prefer the story behind Latso from the previous movie.<br/><br/>I do like the ending because it makes sense why Woody left the group, he hasn't been with Bo Peep for nine years and it just doesn't feel right if they went different ways after so long without seeing each other, plus Woody hasn't been played with for who knows how long so it's best to have a new life where he can actually do something with his new friends and the old group can take care of each other without him.<br/><br/>So yeah, I think it's a good sequel to (hopefully) end the Toy Story franchise, but not as good as the other movies that we know and love."

","My very first thought when this was announced was, do we need a 4th instalment? I've expressed in the past my distaste of sequels and decent trilogies are almost unheard of. Were Pixar willing to risk that for what is surely just a cash in? No probably not, but Disney are! Thankfully though, this is wonderful! Cartoons don't age, but the passing of time is the point here and it's treated deftly. Great characters, great voices, great stories, it's truly magical to escape with Woody & Co. once more on a tense, funny and heartwarming journey, that see's them tackling much deeper subjects than before and themselves becoming much more than mere toys. When the first Toy Story was released it was all about the CGI, as an audience we've moved on so far in the intervening years. Now the mechanics are inconsequential, I completely forgot I was watching an animation. The witty script and rollercoaster plot deliver a 2 hour thrill ride as toys jump out of windows into the unknown, tackle freaky antique dolls and make new fairground friends. Everything is dialled up, carefully orchestrated to make you smile, laugh, shed a tear and white knuckle the remote control. Did we need a 4th instalment? No, we didn't, but I'm sure glad we got one."

","Now that I can watch this without any annoying children, I can happily say that this movie was good. Of course when comparing this to the other Toy Story films, it is my least favorite, but the movie was able to still be entertaining. Although the story is a rehash of the first one a bit, the characters, old and new, were fun to watch in a new adventure. I appreciated that this movie was the end of Woody's arc, which I would assume is why Pixar made this movie other than for money.

Although it was a lot of fun the plot felt quite weak and lacked the charm you'd expect.

"volcanolam","4","4","9","29 September 2019"," Not good enough to justify a full sequel
","Could have been okay 5/10 if not considering the franchise as a whole, which used to be a perfect trilogy before this meh film is released.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is similar to the episodic adventures Pixar has done before, except longer and with less emphasis on the gang of beloved characters who are friends with Woody. Even the Woody Buzz relationship, the highlight of previous films, are mostly shunned for other less interesting aspects. The story does not feel particularly strong or special, and it totally doesn't justify the continuation the franchise when the ending in 3 was so perfect. The script is surprisingly subpar, and most of the humor doesn't hit as well as in the last films. The ending is pretty much a retread on themes from the previous films so it did not elicit any strong emotional response from me.<br/><br/>The animation and production value were what you come to expect of Pixar; they keeping upping the game with improving technology. I like most of the new characters. Bo Peep, Forkie and the villain are pretty decent and well thought out. These are pretty much the major stand outs of this film.<br/><br/>No matter what, Toy Story 4 is obviously inferior to its predecessors in a multitude of ways and on every compartment. I don't want to get into the cash grab criticisms, but Pixar is very hit and miss this decade, and it has become a mere shadow of the legacy it created in the 2000s. Now after marring their flagship property, they are finally turning to some original films. Upwards will come out soon, and I will welcome it with eagerness and skepticism."

"xx-slay-n-xx","6","4","9","2 July 2019"," Lacking some of Pixar's usual magic
","Toy Story 4 is certainly a fourth installment of a franchise. Whether you believe this to be a good thing or a bad thing is up to your opinion of rehashed ideas and the merit of original ideas. While a fun watch, this film lacked a lot of the magic and world building, character development and interesting side characters that we are so used to in Toy Story films.<br/><br/>The world we are put into in this Toy Story film is unfortunately shallow. Where in previous films we saw a wealth of interesting locations that have their own magic in each of them, the scope of this film is far more narrow. We are introduced to the carnival quickly and that is our home for 75 minutes or this film. It felt like the grand aspirations of an interesting world were not realized at all. I kept waiting for the next act, the next stop in the road trip, but it never arrived. We are also not given nearly enough of some of our favorite characters, in favor of drab tired side characters who lack much purpose. Potato Head, Rex, Slinky and Hamm have little more than a cursory mention, and Buzz is left with little to do besides act dumb and provide a small bit of comedic relief.<br/><br/>And where was the tension? The fear? The subtle darkness that made the first few films so wide reaching in its entertainment. There was no Sid, no incinerator. Never was I afraid for these characters. It was too easy for them the whole time. I was never on the edge of my seat and wondering what might happen next.<br/><br/>The stars of this movie were the small toys who were unique and colorful. The Canadian Daredevil, our high-five craving soldiers and the psychopathic horse were the stars of this movie and got the biggest laughs. They are a testament to Pixar's ability to have fun in the peripherals without overshadowing the main cast.<br/><br/>And what more can be said about the animation that everyone hasn't said about Pixar a million times before? The effects were superb. It felt so real and lifelike and yet cartoonishly fun. The ability to make a fork who is sympathizable and relatable cannot be overstated. It's really the little details, the reflection of light off the water, the way a book falls off the shelf, or a lightbulb explodes when crashed into. These are where the magic happens.<br/><br/>Was this movie fun? Yes of course. Was it the weakest of the franchise? Also yes. It didn't hit all the notes we have become accustomed to in Pixar films. Bring your kids, they will love it. And see it if you're a Pixar and Disney nerd, but I won't be putting this one on my shelf for my future children to watch as they grow up."

","It's that time again, the time for updates, since enough time has passed. First of all, people asked me to give my opinion on the summer films of this year, and I'm not against doing this. How good are the films that have been released this summer? I'm now ready to give my take. I must admit that I've seen only several films this summer, and most of them were made by the The Walt Disney Company. But the ones that I did see didn't really disappoint me. Toy Story 4 is the best film that I saw. This film had a long development period because of the departure of John Lasseter from Pixar Animation Studios. I read about this in Animation Magazine. Because of this, and because of the fact that the film is yet another sequel to Toy Story (1995), I had the feeling that Toy Story 4 might be somewhat disappointing. But this film surprised me when I saw it because it's not only the best Pixar film since Incredibles 2 (2018). It's also one of the best Pixar films of this decade. In my opinion, the director, Josh Cooley, delivered the goods. The characters have never looked better. The voice work is excellent. The humor is frequent. And we get to find out new things about Woody and the gang. It's true that the film is formulaic, and it's yet another sequel from Pixar, but, when the film is this good, I don't feel like complaining. Still, I didn't enjoy seeing Toy Story 4 as much as I enjoyed seeing Incredibles 2. Incredibles 2 is, in my opinion, the best Pixar film of this decade, even surpassing Inside Out (2015) and Finding Dory (2016) in terms of craftsmanship. I went to see it more than once in a cinema. Can you believe that Incredibles 2 could have been even better if Brad Bird and Pixar had been given more time to make it? The film is almost perfect as it is, but it could have been even better. The only thing that weighs it down is the lack of a truly memorable villain. But, otherwise, the film is perfect, in my opinion. Thank goodness that films like this can still be made from time to time in Hollywood. Bird deserved to win a second Oscar for his work, but, because of political reasons and because he already has one Oscar, the Oscar for Best Animated Feature was instead awarded to the filmmakers of Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018). By the way, I finally figured out why Into The Spider-Verse isn't an entirely satisfying film. Miles Morales, the new Spider-Man, is supposed to be the main character. But he spends almost the entire film either being a sidekick to Peter B. Parker or acting as comic relief. Only at the end of the film does he get to do something on his own, but, by that time, it's too late for any character development for him. Therefore, Into The Spider-Verse lacks a fully developed protagonist. The animation style is also something that I find to be not entirely to my liking. It makes the film seem like a gimmick at times. Anyway, I've already posted my review of Into The Spider-Verse on my blog, and I don't have to go into it in more detail. By the way, if you like the animation style of the film, I can recommend getting the art book 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - The Art of the Movie'. The only other film that I fully enjoyed seeing this summer in a cinema is Spider-Man: Far From Home. It's yet another example of Marvel's domination of the superhero genre in film form. Marvel continues to put the other Hollywood studios to shame. Even the recently released Shazam!, which is thought of by some people as the best DC film of recent years, doesn't come close to the best Marvel films. I mean, really, is it that hard to make a good action film these days? I guess that it is, especially one with plenty of special-effects. Instead of lively, enjoyable flicks, we often get dour, distasteful flicks like Venom (2018), The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), or Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016) from the other studios. How depressing. It seems that the only film form in Hollywood that has consistently delivered good films in the last decade is computer animation. In my opinion, Far From Home doesn't rank among Marvel's best, but it's still a good flick. Tom Holland is definitely the best on-screen Peter Parker so far. So, there you go. I enjoyed seeing two films in a theater this summer, and both of them are films from Disney. I guess this means that this summer has been disappointing when it comes to new Hollywood films. But there are other new films that I found to be... passable, though not fully enjoyable. They are Annabelle Comes Home, Detective Pikachu, Missing Link, The Angry Birds Movie 2, Pet Sematary, The Secret Life Of Pets 2, Aladdin, Us, Hobbs & Shaw, How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, and Alita: Battle Angel. I saw almost all of these films long after they were released in theaters. I decided not to include The Lion King among these ""just fine"" flicks because seeing it felt strange to me. Firstly, this film was made entirely using computers. There are no human actors or real locations. But the film was still made to look as realistic as possible. Maybe this means that it can't really be called an animated film, or maybe it can. It's almost a scene for scene copy of the original 1994 film. This means that there's nothing original about it except for the way it was made. The animals, since they were made to look as real as possible, aren't as expressive as in the original animated film. In addition to all of this, I saw the original animated film only a few days before I went to see the remake in a theater. All of this added together made the film a strange and unenjoyable experience for me. Still, Pumbaa did fart once. But let's move away from this somewhat depressing picture and focus on something else. The people that follow my blog should know that most of the films that I see aren't new Hollywood films. If it's a Hollywood film, it's most likely one from the 1980s or it's a so-called classic Hollywood film. Many films from Hollywood's Golden Age really are a pleasure to watch for me. These films are well-acted and optimistic. By the way, if you've read the science fiction novel Titan by John Varley, you should know that Gaea, the old alien being that Cirocco meets at the end of the story, is obsessed with watching films from Hollywood's Golden Age. I'm currently reading the book 'Majestic Hollywood: The Greatest Films of 1939' by Mark A. Vieira."
"kevinxip","6","3","6","9 July 2019"," Overrated
","I wonder why a lot of people like this, The idea of this film is great but somehow I feel something is off. It's a bit absurd when Bonnie didnt even know that Woody is missing, If we looked back at toy story 3, woody is her favourite toy. Seems like nobody care about woody too, they just let go of him by the decision that he just made for seconds. The friendship lost its meaning. We didn't see the team like the predecessor, its more about woody and bo peep with its typical woman empowerment idea. The friendship used to be the main idea of the movie, especially when they are holding hands to face the fire in toy story 3. Maybe the idea of this film is different, but doesn't mean that you can just throw it away.<br/><br/>This movie is about making a decision, woman empowerment (equality), character development, but it seems dull. They keep adding things that happening right now to be seen as a platform that supporting equality, but the story itself is full of plotholes. When we see the first toy story, it become so interesting because how woody handling a toy that didn't know he was a toy, a new and sophisticated toy that believe that he's on the other planet. Its a brilliant premise."
"aurrzh","4","3","6","28 June 2019"," disappointing; an unwanted and unneeded ending to an ending
","For a start, there has not been any reasons on why Bonnie would not play with Woody anymore, although we already knew from Toy Story 3 that Woody was her favorite out of the toys that Andy gave her. Even when she finally found Woody and Forky in her backpack -- that was surprisingly left on the SAME shop which she went on and where the toys were -- she did not take a look on Woody. There just wasn't any clear background of this.<br/><br/>Forky, whom some thought (based on the trailer) would be the center of this film; was not really focused on. There was not any clear ""theme"" for Toy Story 4; which is it; getting Bo Peep together with Woody, making Forky realize that he was a toy (just like Buzz in the first movie), or getting not-so-evil Gabby a kid she always wanted.<br/><br/>This movie was even more disappointing as the original characters like Rex, Bullseye, Jessie, Potatoheads were not getting any major contribution to the plot. They instead focus more on the new characters who appear to provide ""more fun"" to the storyline; Plush Rush and Duke Caboom. Getting the original characters to stay on the van for most of the film is really disappointing. Even Buzz was not as eager to help Woody compared to the previous films; looked dumber when writers decided for him to follow his ""inner voice"".<br/><br/>Finally, the ending seems to be forced. Woody, whom we know from 3 previous films to never give up on a kid chose to immediately leave Bonnie just because he hadn't been played with. He even decided to leave the other toys to stay with Bo Peep even though there has not been any built relationships explained on the previous films.<br/><br/>Despite all the disappointments stated above, this movie is still entertaining and fun to watch. The animation was also reaaaally good (emphasizing on the cat in the antique shop)."

","I enjoyed it no doubt, the movie had loads of laughs and there's so much character development to Woody along with some others. By the end of the movie you'll come to really like Forky, as his character just connects so well to things like self discovery and a sense of purpose.<br/><br/>I LOVED how they brought back Bo Peep and made her into a real badass compared to what we previously saw her as and they even included an explanation of her disappearance in the last film which was very necessary indeed.<br/><br/>I'm trying my best not to spoil it but I felt like the things that Woody experienced and his dedication to bringing Forky back to Bonnie was so much more emotionally captivating than the ending. Compared to the final scenes in toy story 3 (literal tears out of my eyes), I didn't feel that same connection but was still so heartwarming to watch.<br/><br/>*Potential spoiler ....
Honestly, I did not like the new character Gabby Gabby (and her 'evil henchmen' that were something out of an R rated movie that was just so creepy) despite her motivations. I didn't like the outcome between her and Woody but I suppose that just reflects Woody's good nature and sole purpose (much like how he taught Forky) and that's what really got to me, how selfless Woody is and has been throughout the entire franchise and it was sad to see it all end.<br/><br/>This 4th instalment of toy story was so unique and touching in its core message, and no it didn't need to be made but thats the whole point!<br/><br/>Just go and enjoy it and try not to tear up"

","I laughed. I cried. I was so surprised about how necessary this installment was. I love all these films equally. They have been an essential part of my childhood and continue to resonate with me even as an adult. So many people contributed to the screen story of this installment, but mainly Andrew Stanton served as a co-writer and Josh Cooley gave us his directorial debut by amplifying the dignity of these characters, who for a long time, despite their inanimate entity, had something definitely human to say.
The last 5 minutes of this film is just pure poignancy and a poetic love letter to the 24 year old saga.

"CubsandCulture","4","3","7","22 October 2019"," A crushing disappointment on many fronts
","I am not sure where to begin with this film. The unnecessary extension of the franchise isn't what bothers me about this film. It isn't that the script is unfocused. It is that Buzz is reduced down to an extended cameo that is just one joke. It is not the film's theme about Woody retiring does not really track with any of the prior films. Or that Gabby Gabby's entire arch is unearned and she gets her big moment because of a lazy writing cheat. No what really bothers me is just how generic it is.<br/><br/>I know this is going to seem like a trivial point but if you compare Scud (bad dog in Toy Story) and the cat in this movie you can see how Pixar's fixation on photorealism and re-arranging tropes render the film exceptionally rote and dull. The cat in this film is far more realistic looking than Scud ever was. There are more than a dozens shots that look like a real cat that one can find on the internet. The fur is rendered in minute detail. Scud's eyes were weird looking. His legs looked like toothpicks. He was odd. But he stood apart as character with his own identity. I guess one could argue that Scud is less polished than the cat. But the cat is an utter failure as a character. There is nothing about it that sets it apart from any other cat. AND given that the cat's narrative function is largely the same as Scud's it blends into the background.<br/><br/>This film is disappointing because it is so flavorless."

"matthewssilverhammer","7","3","7","29 June 2019"," A Perfect Trilogy Taken a Step Too Far
","The ""Toy Story"" trilogy is a touchstone in every way. Starting with the first ever computer animated film, moving to the best Rotten Tomatoes score ever, and ""ending"" with an Oscar nomination, it's a nearly flawless story about loyalty, identity, aging and friendship that concludes in a perfectly satisfying manner.<br/><br/>And now, for some reason, there's a fourth. Woody and the gang are getting acclimated to living with their new child, Bonnie, when a ""toy"" named Forky (a creation made from a spork, googly eyes, glue and other craft box trinkets) enters the fold. From there, the toys go on yet another adventure, where their personal purpose in the world turns into a full-blown existential crisis, and ends with a heartfelt goodbye. Sound familiar?<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie; in fact, as a singular story, it's decent. The plot moves fairly briskly, the ethics are complex, the sweetness sidesteps being saccharine, and the humor is solid. It's also drop-dead gorgeous. The entire series, when watched in a row, really represents the incredible technological advances Pixar has forefronted for two decades.<br/><br/>Still, the movie never quite proves its necessity. Even some of its highest points miss the mark. Forky is a wonderfully and hilariously strange character, but he's sidelined for weaker, more familiar stories. Woody, one of the great cinematic characters, is given little new to do. The psychological-philosophical questions are noble, but never fully developed. Even most of the b-level toys are essentially replaced by cute but unremarkable new ones, a seeming effort to simply sell more toys.<br/><br/>Again, it's not a disaster. Plenty of people will be happy to just spend some more time in this universe. I just think if you're gonna reopen a perfect film franchise, you should have something more to say."

","Toy Story 4 may've been one movie too many, as it didn't quite live up to the first three and left me with too high of expectations that wee not quite met. The climax and plot of this movie weren't as exciting and climatic, and this movie lacked a true antagonist like the other movies. The ending did have a sad moment, but could've been much more dramatic and was too abruptly cut short. After Woody, Buzz, and Bo Peep, the other main toys like Rex, Slinky, Potato Head, and Jesse all had such minimal roles and were cast aside, while the new Forky character was rather stupid and annoying. I did like the crisis that troubled Woody, and the new spunky version of Bo Peep.

","Toy Story 4 is a 2019 American animated film produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Studios in the 3D adventure and romantic comedy genre. It is directed by Josh Cooley who replaces John Lasseter in the lead of the feature; Lasseter remains as executive producer. The story was conceived by the original Toy Story writing team: Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, and Lee Unkrich. The film is the sequel to 2010 Toy Story 3 and the fourth movie in the Toy Story franchise. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts, Joan Cusack, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Don Rickles, Estelle Harris, Jodi Benson, Michael Keaton, Kristen Schaal, Blake Clark, Timothy Dalton, Bonnie Hunt, Lori Alan, and Laurie Metcalfreplay their roles from previous franchise movies. In addition to the new additions by Tony Hale, Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele, Keanu Reeves, and Madeleine McGraw playing Fiddler, Duckling, Bunny, Duke Caboom, and Bonnie. Now living at little Bonnie's house, Woody introduces her friends to her new toy: Little Fork, based on the real fork. The new toy station doesn't like him or me a little, which returns, Bonnie's current favorite toy, Woody chases after him and, at the moment, finds Betty now living in an amusement park. Toy Story 4 is a closing of the movie saga! The protagonists are Woody and Fizzy, Fizzy always stealing in his scenes and very funny, Woody babysits him always facing his plight committed by Fuzzy and Betty this time has her side of female empowerment and liked it a lot. And my movie rating is 10.0.<br/><br/>Movie seen on June 21, 2019"

When Toy Story 4 was announced , I was worried that it was going to be a cash grab and ruin the perfect ending of the franchise which was (previously ) Toy Story 3. But Pixar has managed to create a film which makes you smile. Again. Woody and Buzz's friendship could have had a tad bit more screentime but overall I loved every minute of this film. And although the ending wasn't as tear jerking as Toy Story 3 , you will definitely leave misty eyed. Forky and the other new characters mingle perfectly with the existing ones but at times it feels like the old characters were neglected a bit. And Bo Peep's mysterious disappearance from the franchise is FINALLY solved. I found her new persona to be extremely cool. Toy Story 4 requires you to watch the other 3 films first as most of the plot is interwoven with them as it might become a bit confusing if you go there without any idea who Bo or Bonnie are. Watch the movie for the nostalgia of the simpler times."

"Hallelujah289","6","0","0","24 April 2020"," Bizarre, uneven, sometimes wise, with an emotional send-off
","I'm in my late 20s. I grew up with Toy Story. Probably saw Toy Story 2 (1999) in theaters with my family and borrowed the VHS tape from my aunt. I loved that film and that Sarah McLachlan song ""When She Loved Me."" Still do.<br/><br/>When Toy Story 3 (2010) came out eleven years later, I was excited for it. I didn't mind the darker elements exactly but didn't love the film. While Toy Story 1 and Toy Story 2 left me with warm feelings of friendship and growth, Toy Story 3 was memorable for its sinister plot twist, which was never quite balanced out again by the wholesome or the heroic.<br/><br/>After being disappointed with Toy Story 3, I didn't rush to see Toy Story 4 (2019), which came out nine years later. It's April 2020 and of course I've heard about how powerful the story of Toy Story 4 is, how deep and complex, how poignant. All things I looked forward to, and found in some measure, but not without simultaneous contradiction and other unsettling issues.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, Toy Story 4 is about growing out of old needs, and becoming sufficient without getting what you want, except actually it totally isn't and some characters are indulged anyway, because why not? When Toy Story 4 is actually about ""putting away old toys,"" or old mindsets, as in the case with Woody, the story is mature and outstanding. But when it isn't, the story is contrived and pointless and wish-washy. Where Toy Story 4 progressed with Woody it backpedaled with Gabby and Bonnie, as well to some extent with Bo Peep, which left me wondering what exactly I should be coming away with.<br/><br/>Also for me, what started to become problematic was how aggressive the toys were to humans. Even if only in fantasy, the toys pummeled the humans, suggested sending the father of Bonnie to jail, actually sabotaged the tire of the family RV and caused its owner to temporarily lose control of the vehicle, etc etc. While I love the characters of Andy's toys, Jessie the cowgirl, etc, they really had a scary amount of power to do actual damage. Bo Peep at the end freed most of the carnival prize toys and talked about freeing other toys. Somehow the nice, sweet Toy Story world started to feel eerie, like what next, is all the toys going to turn on the humans?<br/><br/>The problem with Toy Story 4 is it's both too edgy and too bland--it's like if the universe of Toy Story suddenly went gothic as in Game of Thrones (a mismatch which should clue you in to how unsettling Toy Story 4 was for me), but then ended with GoT's non-answer season 8. This is the sort of unevenness Toy Story 4 has for me, which is why I can't rate the movie highly even though there are aspects I do genuinely appreciate.<br/><br/>One thing I did appreciate was how Toy Story 4 grew up with its audience, now twenty-some years later. I did like the depth of the portrayal of Woody's psychology, his issues of being a former favorite toy and now ""trash,"" but I also did feel like some of the issues brought up were too mid-life crisis, like maybe one of the writers is having some major personal issues which didn't translate well to a kid's film. Again the unevenness of deep-seated, adult conflicts and overly scrubbed, kid-friendly resolutions.<br/><br/>Toy Story 1 & 2 are natural sequels, and rather finish the Toy Story series for me. Toy Story 3 is an extended epilogue, and Toy Story 4 is a strange bonus feature with some character development for Woody. Who even thought about Bo Peep and how did she suddenly grow a personality and a backstory? I don't even. . .<br/><br/>While I don't consider Toy Story 4 a success, it does have a very sentimental and appropriate send-off at the end for fans, like a final and very touching goodbye. A great deal of love and care went into those final scenes which warms my heart. Toy Story is a lovely franchise, and it deserves a send off, as well as a chance to finally end for good, unless it becomes an even more bizarre and twisted version of itself. While I don't think the ending of Toy Story 4 was significant or even good in itself, it certainly was a nice farewell for the franchise."

","I think my generation and the one beforehand collectively felt extreme anxiety when hearing a fourth Toy Story was in the works after such a perfect trilogy and it all wrapped up nicely at the end of the third. Although I think it may polarise, I really like this one and it's a great continuation in these characters story! Woody, Buzz and the gang are now all Bonnie's toys. She's just starting school and needs a friend to help her through this sudden change in her life. She makes a new friend, Forky who struggles to get to grips with being a toy. Woody tries to ensure Forky stays put and discover the wonders of being there for a child. It doesn't quite reach the level of perfection that the original trilogy did mainly through its focus on newer characters than the original crew; the new toys such as Duke Kaboom are really funny and multi-layered but it's does lose the focus on Slinky, Rex and the Potato Heads because of this. Buzz also surprisingly has less screen time than expected and the relationship between him and Jessie that was initiated in the originals has no time here at all. Nevertheless, it still works on so many other levels that I found it irresistable. It's so beautifully written and has moments that really tugged at my heartstrings; the central theme of being a lost toy is so well nuanced and profoundly existential the more I think about it with the return of Bo Peep, Woody's own internal struggle and new character Gabby's storyline which brought a tear to my eye in one wonderful scene. On a technical level, Pixar always excel in animation and the visuals from the very opening frames are jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The creativity and inventiveness of the first three are very much alive here with the introduction of funfair toys including the creepy as hell doll antagonists just in the corner of my mind since who are up there with Big Baby from Toy Story 3 and Sid's band of misfits from the first. There is a beautifully warm moment between Woody and Buzz that moved me beyond words; their friendship has been there since the beginning of life as a lot of us know it"

","When I discovered that another Toy Story was coming out of course I was super excited and couldn't wait to watch the film but when I watched it, I couldn't help but feel like this wasn't Toy Story. Like the characters were completely different to how I remembered them, like Buzz Lightyear using his so called ""conscious"" to make decisions for him when Buzz would never do that, he would do it on his own. Also the friendship dynamic between Woody, Buzz and Jessie just seemed like it was forgotten about in this film completely. Jessie hardly speaks and I thought Jessie & Buzz had romance going on like it has been going on since Toy Story 2. It was just a film that didn't feel like Toy Story at all, like Mr Potato Head, Mrs Potato Head, Rex, Hamm, Slinky Dog and Bull's-eye were completely forgotten and pushed to the side like they weren't important when they are in the previous films. Toy Story ended for me in Toy Story 3, it was a perfect ending for these characters didn't need another film to end a story that has already ended. Sure the emotional part in this film really got me but it just wasn't Toy Story for me. I will always watch the first 3 but this one, maybe again but properly not."

","Yeah, Toy Story 4 was a movie no one expected, and it's good, even if it does not live up to the standards set by the first three films.<br/><br/>In this film, Woody is feeling left out of playtime, so sneaking into Bonnie's bag as she goes to school, he helps her with arts and crafts after a boy takes the supplies on her table, bringing in trash that Bonnie uses to create Forky, who comes to life. With Bonnie's family going on a road trip, Woody gets separated from the others trying to keep Forky from throwing himself out. Now he has to get Forky back to Bonnie, reuniting with Bo Peep while trying to avoid being caught by Gabby Gabby, a doll who wants his voice box.<br/><br/>Yeah, I can see how this film does not live up to the level the last three films set. Toy Story 3's ending was a good way to end the trilogy, and the plot sounds like it was something Pixar cobbled together because they didn't have any idea how to top that (as some scenes, like the one where Buzz is tormented by Bunny and Ducky, sounds like another plot idea that was forced in), but ti still gets your emotions like every other Pixar film. The voice cast for the last film returns (with Mr. Potato Head's voice being archived recordings of Don Rickles performing the character in other media), and even adds more big names (like Key and Peele as Bunny and Ducky, Keanu Reeves as Duke Kaboom, and even Carl Weathers as Combat Carl (reprising the role from the Toy Story of Terror TV special). Also, the animation is fluid, and the ending really get you where it feels the most, especially if you've seen the films up until now. This is worth checking out."

","The toys are back in, what Pixar has hinted to be the, their perhaps last adventure. In the fourth installment of the
hugely successful computer-animated film series, the toys, now living with Bonnie is brought with her on a road trip. Problems emerge however, as a new addition the cast, the naive but delightful Forky (Hale) wants to leave the group. As always with ""Toy Story"", the cast is wonderful; under the lead of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as Woody and Buzz, along with a larger role for Annie Potts as Bo Peep and Tony Hale debuting as the before mentioned spork, ""Toy Story 4"" has the charm, fun, and relatable themes from previous films steadily present. The scenes set in a dusty antique shop, where the abandoned doll Gabby Gabby lives with her mafioso-looking henchmen are hilarious and packed with references and insinuations. Once again Pixar delivers a movie filled with warmth, however, for the first time in the ""Toy Story"" series, they haven't really reinvented itself. ""Toy Story 4"" does not manage to explore any new themes, after dealing with finding a place, abandonment, and loneliness in previous film, and as enjoyable as the film is, it isn't able to hit the mark as the three predecessors. At its best, ""Toy Story 4"" seems more sentimental over its predecessors than exploring that feeling in its in-film world. Not reaching the brilliance of previous films, and with ""Toy Story 3"" serving as a more worthy conclusion for the film series, ""Toy Story 4"" is still a beautifully animated, up tempo adventure that everyone can enjoy."
"Min111","Null","0","0","11 March 2020"," This was about the lost toys
","This is a movie where Woody, and his friends go on yet another adventure - a different adventure. This time, they all go on a road trip with their new owner, Bonnie, and meet with someone they haven't seen in a very long time - Little Bo Peep. Toy Story 4 was a good and successful movie, but I wouldn't say it was as good as the previous three Toy Story movies. I think it was the worst one even though it was still good. Something had to give. They somehow reunite with Little Bo Peep despite all the odds. It's the story more than anything which I find interesting. It's not as good or interesting as the other Toy Story movies, but I still liked it anyway. I'm not happy Little Bo Bepp has returned though it looked good that she was back. I was glad to see the back of her in the other movies. She's not one of my favourite characters, but she returned again in Toy Story 4. This movie, I think, finally explains her disappearance. Woody, again, had a prominent role in this latest adventure, and needs to save the day. I'm assuming Woody is the main character. What I didn't like about this movie is that the other characters such as Buzz, Rex, Slinky...didn't have much of a role or screen time, and were quiet in the background strangely. These are toys we all like, and would've liked to see them in action just like Woody. I know Buzz does, but in this movie, he was pretty much quiet which I found interesting. I, just like a lot of people like Buzz; in fact, Buzz happens to be my favourite character. I wished Buzz had a more prominent role, so I was disappointed by that. Again, just like with the other movies, we were introduced with new toys, but the most interesting one was ""Forky"" (nice name). In this movie, I think, it finally explains how toys come to life. Even though Buzz is my favourite character, in this movie, it was Forky who was my favourite character. I found Forky to be quite entertaining. Forky, is what made this movie interesting. Forky made me laugh when he wanted to go in the trash, but Woody wouldn't allow him to. I don't blame Forky for one moment. I could only imagine what Forky be like out in the stores today considering the way it is designed. How can people actually buy/purchase that? Toy Story 4 had its funny moments too. I like the new owner of the toys: Bonnie. I think she's a great replacement for Andy though I kind of miss Andy. The ending was interesting where Woody along with Little Bo Peep decided to say goodbye to everyone. This poses a lot of interesting questions about the future of Toy Story. Will there be a Toy Story 5? Will Woody Return? And so on. All in all, Toy Story 4 was an enjoyable movie. It's no surprise of course. Toy Story will always be about the toys or 'lost' toys especially."
"benm-41751","6","0","0","10 March 2020"," A well-done fourth installments, in every sense of the word...
","I was skeptical about the need for a fourth Toy Story movie, as the third one seemed to close the trilogy very nicely. I can't say that I feel very differently after seeing it, in fact I'd say it feels almost like a standalone movie because it doesn't carry forward any of the momentum from the first two movies. It has to create and modify characters to build a new plot, and Forky is basically a walking plot device without much real substance.<br/><br/>That said, I think Toy Story 4 was well-done. It had a cohesive storyline, the right amount of action, and lots of inventive and funny moments. The animation was beautiful, keeping the style of the original movies but sneaking in gorgeous detail with the capabilities developed since the first film.<br/><br/>However, by well-done I also mean the movie is a bit overly done... The story is sappy, moving from one introspective, sad, or happy moment to another without ever really making me feel emotionally invested.<br/><br/>So Toy Story 4 is a good movie and definitely good entertainment, but it's not great like the previous movies were. It didn't prove itself to be necessary addition at all, but it wasn't a bad one either."

There are good new characters, like Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves). But with all the good stuff, he doesn't get the emotional level of Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Woody is central to this film. But at times we miss the Woody from the previous films. Some characters, like Buzz, play a humorous role. But only at times do they get their best version.<br/><br/>In short: good film, excellent quality of animation, very good moments of humor, but you will miss the emotion of the previous parts."

","I have to admit I groaned when I saw the announcement for this movie. The ending to Toy Story 3 had been perfect. Well okay, it had the capability to induce diabetes two state lines away, but it was a good ending to the trilogy. No additional hijinks needed. But, it made a lot of money, so perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised that Disney/Pixar wanted to return to this golden egg goose.<br/><br/>But, credit where credit is due, they did a good job with this one. This is an excellent continuation to the Toy Story franchise. Love and care have obviously been spent in plentiful abundance and the people behind the story obviously wanted to make this as good as they could.<br/><br/>And I liked it. Sure, it's once again the toys trying to get home to their owner. Like in every single other Toy Story film. But once again they do something different with it. For some reason this repetitiveness doesn't bother me in this franchise unlike everywhere else.<br/><br/>The characters once again feel intriguing, familiar and achingly flawed. None of them are perfect, especially not Woody, who's once again single-mindedly bulldozing his way through emotional issues. Like in every other film, but in a different manner. Once again. How does this franchise do this? It shouldn't work.<br/><br/>I also really like Bo Peep as a returning character. Easily the MVP of the character roster.<br/><br/>So there you have it. Toy Story 4 is not only a good movie, it's actually easily on par with all the rest of the films in its franchise. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this became the favourite Toy Story film for some people."

Whew boy that is a lot of writers for this thing. It is usually not a good sign when you see that many writers are involved in a project. It is also not usually a good sign for a sequel to come after a movie that ended so perfectly. I'm talking about Toy Story 3 which had the most beautiful and perfect ending. Where do you go from there? What story is left to tell?<br/><br/>It turns out this is more story for Woody. He has always been about the other toys. At least since the ending of Toy Story one that is. He has been looking out for his kid's needs. Toy Story 4 starts out with Woody looking after Bonnie even though she has tired of him as children are wont to do. Being left out is not something that Woody is used to. He doesn't quite know how to handle it other than looking after his kid and whatever she needs. She creates a new friend named Forky who just wants to be in the trash.<br/><br/>This movie is really about thinking about the past and the choices you make and the path that leads you down. Woody finds himself with a second chance with Bo Peep. This is Woody's story. The other Toy Story movies have dealt more with an ensemble and even with Buzz and Jessie but this time this is all Woody. He begins his existential journey and I understand how bizarre that sounds when describing a family film but we are talking about Pixar. This is not that out of the ordinary. Pixar likes to make their stories have more meaning than just the surface.<br/><br/>This is also a very funny film. Forky's antics constantly trying to get himself thrown away had me laughing a few times. Duckie and Bunny are pretty funny as well but then again they are voiced by Key and Peele. Those guys are hysterical. The dummies were suitably creepy. Gabby Gabby is villainous but not quite. There are more dimensions to her than just being angry at a kid who threw her away. All these elements are in full display in this movie. It is a solid film.<br/><br/>It has the necessary moments that you've come to expect from a Pixar film. Something is missing though. It might be because of emotional resonance that the other Toy Story movies have that this one seems to lack. It tries for the romance between Woody and Bo Peep but I'm not entirely sure that made the impression on me the film might have wanted to. I can't fault Pixar for sticking to a formula with these movies but I think this is it. This series has completed its journey. There is nothing left to mine here. I give this film a B."

","A long time ago, an unknown entity pitched the idea of a 100% computer generated film and we were graced with the OG Toy Story and the birth of Pixar. Over 20 years later and Pixar has become synonymous with exceptional animated films, all thanks to the success of the original Toy Story. With 24 years to grow and develop, what have they managed to do?<br/><br/>Make the original look like utter garbage, for a start. Toy Story 4 is absolutely, undeniably gorgeous. In the opening scene alone they have managed to blow everything else away and they maintain that visual standard the whole way through. It once again proves that when it comes to animation beauty, Pixar is the bar.<br/><br/>There is no shortage of good to be said about how this movie looks, both on the big screen and now on home video. The toys and the humans are stunning. The weather and environments are incredible. It really feels like a spectacular achievement.<br/><br/>Beyond that, they've crafted a movie that checks a lot of boxes. Comedy, action, drama, heartwarming, romance and even, in a sense, horror are all present here and not just that, they're well represented.<br/><br/>It's not all positive though and as I watch this a second time I find myself noticing things I didn't before. While the overall story is strong and raises very fascinating existential questions for the toys, there are things that don't quite hold up. Woody is center stage, and that's fine, but Buzz isn't just pushed back, his character inexplicably reverts into a gullible and even stupid representation of himself that has seemingly forgotten everything he learned in the previous films. And if Buzz is regressed, Jesse is all but forgotten through the majority of this.<br/><br/>Speaking of the other films, I no longer understand the rules of this world. In all other instances, save one, when humans are around, the toys become inert. That's not the case here, they are actively moving around with large swaths of people around them and NO ONE notices them. They even manage to directly interact with things without people able to tell they're even there.<br/><br/>These are small things but I found them distracting as I watched it again and was less enveloped in how stunning it looks. As a result, my initial rating is dropping a little bit and while I originally thought this might be my new favorite in the series, it's now found itself dropping a spot or even two from that point.<br/><br/>In the end, I never wanted this movie. The third ended so beautifully that I just wanted them to leave the toys alone as a fond memory I could look back on rather than risk tarnishing them. But, even with the faults, Toy Story 4 is a wonderful and beautiful addition to a great series and it deserves to be seen. Kudos, Pixar."

","I mean it was ok not great but at least i saw the whole thing. at first i resisted from seeing this but it took a little while to eventually make a attempt to watch this. the pilot actually pretty much followed with the the whole series itself. but i still think this movie is becoming a victim of squeals just like with pretty much all pixar films. and adding slappy dolls in the mix was definitely a little odd and i believe that what really mixed up the theme in this movie. i think they tried to make the theme of this uplifting in hopes to inspire young kids and adults but when they started added all the slappy dolls it made it feel a little bit spooky for younger audiences. and clearly that wasn't the theme they were trying to reach children the the first place. and characters are very basic maybe a little bit too basic. i mean have a motorcyclist who tries to be the best that he be. and a couple of stuff animals i guess who team up with each to help and rescue their friends. and basic stuff like that. which didn't make characters that interesting or original they just kind of there because they were forced to be in the movie by Disney. which explains the the lack the energy that unfortunately when into the characters. but fortunately some of the characters actually do most the action in this. the rest weren't even saying or doing much at all. its almost like Disney slowly stops giving most of their characters their originally and enthusiasm.
some jokes in this movie worked out and some of them didn't. some of them were appealing to all ages. and some were just unthoughtful and not fully planned out. overall the story did follow with the whole series and you have this movie credit for that. i recommended giving this a try to see what you think."

","First off there are a lot of reviews giving scores of 1 and 2 out of 10 which I feel are harsh. I completely agree that this movie didn't really need to be made and its obvious it's been done to carry on cashing in on the Toy Story brand, however it still is a decent watch.<br/><br/>The animation is incredible and the way Pixar make these types of movies just seem to get better and better. Its probably the best animation I've seen in a movie<br/><br/>It's a pity that the majority of the main characters don't get much of a look in in this movie moving more towards the addition of new characters which I refer back to my cashing in comment, new characters means more merchandise, even Buzz lightyear has been reduced to a bit part character in this movie.<br/><br/>If you hadn't seen any of the other Toy Story movies then this movie would easily score 8 or 9 out of 10, however the fact it really didn't need to be made and doesn't really add anything to the 3 previous movies or make use of the original main characters only gives this an average score.<br/><br/>Whilst its good to see Woody, Buzz and the gang again, I agree with other comments saying the Toy Story franchise should have ended at Toy Story 3."

","I really enjoyed this one. I think it may be my favourite out of the four. It was a lot more smaller scale and personal. The stakes were a lot lower, the villain had solid motivations and wasn't purely evil and even reasonable at times. This film seemed like it would conclude woodys story but I didn't think they would actually have the guts to follow through with it, yet they did and the film was all the better for it. Some of it did feel a bit contrived like woody being left in the closet although that could be considered realistic as kids do forget or choose not to play with certain toys. I liked how they fleshed out bo peep, I ended up liking her more then I thought I would. But mostly I liked the whole idea of sporky. It was an interesting concept to introduce to Toy Story although its a shame the movie didn't delve deeper into the whys."

","I grew up with Toy Story and seeing this chapter of my life close is both daunting and tranquil.
Although this is not my favorite movie of the franchise, it was still emotional to watch, with Woody leaving with Bo Peep and handing over this badge. It just feels right. Through the first 3 movies, Woody was always looking out for the other toys and desire to please Andy, he never did anything fulfilling for himself. This movie was about Woody and his search for his missing void and that shows, with what little screen time the other toys had but that's okay.
Sporky was such a hassle to have around (lol), with him always calling himself trash and trying to kill himself.
Gabby Gabby's arch was evil and sad but I'm glad they didn't make her the villain. She was also trying to please her human, ala Woody and Andy, that she was willing to do anything to fill that hole in the heart. She just went about it in the wrong way.
Overall, I enjoyed the film and hope they make a 5th because I need an ending for Buzz. He was basically pushed aside the entire movie until the very end and that's just not good enough for me."

","SPOILER ALERT : If you hadn't seen the movie yet don't read this review.<br/><br/>9 years ago in 2010 was the end of what was presumed to be the last film in Toy Story franchise, which started 15 years earlier with the original film in 1995 and over a decade after the second one in 1999.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 ended on such a high note with Andy (who was the original owner of the main toy characters in the previous films) all grown up and moving on to college, so he gives up what's left of the old gang : Woody, Buzz, Jessie etc to a little girl named Bonnie (who was seen playing with Woody earlier in the film).<br/><br/>It was the perfect way to end the series in my opinion so when I heard that Pixar was making a Toy Story 4. I was against it at first, as I felt there was no way Pixar was gonna top the ending of the previous film but I was willing to give it a chance.<br/><br/>Fast forward almost 3 months after the 4th film's release and after watching it a couple of times at the movies, I thought the film was great even though in comparison to the other Toy Story movies, it's the weakest out of the bunch and this is why :<br/><br/>The good parts<br/><br/>The film began with a flashback scene to show the events that took place after Toy Story 2 but before the 3rd one in which the character Bo Peep (who was Woody's girlfriend in the earlier films) was donated after Molly (Andy's sister) outgrew her and then Woody attempts to bring her back to Andy's house but she tells him to go on without her (which sets the tone for the rest of the film when we see Bo again) so that was a nice touch by Pixar (by the way the animation is impressive).<br/><br/>The bad<br/><br/>Then we fast forward to the current timeline which takes place after Andy grew up and gave his toys away to Bonnie (including Woody) and everyone seems to be fine with it except for Woody (whose taken a backseat in Bonnie's closet) after being the main protagonist for nearly 25 years, this is what he gets ?<br/><br/>I didn't agree with how Bonnie neglects Woody for no reason and she doesn't even care about him when he gets lost, despite his attempts to make her happy with the new character Forky (who he helped create in her kindergarten orientation class).<br/><br/>Forky is the new character who is the equivalent of what Woody was to Andy, so while I wasn't happy with what they did with Bonnie's character in the 4th film, I understand why they did it but the whole ""You are a toy"" and ""the reason why you exist is to be played with"" has already been established in the old films, so I felt he was unnecessary in that case.<br/><br/>Another thing that was disappointing was how the rest of the Toy Story characters were also pushed to the sidelines in favor of the new ones, especially Buzz Lightyear who is reduced to a running gag where he can't make decisions for himself without pressing his voice commands on his chest to make the decisions for him.<br/><br/>Bo Peep has also been given a makeover, with her old white and pink polka dot dress with the bonnet replaced in favor of a blue jumpsuit with a broken cane and she is now living her life on her own terms as a lost toy without the restrictions of being stuck on a shelf for years and she encourages Woody to do the same thing (which was great) but here's the problem :<br/><br/>The plot with Bo Peep is merged with the Forky arc from earlier in the film (he is now being held hostage in an antique shop by a new toy named Gabby Gabby) who is a doll with a broken voice box who wants to be loved by a kid, so she sends a group of ventriloquist dummies to attack Woody to rip his out of him.<br/><br/>The motives behind Gabby Gabby's story are understandable but it doesn't give her the right to be selfish to pull someone else's voice box out just to make herself happy and when she finally gets the attention of the girl she wants, she doesn't even want her so what was the point ?<br/><br/>The other new characters were great additions to the Toy Story series such as Ducky and Bunny (who attack Buzz for taking his spot at the carnival) and their one liners were hilarious, Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves) the Canadian stunt toy on the motorcycle stole the show but I wish we could've seen more from the old characters.<br/><br/>So while Toy Story 4 isn't a bad film by any means, it's also not as good as the other three because of the issues with the plot and the characters, so if you want to see the movie the way it should've ended then watch Toy Story 3 and pretend this one doesn't exist."

","A much beloved childhood movie, Pixar had a lot to live up to with toy story 4. When I heard they were releasing a fourth, I had to wonder why, story wise, given the conclusive story for toy story three. After watching the movies, I have to say it did fell a bit like it had been tacked on the end of the series. However, the story line itself was entertaining, despite it being a little disappointing and a bit to 'Disney like' with its ending of all the toys being friends, and they did incorporate some more adult themes, looking at Woody trying to understand and get used to the fact that he was loved as much any more. They new characters introduced were either one dimensional or had small character arcs, but were very entertaining non the less. Overall a good movie to see for the sake of nostalgia, but not an incredibly out of this world movie."

","There's no doubt that some serious effort went in to making this film visually brilliant and they succeeded. The animation and textures are utterly incredible. The Pixar humour is excellent with some really funny moments and they're are a couple of really good new characters....
But... Why did we need yet another ""closure"" film that wraps things up once more?
Toy Story 3 delivered a warm ending where everything was aligned and it felt like a natural way to conclude the journey for the toys, but Toy Story 4 creates another new reason to generate a revised ending.
You'll enjoy the movie if you love the Toy Story recipe. You'll enjoy the movie if you love the Pixar emotional roller coaster, but all in all, you'll wonder why they made it? Then you'll see the money generated through marketing, merchandising etc and it'll be extremely obvious."

"brianjohnson-20043","7","6","20","23 June 2019"," Not a terrible film. But not in league with the first 3.
","Although I think this film is overall about a 7/10. Which is ok. I'd give Cars a 7/10 and Brave probably a 6/10. Let alone cars 2 or 3.<br/><br/>However, I really despise Pixar deciding to make Toy Story 4 given that the other 3 movies are 10/10 or maybe a 9/10 in the case of the first one. But the original Toy Story gets brownie points for being first feature length animated movie and first Pixar film. The decision to green-light this script is a 1 or 2 out of 10 decision if you ask me. Because it had the complete opposite effect of Toy Story 2 and 3. Real fans and legacies are built on quality rather than quantity.<br/><br/>The Toy Story films as a duo and trilogy seemed special because they escaped the typical sequel problem of going downhill or being redundant. (Which is especially common for kid-friendly movies)<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 and 3 were such good sequels because they didn't just seem to keep the original vision going, but also improve on, or build on the strengths of the previous films.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 has the Emily flashback sequence. Toy Story 3 has the Lotso backstory plus the poignant moment where Andy passes on his toys to Bonnie.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 has an emotional moment or two. But it doesn't have the strong central plot of the other films.<br/><br/>It took me long time to figure out what #4 specifically was lacking after I watched it, but luckily I found someone with the answer. Which is that the film doesn't seem to clearly be about one big storyline in the action packed dramatic 3rd act, like what we see in the other films.<br/><br/>What feels like the craziest most dramatic action sequence in the first 3 films is the middle of the 3rd act. (It's called the climax for a reason)<br/><br/>In Toy Story 4 what feels like the most dramatic moment is in the middle. Which is when they try and and fail to rescue Forky.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the end of the middle act, where in the first 3 pictures, the main characters learn something important and make an important pivotal decision, is instead, in Toy Story 4, placed at the very end of the 3rd act. And it just didn't feel fresh in a good way. Instead it felt a inferior, unclear and insufficient because the viewer isn't sure what the characters are fighting for in what should be the climax. And if feels it can't work as a climax yet because you're not sure yet what they're all fighting to achieve. This issue alone easily drops the film at least 2 stars.<br/><br/>I also objected a bit to some slow-paced moments in the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>The film doesn't seem to have a villain. Obviously it's good to have red herrings for the audience trying to find a villains. But generally you want there to be someone or some characteristic which is a clear source of the conflict for the protagonists. I don't know what or who that was in this film.<br/><br/>Buzz following his buttons when deciding what to do seemed contrived and like a step backward rather than forward for his character.<br/><br/>The end credits were also noticeably awkward. Why all the pauses to show credits between the clip sequences? Did anyone honestly think this new style was an improvement over the style of the end credits for Toy Story 2 or 3?<br/><br/>The strength of the film was the new and returning Bo had many funny and heartfelt moments. The score and voice acting were still top notch. Bo peep in particular was neat to see and hear once more. (Can you believe that it has been 20 years since we last heard Bo speak?) The look of the film was mostly very enjoyable too.<br/><br/>Some people were annoyed that characters like Rex, Jessie and Mr Potatohead weren't featured much. But I feel that would have made the story seem even clunkier and even harder to follow than it already was. If you stretch the viewer's attention to too many characters in a movie then there's no interesting or cogent story to be had with any of them."
"IsThatJoseph21","6","6","20","22 June 2019"," My least favorite Toy Story movie
","Before I start my review, I'll say my thoughts on the first three Toy Story movies. I consider them as my favorite animated movies. The first Toy Story's animation doesn't hold up as well today, but the script still does. Even though I've seen the movie dozens of times over the years, I still find myself enjoying it. Toy Story 2 was a great sequel that explored deeper themes, like toys getting abandoned. The older I get, the more emotional I get from watching Jessie's flashback scene. Toy Story 3 was a perfect conclusion to the series. The incinerator scene and the ending weren't the only good parts about the movie. Everything else, like the parts in the daycare, was great as well.<br/><br/>Now that I got that out of the way, I'll say my thoughts on Toy Story 4. To be honest, I was kind of let down. I wouldn't say this was a bad movie, but when compared to the first three, it just wasn't as good.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with Toy Story 4 was that most of the old gang didn't have anything to do. Instead, the movie mostly focused on the new characters, who I didn't particularly like. Personally, I thought Forky, Bunny, and Ducky were more annoying than likeable.<br/><br/>Another issue I had was the relationship between Woody and Bo Peep. I was surprised how little they interacted with each other. Because there wasn't enough time to flesh out their relationship, I found Woody's decision to stay with Bo to be sort of rushed and jarring. The idea of Woody leaving the old gang doesn't bother me. I just wished the movie had a few more scenes with Woody and Bo, so the ending can be more hard-hitting.<br/><br/>Despite my criticisms, I still had a good time with Toy Story 4. I never found myself getting bored at the movie. The film moves along at a fast-pace with very few dull moments. I also found myself laughing at a lot of the movie's jokes.<br/><br/>On a side note, the animation was really well-done. It's crazy how much CG animation improved since the first Toy Story from 1995. Toy Story 4's opening flashback in particular is a really good example of how far CG animation has gone.<br/><br/>To sum things up, Toy Story 4 was a good movie, but it was my least favorite in the Toy Story series. This movie could have been improved by focusing more on the old gang and by giving more scenes to develop Woody and Bo's relationship. At the moment, I'll give this movie a 7/10 with a mild recommendation."
"gavinp9","8","6","21","19 June 2019"," Another excellent story about life and love
","'Toy Story 4' is the sequel no-one asked for, but it is another excellent entry in the Pixar filmography - probably not quite as great as the original 'Toy Story', or the most recent 'Toy Story 3' (crazy that even it's nine years ago!), but still a great film. We're reintroduced to Woody (Hanks), Buzz (Allen) Bo Peep (Potts), Jessie (Cusak), Slinky (Clark), Rex (Shaw), Hamm (Ratzenberger) and the gang in a flashback, which sets up the film as a reunion story for Woody & Bo Peep.<br/><br/>Now that the toys are enjoying their second lease on life after Andy passed them on, Bonnie (McGraw) is ""their kid"". When she goes to kindy, she creates a new toy - Forky (Hale), which is exactly what it sounds like. When Bonnie, her parents and the toys go on a roadtrip holiday, Forky gets lost and Woody embarks on a rescue mission. This search for Forky also parallels Woody's search for relevance.<br/><br/>There's plenty of adventure and toy-action, as well as plenty of great new characters - Duke Caboom (Reeves), Ducky & Bunny (Key & Peele), Gabby (Hendricks), Giggle (Maki) - but it's hard to go past the originals & ""newer"" additions Trixie the triceratops (Schaal) & Buttercup the unicorn (Garlin), including Mr Potato Head, pieced together by previous lines from the late Don Rickles. The friendship between Woody & Buzz is still key, but not at the forefront - it's almost a ""love"" story between Woody & Bo and a father/son story between Woody & Forky. Needless to say, excellent CGI, great soundtrack and a fantastic ending."

"jnay-64150","7","4","12","26 June 2019"," Great, just not ""9 years of waiting"" great
","Good movie, I loved it, but it could have been a LOT better.<br/><br/>The plot is a bit unfocused, but given the message and moral, it's rightfully a bit more complicated than we've seen before and in that, allowable to be less focused. Forky stole the show, it would be a 4/10 without him, and Gabby Gabby's story was the best in the movie. While it's a great movie, they missed the mark on 3 things they could have done a lot better.<br/><br/>First, I hated how we didn't see much of Dolly and a lot of the crew at home while Woody and Bonnie left. We didn't see them again until the pre-credits wrap-up scenes. We needed more than 2 minutes screentime with them, Dolly had a lot of potential. Second, I hated how they dropped multiple story arcs, especially Buzz and Jessie's relationship. We waited 9 years, we deserve Spanish Buzz! To cap it all off, all the other Toy Story movies have an iconic ""playtime"" or gripping, exciting scene to kick it off. Toy Story had the original Woody vs. Potato Head bank robber scene, Toy Story 3 had a train sequence that paid homage to that, and there was the Buzz vs. Zerg video game sequence for Toy Story 2. There was nothing in Toy Story 4 like this outside of Woody's goodbye ""for now"" to Bo Peep and a mentioned ""Hat Store"" from an abandoned toy from Bonnie's closet while she was playing off screen.<br/><br/>They could have done SO much more with any of these and it wouldn't have added too much to the 1 hour 40 minute runtime, it would have built upon the previous movies instead of ditching it for a more complex story, and it would have given us loyal, patient Toy Story fans what we deserved after 9 years of waiting to see the sequel to one of the most heartbreaking, bittersweet, and emotional endings in cinema. I loved it, but we deserve better."
"MrDHWong","9","7","26","20 June 2019"," A sequel that I never knew we needed, but am definitely glad was made
","Toy Story 4 is the fourth film in the Toy Story series and Pixar's 21st film overall. Directed by Pixar storyboard artist Josh Cooley and featuring the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, it is a sequel that I never knew we needed, but am definitely glad was made.<br/><br/>Two years after the events of Toy Story 3, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz (voiced by Tim Allen), and the rest of Andy's former toys have adjusted to their new lives with their current owner Bonnie. However, over time, Bonnie has neglected playing with Woody in favour of the other toys, and this causes him to reminisce over his old friend Bo Peep (voiced by Annie Potts), who was sold off to a mysterious buyer several years ago. One day, Bonnie brings home a new toy she made out of a plastic spork named Forky (voiced by Tony Hale), who believes that being played with is not his purpose but instead is merely ""trash"". After Forky and the rest of the toys are taken on a roadtrip with Bonnie and her family, Forky runs away and it is up to Woody to find him before Bonnie discovers he is lost.<br/><br/>As heartfelt as its predecessors, Toy Story 4 is one of the greatest unexpected sequels ever conceived and adds so much more to its already long lasting legacy. Just because the toys' time with Andy is over, does not mean that there aren't any more stories to be expanded upon. Anybody who thought Toy Story 3 could not be topped with its touching ending needs to think again. This ending was so poignant that it reportedly reduced Tom Hanks and Tim Allen to tears while they were recording for Woody and Buzz, respectively, and it is easy to see why after watching. The vocal performances of these two veterans certainly hasn't dulled over the past 24 years and they sound as lively as ever, alongside newcomers to the series. This film also features the vocal talents of comedians Key & Peele as the hilarious stuffed toy duo Ducky and Bunny, who provide some great comic relief, as well as Keanu Reeves voicing Duke Caboom, a toy Canadian stuntman struggling with his own personal insecurities. In addition to all this, the beautiful animation and use of colour truly shines this time around and it shows how far Pixar have come since their feature film debut with the original Toy Story back in 1995. Will there be a Toy Story 5 in the near future? As this film has proven, we just may end up needing one after all.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10"

","""... Toy Story 4 is a near perfect entry in one of the strongest animated franchises of all time"" 9/10<br/><br/>Toy Story is a series of Pixar animated films that have been entertaining audiences of all ages for over 20 years. These films have consistently been on the cutting edge of animation, full of charming characters and fun stories. With each film, the stories have become more and more emotional, dealing with the existential crisis of toys and their purpose. Pushing these themes further than ever, Toy Story 4 is a near perfect entry in one of the strongest animated franchises of all time.<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>In this film, the story more heavily revolves around Woody than in previous entries. He still struggles to move on from Andy, and because of this he projects his loyalty onto Bonnie.<br/><br/>When Bonnie makes Forky during her preschool orientation, Woody immediately notices how much Forky means to her. He becomes determined to a fault to keep Bonnie and Forky together. Things become complicated when Forky tries to run away during a family road trip, and Woody chases after him. When Woody gets sidetracked looking for Bo Peep, who was separated from the group years before, the rest of the gang begin to look for him and Forky. What follows is zippy adventure with fun action sequences, lots of laughs, and most importantly, a lot of heart.<br/><br/>Many new toy characters are introduced, all of which are funny and entertaining. It's very hard not to smile just from the sheer amount of charm in the entire cast of characters, both old and new. The humor is as goofy and hilarious as ever, especially with the new character Forky, voiced by Tony Hale. His existential nightmare causes all sorts of antics, and his childlike worldview is endearing and unique.<br/><br/>One minor drawback is that we don't get a lot of screen time with some classic characters such as Rex, Slinky, and Jessie. A large number of toys are left to sit in an RV for most of the movie, while Buzz and Woody run around with new characters. But this is a minor complaint when what we do get is so much fun.<br/><br/>While the plot does rehash some ideas from previous films, what makes this story work so well is its strong emotional core. Woody learns to let go of the past, accept that his life as a child's toy is over, and begin to pursue the life he really wants.<br/><br/>The voice performances are top notch all around, giving this movie a lot of personality and charm. The animation is vibrant, detailed, and beautifully rendered. Overall, this is a top-of-the-line animated film, and it delivers just about everything you could want from a Toy Story sequel.<br/><br/>9/10"

Buzz's side plot doesn't even make sense nor is it resolved (Hopefully, it's not set up for a 5th installment). We learned in the beginning of Toy Story 2 that Bo Peep was sold at a garage sale. But at the beginning of Toy Story 4 it shows Bo being given away after interacting with Jesse, who doesn't join the gang until the end of Toy Story 2. Ultimately, this retcon doesn't change anything but it does reflects the lazy incoherence of the EIGHT writers. Various moments throughout the film feel disjointed from the rest of the movie. Still, it has plenty of funny moments and action sequences to make it worth seeing. However, it fails to live up to the franchise."

","Yes this movie has a fun and heart touching story, but if we're talking about the most impressive aspect the it would be how beautiful and realistic the animation to this movie is.<br/><br/>Pixar Studios have certainly come along way with how realistic and detailed their movies look. The textures and reflection looked as if the makers were filming legitimate objects, it's that good.<br/><br/>For me, it goes:<br/><br/>1. Toy Story 2
2. Toy Story

"AdrenalinDragon","7","5","18","21 June 2019"," Good, but underwhelming compared to the other Toy Story movies
","The Toy Story movies have always had a special place in my heart. I grew up with them from the very beginning as a kid and they've always been movies I re-watched plenty of times. Being very satisfied with how Toy Story 3 concluded everything, I was a little reluctant on wondering how they could pull off another Toy Story movie without it feeling pointless. Needless to say, Toy Story 4 sort of works I guess? It's not boring and still entertaining, but I don't know by the end of it I just sort of felt a little underwhelmed I guess? It's nice for Toy Story 4 to bring back old characters like Bo Peep and change things up a little following the new toy owner Bonnie instead of Andy, but I don't know I just didn't find the final result as satisfying to watch as the first three movies for some reason.<br/><br/>That's not to say Toy Story 4 is a complete waste of time or is bad. Definitely not at all. It focuses almost entirely on Woody and the other characters, including Buzz Lightyear himself, are mostly placed in the back-burner in favour of Bo Peep and the other new characters such as Forky, Ducky, Gabby Gabby, Bunny, and Duke Caboom. One thing that I seemed to notice in Toy Story 4 was that it definitely wasn't nearly as funny as the first three movies. Forky gets a few good moments, as well as Ducky and Bunny mostly being there for Comic Relief more than anything else, but surprisingly from Woody and the main gang? It definitely felt more lacking to me personally. The theme of toys deciding what to do with their own lives and not sticking to normality is certainly one of the more interesting elements of the movie, but the execution of how these events play out to me felt a bit messy in places and there were some contrivances and out of character moments throughout the movie that bugged me.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, whether the movie decides to focus on Forky or Bo Peep, things start to get a bit chaotic with how the plot is structured and there didn't feel like there was really any stakes to the story at all. The ""Toy Rules"" are really loose here and it takes alot of suspension of disbelief to see toys running around a carnival with no people caring about it at all. The antagonists themselves have good character moments and Duke Kaboom is probably the best new character in Toy Story 4. Bonnie herself is a bit of a bland toy owner compared to Andy, but thankfully she doesn't get too much time just spent on her alone. There are decent emotional parts throughout the movie that worked and I mostly like how it all concludes, but it makes me question if Pixar are going to be milking more Toy Story movies by this point. The animation is top notch as usual, as well as the voice acting from the main cast and all the new characters too.<br/><br/>Overall, Toy Story 4 is fine and not the worst outcome by a long shot, but it's also nothing amazing either. Honestly, I don't think there's anywhere else for these movies to go by this point. Just leave the series on a good note and in case you were disappointed or underwhelmed by Toy Story 4, you could always pretend Toy Story 3 is the real conclusion to the series and consider this an epilogue.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"Lost_In_Translation_","9","7","29","20 June 2019"," Most fun adventure they've been on yet!
","I like many many other people thought the announcement of a 4th movie was a bad idea. It seemed like Disney forcing Pixar to churn out another one after the 3rd made 400 million at the domestic box office. The 3rd one closed out the series in a spectacular fashion. I was skeptical, but the creative team behind it seemed pretty damn stellar.<br/><br/>Safe to say, this movie turned out quite fantastically! I thought I would hate Forky, but he's honestly one of the best parts about it. The return of Bo Peep is fantastic and it is really cool to see how she turned out. The villain has a nice a refreshing twist, especially for someone who is getting tired of movies ""needing"" villains. The Key & Peele duo characters are probably the weakest as they have a really unfunny recurring joke, but they don't ruin the little bit they are in it. Yes, Keanu Reeves continues to be awesome and especially in this!<br/><br/>Only time will tell, but this might be the best of the movies? The first two have their legacy behind them, so it's hard to top that. I loved 3 and it's ending, but I think the story in this one might top it overall. Either way, it's just as good as the rest, but I think it's story out does them all. It's so well written and they really did a great job with the new characters.<br/><br/>As always the animation is top notch. The backgrounds in this look so realistic and it is mind blowing looking at TS1 compared to this and how far 25 years of animation perfection have happened. Where in the AWFUL Good Dinosaur the backgrounds were so perfect that the cartoon dinosaurs didn't fit in it, TS4 really does a good job of meshing the cartoony aspect of the characters with the superbly detailed settings. There are moments of setting that you would just say they are real if you saw a photo of them.<br/><br/>Pixar goes to show that even if they are influenced to make a sequel, they will still knock it out of the park and bring a meaningful story. Incredibles 2 was a godsend, and Finding Dory was pretty fantastic as well. They've had some really poor sequels like Monsters U and the Cars series, but with the right creative team they could still make a story worth telling with characters we've loved since we were kids.<br/><br/>It's great to see their next two projects are original, but I wouldn't mind some more sequels if they keep being as damn good as stuff like Toy Story 4 is! They may falter here and there, but every Pixar movie is worth taking the time to see...even if they end up being wastes of time like The Good Dinosaur."
"dcarroll74","1","3","9","7 February 2020"," The Worst Ever
","I am a pensioner, who grew up with Toy Story, just to keep apace with my grandchildren. 1 to 3, so far so good. This pile of steaming (you know what), destroyed the franchise. The only saving grace is. 1 to 3 are still around, and are as good as they ever where. Let's hope there isn't a 5th. that would definitely rub salt into the wound, created by greed. I won't apologise for any spelling or grammatical errors, it has become the norm in today's society, much like bottom feeding movie sequels, which unfortunately, this long awaited sequel, has become.

"mariabarqawi","10","3","9","15 July 2019"," Great for both kids and adults! Highly recommend it!
","Now of course animation movies are not just for kids, but the reason my title says it's also great for adults is that this movie carries more than just laughs and giggles. You'd have to be mature enough to understand its wisdom and the lessons it protrudes.
One of this movie's many wisdoms that stuck with me is learning that love is not superficial. We can see it when Bonnie favors relatively ugly Forky to the other toys. But the prime example is Gabby Gabby. A beautiful doll designed and wishing to be a little girl's partner in afternoon tea, picnics, bedtime and other activities. The little girl she wants to be with is Harmony, but she's too afraid to approach her because she fears rejection due to her damaged voice box. After spending so much time and energy and trying all the tactics, she finally manages to convince Woody to give her his voice box. Now she waits to be picked up by Harmony and when that happens and Harmony pulls the string and hears her 'perfect' voice the little girl seems to admire the doll for a fleeting moment, but ends up throwing her into a box because she's not interested. Having gone so far to attract Harmony and failed, Gabby Gabby is devastated. Later in the movie a lost girl picks her up and feels safer with her and we conclude that Gabby Gabby has finally found someone who loves her. Moral of Gabby Gabby's story is don't despair and cross mountains and oceans for someone who in the end might not pay you the slightest amount of attention and don't distance yourself from the outside world due to grief and fear of not being 'enough'. By locking yourself up and lingering on the past you have no chance at all, but by moving forward you might actually find what works for you.
Another wisdom is learnt from Duke Caboom's past. When we see that he was a disappointment for his kid just because he wasn't as perfect as advertised we realize that nobody is actually as perfect as the models in the magazines and the superheroes in movies. We all have flaws and if you expect utter perfection from every person you meet then you'll surely be disappointed.
Wisdom put aside, this movie is also a great watch!!!!!!!! Highly recommend it!!!"

I may be 44 years old, but it put tears in my eyes!!<br/><br/>It was the perfect ending to probably one of the best family film franchises ever.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how they can follow on with a Toy Story 5, but I hope they do!"

","At first when I heard Pixar was making Toy Story 4, I groaned. The first posters didn't excite me but the trailers had me intrigued. It wasn't until I saw the first 15 minutes at CinemaCon that I realized that Disney and Pixar had another masterpiece in the making. I saw the first Toy Story at the drive in when I was 7. I remember being so exited for (to my knowledge at the time) the first all computer animated film. I loved it. Toy Story 2 was another masterpiece. I have to admit that I didn't much care for 3. But now with Toy Story 4, it made me feel like a kid again. This movie is the reason why Pixar makes some of the best animated movies out there. Not only will the kids love it, the parents will too. It doesn't lean to hard either way. It has a perfect balance of very tame adult humor and a great story with characters that your children will be sure to love. The true theme of the movie is Purpose. What are we here for? What are our options in life other than the options chose for us? What is best for us in life, what we want or what we need? These and more are the many questions explored in this movie. This reminded me of why I loved Toy Story in the first place. The old characters that really get their time to shine are Woody, Buzz, and returning to the franchise Bo Peep and her sheep. The only tiny complaint that I have is that some of our fan favorites like Jessie, Rex, Slink, Bullseye and Potato head are mostly sidelined to make room for new characters. I also actually loved the new additions. Forky, ducky, bunny, Duke Kaboom, Gabby Gabby, & Giggle McDimples were fantastic. The ending will leave you very emotional and with a sense of finality. This is a great way to end the series and I hope that if they choose to return that they meet it with this level of a story. I highly recommend for everyone of any age. I warn you though, it will make you want to dig out some of your old toys and bring tissues. 10/10"
"josiahliljequist","7","7","30","19 June 2019"," A great addition to the franchise
","I'm gonna start off by saying I'm a huge Toy Story fan, and I grew up with the original trilogy....so I was a little concerned about how this one would (or wouldn't) fit in. Rest assured that it does not ruin the first three, but only adds another chapter in the life of these toys. The animation is top notch, and the new characters are funny and well thought out. I was a little disappointed with the lack of screen time for the original posse, but it was understandable considering the story and the additions. But what made me think that this film is a worthwhile addition is that it keeps the heart and integrity of the trilogy without sacrificing the laughs. I chuckled and almost teared up(I don't cry at movies lol) and that's all you can ask for from a Toy Story film:)"
"patriotdreams","10","2","5","18 October 2019"," Absolutely Marvelous
","Reading through all the criticism it seems to generally add up to these issues for everyone:
1-It didn't go the way they wanted it to.
2-It wasn't like the other movies.
3-The ending was sad.<br/><br/>All three of those actually contributed to me loving the movie. I disagree wholeheartedly that the ending was totally sad. Their was definitely some serious sadness that an era was ending but I found myself also celebrating the new beginning for some characters. The animation was the best I've ever seen in a movie and the bar is now set extremely high (as per usual with Pixar). Was this movie necessary? No, but what movie is? (I've never understood that argument). I thought 3 (still my favorite in the saga) wrapped up things perfectly but that just made 4 a pleasant surprise. To each his own, but my wife and I loved it and so did our kids!"
"pilot1009","8","2","5","16 October 2019"," A good finale
","Probably not popular to some, but I found this a well executed finale to the Toy Story series. The plot diverges from the previous stoy lines but wraps up the theme pretty well. It is not what you expect of the series however and if you want a remix repeat of the previous 3 stories you are probably going to be disappointed. Well done to the writers for having the courage to move the story on."
"RyaanKiing","7","2","5","15 October 2019"," Not needed but still a good show
","Well, I'll be honest, I never thought I'd be reviewing a new toy story film. I'm sure a few people are with me with saying that they believed number three was the end... I guess that wasn't the case. I went into this with no real expectations as it baffled me why they made a new one after ending the third one so well, I'm glad I did this though as I love when a film surprises me. Oh, and before I go into points of interest, it should go without saying if you haven't seen the other three, what's wrong? Go and find them, watch them then come back.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 does an amazing job of letting the new characters take centre stage, we get to see a wide range of new and fascinating toys that each have their own separate personalities. The older toys do return as they should but most only play supporting roles pushing emphasis on the newer characters for the newer generation, this is a good thing! The older generation can enjoy the returning characters but their kids are going to love the new toys. Returning characters are voiced by the same actors/actresses so do not fear, everything is the same.<br/><br/>Very few films can hold the trophy of keeping me grinning ear to ear through at least 75% of their duration. Toy Story 4 excels at doing this. The balance of humorous scenes between adult humour and child humour is outstanding. Not sure how Toy Story does it every time but they really know how to keep adults entertained just as well as children. You will laugh, do not worry, you will laugh and smile.<br/><br/>Can we just talk about how far animation and detailing has come? I mean jeez, it can actually be scary how good this film looks. Shadows, lighting and water effects are insane in Toy Story 4. The bench has now been set, I'm sure this will be broken in years to come but well done to everyone that worked on Toy Story 4. Fantastic job.<br/><br/>The only downside I had with Toy Story 4 and not much of one anyway, I just don't understand why this got made. I did thoroughly enjoy it and am recommending you catch this while it's in cinemas or at least buy the Blu-Ray. However, Toy Story 3 ended immensely well, wrapping everything up perfectly. I just feel like they used this to pull in some serious cash and that's it. The ending is good in this but I don't think anything will beat Toy Story 3. Good thing for us it turned out to be a great watch or that would have been painful to witness.<br/><br/>Here's another point to throw at you, please don't bring a newborn baby into the cinema. Obviously, this is a kids movie and kids are fully expected to be there but a newborn?! they have no clue what's going on?! Even some of the kids were getting cranky over this.<br/><br/>Forgot to mention... you know Keanu Reeves is in this? Cause he damn well is and it's brilliant. Keep an eye out for his character!"

","Ok so I understand these 1 star and 2 stars reviews and how they think their childhood is ruined, cause when I was watching the movie it didn't feel like the masterpiece the last installment was because the 3rd movie is still the best in the series and this one, in your first watch doesn't feel like a Toy Story movie. Some people may think that the villain was weak compared to Lots-o and I agree, but they did something different with the villain this time!<br/><br/>But still, if you put you negative thoughts away and watch the movie again you realize it wasn't waste of time or a ""bad"" toy story at all, it wasn't just another movie about toys and their adventures because they actually did something with their characters, they didn't just made a movie about a new made up toy and how Woody is gonna save him and keep him with Donnie and in the end the villain is defeated and the gang is back together and it's all good.<br/><br/>If you watch the movie again you realize they've been setting the Woody departure
from the beginning and it's a good character development because the character can move on now instead of doing the same thing for 4 movies just tossing to another baby's arms. So if you thing the departure was forced and uncalled for, watch the movie again and you'll see the whole movie was about this. If the ending didn't happen and it was like the other installments I wouldn't have given this a 8 because the movie would've been unnecessary and uncalled for.<br/><br/>But they developed the character of Woody to the next level, they Did something new with character! as for the villain I think it would've been better if they included more evil scenes with her and her terrifying henchmen but still I like what they did with the villain, you might think it's a little bit anticlimactic but if they did the same thing to her as they did with Lots-o, then what's the point? You want to see the same movie again?<br/><br/>I agree with the people who are saying that the trilogy was perfect and didn't need a forth one but the ending makes up for it being unnecessary because the main character moves on to the next chapter and isn't stuck in this endless loop.<br/><br/>The characters of Key & Peele in this movie were hilarious and they didn't ruin the movie at all. Duke Caboom was also a good character.<br/><br/>The cinematography was amazing, there's no camera in making of this movie but it's made the way that you think that they actually did capture it on a camera.<br/><br/>Now I'm gonna talk about some thing that I didn't like about this movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>Donnie all of a sudden doesn't even acknowledge Woody and doesn't care about him anymore.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There's not a lot of Woody and Buzz scenes and this being the last movie Woody is with the gang I didn't like that there wasn't much scene with these two together.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They could've develop the villain more. As I said the 3rd one was a masterpiece and of course they can't top Lots-o but I expected a little more.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The story of the whole Forky and the antique store was kinda not engaging and urgent like the last movie where all those familiar characters where stuck in the kindergarten. But you can understand why Woody wanted to keep Forky safe for Donnie. BUT ALL OF THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED IF DONNIE JUST PLAYED WITH THE DAMN WOODY.</li></ul>"

","The Toy Story movies have always had a high standard. It's a real challenge to keep that up for three movies. But Pixar did. So when Toy Story 4 was announced I had my doubts. Was there room for a fourth movie? Will it be as entertaining as the previous ones? I mean, Cars 2 and Cars 3 where not as good as the first one. Would Toy Story face the same fate in his fourth installment?<br/><br/>Today I saw Toy Story 4. And my doubts where gone fast. Pixar did it again.<br/><br/>First of all the graphics. The renders look incredibly realistic. Rain, dirt, grass, it all looks amazing. And still it keeps the charm of an animation movie. Can't beat them there.<br/><br/>But all tough the graphics can be good, a movie falls or stand with a good story. And that is what Pixar made. A compelling story that is moving and compelling.<br/><br/>And of course the characters. Next to the good old characters we know and love Pixar introduces new ones. And that keeps the movie fresh.<br/><br/>There is great humor. I really laughed out loud a few times and I hardly do that with movies.

","I was certain in my believe that TS4 would be a horrible misstep, following the beloved original trilogy! (And to be honest I wasn't really as mad-keen on TS3 either!) As such, I really wasn't fussed that due to holidays and work trips it's been out a month before I've seen it. But how wrong I was! Pixar have really done it again and pulled a gem out of the bag.<br/><br/>There is more emotional heft in the pre-titles sequence of this film that in many so-called dramas I have seen this year. It's extraordinary how nuanced the animation has become.<br/><br/>I guess it should come has no surprise, that the animation quality has improved: the original Toy Story came out nearly 25 years ago! The pre-title sequence, and the opening titles (flashing back to the glory days of playtime with Andy), allow you to compare and contrast the then and now animation quality. I remember being completely wowed by the photo-realism of the people in the Pixar original. But now that looks like Etch-a-Sketch compared to the quality of the latest installment.<br/><br/>Furthermore the camera can zoom and soar around the scenes at will, illustrating that Moore's Law for computing power pretty much holds true!<br/><br/>The Plot: Buzz and Woody's new owner, Bonnie, is starting kindergarten and in so doing she brings a new toy - Forky, the spork - into existance. Forky is suicidal in not yet understanding his place in the 'circle of life'. When the family go off in their RV (""Damned Renault!!"" - yes, I had a few of them!) Woody has his work cut out in keeping Forky out of the recycling!<br/><br/>They stop over in a small town, where the roving funfair has also stopped. During the visit, Woody gets reintroduced to an old romantic acquaintance - Bo Peep. However, he also has to confront a smiling face of deceit. No, this time not Lotso Huggin Bear, but instead the talking doll Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), who is supported by her scary looking henchmen.<br/><br/>Most of the old crew are along for the ride. (The late Don Rickles part as Mr Potato Head had to come from archive audio clips). This time though the film seems to revolve around a pretty small subset of the toys. The likes of Slinky, Hamm, Rex and the Potato Heads get relatively little screen-time.<br/><br/>However, what we do get is the introduction of some wonderful new characters. This includes diminutive cop Giggle McDimples (voiced by Lori Alan); the hilarious Bunny and Ducky (voiced respectively by Jordan Peele - yes! Jordan Peele! - and Keegan-Michael Key); Combat Carl(s) (voiced by Carl - ""Apollo Creed"" - Weathers); and foremost of all Duke Kaboom! Duke, a self-doubting Canadian Evel Knievel-style stunt-rider action figure, is voiced in enthusiastic style by Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Tim Allen again are the film's heart and soul. Buzz has a somewhat lesser role to play this time, but Hanks is as great as he's ever been voicing Woody.<br/><br/>And it shows how loved this film series is. Talent just queues up to say just a single line! Well, how can you say no to being part of film history? Aside from those mentioned above, the film boasts lines from Timothy Dalton; John Ratzenberger; Annie Potts; Jay Hernandez; Joan Cusack; Wallace Shawn; Laurie Metcalf; Carol Burnett; Carl Reiner; Bill Hader; Patricia Arquette; and even the great Mel Brooks.<br/><br/>Pixar has to work for young kids and it does. I took my four year old grandson to see it and he enjoyed it. (More importantly, he sat through the lot without a wee!). There are a few mildly scary bits for very young children. My Frankie took it all in his stride. After being suitably spooked by Anthony Hopkins in ""Magic"" in 1978, Gabby Gabby's ""heavies"" were far more concerning to me in any case!<br/><br/>But there is much for adults to love as well. In terms of comedy there are many laugh-out-loud moments: a Combat Carl left repeatedly 'hanging'; Buzz's ""inner voice""; Bunny and Ducky's imagined plans; and all of Duke Kaboom's scenes. And as with previous films, there are moment where the script plumbs new depths of emotion. These are friendships between bits of plastic, but they are friendships that have been lived through our childrens' lives. As such, emotions run deep at the end of the film and I defy anyone not to be fighting back tears at the closing scene.<br/><br/>As always, there are Pixar Easter Eggs to be found in the film, In this case, a HUGE number, especially within the Antique Shop scenes. Items are there from every Pixar film, including from the Pixar shorts (Tinny from ""Tin Toy""'s there, for example). (There's some pointers for more to spot from the article here, but I'm sure that is just the tip of the iceberg.)<br/><br/>Directed by Josh Cooley (as his first feature!), it's a masterpiece, and cements itself firmly in my films of the year list.<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."

"lukem-52760","10","2","5","10 July 2019"," BEAUTIFUL, SAD, EMOTIONAL & MAGICAL!!! A LOVELY FILM & ANOTHER MASTERPIECE!!! VERY SPECIAL.
","WOW how far Toy Story has come!!!
I've grown up with these film's the same as Andy grew up with his Toys about the same time & age, so this franchise & it's wonderful characters mean so much to me, as i really did grow up with them, ""Toy Story"" was such a big part of my childhood that it's had a huge impact on me & as an adult (A 35yr old man) i feel attached to that little gang a good-hearted Toys!!!
I'm very emotionally invested in this beautiful franchise of fantasy & magic.
It's a lovely Nostalgic comfort hearing the great voice of movie legend ""Tom Hanks"" back as Woody, i love Hanks & i know he's more loved now for his brilliant serious performances but to me it was his funny & goofy roles that have always stayed with me from such CLASSIC 80's films as ""Dragnet 1987"" & ""The 'Burbs 1989"" both huge films to me growing up in the 90's as i constantly watched these two on video over & over again, then came the first Toy Story in 1995 & blew me away & those three ""Hanks"" movies are so special to me & each has a special spot in my heart as well as on my all time favourite movies list.<br/><br/>Toy Story '95 was way,way ahead of it's time & blew me away with it's ground-breaking animation & Amazing characters.
Woody was always my favourite & I've watched him grow as a thinking, good hearted character through the films.
All 4 movie's are instant CLASSIC's & that's special for a franchise!!!
Toy Story 3 was BEAUTIFUL, i was an emotional wreck by the end of that & it ended perfectly.<br/><br/>But here we are back again for Toy Story 4 & it's ok because the film is absolutely Brilliant & is the most visually stunning of the whole franchise!!!
It's lovely to see our old friends again, the Gang are back & a few new characters are introduced.
The animation has advanced to perfection.
This story is about woody really & how he feels lost & not needed anymore, it's handled beautifully & touching, Toy Story 4 is the most grown-up & most serious of the series & often creepy & a mood of sadness hangs over the movie.
Toy Story 4 brings back Bo peep & tells her story as well as tell woody's dilemma & introduces a new character for the gang called ""Forky""
There's a sweet love story in here too, Woody & Bo Peep & it's beautiful, i was an emotional wreck at the end as it's really saying goodbye to this wonderful franchise we all grew up loving, a masterpiece movie & my favourite of the franchise.
I do really appreciate the darker & creepier tone to this sequel, at times with the creepy ventriloquist dummies in the old antiques store, it's like stepping into ""Goosebumps"" territory with ""Slappy"" it's got an old school Nostalgic Horror quality & i loved it.<br/><br/>There's a few little stories entwined together but mainly this is Woody's story & his movie.
There's some fun stuff here, mostly with Woody trying to look after forky like a father & his kid.
The basic story is the gang of Toys go on a road trip with Bonnie & her parents & end up meeting some strange characters at a fun fare & old antique shop.
There's a sense of something big is gonna happen in it's atmosphere whenever woody is on screen, There's a change coming & you can feel it.<br/><br/>I felt Toy Story 4 was also the darkest of the franchise, it dealt with real emotion coming from Woody.
Woody feels so lost & lonely, he doesn't feel wanted anymore & doesn't have a purpose anymore!!!
He doesn't get played with & is feeling the loss.
What do Toys do when they don't have an owner anymore?
What do they do if they never get played with?
There's some emotional questions for the toys.
Woody also acts like a father figure to Forky which is funny & touching at the same time!!!
This sweet heart-felt movie has so much beautiful little moments & scenes, it's a special film in an outstanding franchise & i would say part 4 is the best & is on a different level in some respects.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is another beautiful film in the outstanding franchise, it's beautiful to look at & full of emotion.
If you grew up watching & loving these films then part 4 will hit you hard at the end!!!
Now this great film part 4 didn't need to be made, as part 3 ended beautifully but I'm so glad this got made because it really does carry on the story to another logical conclusion & still with an impactful ending that is both very sad & at the same time very sweet, it will bring tears to the eyes.<br/><br/>The new characters are fun with the likes of ""Bunny"" ""Ducky"" & ""Forky"" & some other's but those 3 stand out the most & have the most to do.
""Gabby Gabby"" the old doll is a sort of villain type with a sad story & there's some creepy ventriloquist dummies that are her henchmen.
The big old Antique shop setting is stunning in it's look & detail, There's such an exciting old style atmosphere whenever the Toys are there.<br/><br/>Like part 3, this film has a big heart & emotional scenes that made me cry like a baby!!!
I think this is my favourite of the franchise? Or maybe that's because it's so fresh & new? But it is excellent even though the original Toy gang all take a back seat for this film, even Buzz is basically a minor character here but it's ok because this film gives us so much else to focus on.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is an instant CLASSIC.
I absolutely loved watching this with my wife & kids who all loved it.
A lovely & bittersweet ending to an incredible franchise that is loved so much, especially by me.
I've loved all these films & it's one beautiful epic fantasy franchise."

","Toy Story 4 is a movie filled with absolute joy. I love the first three films of course and part 4 was a sequel no one asked for ever because Toy Story 3's end was phenomenal and perfect for the series but of course they still had money and put some stuff together and wow. The characters are amazing as always and the new characters made me laugh my butts off in the theaters. I swear I was dying of laughter. Especially when the Bunny and Ducky characters first came in they were so so funny. Forky was absolutely a loveable and hysterical character. He was a character who thought his whole life is trash and everytime he said the word ""Trash"" and tried to throw himself out I was laughing out loud. Also they bring back Bo Peep after not having her in a movie for about 20 years and its awesome.<br/><br/>Overall, Toy Story 4 is a masterpiece but is it the best one? No. Toy Story 3 is that best one but is Toy Story 4 worth it? Yes absolutely and definitely check it out. Hopefully this is the last one because I don't think they should make another. Being a Toy Story fan since I was like practically born, I say this was a perfect movie in every way. To Infinity And Beyond."
"kristatrochei","6","2","5","10 July 2019"," Good but not the best.
","This movie got to take you into a deeper look of Bo Peeps life and how Woody truly felt towards her. It was a good movie just I wasn't too pleased with the ending. For me, Toy Story ended in the third movie, because it just had a more satisfying feel to it. In this movie we see Bonnie who completely neglects Woody which was a huge disappointment, especially after seeing in the third movie how in love she was with him, how she loved and played with every toy and how she agreed to take very good care of him. We got to see very little of the gang and toys that we all know and love. Instead it was more about new characters and their story. In the first three movies we got to see Woody and the gang fight to be together and to remain together as a family, no matter the circumstances but in this movie I wasn't very pleased with Woody staying behind. Overall, this movie was good just not as good as the third one was."

"wackywhovian11","6","2","5","3 July 2019"," Good but not great
","Look I love Toy Story films, always have and always will except this one. sorry Disney but you should have stopped at the 3rd one. Toy Story 3 was an perfect ending to the series. You didn't need a 4th one. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it. I did like it very much but usually when I see a Toy Story film I admittedly want to go back to the theater and see the film again but sorry not this film.
What this film is about without giving too much away because I don't do spoilers is Woody feels unwanted and unneeded by Bonnie is new owner because Andy is off to college and living his life. Bonnie is starting Kindergarten and Woody wants to protect her on journey to school and he sees these kids being mean to her so he grabs some materials for her so she can make a best friend named Forky who in all honestly is a bit mental but it's fine because Woody is like a big brother to him. Basically the film takes a weird turn when the family decides to go on a trip that Summer and a lot of weird stuff happens that I can't really talk about because I don't want to ruin it for you guys. But we do find out what happened to Bo-Peep and that was sort of nice to see what happened to her.
Should you see this film? Umm I guess so if you children they'll enjoy it but adults might find it okay but it's not like the other Toy Story films but hey that's just me. Normally the other films I saw in the theater I wanted to see the film again but not this film. I'll use my money for The Lion King and Spiderman Far From Home. Will I buy the film on Blu-ray when it's out? Probably to add to my collection because I have the other films. I did enjoy the new characters Ducky and Bunny but all the scenes you saw in the theater they saw in the clips on Twitter or in the commercials so you can just watch those on YouTube if you wanted to."
"cardsrock","10","2","5","3 July 2019"," Never doubt Pixar
","Given the near perfect ending of Toy Story 3, I didn't want this franchise to be touched ever again. I am happy to say Pixar managed to craft a more than worthy story for this fourth film and an ending that fits just as well as a goodbye to these characters. This might be the funniest Toy Story film with hilarious jokes and gags lovingly sprinkled throughout. The new characters are all terrific and brilliantly brought to life by greats such as Key and Peele, as well as Keanu Reeves (firmly in the midst of his Keanussaince).<br/><br/>It's hard to emphasize the amount of love and care that went into making this film. You can tell that the creators didn't want to tarnish this franchise's legacy, but instead enhance it. Toy Story 4 is funny, profound, emotionally resonant, and a perfect cap to arguably the most consistently excellent franchise in film history."

","This is by far the worst toy story film. Toy story has always made me leave the theater thinking ""wow what a great experience. This made me leave thinking ""meh"". Toy story 3 had the PERFECT ending and they decided they needed to make this. The thing that kept me intrested in 4s plot was woody and that's about it. Some other new interesting toys also helped with this. Most of the characters we know and love really don't have any screen time besides buzz and woody. The so called enemy of the story was really bad and I didn't really find that storyline interesting at all. The ending left me with a big ?. Woody talks about in the movie how he always remains loyal to the children that have owned him specifically Andy. I guess all the loyalty just gets thrown out the window when he stays at the carnival. Woody has known the other characters longer then bo peep and should care more for them. Overall it was enjoyable but I would wait to see this if it's on Redbox. By far the worst Pixar movie in a while."

Slightly unmet expectations aside, it's still very fun (the action set pieces are great), very funny, and very well-animated.

Tony Hale as Forky is so fun and all of the characters are played and acted well. Fun animation and characters. Duke Kaboom played by Keanu Reeves, Bunny played by Jorden Peele and Ducky played by Keegan Michael-Keys were all so funny. Annie Potts returned as Bo Peep and the whole movie was just so fun.

Such a beautiful story of friendship, sacrifice, selflessness, and perseverance. Pixar continues to be ahead of the curve in telling stories in a profound way that ultimately matter to humanity. I am so glad they made this movie. It was funny, charming, and by the end you couldn't help but have a smile on your face while being incredibly moved.

Forky in particular was very well done.<br/><br/>Now- for the ending. The moment when Gabby Gabby finds a child to love her was genuinely heartfelt and on par with the philosophical moments each toy story movie has given us about the purpose of a toy. However, Woody leaving Bonnie came out of nowhere and didn't make sense. The entire purpose of Toy Story 3 was to prove that for Woody, a life with Buzz and the gang was better than one with grown up Andy, and this ending subverts all of that. It felt like Pixar was trying so hard to get emotion out of its viewers that it went against how hardcore fans know Woody would act.<br/><br/>This movie was honestly very well done, but the arcs for all of our characters were completed at the end of Toy Story 3, and in this films quest to prove that it was needed, it ended the core of the entire franchise: Woody and Buzz's friendship."

It's not very exciting.
It's like watching Toy Story 1 without the car chase at the end, or Toy Story 2 without the Airport scenes, or Toy Story 3 without the scenes from the garbage truck to the claw. There's no bad guy or exciting action in this one. It's a straight forward drama and nothing more. PLUS, Buzz was a secondary small part like the rest of the toys. BIG step backwards.

"mc1382","5","2","6","24 June 2019"," Oh boy
","I enjoyed myself, I can't deny that. The humor was mostly well done and the film had some fantastic character moments. The only thing is what is this films purpose in the franchise? Toy Story 4 felt like a broken record at points repeating recurring themes that have been ingrained by the first three films. I don't have a problem with this inherently but the film doesn't try to make them fresh. It often repeats plot points from the previous films. Sure we get a new unexplored theme but this theme isn't realised in it's full potential. We get causal hints of it but we get very little insight into not only the theme but how Woody feels about it. When the ending comes it doesn't feel earned.<br/><br/>The film is more concerned with being humourous the majority of the time. So when the emotional punch comes it doesn't feel organic within the story. You can't be humourous a good chunk of the time and expect the audience to be emotionally invested. The only reason people are invested is because of the previous three films. Now, I won't lie, I was emotionally impacted by these hard hitting character moments and it's hard not to get swept up into the drama of it all. The only thing is that when your characters and themes aren't developed enough I can't get fully invested.

","Perfection. That's all that's needed. This movie is absolute perfection; this franchise is pure perfection. Honestly, most people were skeptical about this movie to a certain degree.
I saw the first toy story 20 years ago; I saw the last toy story movie 10 years ago. And I loved this trilogy; didn't want them to reach too far and ruin it.<br/><br/>But my god,Pixar, you've excelled; and by that I mean, you've delivered a dish that no one wanted,but might have been the best experience of the last decade.<br/><br/>From the opening till it's last scene, you're never for a second doubting the quality. The music is beyond incredible, the animation is spectacular, the plot is somehow as emotionally powerful as the others. The characters are all beautiful presented and really impactful. The humor will leave you gasping for breath. There's nothing I can say that actually didn't work for me.<br/><br/>All the new toys leave their mark; the original roster still delivers. I was legitimately scared in this,I'm not kidding. There are scenes that are incredibly chilling. There balance it out quite well with light-hearted tones. I can't remember having such a good time this summer during a film.<br/><br/>The most important question though: did you cry?
There wasn't a single dry eye in the theatre; and I couldn't believe it.
I can't believe Pixar made me cry AGAIN.<br/><br/>Please go watch this film; it's a cinematic masterpiece, for fans of otherwise.
I laughed ,I cried, I gasped, I felt the entire spectrum. The best movie of this summer so far and a truly worthy addition to the Toy Story franchise.
My rating goes all the way up to infinity and beyond."

"dwooldridge97","6","2","6","21 June 2019"," WOODY ""A TOY STORY""
","This is a story of woody,forky and Bo peep more than another toy story movie. All the central characters of the last 3 films ie Buzz, jessie, ham, potato head, rex are all limited to 3 or 4 lines max in this movie and basically play no role at all. I wondered how they would treat potato head especially as Don Rickles had passed away and to be honest after seeing Toy Story 4 i wished they just left it alone. It hasnt got that TS magic of old. Just feels thrown together and rushed and i dont understand that as this is not a movie we asked for as #3 was a fitting send off so why bother make it. I loved Forky and Duke Caboom and also Bunny & Ducky but they'll never hold a candle to the old gang. I got a sinking feeling about the old characters in the trailers and it was massively confirmed in the film as they basically sit in a van offering no help or insight. This is just a Woody film and to me should of been promoted that way and not as TS4. Buzz who is as central a TS character as woody is an empty shell here. That to me is very sad and disrespectful to the other movies we all fell in love with.
Ive seen other reviews on imdb and i totally respect your right to your opinion but if your really committed emotionally to this franchise please dont talk rubbish because of the glory days,base every TS movie on its own merits and be honest when you know in your heart something doesnt feel right in this last installment. The fact this movie needed 8 writers is an absolute red flag and should tell you the truth."

"jebyvyson","7","1","2","30 January 2020"," An unnecessary solid sequel.
","I don't know if I have already made a review of this movie, but here it goes: I think this movie was unnecessary to begin with. As a kid, I did wanted a 4th Toy Story movie to be made but times has changed and I was focusing other things until the trailer dropped. The plot was...alright. I see what they're going for, but there were some flaws in the writing that made me scratch my head. This movie is now mostly focus on Woody, which is upsetting because I know Woody is the main character of this franchise but I would like to see the movie give Buzz Lightyear and Woody enough screen time like in the previous movies rather seeing Buzz less in the movie. They made the villain pretty obvious, seeing Bo Peep was nice, and the ending was pretty emotional. Overall, it's a solid film that shouldn't have be made in the first place. I know Pixar said they'll make another Toy Story if there was a story idea to be made, but Toy Story 3 had a perfect clear ending."

","Movie afternoon with Gertie.<br/><br/>Why mess with the perfect trilogy? This doesn't do anything wrong, but it doesn't add anything. It rehashes old separation plots, and didn't make me laugh until the last 10-minutes.<br/><br/>It sidelines established characters, and introduces new inferior ones. Although it's good to see a female dominating proceedings. The only saving grace is it all but rules out Toy Story 5."
"samuellickiss","8","1","2","22 November 2019"," Even Pixar's cash grabs are head and shoulders above the rest
","I'll be honest, I was dead against Toy Story 4. I grew up with Toy Story. When the first one came out, I was a young child, and I was in my first year of university when the third was released, just as Andy was heading off to college himself. These films are special to me, and they're part of a very special club where both the original and its sequels are damn-near perfect.<br/><br/>I refused to see the film on principle when it was released. I want to see more films like Inside Out and Coco, not sequels that don't even come close to the quality of the original (looking at you, Finding Dory, Ralph Breaks the Internet and The Incredibles 2 - all firmly okay films). While Disney are also busy with sequels and live action remakes of their existing, there's a definite sense of dread that standalone originals are going to become a rarity in lieu of easy money.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is certainly easy money. Fortunately, it's actually quite good.<br/><br/>The first thing to mention are the visuals. They are outstanding, at times bordering on photorealistic, yet retaining the Toy Story style. They're classy too. At one point, the toys walk behind a dusty display case in an antiques shop and it's shot to look like a proper 1940s film noir. There's an extraordinary attention to detail, just as you'd expect from Pixar - a lot of love has gone into the film.<br/><br/>Story-wise, the plot does that classic Pixar thing where it constantly balances comedy and emotional heft. Just a few minutes into the film, Bonnie (you'll remember her from Toy Story 3) starts her first day at school. What starts as something heartbreaking turns into pure joy, and later hilarity, as her creation - a spork called Forkie with pipe cleaner arms and lolly sticks for legs - gains sentience.<br/><br/>Forkie is unsure about his role in life. What's his purpose? It's introspective in that way Pixar films often are - nothing like a bit of existentialism in your children's animations. This theme is explored on a road trip that, in true Toy Story style, turns into a rescue mission.<br/><br/>The new characters excellent, with Keanu Reeves in particular stealing his scenes as a Canadian stunt rider. The reappearance of Bo Peep is welcome, and Annie Potts' voice acting is great. With so many characters, it's impressive that the screenwriters have been able to balance each of their character arcs and give them meaningful personality with only a limited amount of screen time to go around.<br/><br/>I'm docking a couple of stars due to its slightly muddled message and a wonderfully creepy antagonist that...it'd be a spoiler to say anything more, but it's a bit strange what they do there.<br/><br/>All in all, it's frequently laugh out loud funny, emotionally powerful and thoroughly enjoyable. It's not as good as Toy Story 3, but it's still head and shoulders above what most studios are pumping out."

The only problem that I saw is centralized in the fact that the Woody's gang is not seen very much. However, the additional characters are amazing, specially Forky.

I enjoyed toy story 4 but to be this should have been a separate spin off. The 3rd installment ended with such an emotional and touching point it made everyone stop and consider what we should do with our old unwanted items lying around in boxes.
This movie started and ended with me questioning; was there really need for any of this, none of it spoke to emotionally and I truly believe there was no need for it. I didn't enjoy how the toys interacted so strongly in the day to day life of 'people', upto now the movies made you believe toys came to life when you weren't looking but not in this movie.... they're very much real.
I loved the new characters but all the old characters were background pieces which supports my belief that this movie was a spin off and shouldn't be watched as a true lover of toy story expecting a 4th installment."

Some reviews I read said some of the dolls were scary and that was a concern for me. But not to worry. They are probably more creepy for adults than kids.
As far as the Pixar graphics it was great! The music was as good. I loved the cast of characters especially for the new toys.

It is definitely a must-see.<br/><br/>It was great that they included Bo-Peep in the series after 20 years, but I think that focusing the story solely on her kind of loses the momentum of the first three films.

"Abranth-d","8","1","2","19 July 2019"," A lot of sweating through the eyes
","Here's my review of Toy Story 4 . To be honest , I wasn't looking forward to this movie because I thought toy story 3's ending was a conclusive one and toy story 4 would be nothing but a cashgrab , and I was absolutely wrong. Toy story 4 is an epilogue to Toy story 3 and a really good one . Growing up I've noticed the different themes in these movies , the first one was about playing together , the second was about how toys shouldn't be collectibles but playthings , the third one was about growing up and moving on from the toys . Now this movie is the exact opposite , it's about how the toys grow up and move on ,and that bought a lot of man tears in this movie. The story is about this spork called ""forky"" made into a toy by Bonnie who gets lost during a road trip and Woody makes it his mission to find him while also facing scenarios which make him rethink his own position. Believe me when I say that 10% of this movie is of the horror genre cause there are a few ventriloquist dolls with jumpscares and such . Key and Peele are in this movie as Ducky and Bunny and they are hilarious. Keanu Reeves is also in this movie as an action figure and I won't be surprised if he says "" Let's kaboom "" in John wick 4 , point is he was awesome ! The only gripes I had with this movie was how the other toys , even buzz had less screentime when compared to Woody who was pretty much the lead in this movie , I was also dissapointed on how there was less bromance b/w buzz and Woody than in the other movies. But these are just little things that bothered me. In the end , Toy story 4 is a trip down memory lane with a fast phased , hard hitting story which strikes both adults and kids. That's something I've always liked about Pixar movies , they are kids movies with deep themes which makes them a great watch for all audiences , so with lovable characters , a satisfying epilogue and lot of sweating through the eyes , Toy Story 4 is an instant classic and is definitely one of the best movies of the summer , right next to Endgame."
"lisadewaal-98104","7","1","2","19 July 2019"," Andy's Gonna Yeet Bonnie Right Out The Window
","This movie was extremely well made. The graphics are beautiful, the characters are great, and the story is good. However, this movie makes Toy Story 1, 2 and 3 feel... a little hollow.<br/><br/>As it was said in the other movies, toys are supposed to be there for children. That's what they're made for. Even when they don't get played with for a while, they'll find a new kid. Andy giving away Woody at the end of Toy Story 3 was such a heartfelt moment I was crying. And I trusted Bonnie to take good care of Woody, as did Andy.<br/><br/>And then in Toy Story 4, Bonnie doesn't look at Woody anymore. And that's fine, she has other toys. But abandoning her felt incredibly wrong, that's something Woody would never do. I understand that he wants more out of life now, but it stands in contradiction to everything he's ever said in the other movies. That, and Buzz was... rather dumb and even useless here? What happened?<br/><br/>Also, I can only imagine what will happen to Bonnie once Andy visits her to see how Woody's doing. God, he's gonna yeet that kid right out the window of a ten story building.

There were a couple plot points that surprised me, which I liked: That girl denying Gabby in the store, the tearful scene where a little girl at the carnival was lost, and of course, Woody's decision to stay with Bo. Besides these points, the whole movie was pretty predictable. It had a lot of the same concepts that ""Toy Story 3"" had, including the 'one kid vs many' issue, the new location that takes up most of the movie, the mean character who is mean because they've gone through a lot, etc. It almost seems they were unsatisfied with the outcome of the third movie that they had to make a fourth just to alter the decision Woody makes at the end of the film."

"calebmurrieta","6","1","2","11 July 2019"," Redundant plot and characters seem to have amnesia?
","***SPOILER ALERT***
Honestly, I didn't need to see this movie. the 3rd movie was a great ending for the series, but for nostalgia's sake, I made like a long-time-Star-Wars-fan and forced my kid to watch the whole trilogy in chronological order and then go to the theater to see our beloved characters fall into another adventure. To be fair, the movie wasn't a complete disaster; it was HILARIOUS. but that's about it... it was purely a kid's movie, meant to make money. I was really disappointed with this one. I get it, the plot for a toy-centered movie can really only go as far as it has in the past; ""Lost/stolen toy(s) tries to find their owner"". 24 years and the plot still hasn't deviated much. Aside from that the only real problem I had was the Character development. It's as though the 2 main characters of the movies have completely forgotten previous lessons learned.<br/><br/>#1. Buzz. In this movie, Buzz was lacking in the intelligence and leadership department. in Toy Story 2 and 3 we saw Buzz lead the gang into busy streets, public buildings and out of entrapment all with excellence and confidence. Toy story 4? Buzz freezes under pressure and jumps out a window to deal with the problem on his own... what!? On top of that, I find it hard to believe even his ""space ranger memories"" don't provide him with the knowledge necessary to know what a conscience is. we spend the majority of the movie watching Buzz rely on tips from his voice box to strategize how to find Woody instead of LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE (not even the common sense found in the previous movies).<br/><br/>#2. Woody. In Toy Story 1, Woody learned that he won't always be the favorite toy, but in the beginning of Toy Story 4, Woody is super insecure about not getting played with and gets jealous when Bonnie favors Jesse as the sheriff. In Toy Story 3, Woody learns to move on from Andy to Bonnie, but in Toy Story 4, Woody, clearly, still hasn't moved on. In Toy Story 2, Woody re-learns about an unending loyalty to your kid even if it won't last, but in the end of Toy Story 4, he chooses not to return to his current owner and live a life on the road. It really felt like Woody was completely out of character.<br/><br/>Moving on, Bo Peep was pretty cool; she fits right in to the Disney-female-protagonist thing they got going on. just kind of wish she were a perfect bad-ass for any other legitimate reason aside from trying to pander to that role for the sake of equality. Bo was quite possibly the only character in the movie who thought rationally and put the main characters to shame.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie explored a sort of dark topic; what is considered a toy? is it the name of a child on the bottom of an object with some kind of facial structure? If a spork can become alive, then how about a vehicle? Is this how the world of ""Cars"" and ""Planes"" were created?<br/><br/>Gotta say tho, I DID like the conjoined rabbit-duck. they made the movie for me.<br/><br/>That's it."

","Unneeded, definitely. Technically awesome for sure: Pixar is the best in this no doubt at all (although some dejavu feeling is there with the evil toys recalling partially the third installation's plot), but the trilogy had the very perfect conclusion for each of the characters' storyline.

The difference is, Woody not jealous.<br/><br/>
--> And the biggest bad is ending. This Movie is broke Toy Story 3 legacy for best ending movie story. The the ending is too forced, very selfish. You can get my point. In Toy Story 1-3, we can see, Woody is true leadership for Toy gang. But, in 4, he just broke it. Is non sense, is not Woody false, but this story is really bad. I know Woody not have much play time like Toy Story 3, but, why destory Woody leadership like that. Is really nonsense. He left his friends like that, is not right.<br/><br/>I thought Toy Story 4 story is about how Toy can have soul and life like human, but it just drama. It seems like, Disney and Pixar try to make Toy Story 5 to answer it. Is really bad decision.<br/><br/>For my perspective, who watch Toy Story movies since a kid, and now I'm 20 years old, is bad ending, disappointed, even moral values, and comedy in this movie is entertaining.<br/><br/>Sorry my English is not good."
"pokedom","6","1","2","24 June 2019"," Pixar makes another movie
","There's nothing inherently wrong with making sequels. If you've got a great idea and a story to tell that feels natural, good on you. Make your sequel. Some of my favorite movies are sequels. Terminator 2 and The Dark Knight are two big ones that influence me even today. You know why? Because those films are awesome! They expand on the universe set up from the previous film, they add new creative elements, and they don't retread the same things they've already done.<br/><br/>Conversely, some of my least favorite movies are sequels. Movies I think have ruined the original in some way, or not done enough to make the series better. Or sequels that didn't need to exist. This was always my fear with Toy Story 4, the feeling that it didn't need to exist, especially with the powerful ending of Toy Story 3, plus the mini side stories in the form of TV specials.<br/><br/>I did still like this movie, which is a testament to the quality of Pixar. They know how to make something pretty regardless of actual quality. However Toy Story 4 does some pretty good stuff that I wasn't expecting. We'll work through positives first.<br/><br/><ul><li>Fantastic animation. Pixar has really mastered their craft with this movie. The designs of the characters are great and even the sets the movie runs around in are fantastic. From the rainy outside to the dusty corners of an antique shop to a vibrant fairground, the movie vigorously sweats to keep itself looking visually stunning.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Great editing. Editing and cinematography are usually pretty easy to do in animated films, however Toy Story 4 surprised me in visual style beyond just animation. The film is very well edited, with scenes smoothly flowing from one shot to the next. The opening credits sequence is the prime example.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I loved Forky. The fact that the film made me care for a sentient spork with googly eyes is a victory. His growth and how he interacts with Woody is great. It's also a win for Woody's character, how he passes down all of his knowledge as the veteran favorite toy down to Forky. My absolute favorite scene by far is just the simple exchange of information on the walk on the road between the two.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gabby Gabby was great as well. You at first find the whole premise of her character creepy and you grow to care for her over time (Shining music was a nice touch). A reverse Lotso, and a way better one at that.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bo was alright. Definitely was fine with how her character was treated, felt like something she would do. A lot more spunk than she previously had however, felt a little jarring but I adjusted.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bunny and Ducky are great sometimes and not great others. At least they're funny. Keanu Reaves was also very funny. I know his character's name is Rex Kaboom but if we're being honest it's Keanu Reaves's action figure, let's stop kidding ourselves.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I was definitely fine with the ending. Nothing ground breaking and definitely not as good as Toy Story 3's ending, nor is it more definitive. I do like how it ended however, it felt natural enough.</li></ul><br/><br/>Time for the negatives.<br/><br/><ul><li>My biggest fear for this movie was confirmed after I sat back for a couple days and thought about it. The movie has almost nothing new to offer audiences. The majority of plot points and core themes/ideas this movie has have been recycled from the previous films. Lost toys, growing up, leaving the past behind, toys without owners, the joys of being played with, and the nobility of toys. All have been thoroughly explored in each movie before. I would be fine if the movie felt pointless but had something new to offer. Instead it just felt utterly pointless.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Buzz was absolutely butchered in this movie. Buzz has never been as dumb and as illogical as he is in this movie. One of the most powerful moments in this series for me at least was between Buzz and Woody in Al's Apartment in the second movie. It conveyed how he had grown since the first film, and what he knows now is right for toys. In this movie he just presses a button on his chest to figure out what to do next. He went from arguably a better character than Woody at times to a complete doofus.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In addition, the rest of the gang was barely in the movie. The fact that Jesse has barely anything to do is a dang shame. You could have cut her and even everyone else and barely anything would have changed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I don't understand why Pixar sequels feel the need to reuse their old score. I had this issue with Cars 3, I had this issue with Incredibles 2 (lesser however, not as often), and I have an issue with it here. The amount of times this movie reuses the old tunes from the previous films is almost comical.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ""oh no I forgot something"" thing Bonnie did got really annoying after a while. Felt like a lazy way to keep the plot moving. Also the ""where's (insert toy name here)"" got irritating, as it'd usually disappear for a second, get thrown back into view the next, they just turn back and see it. It got lazy.</li></ul><br/><br/>TL;DR: It is absolutely a testament to the talent behind Pixar that they managed to make a movie that is utterly pointless to existing still be a good movie. I will have my faults with it, and you will never catch me saying ""oh yeah, this series didn't really end at 3"". 3 ended the series. 4 is a nice idea to end the series, but the definitive ending will always be 3. It's simply too perfect an ending."

Particularly the scene in the antique shop with the chandeliers.<br/><br/>The plot was fun. There is a lot happening but it's all intertwined. A lot of lower ratings were because there were multiple themes. Let me say, if they can write an IMDB review they can keep up with a kids movie surely.<br/><br/>The new characters were fun. The ventriloquist dolls were scary and funny. Key and Peele's characters were hilarious.<br/><br/>Our only complaint was too little of Buzz however he was present.<br/><br/>It's a great movie.

","I am glad Disney didn't go the easy route and make the same film four times. Our toys end up with Bonnie who loves a toy spork. When the not-so-astute fork becomes separated at a carnival, Woody to the rescue. The film gets slightly dark as an evil Chatty Cathy doll wants Woody's voice box and has some creepy Jerry Mahoney dolls as henchmen.<br/><br/>One of the questions raised by the film is who still plays with valuable old toys? Aren't they in antique stores or on display? And with Disney's acquisition of the rights to Star Wars, I would have expected things to go in a different direction. Nothing like a bittersweet story of children growing up and the end to childhood."

","This movie made me feel good. It proves that you can tell an extremely entertaining and funny story which even small childeren will understand, and by doing so, discuss real serious matters, even the very meaning of life, in a deep, non-trivial manner. It is not alone in achieving this feat - Inside Out comes to mind. But, there are not many films like this. What is especially beautiful about this film: it allows you to be completely immersed in the story, turn off your brain and munch away on your popcorn. And if you decide to follow the philosophical implications, you are NOT rewarded with easy answers, but with questions that will last a lifetime."
"paligladayan","9","2","7","12 August 2019"," Fun for kids and adults!!
","I can almost say this is my favorite toy story..
Beginning with all the memories from the previous toy stories and moving on to new adventures.. aside from having a great sense of humour and so much imagination, the movie actually carried amazing messages for adults as well..
I'm 28 and late 20s seem to be the time you realize you're not 18 anymore, you are actually growing up, that you have to let go of some things since life goes on, and so you need to cope accordingly.. yet, life is still beautiful, since you still have all those beautiful memories and you can still make new ones!
I think this movie also presents values that not only kids, but also adults should sometimes be reminded of.. love, caring, friendship, sharing and so many other ones..
I know I mentioned my age earlier and this might seem funny for some, but I actually had tears in my eyes at the end of the movie.. I couldn't imagine woodie without his friends, but then again.. life is life.. they will always be his family, but he had to make a decision for new adventures.. step up and make a change because, well, times goes by and life happens..
I truly wouldn't miss this movie..
Honestly I'm not a huge fan of watching a second or a third when they come out, as I usually prefer the original first ones of most of the Disney movies, yet this one is truly worth it.. no matter your age :)"

"drm2642","6","2","7","7 July 2019"," Woody vs. Gabby Gabby?
","I did not find this movie to be as bad as some are making it out to be. I think the story arc of lost toys finding a purpose is clever and this was a good way to bring Bo back into the story. I do think that Buzz was a bit underused. Instead of being Woody's partner in crime, like he was in the previous films, he took a back seat and really just became one of the other side characters, not all that different from Potato Head or the dinosaur.<br/><br/>Ok, so for the controversial side of this post. Nobody seems to be talking about this which is odd, because to me this was so obvious. Woody was essentially R with an Aped by Gabby Gabby (had to write it that way so as not to get flagged). When she has her men forcibly remove his voice device and insert it into her, they are symbolically violating him. If this was a male character doing this to a female, people would be outraged. I think since they are toys and since it is a female doing it to a male this flew under the radar. I don't think the makers of the movie intended this to be interpreted this way, but it does not change the fact that it is exactly that. In the end Woody is ok with this, but does not make the act ok. It is no different than if a woman forgave her attacker. The action is still criminal. Then Gabby tries to become a redeemable character. Yes, the ending with her and the child finding each other is very touching, but still it's not right. It is symbolically the equivalence of a judge going easy on a young man because he has a bright future ahead of him."

"theredsky","8","2","7","3 July 2019"," Toy Story 4 Review
","Toy Story 4 is an outstanding film that succeeds in keeping the Toy Story Franchise one of the best franchises. Here are the few negatives. The character of Forky, as great as he is, is a plot device. He really is only there to move the story forward which kinda sucks. My other issue is that the film does borrow heavily on themes and plot points from the original 3 films. Here are the positives. This film can be very emotional at times. The film starts emotional and doesn't stop being emotional until the credits roll. The last scene of the film is probably one of the most emotional Pixar moments. The voice acting is very good. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and Annie Potts are standouts from the main cast. Each delivers their lines with so much emotion and personality that you can't help but care about them and their struggles. The returning characters don't have a lot of screen time but they all do an outstanding job. The new characters are really good also. Keanu Reeves, Jordan Peele, and Keegan-Michael Key's characters steal the show. Each of their characters are incredibly entertaining and hilarious to watch on the big screen. This leads me to my next point. For a Pixar film, Toy Story 4 is pretty funny. There are a handful of jokes that don't land well but most of them got a chuckle out of me and one or two got full on laughs from me. The animation for this film is outstanding. It's incredible to see how far animation has come from the original Toy Story in 1995. There is one shot that showcases the passage of time and it's incredible. The story is heartwarming and nice even if it does bounce back on ideas from the previous films. The score for this film is pretty good also. It's not extraordinary but it's good. The tone for the film remains consistent all the way through and it's also paced really well. I would highly recommend seeing this in theaters. Overall, Toy Story 4 is another great addition to the Toy Story franchise with outstanding animation, great voice acting, and tons of emotion. I give Toy Story 4 a 9/10."
"TYContact1","10","2","7","2 July 2019"," Toy Story 4 still brings interesting new characters and action-packed giggles to all ages, and touches audience with inspiring life lessons about self and society.
","If this is the last instalment, Toy Story 4 ended with a very high bar for other sequels - live or animation wise.<br/><br/>The film runs a tight script, so every scene is full of action, smart dialogues and hilarious situations that are relevant to today's society: e.g. throw-away society, where toy characters question the difference between being ""trash"" and ""a toy""; changing gender roles and existentialism - delivered by unforgettable new and old characters, hands down.<br/><br/>What amazes me is that the script was able to demonstrate conflict resolution between toys through trust, communication and empathy - an important lesson on building a cooperative society in a competitive world.<br/><br/>The story left me with belly laughs and heart-felt tears."

So the movie contains 3 of those characters and then we have to pay attention to Key, Peele and Keanu instead and some really creepy dolls for kids to be seeing.

However, these movies have all wowed me so I expected the same from Toy Story 4.<br/><br/>You can expect many laughs, some plot twists, and certainly creativity. However, I was let down with this one... The movie did not feel like a Toy Story movie for me, it felt as if I was watching a film that featured a few Toy Story characters. For instance, you don't see much of the full traditional cast (Rex, Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, Slinky, Mr. Porkchop, etc.) These characters are what make these movies so the fact that these roles were heavily overdrawn with new characters was upsetting.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending was sweet and a bit heart wrenching. However, I do think Toy Story 3 ended on great terms and would have been best for this series of movies. All in all it was a good movie for Pixar, but did not entirely live up to the Toy Story series."

","The Toy Story franchise's ability to make one quality movie after another is really special. This is the fourth over a span of 24 years and they have not lost a step.<br/><br/>So, we know with every new Toy Story there's a new toy or toys-usually multiple toys because there are the good and the bad. We also know that Woody is going to be heavily mixed up in whatever is going on. Part four is no different.<br/><br/>It picks up where part three left off with Andy bequeathing his toys to little Bonnie. Bonnie plays with the toys like nobody's business then there is a shift. She goes to kindergarten. There she makes a toy out of a spork and little ""Forky"" (Tony Hale), as he's called, takes the gang on a new unplanned adventure.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 had everything I wanted to see: a good story, creative action from the toys, and laughs. Thanks to Key and Peele playing Ducky and Bunny I got laughs that I don't think I've ever gotten from a Toy Story before.<br/><br/>The laughs were really an added bonus. The story was wonderful and of all the toys, Bo Peep (Annie Potts) stole the show. She showed toys in a new role and it was great.<br/><br/>Toy Story could go another 24 years and I think it would continue to be stellar.

","When Toy Story 4 was first announced many people online seemed very reluctant about the idea of another Toy Story movie. Not because people were bored of the franchise, but because they thought Toy Story 3 provided such an ideal ending that they were concerned any continuation couldn't live up to the ideal legacy the previous three films had created. But once again Pixar outdoes all expectations, making another fine addition to their greatest franchise.<br/><br/>We start more or less where the last film left off, with Woody struggling to adapt to being Bonnie's toy. He's no longer the favourite and he's started to collect dust in a cupboard. But he finds a new meaning for his life when he decides to become a mentor to a new toy named Forky, a toy which Bonnie makes on her first day of school out of a spork. Now you may be wondering to yourself how a spork comes to life and what really makes a toy? I don't know. But whatever brought him to life has also caused him to have an existential crisis where he is forced to be a living toy when all he wants to be is trash.<br/><br/>This crisis leads to Woody and Forky becoming separated from the rest of the gang whilst on a road trip, where they end up bumping into Woody's long lost love, Bo Peep. Whereas Woody lives trying to recapture that special connection he had with Andy, Bo has decided she doesn't want a new kid and lives her life as a lost toy. With Bo and Woody's relationship taking centre stage in the film, Toy Story 4 allows their personalities to lead the direction of the film all culminating in another heart wrenching conclusion to the Toy Story franchise.<br/><br/>As with the other Toy Story films, we also get introduced to some new memorable toys. Beyond the lovably naive (albeit slightly suicidal) Forky, we also have Duke Caboom, a stunt-cyclist toy who suffers from PTSD due to not being able to leap through the air for his previous owner as his toy was originally marketed as. Key and Peele play a pair of carnival fluffies, who's surprisingly sadistic nature ends up being a comedic highlight of the film. And also an old doll named Gabby Gabby, who due to being defective sends her ventriloquist dummies to kidnap Woody to steal his voice box. And yes, her ventriloquist dummies are just as creepy as you're imagining they are.<br/><br/>Another cornerstone of the franchise is that each film always showcases the best animation of the time and Toy Story 4 is no exception. These aren't the most ambitious visual concepts, most of it just takes place in an old antiques store and a moving carnival. But the attention to detail, the colour and the photorealistic lighting ensures that the film is consistently beautiful and that there's never a boring shot in the film. One moment which really stuck with me was an establishing shot of Woody and Bo Peep in the rain, which was so awe inspiring that it's a moment I found myself completely lost in.<br/><br/>Though as entertaining as all of the new characters are, it would have been nice to see some more from the original gang like Hamm, Rex and Jessie. None of them become too involved in the main plot and some are never really given a moment to shine in the film. And with a brief runtime of 100 minutes it's not like they had to be cut out to condense screen time.<br/><br/>Although when my biggest gripe with a film is that I would have liked more of it, the filmmakers have definitely been able to recapture that special Pixar magic. And I have no doubt that kids will remember characters like Forky as fondly as I held Buzz and Woody after growing up with the original Toy Story."

","This is NOT the Ice Age series. This isn't Incredibles 2. And it's definitely not Cars 2.<br/><br/>This movie has MORE reason to be here than anything I previously mentioned (Except the 1st Ice Age. That was a good movie).<br/><br/>The thing is, we don't have superpowers. We don't live in a world where everyone is a talking sentient automobile, but we have ALL had a childhood, at one point or another. And most of us have had to leave it behind by now.<br/><br/>If toy story 4 doesn't bring you back to your childhood, make you nostalgic, make you laugh, or even make you smile, then there is probably no hope for you with this movie. You might need to get that checked because you may have grown into a soulless human. No offense to soulless humans.<br/><br/>Getting a sequel THIS good, that works well with the story, gives some characters good arcs, introduces fun new characters, and serves justice to the world that was built for us. I'm just saying, for a sequel that we DIDN'T ASK FOR, I don't see a need to complain.<br/><br/>I had a surprisingly good time watching this film from start to finish, and even had a few moments of somewhat tears. Forky is delightfully hilarious. Please treat yourself with Pixar's latest animated masterpiece.<br/><br/>Listen to your inner voice. The one telling you to not miss this movie!

But it does not take the fact that it is fantastic, and different from 3 that does sometimes copy 2, it presents a newer structure and a new theme for this franchise, ending in a great way that could have been given a little bit more time so than it could reach those emotional heights from the 3rd movie, but it is great"

","I don't normally write reviews on IMDB, but for this I just have to let out my love for this film. It's so beautiful to witness all the gang back together and not only that, but they are back with a more light hearted story of what happens After the curtains close.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 Is a tale about what becomes of those after there purpose has been fulfilled, in a way you could sum up Toy Story 4 as a Retirement film and how to deal with letting go of things that cannot be replaced.<br/><br/>Along with the emotional messages the film gives off, I would say it's greatest aspect for this run is it's comedy, I found myself laughing out loud to jokes and characters that I normally think are poorly delivered, but Toy Story 4 knows it's audience and knows how to deliver it's comedy in such a way as it feels enduring to character depth.<br/><br/>I will say that to me personally it's not as good as 1, 2 or 3. But it doesn't try to be ""better"" it try's just ""be"" Toy Story and it does so with flying colours and I would still say this film is worth getting back into the Pixar craze once again.<br/><br/>I think with films like Coco and Incredibles 2, Pixar is back on track with there depth world building films that create more character driven stories better than anything in the film industry.<br/><br/>Overall I give Toy Story 4 an 8.6. Same rating as I have given Forest Gump, Black Swan & Terminator 2 Judgement Day."

"datautisticgamer-74853","8","2","8","24 June 2019"," This franchise should, at least movie wise, end
","It has been a while since I actually watched the previous 3 Toy Stories, however as with most audiences around the world I do remember finding enjoyment in each. The thought of this movie irked me at first since, in addition to the reputation Pixar has with its other sequels, 3 came with the perfect ending to the franchise's would-be trilogy. Pixar really had a lot riding on this, and...<br/><br/>As with any sequels, I would recommend engaging yourself with the prequels first in order to understand how Toy Story sets itself up as a series of movies (that includes the characters as well). For that reason, really the only big thing I want to say about the characters is that I like how the supposed antagonist is not necessarily a villain. The other new faces, like Ducky and Bunny, offer the expected comedy and heart of Toy Story; their writing enhances this. From the one-liners to the delightful action, the whole theater actually laughed out loud in some scenes. That said, I feel as though the story did sometimes feel cliché. In particular, the scene where Woody falls out with Bo Peep and his allies outside of Second Chance Antiques features the same structure as a lot of other types of these scenes, but isn't executed good enough to make it exceptional. I do have to give TS4 big points for its dénouement, which I find too delicate and powerful to spoil for you all. To round up a story that could have been crafted and showcased much worse for a sequel, we have Pixar's top-notch animation, rendering the effects and objects to the millimeters of detail. As much as the humans continue to have a Pixar feel to them, the toys and all the objects they interact with feel even more so like you could just reach out and grab them like real toys. Sure Coco was way more colorful, but that palette was more intended for that movie's world and wouldn't be necessary in a franchise known for relatively down-to-earth premises.<br/><br/>I have to admit I was disappointed by the lack of aliens, however that is a mere nitpick for a dam* fine addition to Pixar's lineup. As with the previous 3 Toy Stories, I can recommend this to even families who are not big on toys. Lovable and/or sympathetic characters will allure children, while adults can appreciate its solid humor and action. I personally would place it on par with 1, above 2, and below 3. Of course, this now means that any Toy Story 5 will have a lot more riding on it, and I dread to see a wonderful franchise possibly be sullied. For that reason, I feel that Toy Story should at this point not continue in movie form. Instead, more shorts like of Terror or That Time Forgot would continue its charm. Ignoring the future, this is still a movie that makes, at least me, proud to say I love Pixar."

"WillsFilms","9","2","8","22 June 2019"," I Will Love Toy Story 4 For Infinity and Beyond
","When I first walked out of Toy Story 4, I wasn't a huge fan. The second time I saw it, I loved it. This movie didn't have to exist, as Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending, but I'm happy it does. Tom Hanks returns as Woody and delivers one of, if not his best performance in the role. The way Woody's character is handled is beautiful and in many ways tragic. Without spoiling the ending, it's a very conclusive and beautiful end to Woody's character arc. Tim Allen returns as Buzz Lightyear and, while I think the character was at his best in Toy Story 2, this movie portrays his friendship with Woody the best, especially at the end. Annie Potts as Bo Peep gets a lot more screen time in this movie, than in the first two combined. While I honestly didn't care for her that much as a character in the first two, here it's a completely different story. She's a genuinely interesting character and introduces a new piece of the Toy Story universe we've never really seen before; toys without kids, that run around living their own lives. The new characters are all pretty good. Tony Hale is both hilarious and interesting as Forky. Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peel as Duckie and Bunny, I didn't care for. They were decent characters and gave some good laughs, but they could get annoying at some points in the movie. Christina Hendricks made a fantastic antagonist, the best one in the series. Her motivations are so relatable that I can barely call her a villain and she's probably the best new character in the movie. Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom was the comedic highlight of the movie and every scene with him was gold.<br/><br/>If I had one problem with the movie, it's that several of our favourite characters from the first three movies are barely in the movie. Jessie, Slinky, Mr and Mrs. Potato Head, Hamm, Rex, The Alliens and Bullseye all have very limited screen time, but I understand as this movie focuses primarily on Woody and the new characters.<br/><br/>In summary, Toy Story 4 is a fantastic return to the franchise, a beautiful ending to Woody's story, introduces several new, memorable characters and has massively improved animation when compared to the other films. Is it the best Toy Story film? No. Is it a great one? Yes. I'd wholeheartedly recommend it."
"donz-8","9","2","8","21 June 2019"," One of the best animated films ever made, really
","For me, Toy Story 4 was surprisingly the funniest of the entire series, as I was laughing hysterically throughout the movie, earlier tonight. While I still find Toy Story 3 to be the best of them all, the 4th in the series was equally satisfying with a rich, deep, and heartwarming story. I love a lot of the new characters too, and even Forky grows on you pretty quickly. I did miss the older characters though, as a lot of them didn't contribute much this time and wish they could have been involved more in the action and story overall. And some parts of the story seemed a little thrown together, without a really strong or intimidating antagonist/bad guy like those from the previous films. However, Toy Story 4 was absolutely charming, incredibly funny, and one of the best animated films I've ever watched, and I've watched quite a few."

","There is so much I want to say about this movie.
I was really anxious walking in, there was so much build up! Tom Hank's stated that when recording his last lines it was ""A moment in history!"", and given the anti-climactic build-up for the Incredibles sequel, I didn't know how this was going to hold up.<br/><br/>But my God did the producers pull this off with elegance and beauty! The humour was there, the feel-good nostalgia was there, the values that Toy Story has always tried to convey were there. Almost 2 decades we have spent growing up with these iconic toys, and now it's time to give them the perfect send off that we deserved, but more importantly, what they deserved. An ending you didn't realise was perhaps the only way for it to go.<br/><br/>I am so happy that this movie exists, and I am so happy that it ended up being the best movie I have seen so far this year. Pixar never disappoints"

","This is another great movie in the Toy Story franchise. As a person born in the 90s and having grown up with these movies, I've been worried that this movie would not be good and it was a fun solid movie. Woody is great as ever and Pixar handles the story and humor well (as they always do).<br/><br/>Overall, I want to give it a 10 but left the theater a little disappointed - I think 1-3 were perfect movies. I felt this was lacking something that the first three had maybe due to the storyline pushing some of the original characters to the side or the story being not as interesting in my opinion. But this is still a excellent movie but I don't think it's perfect when compared to 1-3. Of course it was always going to be challenging to live up to those movies.

","The TOY STORY films have been hits for Pixar and Disney since the release of the first film in 1995. Now 24 years later what could be the final film in the franchise has been released and is on the way to disc. Think about this. A 5 year old child who saw that first film is not graduated from high school and on their way to college. That in itself is amazing. That the movies can remain fresh, interesting and grab onto a new generation even more so.<br/><br/>If, like me, you hadn't kept up with the other three films, Andy (the boy who originally owned the toys) has passed them on to his sister Bonnie. Having grown and in college the toys now make up a major part of Bonnie's life. But she's about to start going to school and has the normal fears children do when that time comes. Woody (Tom Hanks) steps in to help, recalling the first day of school Andy had and how he helped him through it.<br/><br/>Sneaking into her backpack he's there to watch over her. When art supplies are taken from her desk, he retrieves some from the trash and in so doing picks up a spork too. Bonnie sees the items on her table and lights up, mixing them together to create her own figure made of a broken popsicle stick for feet, a lump of modeling clay to hold the feet and spork together, glued google eyes, a rubber band mouth and a pipe cleaner for arms. She dubs her new toy Forky and now Woody must get him to go home with her. After all, Forky thinks he's nothing but trash.<br/><br/>Forky continues to try and escape and Woody and friends continue to bring him home. Then the family decides to go on a road trip via RV. Along the road Forky jumps out and Woody is determined to rescue him. Forky still thinks of himself as trash. As the pair make their way to the camp the family is staying in for the night, Woody finally convinces Forky that Bonnie needs him, that he is HER trash. Off they go to be reunited.<br/><br/>But along the way they pass near an antique shop and Woody spots a familiar glow. It's the base of the lamp that Bo Peep (Annie Potts) and her sheep were on in the front window of an antique store. He and Forky enter and meet Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks). The talking doll has a broken voice box and she sees Woody as her chance to remedy the situation by taking his. Woody escapes but not Forky.<br/><br/>At a nearby playground Woody is reunited with Bo Peep and the sheep only to discover she's now a lost toy and happy about it. The worlds is hers to explore and no longer depend on a child to play with her. He tells her what's happening and eventually she agrees to help him recover Forky along with several other lost toy friends.<br/><br/>AND while all this is going on Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the other toys are wondering where Woody is. Having been told to consult his ""inner voice"" Buzz takes him literally and pushes his buttons to speak. Low and behold they send him on a quest to find Woody and help him recover Forky.<br/><br/>So what makes the TOY STORY movies work? There is no simple, single, solitary answer. It is an amalgamation of items that weave together to not only capture the imaginations of children but of adults who will be sitting there with those kids watching. Everyone has had that special toy at one time or another, that one item that meant so much to you but that somewhere along the way was lost, misplaced or no longer played with. These movies, and this one in particular, bring back those memories of lost toys.<br/><br/>In addition to that the film deals with emotional predicaments that children find themselves in and deals with those issues. The loss of a special toy transfers possibly to the loss of a special friend. People move, change schools or pass away. The toys serve as metaphors for these things and the movie opens a door for discussion between parents and children. Without spoiling anything it also opens the door to talk about when it's the right time to leave, to move on. That what some would consider a simple cartoon can have that impact and allow itself to be used to open those doors is something special.<br/><br/>No one can say for certain that this will be the last film in the series but it does have an ending that would make you think so. That would be the smart thing to do. Set aside the concept of making another film for the sake of dollars and let the toys be free finally. Doing so would make the impact of the film all that more special. And this is a special movie that adults and children will love. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll find something you can share with your kids or alone. It's one great movie."

Looking at Toy Story 4 in isolation does not require a frontal lobotomy. Rate the story, how it made you feel and what you feel at the end. Was it a good journey? Or did you get off half way?

Pixar almost always gets it right and you kind of know they would not mess with this or rather just do something for the sake of it. So while the third put a really good lid on it (full circle, great ending, whatever you want to say about it), this finds a way to give us a new story ... and a new satisfying (?) ending ... that depends on the viewer of course.<br/><br/>Great animation, great voice work, good new and old new characters, although there is an emphasis on some of them and your fave may not get as much screentime as you'd like.

","I saw the first Toy Story in the theatre when I was a little girl; it blew me away completely. I was amazed by the entire experience. I re-watched it as an adult, and was pleasantly surprized by how well it held up. The animation looked a little dated, but the story, heart, and characters shone through. I was eerie about this fourth movie, thinking ""How could they keep the franchise going?"" I expected the worst, as so many long-lived franchises tend to dim in quality.
I very much enjoyed this movie. It was difficult to watch. Quite sad. I felt so old! It had me reflecting on how much has changed since I saw the first movie. Change and large breaks from familiarity are painful and upsetting. I think this movie was too realistic in uncomfortable ways, and perhaps too grown up for children. The ending is bittersweet, heartbreaking, and I did not see it coming. I immediately thought 'people won't like this!"" . I felt ambivalent at first, not sure if I liked it or not. It is stunningly beautiful. It captures some very sad aspects of growing up and aging, loss, disappointment, change, lost dreams...<br/><br/>To sum up: super beautiful, technically beyond well made - next level amazing animation; bright colourful scenery, fun easter eggs, and just everything! So well-made. Very sad; might leave you with a hollow, empty feeling like the loss of something dear, or death...too realistic in its portrayal of pain and difficult decisions and division. This is a hard one to review!"

","Sorry to everyone who loves this movie, but I really wish it didn't exist. Now, I've given it 7/10, so clearly I don't hate it. It is a great movie on its own. But the fact of the matter is, Toy Story IV is NOT its own movie. It is a part of the beloved Toy Story franchise, and that is how I am viewing it. And frankly, as a Toy Story movie, it doesn't even begin to compare. I spent the entire film waiting for the old characters, the gang, to have their moments to shine. It never came. All the old characters who we have grown to know and love dearly, were hardly in it. Instead, we're introduced to about 50 new characters, most of who I don't care for at all. Buzz, my favourite character and one of THE MAIN CHARACTERS, is barely in it either; and when he is, he just acts like a dumb robot who has no personality or conscience. Do you think we're stupid, Pixar? We saw him in the other three films! We know how smart and selfless he is! I just found the whole thing so strange and out of place. It's a nice enough story but, like I said, it doesn't feel like Toy Story without the essential characters. Didn't like the ending, either - it goes against everything Woody has stood for over the course of the four films. Toy Story III is still my Toy Story ending."

anyways here's my review of toy story 4
So I watched toy story 4 a month ago (posting this on 7-23-19) and I have had some time to think about the quality of this film and I think its a little bit worse then the 3rd but not by much.
I think this film is very funny, beautiful to look at, and heartwarming on many different fronts but the other 3 films are also that and better. I am happy to say I can enjoy this film on par to the other films after 3's ending and I hope we keep this as the conclusion. I think 5 is a possibility but I'm less sure it'll be good then when I heard about 3. I won't spoil anything but I hope Pixar can conclude this series the way it is now and I thank them for decades of Toy Story entertainment."
"ronakkotian","9","1","3","23 July 2019"," Surprisingly great
","When Toy Story 4 was announced, I became quite skeptical. I thought Toy Story 3 had a perfect ending and sendoff to the characters we've grown to love over the years. So initially I was scared. However, I'm happy to say that Pixar have proved once again why they are one of the best animation studios working today.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, this movie was a blast. I had so much fun throughout its entirety. Let's start off with the animation. The animation in this film is downright gorgeous. The colours and textures of everything make the film look very photorealistic. It's safe to say Pixar has excelled in that department. This movie is directed by debutant Josh Cooley. What a debut! His style of direction is impressive especially for a debut. There are so many clever shots utilised especially during scenes that involve a lot of action.<br/><br/>The new characters in the movie are great. Ducky and Bunny, voiced by Key & Peele, are hilarious and a lot of their jokes land. Keanu Reeves voices a character named Duke Caboom who is also entertaining. The main story revolves around the new character Forky who could have been annoying but Pixar made the character more likeable which worked out. It felt so nostalgic seeing Bo Peep once again. I was a bit worried Pixar might change the character to act in a certain way but thankfully that wasn't the case.<br/><br/>The only issue I have with the film is that other supporting characters from the previous films don't have much of a role in this film since the story mainly focuses on Woody, Forky and Bo Peep.<br/><br/>Despite that one negative, this film is awesome. It felt really nice seeing these beloved characters on the big screen once again. The story, animation, screenplay and direction were all superb. There are some great lessons about friendship, change and importance that can be learnt by both children and adults alike. Even though Toy Story 4 is unnecessary, it still is a fantastic installment in the franchise."
"PotassiumMan","10","1","3","23 July 2019"," Wonderfully enjoyable Toy Story sequel
","If you have any uncertainty about the durability of ""Toy Story"" as a film franchise, this sequel should put your doubts to rest. It's a splendid continuation of the saga of Woody and Company as he and his fellow toys adjust to a new era as the toys of Andy's child, Bonnie, and the introduction of a new type of toy into their world, Forky.<br/><br/>On a family road trip, Woody and the other toys come to grips with how their purpose has changed in a new lifetime as toys. They find answers in unexpected places as they cross paths with other toys in their journey. It's a touching and wholesome story that is surprisingly thought-provoking and insightful. I wish all animation films could be like this.<br/><br/>Those of us who have watched Woody and his fellow toys through the years can be grateful for this chapter, a rewarding experience. Recommended to the highest degree to viewers of all ages."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","1","3","21 July 2019"," The true-and ultimately fitting-end to the Toy Story saga
","After the Toy Story ""trilogy"" ended in 2010, I was honestly a little confused and irritated that Disney/Pixar would open up this franchise again for a fourth entry. That being said, I now see the entire ""story"" was not complete at that point. There was still some amount of finality that the franchise had not reached. Of course, now I'll be mad if they decide to make a Toy Story 5 since Toy Story 4 (2019) wrapped everything up so nicely and conclusively. Then again, maybe the next entry in the series will finally explain the odd rules about toy sentience.<br/><br/>By far, the most striking thing about Toy Story 4 is its visuals. I was ten years old when Toy Story (1995) came out. Even in the four years between it and Toy Story 2 (1999), I could see massive improvements in what computers could create in terms of CGI imagery. With Toy Story 3 (2010) having just over a decade to improve its visuals, the technical progress and prowess shown on the screen were breathtaking. Add almost another decade to the last movie, and I was blown away with how realistic this film appeared. In particular, the plastic texture of Woody's (Tom Hanks) skin seemed much more ""toy-like"" than usual.<br/><br/>As for the plot, there was plenty to cover in a limited 100-minute run-time. However, it felt like that was all the time needed to explore the final pieces of this world of toys. After all, Toy Story dealt with the concept of the popularity of toys, Toy Story 2 handled toy stores and toy collectors, and Toy Story 3 took a darker turn into the world of ""shared"" toys at daycare. Toy Story 4 is the logical conclusion of toys that are lost or left behind, along with the toys relegated to the dusty shelves of an antique store. There's not much more to explore in the world of toys after that. At least this one went out with plenty of humor (Key and Peele's stuffed animal characters were a solid highlight) and heart that inevitably left me in tears by the end.<br/><br/>The true-and ultimately fitting-end to the Toy Story saga, I give Toy Story 4 5.0 stars out of 5."

"ThePeruvianPost","9","1","3","19 July 2019"," The New Generation will finally know how does it feel to be a kid again !
","The first time I watched this instalment I was little; we are talking about a seven-year-old kiddo who dreamt bit and could not stop thinking about toys and their unreal yet emotional impact on us. Once the third episode was broadcasted, I cried for hours because the epic animated trilogy, after fifteen years since its first release, did not only conclude my entire childhood, but it taught me so many lessons of life which I still practice to date.<br/><br/>One day though, I received a notification saying that the toys were back and a fourth movie was about to be announced. The news left me abrupted, as if a bitter sensation came into my heart. Something told me Pixar was scheduling a sequel due to the great amount of money collected during the so-called finale. Rubbish! How could anybody do such discreditable thing! I was infuriated, overall. The day came in and I knew that, as a cinephile, before disapproving a movie it was a mere responsibility to watch it first. A fun fact was the surrounded atmosphere of the cinema, everyone else was younger than eleven while I was the only fella who was almost eighteen years old. The opening scene gave the old audience a sense of nostalgia to the point I almost started crying out loud. The most beautiful memories of my life were brought back, the time stopped brusquely and I felt myself as that kiddo I used to be. Nothing has changed at all. I was laughing terribly, I was having fun, I was recalling some backstories and I was engaged with each moment of the movie.<br/><br/>Producing a movie with a vast content is not easy, somehow, it was perfectly balanced and displayed. The new characters as bunny, ducky, the Canadian-motorbike toy and Forky were outstanding. Each of them, committed their objectives in the most satisfying way: natural, original, comical, intrigant and mysterious. Our main character matured profoundly while our beloved toy gang stayed fresh and interactive. Bo-Peep and her three adorable sheep overwhelmed the audience and, at some point, empowered the twentieth-first century women genuinely. No more forced Captain Marvel's style. The villain was well-developed with an emotional flashback.<br/><br/>I realised everything in a matter of minutes, it brought me back so many experiences. Maybe, after all, Pixar is giving its best shot at directing while providing strong values. I love it! (89/100)"
"elliottsoraff","9","1","3","15 July 2019"," A poignant ending to one of the greatest movie series of all time
","On first viewing the trailer to 'Toy Story 4', many including myself were concerned about the creation of yet another film to the franchise because of the potential of tarnishing arguably one of the greatest film trilogies of all time. However, Josh Cooley and the rest of the gang at Pixar, have defied expectations and have put to bed any doubts that had hung over the film since it was first announced that a fourth instalment was on its way. To be perfectly honest, you can not blame myself and others for possessing such grievances because the ending of the third instalment seemed so fitting and it was a clear statement by Pixar that our journey with Andy and his unconditional love for his toys had come to a close.<br/><br/>In regards to the film, while the plot may seem quite cliche of the 'Toy Story' franchise (that being Woody is set with another mission that he feels obliged to complete), the narrative behind the simple plot is absolutely wonderful; layered and beautifully crafted. It answers questions about Woody's determination and allows the spectator to feel closer, relate and align with the characters more than we have ever done before. It's this narrative aspect, coinciding with the themes of love, friendship and acceptance that makes this film the heaviest within the series.<br/><br/>The acclaim this film deserves can not only go on the basis that it's yet another masterpiece by the animation studio that has the power to make people of all ages believe in a ""cartoon"", but also confirms that Pixar stand out from the rest in the sense that they are one of the only companies who do not add more films to their franchises to simply make more money but feel they have the confidence to tell another story and give 'Toy Story' a fulfilling yet poignant send off it deserves.<br/><br/>To everyone at Pixar, In the words of Buzz Lightyear, ""mission accomplished""."

Many people call this the sequel no one needed/wanted but much to our surprise...it's good. It's great even. It lacks a few key things in my opinion that the original three had but it still is a just little prologue to Woody's story. I also think interestingly that much like Toy Story 3 this was made more for the adults that grew up watching Toy Story 1/2 then it is for the kids of this generation. I think my daughter (she's 4) enjoyed it but it is kind of sad, a little creepy, and certainly has Woody at the forefront of the film. One of the things that makes Toy Story so great is all the characters and this one put the main group in the background significantly and that was a little tough to swallow. They have a few key moments but overall, they are reduced to minor supporting characters. We got to meet Ducky and Rabbit and Forky and Duke Kaboom in an sadly small role but all of whom are great additions to the cast and our somewhat villainous Gaby Gaby who also is a good addition.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is magnificent as Woody once again and this story is solely about wrapping his storyline up and it shows. You will leave with some mixed feelings about how this story ends but overall it is fun and exciting and keeps the Toy Story spirit alive and they did a good job of bringing it back one last time (allegedly.) . 8/10"

"dan_slentz","6","1","3","29 June 2019"," It's another Toy Story
","Beautiful work from Pixar.. but on strictly the Toy Story Scale, this was #3 of the 4 they made. The order story and originality is Toy Story 1, 2, 4, and then 3. Pixar does a great job with the story, tears, action and everything you'd expect. It starts with a great story (still waiting for Pixar to bring an Amish storyline to life.. something truly original), and this was very good, but with four Toy Stories, if you weigh it against the others, I'd call is a close (by not quite) 2nd place.
It's fun to look for the TONS of other Pixar reference in this movie as well (lots!) I can add it's interesting to see the multiple versions of Andy based on the quality of digital animation. LOVE Pixar... LOVE their work.. but this wasn't Up or Monsters Inc. quality. I'd MUCH rather see Pixar NOT trying to give us a 4th edition of a movie, but create more of their high quality original NEW story lines. With that said, well worth seeing... may produce tears.. good story... and time will tell if they bring back a Toy Story 5 (keep in mind that Woody is a toy from the 1950's.. and he belonged to SOMEONE before Andy (who we've never heard about). I think I actually COULD go for a cool ""A New Toy Story"".. based on Woody being brand new and in the 1950's (surrounded by 1950's... ala Back to the Future 50's fun!)"
"katieluvsmath-545-680752","9","1","3","29 June 2019"," Dark comedy with a heart
","So let's discuss the ventriloquist dummies in the room first - they are extremely creepy. They don't actually do anything more than chase after our protagonists, but the way they move is unsettling and there are a couple jump scares. If I had seen this at 6 or 7 years old, I would have been buried in my mom's lap in tears. We had one little girl in the audience loudly proclaim she was REALLY ready to go home several times. Another little girl the same age was all smiles and declared it was her new favorite movie. So parents, you know your kids best.
That being said, I do think this movie is best appreciated as a childless adult who grew up watching Toy Story. I was absolutely in the camp that Toy Story 3 had the perfect ending, but having seen this one, it felt like it fit. The characters continue to mature organically, and I'm a HUGE fan of our revamped Bo Peep. She's a fun character to watch, and she adds a new, fresh perspective to the ways a toy can have a fulfilling life. Plus, Toy Story 4 FINALLY relieves us millennials of some of the guilt we all felt losing toys. It's okay! They're out there exploring the world!
Also, Toy Story 4 is hilarious, easily the funniest out of all the movies. Forky had me in tears- I was extremely skeptical about a toy having an existential crisis, but between Tony Hale's voice work and Randy Newman's score, it's the best animated dark comedy version of Frankenstein you'll see on screen. The aforementioned dummies are also extremely funny if you have a certain kind of sick mind (do you enjoy watching people scream in terror when the shark pops up in Jaws? Go with a group of people who are terrified of dummies and you'll have a blast).
The animation, it should be noted, is spectacular. Of course we've come to expect nothing less from Pixar, but there were still several scenes that were just SO beautiful. Even the rainstorm at the beginning had me awestruck at how great their animation has become."

It is more that I feel this sequel was not needed. Toy Story 3 had the most perfect ending they could have given the franchise. For those of us who grew up with the original movie in 1995, watching Andy grow up alongside ourselves and then passing Woody and the gang to another child, hit a deep emotional chord.<br/><br/>This sequel's ending was rather emotional too, it simply didn't reach the height of the previous movie. Everything was in place, the humor, the characters, the animation, they were all on point. I just couldn't help feeling that what I was seeing had no real reason to happen..<br/><br/>To make a long story short, this was a very good movie and a decent addition to the franchise.

"kevinthecritic","9","1","3","25 June 2019"," Toy Story 4: Emotional Finale Will Leave Fans in Tears of Joy
","I didn't want a Toy Story 4. The series was a nearly perfect trilogy, and Pixar's new crop of sequels had been solid but slightly disappointing. Each of them missed what we had loved about the original films, relying more on nostalgia than strong scripts. Thankfully, Toy Story 4 understands exactly why kids and adults alike adore this series, providing a funny, emotional conclusion that, despite minor flaws, is a beautiful swan song that proves some toys should be played with one last time.
Woody (Voiced by Tom Hanks) and the gang have adjusted to their new kid, Bonnie (voiced by Madeleine McGraw). While he isn't getting as much play time as he used to, Woody works hard to bring Bonnie joy, even sneaking into preschool orientation. She creates a spork, calling him Forky (voiced by Tony Hale), and brings him and the gang on a family road trip. However, Forky doesn't want to be her toy and jumps from the RV near a small town rest stop, followed by Woody. Now he and Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) set out to retrieve him, encountering new friends, foes, and even someone from the past who changes everything. The remaining toys prevent the family from leaving, but are otherwise sidelined.<br/><br/>The script for Toy Story 4 was heavily reworked partway through production, thus its pacing and main plot aren't as fluid as previous entries. Two new characters voiced by Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael Key slightly annoyed me, but their humor appealed to the kids in my screening. However, Toy Story 4 retains the heart, clever wit, and subtle complexity of its predecessors, thankfully aimed at my generation more than young kids. It gives me joy to type that Toy Story 4 is a funny, emotionally complex, and wholly satisfying end to one of film's greatest series. See it.<br/><br/>Rated G for Great Ending."

But this sequel usurping the perfect ending of Toy Story 3 just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>I must say that I was quite surprised with the inconsistencies in few of the characters when compared to the first three parts. One of them was Buzz Lightyear, whose character was altered for the sake of additional humour. Woody's pivotal decision at the end also surprised me.<br/><br/>Forky's character was an intelligently conceived one. Other newly conceived characters such as Gaby Gaby, Bensons, Duke Caboom, Ducky, Bunny and Giggle McDimples were enjoyable although lacking emotional connect.<br/><br/>One thing that hasn't changed in this sequel is the heart-rending depiction of the purpose and journey of toys. However moving the movie was, it unfortunately fails to impress as much as its flawless predecessors did."
"gregoryrorke-54328","7","1","3","24 June 2019"," Good but definitely the worst of the four
","Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of the Toy Story movies. When I first heard that Pixar was making a 4th Toy Story movie, I was furious, especially with the way Toy Story 3 ended. However, I read somewhere online that they wouldn't make a 4th film unless it was just as good or better than its predecessor. So that's just what they did, and when I saw the trailers for the first time, I had second thoughts about this film because it actually looked decent. I was actually quite excited after hearing such great reviews. So I came into the theater with high expectations wanting this film to be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, it was FAR from that, but it was still a really good movie. If you're a fan of the Toy Story trilogy, you should definitely see it! It was funny, heartwarming, and enjoyable. The ending was very emotional but I'm not going to give spoilers!! Overall, the movie was really good, but I feel that it didn't have to be made. Go see it for yourself and you may think differently!"
"MovieTim14","9","1","3","24 June 2019"," Great risk gives way to great reward - another Pixar triumph
","Like many, I was nervous about Toy Story 4. The first 3 ""Toy Story"" movies formed not only a perfect trilogy, arguably, but also a conclusive and satisfying ending to the journey we'd experienced with those toys. Why then, add another story to that full circle narrative, and risk adding a blemish to a perfect series? Pixar's answer to that with ""Toy Story 4"" is to go where very few stories, let alone Hollywood movies go, and ask the question of ""who are you after your purpose has been fulfilled?"" By doing so, ""Toy Story 4"" is a wonderful and beautiful addition to the series that stands both as a standalone adventure as well as a great epilogue to everything that came before, and shows that the greater the risk, the greater the reward.<br/><br/>The deepening of the themes of the Toy Story series help legitimize the existence of this entry, but as a movie itself, ""Toy Story 4"" also happens to be every bit the fun, warm, and superbly crafted film that each of its predecessors were. The adventure is another fun romp in the lives of toys. The movie is frequently hilarious, and the humor is actually much darker in some places than I was expecting (a plus for adults and things that kids probably won't catch). Pixar's grasp of characters is on full display, with every new addition to the cast not only being likeable, but also instantly relatable and easy to understand. My only gripe with the film is that it feels like the old cast of supporting characters don't really get their time in the sun here. It's understandable when looking at the plot, but unfortunately it lessens the weight the ending should have just a little bit. Despite that, the movie is heartwarming and touching the way every great Pixar movie is.<br/><br/>The final standout for me that I haven't mentioned yet is the animation, which is incredible. I happened to catch the first ""Toy Story"" on TV just before I headed to the theater for this one, and the way the animation has evolved in the past 24 years is STAGGERING! This movie is pretty much photorealistic, and Pixar uses a number of setpieces that involve both weather and lighting to put their mastery on full display, with stunning results.<br/><br/>Definitely give ""Toy Story 4"" a watch. If you're nervous because these films hold such a special place in your heart, like I was, I think you'll find that the love you have for them will allow you to love this final entry as well."
"brandonmullin","7","1","3","24 June 2019"," Real Story 4
","From the simple life of a kids toys to the complex life as an adult, Toy Story has become a Real Story.
I have grown up with Toy Story and feel like it's story has followed me thru my life experiences. The fourth installment is the end that no one needed, but an end that leads to new beginnings. The movie starts off narratively slow and takes a long time to build. It's not a funny movie and certainly isn't just a kids movie, this movie is for we adults who were kids when Toy Story began. Little kids may find it complex and hard to understand an enjoy, but as an adult it's message of scary and unexpected new beginnings hits home all to real. I find the characters were at times distant from their traditional roles and in a way the screenplay is not well crafted, but it's message of moving on is really real and it's hidden message of understanding your enemy and not ultimately seeking their destruction is refreshing and one I hope kids watching understand.
I hope this is the last Toy Story movie, not because I want the story to end or because the series has gotten bad, but because I want new stories to begin. I want to keep Toy Story as a simple Toy Story, I don't want the characters or message to grow up. Toy Story is a timeless, pioneering and brilliant story that lives in everyone, but the simple brilliance of the story is that it is akin to a time when your life is simple and going any further risks fans loosing that simple recognition that it's characters were to us. This movie was good, this movie inspires deep emotions, but this move was not great entertainment and could have been much better if it was more simple, more of a Toy Story, than a Real Story."
"calebdrums","10","1","3","24 June 2019"," How do you top perfection? Like this!
","Toy Story is one of those animated franchises that you remember watching as a kid, and then growing up with. If you were anything like me, Sid and his creepy toy creations scared you and your parents didn't allow you to watch it again until you were older, or in other words, eight instead of five. But getting to grow up with this franchise has been a sheer delight. The first movie was brilliant, and the series has never stopped topping itself. The second movie was incredibly well written, and has stood the test of time as being one of those rare occasions when a sequel stands up to the original movie. The third one is a work of perfection, with no flaws whatsoever.<br/><br/>But if the third one was perfection, then how, as a studio, do you have the guts to take a movie that had everything, including the perfect ending, and attempt to better it? After all, by definition, perfection is, well, perfect! But somehow, someway, Pixar have managed to do the impossible. They have topped Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>This movie had all the hallmarks of not only a timeless Pixar film, but a timeless animated film in general. It had amazing animation, with some incredibly intricate work hidden amidst the vastness of scenes like the carnival and the antique store. The store itself was an animated set piece to marvel at, with all of the different antiques having their own unique place in the film. It felt like careful thought was put into that, and animating the backgrounds is just as important as the foregrounds.<br/><br/>I was also impressed with the way they animated Bonnie's first day of kindergarten. To the average adult, a kindergarten classroom is simply that: a classroom. It's nothing to be frightened of, or set in a place of complete domination in your psyche. But for Bonnie, and for most kids that age, it is an incredibly scary environment. In another instance of incredible attention to detail, Pixar oriented the cameras to capture everything from Bonnie's point of view. You feel the absolute horror she's feeling as she heads into elementary school for the first time. The room is gigantic, and it feels endless. The kids are all loud and new and different, and that can be very off putting to a kid at that age. You can read Bonnie's emotions, and she doesn't have to go into a cliche tantrum out of fright. When she sits down and another kid comes over and steals her art supplies, it's like she's lost her best friend. But then she creates Forky, and the rest is Toy Story history.<br/><br/>The level of emotion shown in this movie is magnificent. At the end, when Woody says ""farewell"" forever to the gang we've come to know and love, you can see the pain each character is feeling. Yet, through this pain, there are major glimmers of happiness. Woody has found another purpose in life: bringing toys and kids together! That's something that's really cool. They don't just fling Woody aside and let the other toys walk all over him in his relative ""old age."" They almost retire him, and let him go on new adventures with Bo Peep and her friends.<br/><br/>I've gotta give major props to Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, who give majorly hilarious performances in this movie as Ducky and Bunny. These are plush animals who, on the one hand, seem to be having some kind of existential crisis about ""what they look like on the inside,"" but on the other, are two toys who just want a kid to make happy. These two steal the show every moment they're on screen, and Keegan and Jordan's vocal effects are just as funny as their written dialogue.<br/><br/>I also love how the movie doesn't have cut and dry heroes or villains. After the disappointment that was Thanos in Avengers: Endgame, the use of Gabby Gabby here felt completely refreshing. Having her become a reformed antagonist towards the end of the picture, while keeping Woody a very flawed character, was a brilliant idea, and their chemistry on screen is amazing.<br/><br/>The reintroduction of Bo Peep is also amazing. I thought they were gonna ride the feminism hype train and have her be a masculine female character, but they didn't. They made her independent and brave, without making her lose any of the things that make her who she is, and that was also brilliant. Watching her rekindle her soft romance with Woody was a delight, and the two work very well together.<br/><br/>On the tiniest of downsides, the movie does take a little bit to get going. But once it does, it's such an enjoyable ride. You don't want it to end. I thought Toy Story 3 had the perfect ending, but that was just Woody saying goodbye to Andy. Watching him say goodbye to the other toys may be even more heart wrenching. The perfect ending line to the perfect way to end a near perfect franchise is said between Woody and Buzz: ""To infinity, and beyond."" That's a perfect way to describe this film, and in this reviewer's opinion, it's the best in the entire franchise."

"nicetryjan","8","1","3","23 June 2019"," Great, but not better than 3.
","As soon as Toy Story 4 was announced, I said that the third one was going to be hard to beat. And after seeing the fourth entry, that statement is still true.<br/><br/>This film should not be considered as a continuation of Toy Story 3. It takes place two years later with Bonnie finally entering Kindergarten. Woody, to his dismay, is one of her least favorites. He gets left in the closet, and even has his sheriff badge torn off only to see it being placed on Jessie. He still cares about Bonnie, and sneaks into her backpack to see how she does at kindergarten orientation. Without realizing it, he essentially helps Bonnie create Forky, a plastic spork that she now considers her favorite toy.<br/><br/>Is it a good film? Absolutely. The story itself is good and the animation is top notch beautiful. Does it capture the essence of the previous films? No. Which is why I think it shouldn't be compared to the other three. This Toy Story focuses on the new characters while the original characters, aside from Woody and Buzz, get left in the dust. Rex, Slinky, Potato Heads, Hamm, Bullseye, and Jessie are hardly seen in the movie and the only time Jessie is relevant is when she makes the tire on the RV go flat. I realize they had to make room for the new characters, but they could've made the original characters have some relevance instead of having them stay inside of the RV the whole time. Especially since they've been, for the most part, crucial characters in the previous films.<br/><br/>Now, the ending. It was emotional, but it did feel kind of rushed and out of character. The whole reason Woody didn't go to college with Andy in TS3 is because he didn't want to leave his friends. And the reason he didn't go to Japan in TS2 is because he didn't want to leave his kid and wanted to stay with his friends. In this one, he abruptly decides to leave Buzz and the rest of the gang so he can travel the world with Bo Peep, who he hasn't seen in 9 years. This film takes place over the course of a day. Woody even mentions loyalty in this film. You call that being loyal? For once I have to disagree with Woody. You're gonna leave your friends that you've known your whole life for a Toy you haven't seen in nine years? I realize, if he went with Bonnie, he just would've been thrown in the closet again. It just seems out of character for Woody to make that kind of decision in such a small amount of time.<br/><br/>I did enjoy it. I enjoyed the quick flashback at the beginning followed by You've Got a Friend in Me. I'd rank it the third best. 3 2 4 1. Thats how I rank it."
"TheDreadedChampion2019","6","1","3","23 June 2019"," Toy Story - The Continuing Adventures
","SOME MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
""My overall feeling for this film having just walked out of it was a bit of disappointment. And its actually a solid movie. However solid is not good enough for a franchise like Toy Story. Now I am of the perhaps minority opinion that the first two Toy Story films were the best ones, exercises in near perfect storytelling. I liked the third one. Everyone talks about the ending with Andy or the scene where the toys almost get incinerated. But to me the rest of the film was mainly serviceable. Ken was great. But overall I feel it didn't quite live up to the very high standard of the original two.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 feels more in the vein of 3 as well. So if you're one of the many people that absolutely love TS3 you will probably love this one.<br/><br/>Its weird because TS3 felt like a fitting send off to all of these characters, so to see them back again is strange. It feels more like a sort of toy story dlc if you will, or the ""continuing adventures of"" if you will then a full on true sequel.<br/><br/>Here are the pros of the film... as a whole its an entertaining 90 minutes filled with humor and good storytelling, and what's more you get to revisit these wonderful characters again. I liked the idea of bringing back Bo Peep and addressing her absence in the last film. The new characters are the best part of the movie, Forky, Duke Kaboom, and the Key and Peele duo...<br/><br/>Now for the cons... I found it to be very emotionally manipulative and exploitive, much like Toy Story 3. Every other scene is trying to make you cry, it just kind of wallows in sappy emotions. The first two had great emotional scenes without seeming manipulative or manufactured in any way. I don't know it just felt laid on a little too thick for me... also Woody is so clingy in this one to the point of annoyance. He's not as heroic or dashing as he has been in the past, more whiney and honestly kind of a pushover.<br/><br/>Also Buzz Lightyear. The once great character has been, for the second film in a row, relegated to merely a supporting player. He has a sort of arc, more of a running gag really, about him learning to listen to his ""inner voice"". But its not enough. Its honestly a tragedy to see this iconic character being given so little to work with, static, no longer evolving or being as active in the stories.<br/><br/>Bo Peep was cool and it was great to see her again... BUT at the same time it really takes some suspending of disbelief to accept such a significant transformation of the character we know from the first two films. She was never really a go-getter take action type in the others. Of course I can see see how she might have evolved having been on her own for so many years, and I do realize she was more of a side character before and they had to flesh her out... still I couldn't help but feel she was a different person to the point of even betraying who she has been established to be.... its really more of a gripe than a true negative.<br/><br/>The Gabby Doll voiced by Christina Hendricks literally forces Woody to give up his voice box and we're supposed to turn around and feel sorry for her. I mean that was pretty clunky handled I think.<br/><br/>A lot of the original toys are back and yet they are simply just... there. You see their faces but they contribute almost nothing. Why even include them in the film? I just see the first two films as having more depth and nuance with these characters. They were firing on all cylinders creatively. And now, to a degree, Toy Story has been reduced to nostalgia and trying to milk all of those tear jerker moments.<br/><br/>But I have to say, I enjoyed a change of scenery. The highways, an antique store, a carnival... and I did enjoy the Woody and Bo Peep stuff overall, it was really the soul of this movie. I was so glad to see them together again...""<br/><br/>TOY STORY 4 is a decent movie, I liked it. Its just not quite on par with the originals."
"henryau-29344","10","1","3","23 June 2019"," A sequel I didn't think I wanted
","Enjoyed it as much as previous Toy Stories. This time, there isn't really much of an antagonist, and some people are criticizing its lack of story or character development. Well, to me, it's really about Woody and his feelings of falling into nothingness. For real, this time, not like before just out of jealousy when Buzz was the new hot thing or when Andy grew up and transitioning owners with everyone else.<br/><br/>Why care about some random trash toy like Forky, ppl have asked. Because you care about Woody, that's why. He says straightly that keeping him safe is the only thing he can do - you can associate that with depression, midlife crisis, old age, and a bunch of other life issues while not being so apparent to kids. A man's trash is another man's treasure, your dream not coming true but things can still work out, and still more.<br/><br/>Bo's reintroduction is great, and serves as imo the second main character in the movie. Without spoilers, she and Woody have a touching end if you focus on Woody's character and not huff about other characters getting enough screentime. I liked Gabby and Duke Caboom as well. The two birds ranged from slightly annoying to amusing.<br/><br/>It might be crazy, but I can see another sequel to this easily."

It's been 24 years since the first Toy Story-1995 was the first, 1999 was the second & 2010 was the third-and it is still a good family entertainment film for both kids and adults. Don Rickles passed away in 2017-he voiced Mr Potato Head-but they did use previous recordings of his voice for this film, with Mr Rickles' family's permission, of course. The music is still by Randy Newman, too. Annie/Bo Peep is separated from the gang at the beginning of the movie-don't worry, she shows up later-and a new character is created, Tony/Forky, who happens to be made from an eating utensil. After an accident on a family road trip separates Tony from the family, Tom/Woody and Tim/Buzz Lightyear lead a search and rescue mission to bring him home. They meet some other new toys and valuable life lessons along their journeys. There are some scenes during the end credits and one at the very end, too.
It's rated ""G"" for some mild language and frightening and intense scenes and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.

","Having just rewatched the previous three films , I was really excited going into this movie. I never expected it to be better than Toy Story 3 , but I knew that I'd watch Woody and the gang set out on a new adventure. The animation was excellent , something which shows that the Pixar team really worked hard in making this movie possible. The story , however , just wasn't good enough. Most of the original characters( Slinky Dog ,Hamm, Rex, Jessie, Bullseye, Mr and Mrs Potato Head etc. ) had little to no involvement in the progression of the story. The movie's main focus was to introduce new characters. It was still fun, but not as good as the original three. The kids are going to love it and adults are going to spot some positive messages such as the importance of loyalty and the power of letting go. It is definitely worth a watch since everyone views things differently and might enjoy this more than I did."
"HairyMart1","8","1","3","22 June 2019"," Still going strong
","Twenty four years since Toy Story was released, and if nothing else this just shows how amazing the creative talent at PIXAR. Once again Woody and the other toys find themselves in a perilous adventure attempting to rescue the newly added toy - Forky, from the not so friendly occupants of an antique store. As before with consummate ease the makers managed to bring out the more sinister elements of certain toys, this time it's the classic old style ventriloquist dummy, aptly named Vincent. Peppering in some yet further additions to the troupe of toys, and then allowing them via own comic vignette, and you have the makings for yet another Pixar classic. But not quite, there is as before an underlying story of change and loss, previously as Toys came to terms with their ""child"" leaving them behind. Here it's more around Woody coming to terms with making a ""life"" for himself, which is well handled, but in doing so most of the supporting characters get pretty much sidelined, and the family of toys element is weakened by this, and so lessens the story arc of the film itself. Still a film to see, as what other U cert film could get in such a meaningy homage to The Shining !"

I like the development of the villain (Gaby Gaby), her arc and how she evolves. The initial scene with the rain and how they tell us what happened with Bo Peep 9 years ago is GREAT. The new characters Forky, Ducky and Bunny, Duke Caboom and Giggle McDimples are great. The road that Woody has to travel and how he has to get rid of his past with Andy is very well done. The ending with Woody and Buzz Lightyear is one of the best things I've seen. 3D animation is the biggest thing that Pixar has done, there are times that even it looks real."
"TomTomH","Null","1","3","22 June 2019"," An inessential, but incredibly entertaining fourth entry of an all-time great movie series
","Toy Story 4 - yep, you read that right - is finally here. The sequel nobody asked for comes 9 long years after the 3rd, 20 after the 2nd and 24 after the original. Fourth instalments can be risky business, and the question remains if Pixar can make one without tarnishing childhood memories and a concept that worked 3 times in a row.<br/><br/>Leave any concerns at the door. While it feels like an offshoot in comparision to the original trilogy, the surprising part of this third sequel is how well it works. It's same-old same-old, exactly how it should be, but the filmmakers have triumphantly brought the series back to life without it looking like a fluke. It cooks up everything you could possibly want from a Toy Story film, nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>The plot continues years after Andy gives his childhood toys to Bonnie before going off to college. A sensitive new toy Forky joins the gang as Bonnie and her parents embark on a holiday, which goes in another direction. Woody, ending up at an amusement park while on the way, bumps into Bo Peep as a completely different person. She has a confident and warrior type of personality compared to what she was like previously. It's an intriguing piece of character development that Pixar has rarely attempted to do.<br/><br/>In nearly a decade of development, screenwriters Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom have mostly succeeded at reviving the humour and character moments that have made the series so memorable. They tell a story that repeats the franchise's old school tropes without them feeling stale, and the addition of Forky makes all the difference. His dialogue scenes with Woody alongside the overarching theme of existentialism create a sense of freshness in the formula. These small inclusions are what the film required, in order to stand out.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and the ensemble cast work hard with the material they are given. The latest members of the voice cast are nothing short of brilliant. 20 years after The Matrix, Keanu Reeves reinvents himself once again as Duke Kaboom, a voice role he was born to play. Keegan Michael-Key and Get Out director Jordan Peele have tons of fun voicing Ducky and Bunny, bantering with one another as if they're dressed up as their characters on stage. They have such great chemistry that many would hope that they get a spin-off TV show together someday. The newbies are franchise characters you never knew you needed, and who knows what Pixar will do with them in the future.<br/><br/>Prepared to be wowed by the animation, as it takes the divisive 'uncanny valley' effect to the next level. Though this isn't stop motion animation, it's a perfect example of how computer animation can smash through the surreal window towards reality. Unlike many computer animated films of the past few years, every shot looks like a painting, with each object in the frame designed and textured flawlessly. It definitely shows how far we've come since Toy Story invented CGI animation back in 1995. It even looks better than the CGI used in many live action films, and that's saying something.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is not the best of the series. A portion of the original characters aren't given very much to do throughout the runtime, in favour of focusing on the new ones. The villain, without spoiling anything, lacks the menacing characterisations of Sid, Stinky Pete and Lotso. This ultimately makes for a Toy Story instalment with something unheard of: a low-stakes storyline.<br/><br/>Despite the script issues, this is a damn good sequel, and a nostalgic treat for those who grew up with these characters. It doesn't have the emotional weight and rich storytelling of its predecessor, but it makes up for that with pure popcorn entertainment.<br/><br/>Woody at some point mentions that, ""You can teach an old toy new tricks."" When it comes to a third sequel, this is exactly what it sets out to do, and thankfully succeeds."

","When the news broke that there was to be a fourth Toy Story I did worry that this was just a money making decision and not a creative one. However, the fourth film more than holds its own in the now quadriology. It is beautifully animated, the best quality Pixar film thus far. The story follows a similar format to the previous three, although there isn't a moment in this film when you truly feel the main characters are in any form of danger. It's nice to get an understanding of where Bo Peep disappeared to all those years ago. This really is Woody's film, the culmination of the past 24 years. Tom Hanks is, as you'd expect, great as Woody struggles to find a purpose now that Andy has gone and Bonnie doesn't require him quite so much. The new additions all play their part, Keanu Reeves, Jordan Peele & Keegan-Michael Key provide the majority of the humour ( and in parts this film is properly funny). Overall, the film is satisfying but it doesn't reach the perfection of its predecessors. Most of the main gang are sidelined during the film. Forky is quirky but at times I found him annoying. The ending felt a tad rushed and that blunted the emotional impact for me. I wasn't overly keen on the Gabby Gabby character either, I felt she was one new character too many. Overall though, another great entry in to the Pixar catalogue & if this really is goodbye it is a more than satisfying way to say it."
"LukeCraw4d","9","1","3","21 June 2019"," Wow.
","This movie has so much heart and it really does a good job of making the viewer be invested in every character. It is so damn funny and tear jerking at the same time. All the characters have an ark that is really well written. The animation is the best I've literally ever seen in a movie. The last thing is how good they did at getting the characters to understand different points of view and how one should think independently and not just what others do. This movie has a lot of heart a good message and really just beautiful."

","First off, I'll say that 'Toy Story 4 (2019)' is, in and of itself, rather good. I suppose it was bound to be; it's Pixar, after all. It looks incredibly impressive, its near photo-real environments meshing with its stylistic characters, and it has several interesting ideas under the hood. The problem comes when you consider its place within the franchise. Even if it was perfect, it would still be like painting a Picasso on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel: that is to say, stepping on the toes of its predecessor. Its ending, while somewhat resonant, leaves things in a far less satisfying place than 'Toy Story 3 (2010)' did. Unless you totally ignore it, it - essentially - stains your memory of these characters. This wouldn't be a bad thing if the piece felt as though it had a crystal clear and absolutely vital story to tell. It just doesn't though, struggling to conflate its previously mentioned interesting ideas into a strong theme able to consistently drive its characters (and vice versa) - something all three of the prior titles did amazingly well. Here, this struggle leads to some oddly dissonant moments and a sense of, perhaps, too many cooks (or concepts) in the kitchen. As an example, Forky's much-advertised existential crisis essentially only acts as an inciting incident, despite being the most intriguing addition to the canon. Also, the side characters - such as Rex, Ham, Potato-Head and, even, Jessie - are strangely side-lined despite having no real reason not to go on the adventure (they tend to just wait around - though, they do get some action, as an ensemble, later on). In general, the writing isn't as strong as you'd like and the humour is a little lacking, too. Of course, the flick never totally fumbles and still tells a mostly enjoyable tale. It seems to have its heart in the right place, it moves at a decent pace and, in the moment, it's pretty much as likeable as ever. As a stand-alone, it's a decent experience that's actually better than the majority of movies already released in 2019. As a sequel, it's a bit of a retread that doesn't really match the quality of the series' previous entries. If you're a fan of the franchise, you may actually get less out of it than if you're not. It's a lot better than 'Incredibles 2 (2018)', though. 7/10"
"sala151183","9","1","3","21 June 2019"," As great or better than previous 3 films.
","Of course we were all apprehensive about Toy Story 4 but when you've watched it you'll soon realise why on earth did I feel that way.
Toy Story 4 is not just a great film it's also as good or better than the previous 3 films.
They really capture moments with Woody in particular and the new characters fit into the film like we've always known them.
You thought Toy Story 3 ending was emotional, Errrrrr wait until you've seen the ending of toy story 4.
It's so rare to find such a great trilogy but for them to introduce a 4th film and it being just as great as the previous 3 is unlike anything before."
"arskhemnanilack","9","1","3","21 June 2019"," Toy Story 4 - 9.5/10
","This movie is easily my favorite so far of 2019. It easily exceeds expectations, and surely lives up to the rest of the Toy Story franchise. I, like many other people really thought this movie would suck, being that Disney is known for profiting off of nostalgia and it's a trend for companies to reboot old movies just for money, but I forgot that this is a Pixar movie. You can tell they poured so much work and time into this movie, with the animation being incredible and looking very realistic when it has to be as well. Comedy just always seems to land, with jokes not geing too corny or too childish, being a lot more funny than I expected and definitely the funniest out of the 4 movies. The cast did an incredible job, but so did the newer characters such as Duke Caboom voiced by Keanu Reeves and 2 plush toys voiced by Key and Peele. I have to say, Key and Peele were incredible, and stole the show from the moment they came on screen. Tony Hale killed it as Forky, the main new character, and added tons of comedy throughout the first half. What makes Toy Story so great is that the story is something for the whole family, no matter how old or young you are, the story will always make sense to you and have meaning to all. This film takes the right steps, knowing when there's something serious going on and when there isn't. You actually feel sorrow for these characters, and sympathize with them. It's movies like these that just show the potential of film, how a literal story about toys and children can teach you life lessons and make you feel for plastic figures. Though, this movie falls short on a couple things. Firstly, it's only 1 hour and 40 minutes, and so it does feel quite short once the credits roll and that's quite a downside. Some scenes feel a bit unnecessary and some a little repetitive at times which can take away from the atmosphere. Regardless, Toy Story is the perfect family movie franchise that it always has and will be throughout time. You will definitely walk out of this movie with a smile and have had a great time. There are a few short scenes throughout the credits, about 3 or 4 which are quite important and funny as well."

Got bored almost instantly and only watched the entire thing because we regretfully rented it. The story picked up a little but overall remained empty. It felt more like work than entertainment watching Woody constantly trying to keep a certain character from causing a problem. There was a weird depressing undertone the whole way through.<br/><br/>The original creators (if they were even involved in making the fourth addition) completely lost the whole point of the previous Toy Story movies.

I watched the whole movie purely because it looked amazing..The story was beautiful, heartwarming and bubble all over..at least at one point it is. The move opens up with Woody sacrificing bo peep for Andy...Yes a love triangle. Apparently Wood's love for andy is stronger than his love for Bo peep. And this is why the movie does not work. Bo peep has a transformation...she likes to be independent now. But woody only chooses the independent life for her after it was already explained that she is not as important as being played with...god that sounds dirty..So woody really only chooses her because his first love is no longer in love with him...that message is MESSED up...I hope none of the kids caught onto that!"

","Toy story 4 is just as good as the other 3 films. If not, better. I think it's incredible! However the film only focuses on a few characters. It does exclude some of the main characters from the other 3 Toy story movies from the main story in this one. New characters are introduced in this film. Such as, Forky, Duke Caboom, Gabby Gabby, Ducky and Bunny and much more unfamiliar faces. I think they are such a good part of the story. But overall I think Toy story 4 is amazing. It has such as good feel to it, it almost made me cry. The story is a bit upsetting at some parts. But to be honest, I think it adds more of a great feel to it. In my opinion it is the best Toy story get. Thank you Pixar for marking such a great movie!"

","Im definitely among the crowd that didnt rush out to see this because I questioned why this needed to exist other than as a cash grab. Im surprised to say while its not as thickly packed with emotional beats as the first three its definitely not a step down in quality. I was thoroughly invested in the story within the first act. More importantly, while 3 provided closure for the concept of the living toys, this provides closure for the central characters and is solid as an ending to the series. If youre one of the types that has noticed a step divide in quality of pixar films you can rest assured this still fits in the ""good"" pixar category. I still would stand firm that this has gotta be it. Any Toy story movies after this are going to have serious deminishing returns."

","I thought the movie was entertaining and somewhat heartwarming when I saw it with a friend. Sadly, I found Toy Story 4 predictable as soon as Woody reunited with Bo-Peep. Including the scene when Woody leaves the gang and decides to stay with Bo-Peep, which I predicted right from the start. In my opinion, that should not be the case.<br/><br/>Secondly, the film is upsetting as it does mean the group of toys that I grew up with, just won't be the same anymore without Woody. Woody leaving the gang highlights a problem as his decision contradicts the message of the previous three movies. In the last three movies, Woody expresses that a toy's purpose is to be there for a child always. However, to see Woody just split with the group was odd."
"stuartpiles","5","1","4","4 August 2019"," A good film, not the best not the worst, but an average film.
","I was disappointed because I expected more. By more I mean more drama, more inclusion of something special, not just an average experience. It left something lacking and undefined. This film certainly is not the level of the first 3 Toy Stories. It lacks the quality of any outstanding animated film. I left the theater feeling like I missed something. It was not an excellent film but average. That is not what I expected. I have seen many animated films going back more than 50 years. While this was not the best and not the worst, but I would not recommend it. While there are some good parts, there are some uneven and bad parts. I guess the best way to describe this is to say that Toy Story 4 is not fun, and that says a whole lot."
"tobysillett","5","1","4","29 July 2019"," Unnecessary
","I loved toys story 1-3. One of the only trilogy's where each film was as strong as the previous one. Unfortunately, toy story 4 did not need to be made, it finished perfectly well at no. 3. This film just felt like a money making opportunity and nothing more. SPOILER. I heard people saying it was a tear jerker, I'm guessing they meant the end where Woody decides to leave to gang and stay as a lost toy with Bo Peep. It might have been emotional if any of the other toys had a line in the film! Sadly they were hardly in it, I don't think Mr Potato Head had a single line so this part does not pull on the heart strings at all.<br/><br/>On its own, away from the franchise, it's an enjoyable enough film. The new characters are funny, it probably would have been better just to have introduced the new characters early, said goodbye to the old ones and start a new thread of toy story movies with a completely different cast maybe???"
"ericstevenson","10","1","4","22 July 2019"," They did it again!
","This is the best fourth installment I've ever seen in any series! I remember back when this very website said that there was a ""Toy Story 4"", but then in the FAQ it was just said to be a hoax. I guess it was real after all! Many people were skeptic because ""Toy Story 3"" was the perfect finale to the series. I knew they had to make a major change if they would make it as good as the other ones. I remember when the ending was coming and I said that I went the way, I would put this on the same pedestal as the previous ones.<br/><br/>And guess what happened? The previous movie mentioned that Bo Peep had left, but they never showed how. They do in the first six minutes of this film! So the plot is that Bonnie literally makes a new toy out of a spork and googly eyes which turns out be a real toy! ""Sporky"" can't understand his status as a toy and tries to leave the family when they're on a road trip. Turns out he more or less accepts that he's a toy in the first thirty minutes of the movie!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Woody and Sporky have to deal with a villain named Gabby, who wants to steal Woody's voicebox. Duke Kaboom (voiced by Keanu Reeves) doesn't appear until halfway through the movie. He ends up still being a great character! This movie has great joke after great joke and everything else great! It's great how they worked so hard to flesh out Bo Peep's characters. It's too bad that some of the voice cast had died, which is why they don't have that much of a role here (especially Mr. Potato Head with Don Rickles). ****"

Me and my friend spotted several Easter Eggs, but this movie hides so many of them very well indeed.
Gabby Gabby has a great redemption story, though the other toys don't get much screen time, every second they're on screen is great. Ham and the ""But's it's money line"" was brilliant.
But the best scene by far is with Bunny and Ducky and their choices on how to get the key from that old shop keep.

","I have always been a fan of the Toy Story films and have loved every film that has come out of the franchise as well as in general being a huge Pixar fan loving almost every movie that the studio has created. Now being 9 years since Toy Story 3 came out, the fourth and probably from many of the films choices the final film in the franchise is here.<br/><br/>I was at first concerned when I first heard this movie was being made since it first seemed that it was going to mess with the emotional finality that the third film established. But after watching Toy Story 4, it comes as a very welcome extension aswell as new end to the franchise.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was fanstastic, from the incredibly detailed and beautiful looking animation aswell as the stunning locations and characters old and new. Forky was an excellent addition to the main cast of characters. I was scared he was going to be an annoying side character, but he ended up being quite a depth and layered character and was very enjoyable in the film.<br/><br/>The reintroduction of Bo Peep was also great and also came a nice surprise that her character came with a much needed facelift, being much more outgoing, adventurous and independent for plot reasons I won't go into in this review. Her animation was also very beautiful looking aswell, since she is made of china. The movie's villain was also surprisingly depthed, and very refreshing in the way the character was executed.<br/><br/>
Overall, I had a very fun time with Toy Story 4. It is probably the most mature of all four of the films with its main messages even though the film isn't as emotionally thematic as the previous film, but is still very heartwarming, enjoyable and beautiful looking film. If you're a Toy Story fan or just overall a Pixar fan in general, definitely see it. You will not be disappointed"

Unlike the last pixar movies, this one has no short before the film but a trailer for the upcoming Pixar movie next year called Onward, which looks promising. Go see this in Dolby as it uses the full potential of the Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos along with the vibrating seats. Highly recommended for all ages!!!"

"loshidragon","9","1","4","1 July 2019"," HILARIOUS
","I enjoyed Toy Story 4 - I wasn't sure what could be done after TS3 because it felt like the perfect ending but TS4 was a perfect conclusion to Woody's purpose. The entire franchise focuses on his purpose being to support Andy but that no longer fell in place being in Bonnie's toy box. I loved it. Key and Peele stole the show though, they were incredibly hilarious. Not too big on Keanu Reeves' role... not sure why it got so much hype. The ending was heartfelt and emotional. With Woody and Buzz going their separate ways, I don't see another TS film working.... but they may prove me wrong because TS4 was refreshing and an updated outlook to the world of living toys."

","I didn't know following Toy Story 3 if another chapter was necessary. I am happy to say after watching the fourth installment of the franchise that it was a story that needed to be told. The first film came out when I was 7 years old. Andy was around the same age. I grew up with these characters, but only after watching this fourth film did I realize the characters were growing up with me. After the third film you realize that Woody and Buzz being passed on to Bonnie was representative of these characters being passed on to a new generation of children. We had to pass them on to the next generation as much as we felt like they belonged to us, just as Andy did with Bonnie.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the film, it does feel conclusive. Like we finally are saying goodbye. And just like the emotion of passing the characters on to the new generation through Bonnie, the feeling that we are saying goodbye translates to the characters in this film.<br/><br/>Woody, Buzz, even though it feels like it's over, I'm glad I got to see you again.<br/><br/>When you'll see the movie, you'll understand."
"cinephile-27690","10","1","4","29 June 2019"," The Best Toy Story Sequel, And One Of The Top 5 Pixar Movies!
","If you love Disney, Pixar, and Toy Story in general-go see this movie as soon as you can! Toy Story 4 a must see for any Disney fan!<br/><br/>Before I continue my praise, it seems appropriate for me to give a quick synopsis: When Bonnie(the girl in the previous movie) is about to start kindergarten, she's worried about starting school. So at orientation, a week before school actually begins, she makes Forky-a spork that comes to life after she puts him together.<br/><br/>He later gets lost, so Woody helps him get back to Bonnie, with old and new friends found on the way.<br/><br/>If you go back to the original movie from 1995, the animation isn't bad, but it's not top notch either, since feature length animated movies were a budding project. Now that 24 years have past(yes, that long!)-the animation is great! This is some of the best animation Pixar has done to date!<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is also one of the company's funniest movies, I can only name Finding Nemo right now as a more comedic movie. I watched this with a friend, and we both laughed loud and hard quite a few times!<br/><br/>We also both cried a little, which is kind of hard for either of us to do when watching movies. I don't think you'll be bawling, but prepare for a few tears, and a few tissues may be required for some.<br/><br/>I'm trying to think of any minor flaws, and I truly can't think of any. The plot, animation, character development, plot twists, etc. are all close to perfection as I could imagine. Also, if I had to rank the 4, I'd say: 1, 4, 2 and 3.<br/><br/>I was concerned on if Forky would be an enjoyable character as well, but I was wrong to fear-he was an endearing character!<br/><br/>The end of the movie seem to imply that after 4 movies, this is the end for the Toy Story franchise. I think it's time, we've had 4 movies in 24 years. But this is a well worthy conclusion of the series.<br/><br/>My friend and me said when it ended that we wondered why there had to be a 4TH Toy Story, but this showed that even a 4th movie can be worth seeing. Maybe not always, but here, it is well used. So you have 2 recommendations in one review!<br/><br/>If you have not seen Toy Story 4 yet, do so as soon as you can! It's well worth it. If I can't convince you within the above paragraphs, I don't know what will. This is a charming Pixar movie and a sequel worthy of the series. It's a masterpiece of animation.<br/><br/>Warning: No character is super evil like Sid, Zurg, or Lotso, but prepare for a creepy doll if you have a sensitive child.<br/><br/>Note: If you found this review helpful, please click on cinephile-27690 for more reviews to read.

"MarkyLouiG","9","1","4","27 June 2019"," Best animated franchise . . Hands down
","Ok I had How to Train your Dragon and Toy Story as my top animated franchises. But after this I can say that Toy Story is my personal pick as the best animated franchise. First of all the animation is superb; the attention to detail mind-blowing. But the thing that has always set Toy Story apart is its story. The franchise has been consistent with just presenting audiences with heartfelt stories that capture your attention as well as your heart; and the fourth instalment made no difference. The story is again heartfelt and sweet as well as it is incredibly deep. The voice work is fantastic; all of them were great, the humour in the film is fantastic. Key and Peele were amazing they were hilarious AF. And I just enjoyed the hell out of this movie. This is certainly the priceless gem in the list of animated franchises. I really don't have a lot of issues with the film but the biggest issue I had was with Buzz Lightyear. I get that there are new characters that are introduced and some of the old characters had to take a huge step back. But I do feel that they executed it in a way that no one is really overshadowed anyone, however Buzz just went completely backwards. He is established as Woody's right hand man, but in this film he is completely changed and it feels like his character growth was negated. Over than that I really don't have much to complain about it; again the animation is fantastic, voice acting was superb, jokes were hilarious and I really liked the approached they had with ""antagonist"" of the film. She isn't your typical antagonist in a sense that you really feel for her. She kinda reminded me of how people felt for Killmonger in Black Panther. It certainly was great new take for the franchise especially because you do have really intense antagonists in the previous films, Lotso especially in the 3rd film. With an intense character like him it was a breath of fresh air to see a new take on a role.
All in all I thought this movie is fantastic, it certainly is worth your time, money and I would even recommend seeing in IMAX."

"moviegeektimothy","9","1","4","24 June 2019"," A surprise for sure, but a welcome one
","When I heard the news of a fourth Toy Story film, the first thought to come through my head was.. why? Toy Story 3 to me was the perfect ending and one not needing another film. Andy's grown up, so he passed his legacy onto Bonnie, right?<br/><br/>I came into the theatre hands freezing from the iced tea with a hint of pessimism. Toy Story had been a wonderful part of my childhood, even though the first two predated me by a decade. At first I had questions, I was worried about Pixar and whether they'd lost their game. Fortunately, I was wrong.<br/><br/>Having finished just 10 minutes ago, WOW! I don't know what it is about Pixar, but they sure know how to keep their magic alive even 24 years since their first film hit the hearts of generations to come. Despite a few minor setbacks such as the lack of focus on Bonnie and Buzz's dumbing down, Pixar soared high like a bird and did the toughest task any film could ever dream of doing: living up to the legacy of its predecessors.<br/><br/>They ended on a high note, one I'm surprised to say I throughoutly enjoyed. As beautiful as it is satisfying, Pixar's done it once again. Incredible work to their team, they're truly a talented group of people."

","For a lot of people like myself, Toy Story is one of the first films we remember watching, and the fact they are still just as good as when you watch them as an adult shows how good the guys at Pixar are.<br/><br/>Each film is just near perfection. But when Toy Story 4 was announced my first reaction was; ""they're not gonna pull this off"". I don't think I've ever been so nervous going to see a film. But boy did they pull this off.<br/><br/>It's was dramatic, heartwarming and I have to say probably the funniest Toy Story film out of the four.<br/><br/>The voice acting was brilliant, both the old and new additions. Especially Key and Peele who I thought were hilarious. and obviously, Keanu Reeves was just brilliant.<br/><br/>No spoilers but this is the only film series where I have had tears in my eyes with every film.<br/><br/>A great ending (and I really hope this is the end because I can't take the nerves anymore) to what is in my opinion the greatest film series of all time. It really has taken us to infinity and beyond."

"grantpaulsen","4","1","4","22 June 2019"," To Infinity and Beyond!
","Pretty good flick. It never really justifies its existence though, and it doesn't have the emotional impact I think it needed (especially if it's the last one). The story feels really inconsequential for the first half at least, and one of the side characters was kinda pointless. There's also a lot of plot conveniences that I found stupid, and sometimes this film relied on contrivances way too much (especially the part at the end with the RV). Don't get me wrong the previous films had that too, but I don't think the previous three relied on them that much. Also I think the overall story could've used some more development, I cared about the characters and what was happening because of my investment in the previous films, but this one not so much. I think it's good enough to make me invested it's just not on the level that I think it should be. My last complaint is that I wish the old gang got more screen time, specifically Jessie, and especially Buzz given the outcome of the story. However, I love everything they did with Woody and Bo Peep, I also love the new characters especially Forkey and Duke Kaboom (Keanu Reeves is perfect as always). There's a long tracking shot of two characters walking that I loved, and there's a scene with rain in the film and it's absolutely stunning. The visuals and animation are perfect, almost photo realistic at this point. Also the humor is pretty good, there were some jokes that I found to be genuinely hilarious, this film might actually be the strongest in terms of humor. Tom Banks's voice acting performance in this film as Woody is absolutely perfect, this might actually be his best in the franchise, other than maybe the third film. Once I've had more time to think about the film and see it again, my rating may go up. I know that I really liked this film, but not as much as the trilogy. In terms of Pixar sequels I would say this takes the edge over films like, ""Finding Dory"", ""Incredibles 2"", ""Monsters University"", and all the Cars films of course. In conclusion, Toy Story 4 feels like the ""optional"" epilogue that comes after the perfect ending to a story that you love, but it's a pretty good ""optional"" epilogue."
"pugmaster-49037","10","1","4","22 June 2019"," Great Ending To Story
","In Toy Story 4, Pixar doesn't seem to let any bad detail slip. The storyline tied together with the events of the past 3 movies. Bo Peep makes a grand return and tells Woody that no Toy is ever lost. Woody is very generous when it comes down to making sure Bonnie is happy and the only way to do that is to make sure Forky doesn't die. Woody teaches him a lesson that means no matter how different you may seem or be, to someone who loves you, you are just you. Whilst other character like Buzz and Jessie (etc.) don't really have a lot of screen time they seem to fit in the story just perfectly and their roles are counted for. In the end, when Woody decides to stay with Bo Peep and remain kidless, Buzz starts to say ""to infinity"" and woody finishes by saying ""and beyond"" as Bonnie is leaving in a van to go back home. That one line proves that no matter how far and how close the gang is to each other, they will be there for each other."
"Dragoneagle144","9","1","4","22 June 2019"," A Worthy Sequel
","Toy Story 4 is a completely unnecessary movie and I was completely against it being made. I felt like Toy Story 3 was the not only the best in the franchise but also one of the best concluding chapters of a trilogy ever. So I went into this movie with super low expectations even though everyone was telling me it was amazing and I have to say, they were right. This is an amazing movie. It makes me so happy that we have another kick ass Toy Story movie that honestly feels like a great extension of the trilogy. I was totally into where they were taking the story and it had a great payoff in the end. Tom Hanks is once again incredible as Woody and all of the new (and long lost) characters were amazing as well. They do focus a lot more on newer characters more than the original gang but that is honestly completely fine because all of these new characters are very interesting. Woody's arc in this movie is easily my favorite part of the story and man does it make for a great ending. The theme of growing up is explored again in this movie and even though it is the third movie in a row to have that same theme it never felt repetitive or redundant because they keep finding new ways to make it interesting and different. I do have some flaws though and most of them involve Buzz. They kind of shove him to the back and don't do anything with him. They also make him exponentially more stupid and uninteresting which doesn't really feel right because the entire series has been based off of the relationship between Woody and Buzz. But I do get that that wasn't the story they wanted to tell. All in all Toy Story 4 is an awesome time and has earned the Toy Story name."
"krazykevin-00184","9","1","4","22 June 2019"," A Fantastic Story
","Toy Story is the best animated saga of all time, thus; this movie had a lot to live up to. It didn't disappoint. Every character was absolutely perfect and old characters became more developed.

Overall, an outstanding film and even though I don't like sagas rambling on with movies, I hope to see another Toy Story,"

","Controversial opinion - I didn't think this was needed after the perfect masterpiece (at least in my head) that was Toy Story 3, however, this is an excellently crafted movie.<br/><br/>Some of the shots looks so realistic, I love that this film breaks from the traditional archetypal villain, and focuses a lot on purpose of the toys and their relationship with children There is a nice running commentary on existence and following or not following what expectations are programmed into you by society."
"sbweightman","8","1","4","21 June 2019"," Still great and enjoyable, but has lost some of it's magic over time.
","A more emotional and poignant adventure featuring everyone's favorite toys which, although still very entertaining, isn't as much fun. There are funny moments and the action and animation is always superb, but it doesn't have the same style or magic of the other films in the series.

"Batman9003","9","1","4","21 June 2019"," Amazing yet still unnecessary.
","9/10. Ok, so it's very touching, funny, beautifully animated, and fun. Always great to see the Toy Story Crew back but still didn't really needed to be made. Still an awesome movie but doesn't quite compare to the first 3. The third one wrapped it up perfectly. In this one some of the other toys didn't get a lot of screen time. Still very enjoyable and many laughs to be had. Ole Sporky is going to be a hit and it's awesome seeing Bo Peep back in action. The animation was absolutely gorgeous and top notch. Pixar somehow pulled this off despite the pushed back release dates and behind the scenes drama. Anywho, go see it folks! I've loved these movies since I was a young one."

","""I was made to help a child, I don't remember it being this hard."" Woody (Tom Hanks voice)<br/><br/>Joy, sorrow, laughter, tears, love, and loyalty-those words may describe Casablanca, but right now I'm thinking Toy Story 4. Who would have thought an animation could compete with that classic romance? Who would have thought one animated frame could show more humanity than those in all the summer blockbusters? Who would have thought after the triumph of 3 that 4 would be just as good?<br/><br/>Pixar and director John Cooley (a Pixar operative with his directorial debut), together with writers Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom, have crafted yet another brilliant story of little people overcoming the crush of cretinous big people to save their pleasant roles as support for kids and strengthen their bonds as buddies. No better example than cowboy Woody and astronaut Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), whose initial Toy Story 1 dislike for each other has grown to a lively mature friendship three iterations later.<br/><br/>Woody's growth is the heart of an uproarious adventure with the lovely Bo Peep (Annie Potts), who is the best strong female to occupy the screen in a long time. The two are sweet on each other but subsume that affection to the tasks of saving kids and toys from disconnection.<br/><br/>Moreover, they have to deal with a new character, Forky (Tony Hale), a beautiful piece of trash with pipe-stem arms and disproportionate eyes, who forces friendship decisions and affections that help determine the maturity of lead characters. In addition, the carnival setting with a carousel and second-hand antique shop among other props helps to mix the joy of toydom and the danger of a rambunctious world without rules.<br/><br/>And so it goes, turning not so much this time on finding home as finding love. Every family member should fully appreciate the humanity of that arc and listen to its abundant life lessons..<br/><br/>You know Avenger's: Endgame is a change agent for a successful franchise. Don't miss the summer's even better revolution: Toy Story 4. I hope Pixar itself doesn't change this monumental animation by ending it.<br/><br/>""Some kids play rougher than others.""

","I know that ""Toy Story"" is a beloved franchise...I get that. But at the same time, it's a movie that's spawned three sequels AND countless shorts. Despite a complete lack of originality, however, folks still love the films and the Academy keeps awarding Pixar with Oscars for the movies. As for me, I've had enough and would really love to see the studio focus on something new and original.<br/><br/>The story is about a new toy, 'Forky' the spork--a toy that Bonnie made at kindergarten out of some trash. Forky is trash and doesn't get the concept of being a toy....and constantly is trying to throw himself away despite Woody's best efforts to keep him with Bonnie. In the process, Woody ends up getting separated from Bonnie at Great Basin National Park (on the Nevada/Utah border). Can he find his way back to Bonnie? And, what about Forky?<br/><br/>Although the film lacks originality, I hate to admit that it is gorgeous....with about the nicest looking CGI I can recall having seen. It is lovely to look at and the characters are more fluid and lovely to look at than ever before. Perhaps this is why it got an Oscar....it certainly wasn't for any other conceivable reason.
After all, it's yet another film where the toys try to find their way back home....just like in all the other films. Overall, an enjoyable film that is nice to watch and with a few enjoyable moments...but nothing more. It's essentially ""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Toy Story 3"" all over again.<br/><br/>By the way, like other Toy Story movies, the creepy characters in this one are the Vincent marionettes. And, they are mega-creepy nightmare fuel."

"blackwidowis7cool","8","1","5","12 October 2019"," Surprisingly works
","When I heard there was a Toy Story 4 coming out, I had two reactions - excitement that we would get to play with our beloved toys once again and skepticism about a fourth one - I didn't think that it would work at all. So, I put off seeing it in theaters and decided to wait until it came out on DVD. I would have simply borrowed it, but one of my little brothers isn't feeling too well, and he loves Toy Story, so I thought that I would buy it for him as a surprise to make him feel better - especially since he wasn't aware there even was a fourth Toy Story beforehand.
Well, the surprise worked. He really brightened up, which made my day and made me in turn really excited to watch this movie with him.
I was surprised to find that it really works.
The animation is great and you can see how far it has progressed from the first Toy Story. The cast is all back - with some new additions - and are just as impressive as ever. Is it just me or does the cast, specifically the ones who play the original ones, seem to be upping their acting in this movie? The cast for the new additions are perfect and utterly hilarious.
Now, if you have watched the previous three movies in this franchise, you will go to this one thinking you know what message they are going to be trying to tell. Well, you'd be wrong. It completely (or at least almost entirely) defies everything we have been taught about this world. It takes what they taught us in the previous three movies and turns it on its head, expanding on it, creating a whole new world to explore. It brings new messages and themes and plot to the table and it works.
I have never cried or had the urge to cry with the other Toy Story movies, though I thoroughly enjoy them. But, I was surprised to find myself tearing up throughout this movie, particularly around the climax. It handles the climax really well and ties everything all down with a stupendous bow. It packs an emotional punch, and my heart felt like it was breaking at particular parts around the very end - especially with the final line in the movie spoken by Buzz and Woody. While some people may not be happy with how it ends, it's the perfect ending. It's the best decision, and I am happy with it. The movie on a whole - especially the climax - hits all the right notes and really delivers.

","I saw this twice in theaters. When I first saw the trailer I thought, ""Really? A spork?"" I thought Forky was going to be super lame and I generally have low expectations for sequels, but it's Toy Story so of course I had to see it! Plus Keanu Reeves!! But alas! Forky was probably one of my favorites! I laughed the whole time and cried twice from the overload of nostalgia. We grew up with these characters and you think you'll leave them behind but then Pixar makes another one! The last one was good but I can't watch it ever again because of how emotional it was. Also, I have to give some recognition to the animation department. The visuals are absolutely incredible. If you are into animation, then take a look at some of the still frames online and you can only imagine how long it took to get the texturing right. The rewatch value of Toy Story 4 is pretty high. The writers have created an incredible script and the humor never stops. The great thing about Pixar is that it's not just for kids! Parents and adults can see the humor that kids might miss. You'll understand when you see it. You may get emotional at points but it's nothing like Toy Story 3! I wonder if this will be the last one, but Disney can't seem to create new stories anymore with all the remakes so I expect we will see a few more Toy Story movies as long as Iger is president. As long as the keep their creative team together, we can expect them to stay faithful and know how important Toy Story is to the fans."

","Though Toy Story 4 is not the best picture in the franchise, it is definitely an important part of it. Highlighting Woody once more, it really brings the character full circle. The bittersweet ending addresses adults more than younger audiences, and it's a brave move from Pixar. A predictable and 'satisfying' happy ending so many people long for would feel cheap and repetitive. It's good to see something that's not a cliché, something that feels more lifelike. Once again Pixar reminds us about something: as Woody bids farewell to the gang, I recalled the words of Jack's father from 'Lost': it's not about leaving, no, it's about 'moving on'."

","I am among the people who were very skeptical about Pixar making a fourth Toy Story movie after the powerful ending of the third movie, but I went to the theater to see it for myself.<br/><br/>And may I say, for a sequel we may not have needed, I still enjoyed it to the fullest because of how they made another aspect of toys come to life. I'm talking about the emotionally and physically damaged doll, Gabby Gabby whose wants and needs are fully understandable.<br/><br/>Her story is the most touching here and even though her sidekicks can be scary as hell it's worth paying attention every time she is on screen. But not her alone, because we get closure with Bo Peep very early on who wasn't in the third movie at all. She is awesome and entertaining and tough and all that stuff. In my opinion, ther is still room for more in this franchise, not a movie, but a TV-series about Bo Peep could be awesome.<br/><br/>So many memorable characters and yet another emotionally charged story only Toy Story is capable of making. TS4 may seem like an odd choice after the seemingly definite ending from the third movie, but this ending is another one of that kind."

The childhood memories we had built up with the plot culminated into a fantastic point of moving on and letting go to the franchise.<br/><br/>I'd recommend not watching it if you loved the Toy Story 3 ending.

","Toy Story 4 sure is the funniest out of the bunch, but at the same time it is also the weakest.

As always, likable characters, great animation and for the most part I had a fun time watching it. That being said, it didn't win me entirely over like the others. I think the majority of us can agree that the third installment ended the franchise flawlessly. I was intrigued to see what the fourth installment had in store, but not entirely. Conclusion: it felt kinda redundant in a way - no offense. Final score: 7/ 10"
"dpg-87522","7","1","5","7 August 2019"," Totally unnecessary but ok it's a good movie.
","Toy story 4 was totally unnecessary, because toy story 3 had the perfect ending, a magic ending, but all right apparently for pixar there is nothing more magical than money, one of the biggest problems with this fourth part is that it feels like a epic adventure, something that it could have been taught in a short film, i mean if woody hadnt turned to the store nothing of the movie would have happened, and the movie introduces you to new characters and this time if you put aside those we already know. This movie is a little overated, with this i ´m not saying that the movie is bad, i just say that toy story 4 has a 97/100 in rotten tomatoes, the movie is good yeah but it's not good enough to have those qualifications, let's be,honest of the 4 movies this is the worst, the only that stands out from its predecessors is in the incredible animation, something that i like very much is that the movie takes risk and lets Woody leave once it have finished his purpose, and his ending is good, great ending, I hope that this one be the last movie, in conclusion toy story 4 is a good movie with a mature plot, but nothing outstanding ."

"jboothmillard","7","1","5","6 July 2019"," Toy Story 4
","The original three Disney Pixar films are fantastic, there were people that were sceptical that it should have remained a trilogy. The cast and crew claim this will be the final film in the series, and it went on to break the world record for biggest box-office opening for an animated movie. Basically, nine years ago, when Woody (Tom Hanks) and the gang were still with Andy, there is a rescue operation to save R.C. from being washed away in a drain. While the toys save the remote-controlled car, they are unable to stop Bo Peep (Annie Potts) and her sheep being given away by Andy's sister Molly. Woody tries to convince Bo Peep to escape and stay, but she reassures him that she will be fine, and he knows he cannot go with her, because Andy still needs him, so they bid each other farewell. Two years after Andy gave his toys away to Bonnie (Madeleine McGraw), Woody and the gang have settled and are happy in their new life. But Woody has been neglecting Woody recently, and he observes that she is overwhelmed about starting kindergarten. Woody sneaks into Bonnie's backpack, hoping he will help her cope, he watches her become nervous and almost cry during an arts and crafts session. Woody covertly sneaks materials, including pipe cleaners and googly eyes, along with a spork, Bonnie turns the spork into a handmade toy she names ""Forky"". Forky (Tony Hale) comes to life in Bonnie's backpack, shocking Woody, he introduces him to the other toys back at home. But Forky experiences an existential crisis, he believes himself to be trash and continually tries to throw himself in the garbage, and Woody repeatedly retrieves him. Bonnie and her parents go on a road trip, Forky throws himself out of the window, forcing Woody to follow him out. While walking to return to Bonnie, Woody explains why he makes Bonnie happy, he accidentally mentions Andy during this. Forky becomes enthusiastic about being Bonnie's toy, and they eventually reach the RV park where Bonnie's family are staying. But Woody spots Bo Peep's lamp in the window of an antique store, he sneaks inside, with Forky following, hoping to find Bo inside. Woody and Forky encounter a doll named Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks) and her creepy ventriloquist's dummies, the Bensons. Gabby offers to take them to Bo, but her true plan is to obtain Woody's voice box, her own is broken and no child will purchase her. Woody and Forky, but they are separated, Woody is surprised to be reunited with Bo Peep at the playground, while Forky is captured by Gabby. Bo is now living a free lifestyle as a ""lost"" toy, but she agrees to help Woody save Forky and get back to Bonnie. Meanwhile, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) searches for Woody on his own. In an earlier conversation, Woody claimed he had an ""inner voice"", Buzz mistakes him for meaning his voice box, so Buzz often presses his buttons, activating his own voice box phrases to use as guidance. Buzz accidentally causes himself to become a carnival prize at the fairground taking place between the RV park and the antique store. He escapes with plush toys Ducky (Keegan-Michael Key) and Bunny (Jordan Peele), and they meet up with Woody and Bo. Along with pocket toy cop Giggle McDimples (Ally Maki) (inspired by Polly Pocket) and Canadian stuntman toy Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves) (a spoof of Evel Knievel), they try but again fail to rescue Forky. Woody tries to convince them to try again, but Bo is not willing for them to risk their lives again, she and the others leave when Woody indirectly insults her. Woody encounters Gabby Gabby again, who tells him of her longing to belong to the store owner's granddaughter, Harmony (Lila Sage Bromley.) Having been told about Andy by Forky, she convinces Woody to give her his voice box in exchange for Forky. Woody and Forky enter Bonnie's backpack, which she left at the store when she and the parents popped in. As Bonnie is retrieving it, Forky and Woody watch Harmony reject Gabby. Woody sends Forky back alone, with a message for Buzz to meet them at the carnival's carousel, while he comforts Gabby and invites her to become Bonnie's toy. While Bo meets with the gang and they head for the carnival, with Trixie (Kristen Schaal) impersonating the RV's GPS and others manipulating the RV controls. Gabby sees a crying girl lost in the carnival, Woody convinces her to approach the child, to find her and help her, the little girl is given confidence to approach a security guard and find her parents, the others are happy Gabby has found a new owner. At the carousel, Woody and Bo share a bittersweet goodbye. Buzz realises that Woody feels torn, and perhaps lost without Andy, he tells him that Bonnie will be okay without him. Woody decides to stay with Bo and gives his sheriff badge to Jessie (Joan Cusack). The RV departs, and Bonnie's toys leave with her. Woody, Bo, Giggle, Duke, Ducky, and Bunny continue to travel with the carnival, and help children to win prize toys. On her first day of first grade, Bonnie makes another new toy: a female plastic knife, to whom Forky eagerly introduces himself. Also starring Jay Hernandez as Bonnie's Dad, Lori Alan as Bonnie's Mom, Bonnie Hunt as Dolly, Emily Davis as Billy / Goat / Gruff, Wallace Shawn as Rex, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Blake Clark as Slinky Dog, June Squibb as Margaret the Store Owner, Carl Weathers as Combat Carls, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head (archive sound), Jeff Garlin as Buttercup, Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head, Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, Mel Brooks as Melephant Brooks, Alan Oppenheimer as Old Timer, Betty White as Bitey White, Carl Reiner (Rob's father) as Carl Reineroceros, Bill Hader as Axel the Carnie, Patricia Arquette as Harmony's Mom, and Timothy Dalton as Mr. Pricklepants. The characters we have grown to love for the last twenty-four years all remain appealing, the new characters are likeable, the voice cast to bring them to life are great, it makes you laugh, and it tugs at the heart strings at the right moments. You could argue that Bo Peep's personality has changed significantly, there is that little something missing that causes it to be not quite as magical as the previous movies, and the ending is a little questionable, it is probably a good idea this will be truly the last film made, but I guess it concludes Woody's story, all in all, it is an enjoyable computer-animated comedy adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated for Best Original Song for ""I Can't Let You Throw Yourself Away"" by Randy Newman, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Featured Film, and the BAFTA Children's Award for Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated.

","Watching the beginning of Toy Story 4 the animation was incredible, the opening scenes looked like a live action that would then merge into animation. Pixar were a revelation with their first Toy Story, and 24 years later with Toy Story 4 it's heartbreaking for Woody, voiced as usual by Tom Hanks, as he sees his girl Bo Beep given away by Andy's sister Molly. These are animated toys and yet director Josh Cooley gives them life, and we feel real empathy for them. For their sadness and then joy when Woody and the gang got a second chance with new owner Bonnie in Toy Story 3. But now Sheriff Woody is collecting tumbleweed in the cupboard. His badge is given to Sheriff Jessie, little girl Bonnie's law enforcer is female. And her doll Dolly is in charge of the toys, when it used to be Woody, who sadly now just watches what happens from the last chance saloon. Will he get another chance at happiness?<br/><br/>On Bonnie's orientation day at kindergarten the shy little girl is on her own at a table when the mean kid tips her pencil and pens into the trash. Yeah we know what would happen to him if our toys got hold of him. Remember Sid? But concerned Woody, even though he has been forgotten and left in the cupboard, went in her backpack to kindergarten to keep an eye on Bonnie, and jumps out to gather the arts and crafts from the trash. And Bonnie happily proceeds to craft herself a spork doll from a fork that was actually in the trash, and a pipe cleaner. (I had never heard of a spork before this film).<br/><br/>Bonnie just needed a friend. And when they come home and Woody introduces Forky, voiced by Tony Hale, as a new toy that Bonnie has made, well the toys are a little bemused. No more than Forky himself, who is hilariously determined always to be looking to jump into trash. That is his destiny as trash, to be used and then discarded.<br/><br/>But through the magic of childhood wishes, Pixar has brought this utensil to life, and he becomes Bonnie's new favourite 'toy'. So when Bonnie's parents take the family on a road trip, Woody takes it upon himself to save the spork. And it's a full time job. When Forky jumps out of the window of the moving RV, Woody jumps too. No toys are left behind has always been the motto. See you at the next RV stop he says in goodbye.<br/><br/>The humour is still there with a cracking script and this time the Child's Play terror is provided by a creepy baby doll with Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween style ventriloquist dummy minders. They'll creep you out at any age.<br/><br/>Having persuaded Forky how important he is to Bonnie on their way back to the RV, Woody is attracted to a lamp similar to Bo's in an antique shop window. And he and Forky pop through the letterbox. Big mistake. The tinkling china Bo Peep voiced by Annie Potts, managed to escape from here with her kid sheep; Billy, Goat and Gruff. And now she's a badass lost toy in her bloomers at the travelling fun fair in town. But inside the shop the creepy vintage doll Gabby Gabby rules with her dummies. She has a defective voice box; voiced by Christina Hendricks, and never got to share tea with an owner. She just mimics the actions from her cabinet. Of course Woody has a working voice box....and Forky is the leverage.<br/><br/>New toys are introduced to the story including an Evel Knievel style stunt motorbike doll I remember from my childhood, voiced by the strangely wooden (plastic?) Keanu Reeves. His Canadian Duke Caboom toy was rejected on Christmas Day all that time ago, because he couldn't actually perform the stunts on his tv commercial. Having realised his limitations, he now lives in the store waiting for, but not expecting, a new owner.<br/><br/>And what of our Toy Story regulars in the RV? Tim Allen's Buzz Lightyear gets a starring role listening to his conscience, just like Woody, although Buzz is directed not by his inner voice, but by his voice commands. And when his voice sends him on mission to go find Woody, he meets two soft toys pinned to the same fairground stall wall he finds himself on. Voiced by Keegan-Michael Key as Ducky and Jordan Peele as Bunny, they will never be won by a child. And don't want Buzz getting the chance either as they've been up there the longest. The desire to have an owner is the overbearing need for a toy. But they are a scream with their ever increasing fantastic attempts to save Forky. And when Bonnie's toys club together for a sat nav return to all the fun of the fair, it feels like we're back in Andy's room all those years ago, with Hamm, Rex and Slinky on the gas.<br/><br/>It's a blast, and if this really is the Last Chance Saloon, then we're escaping to the open road with a high 5 from Keanu Reeves. (Stay for the credits)."

But what really makes the movie shine is how it focuses on Woody's personal story, the relationship he has with Bo, and the emotional parts.

","Despite what you might think about my rating, I was pleasantly surprised by toy story 4's quality; it was fun, emotional and a nice look in to woody's character. Problem is I still think this film doesn't need to exist.
I don't know I feel like the idea of an owner growing out of a toy was already done in 3, maybe even 2. We already know that bonnie's gonna get old of the toys eventually so why show it?
Another thing that annoyed me was forky, the trailers and the former half of this film lead me to believe that the character is unique and a pessimist, but that is abandoned 5 seconds after the group are separated and he just becomes a plot device after that.

I would prefer if they have just end it with the ToyStory3 MASTERPIECE,, but i mean, they 'need' money so. I recommend it yes. See this like Annabelle 3, it was just a story that happened in one afternoon, nothing more, nothing less, doesnt have that thrill of many many days in developing ideas, situations and characters,, this could just be like when after Cars2 they create MattTons or something like that, just things that happen to our beloved characters.

","""Toy Story 4"" (2019 release; 100 min.) brings the on-going adventures of Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the gang. As the movie opens, Andy has passed along his toys to a young girl, Bonnie. Bonnie regularly passes over Woody when choosing what toys to play with. But when Bonnie is denied taking a toy with her by her dad for her kindergarten orientation day, Woody makes a bold move and sneaks into her backpack. At school, Bonnie is alone but with the ""help"" from Woody, she makes a new toy, a spork whom she names Forky and she absolutely adores... At this point we're 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out,<br/><br/>Couple of comments: it blows the mind that it's been 24 years since the original ""Toy Story"" was released. Now a quarter-century later (and exactly 20 years since ""Toy Story 2""), the gang is at it again. The movie is so well done on so many levels, first and foremost at the actual story-telling level. The film's pace is fast much of the time: only so many minutes, with so much to tell. Second, all of these characters are now so familiar to us, it's like going to a long-delayed family reunion. Then there is the supreme voice cast with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen being top notch once again. But the big surprise for me in ""Toy Story 4"" is how much of it is really intended for audiences that are not kids. One good example is the entire side thread involving the ""defective"" girl toy Gabby Gabby (sorry, I shan't say more). I was 35 when the original ""Toy Story"" came out, and my kids were 9 and 6, so you can do the math, yet we all still love this franchise. Here's hoping that we can do this again in another decade. But don't make it much longer than that. I'm not getting any younger!<br/><br/>""Toy Story 4"" is now in its 4th weekend in the theaters. I purposefully waited that long so as to avoid some over the big crowds. This Sunday's early evening screening here in Cincinnati was attended perfectly from that perspective (about 25 in total, mostly extended families with young kids). Interestingly, I don't think any of these young kids were older than 6 or 7. In other words: none of them were even born when ""Toy Story 3"" came out (in 2010). It is no coincidence that ""Toy Story"" is the highest rated franchise ever in Rotten Tomatoes' history, and of course is Certified Fresh. ""Toy Story 4"" is a WINNER all the way."

Toy Story 4 explores this idea for a little while and then fully abandons it halfway through the movie. It turns into the usual Toy Story plotlines. Forky is barely a part of the finale. Buzz is forced into the storyline when he really doesn't serve any purpose whatsoever (he is really forced in there to introduce two side characters and get a key, which is really something unnecessary for the story to happen). Pixar delivers a good film, which I consider Pixar's version of phoning it in. I wish they had fully explored Forky's storyline to make a great Pixar film."
"kgarland-08010","5","1","6","3 July 2019"," Good, very funny but not on the same level as the rest.
","An enjoyable contribution to the Toy Story saga. Probably the funniest one too. Woody is just as brilliant and loyal as ever, highlight of the film as always. Unfortunately the same can't be said for Buzz Lightyear...total personality transplant, certainly not the bright, sensible Buzz that I know and love. He got more screen time as the film went on. Also the film is centered alot around new toys, most of which are very funny so it works, but that means less time of our favourite original toys, especially the potato heads...I can't actually remember any of their scenes.
Not up to the level of the first 3, the storyline was pretty weak in my opinion. Still worth watching if you are a loyal Toy Story fan. I can't decide if I was happy with the end or not."

","Didn't expect this to happen
Such a amazing film. Very funny in some scenes. A bit scary (as it warned us about that in the preshow), a few jump scares (if you watching it on Surround sound or at the cinema, but if you watching it on DVD normally, you hardly get jump scared). They is 1 creepy doll which are multiplied into 4. Personally I didn't like Toy Story & Toy Story 2 very much but they are good.<br/><br/>It different then the rest of them but it good. I read some reviews and I get they are going with but it a bit like The Haunted Mansion (starring Eddie Murphy) but not as scary<br/><br/>If your children don't like scary dolls or anything making them jump, I recommend for children who don't watch it and probably not to watch it in surround sound."

","Like lots of people I was very sceptical about there being a 'Toy Story 4', after part 3 appeared to wrap up the franchise so beautifully.<br/><br/>However, there is a lot to like about this 4th instalment, with it feeling like a lovely epilogue to what has gone before.<br/><br/>While perhaps not without it's slower moments, and Buzz/Jessie are a little underused, there is enough quality storytelling and heart to justify the film, and the ending is right up there with the incinerator moment in TS3.<br/><br/>I hope Pixar celebrate a job well done by now closing the toy box lid on Woody,Buzz and the gang, as this would be a fitting ending."
"classicsoncall","7","1","7","5 August 2019"," ""Like it or not, you are a toy!""
","For this older viewer, this entry in the Toy Story series didn't seem to capture the same magic as the first three films. It's not bad as a stand alone film, but when you compare it to what's gone before, there's an element missing that makes it more of an average animated picture. There aren't as many sight gags and it doesn't carry the same sense of nostalgia that ""Toy Story 2"" had, for example. What it does have going for it is the skillful animation and colorful palette, and the new character 'Forky' added a whimsical vibe to the cast of characters. Most of the other returning toys though are sadly underused; Buzz Lightyear for example only makes a handful of appearances and isn't instrumental to the story line. Duke Caboom was also a new entertaining presence, while the pair of ventriloquist dummies reminded me of a couple 'Twilight Zone' episode characters back in the day which they resembled so much. But even though my review here is kind of lukewarm, I'd still encourage families to view it together as a fun time at the theater. That's the way I did it, and that's what makes it all worthwhile."
"rchosen-193-5535","5","1","7","8 July 2019"," Nothing to write home about. Bland really.
","Being a Toy Story fan I through the third installment ended it all well. Wasn't expecting a forth movie. And I have to say this one just felt average. It wans't amazing nor was it horrible. Feels like a movie you watch once and forget about. Not sure what about it made it feel this way. Had some good new characters and a good story of course. Just didn't have that same charm as the other ones. Not fully at least.<br/><br/>Wouldn't see it at the theater really. Save it for a rental as you probably won't watch it again. Granted I'm sure kids will rewatch it. But for adults its not worth a rewatch. Again I think it just felt average because the story really didn't need to go on anymore past the third movie."

","After seeing the trailer I wasn't mad keen on seeing this, but I'm so glad I went against my inner voice (no spoiler lol) and saw this. It's the perfect end to the perfect franchise. I've been a crazy mad fan of TS since the beginning and despite, controversially some might say, not loving the third one, I absolutely loved this film. I laughed and cried in equal measure. It bookended the series perfectly. Forky does annoy me though and I blame him solely for Woody and Buzz breaking up."
"Koma-Mo","9","1","8","17 August 2019"," Who would have thought that this would be so much better than anticipated!
","Here is a movie that many people, including myself, were disappointed to hear when this movie was announced, especially after watching the few trailers that was released beforehand. However, after finally getting to see this film, I really have to say that not only was I so surprised with this movie, but this movie is simply one of the best movies that I have seen this year. One of the major surprises was the actual plot itself. It's surprisingly deep and it deals with very complex emotions and situations extremely well to where it had me connect with the major characters and I understood how each character felt, along with understanding the decisions that they make throughout the movie. I was a little worried with where the film would go because I knew that the film had to revolve around the new character, Forkie, but everything was woven together perfectly where his addition to the story and this overall plot makes sense, along with delivering on the fun factor that I did not expect from this movie. Here is a plot where there isn't a dull moment at sight, something is always happening and the amount of humor and emotional scenes either had me laughing or crying a river.<br/><br/>With every Pixar film, they always improve their CG and the film looks absolutely amazing! The characters look great and everything from the background to the look of an antique store looks very realistic. It's so good to where even the ventriloquist dummies were scary and had the creepiness that I tend to feel when I actually look at one. There is a scene involving rain and it's scary how realistic it looks. This is such an amazing achievement, especially with a film in its fourth entry.<br/><br/>Just like in the previous films, all of the characters that you love are back and it's always nice to see them on screen, along with hearing Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as their iconic roles. I am a little sad to see some of the more popular characters being put to the side line, but this is necessary as the main focus is on Woody, Buzz and the new characters that appear in the movie. These new characters are great additions to the series and all of them are great for their own reasons. Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key as Bunny and Duckie were extremely funny and had me cracking up throughout the movie. Forkie, voiced by Tony Hale, started off annoying, but he started to grow on me and I ended up caring for him by the end of the film. Even thinking about the character just made me understand his characteristics a bit more. A very interesting concept and actually one of the more interesting characters in the film. Duke Caboom was also great, adding a lot of humor to his scenes and Keanu Reeves, who is having a great year, helping make this character to be likable. Annie Potts really helped bring a lot of personality to Bo Peep. Finally, Gabby Gabby, voiced by Chrisitna Hendricks is surprisingly a deep character that had me in tears when it came to the end of her subplot. From humor to having great emotional depth, all of these characters revolved around the overall story perfectly well and I really liked every single character here.<br/><br/>Words cannot describe how much I loved this movie and on how much I really appreciate the effort that the people involved with this movie put into this film. I couldn't stop crying even after the credits stopped rolling and that shows how much of an impact it had on me. For fans of the series, I think they will notice a few things that have continued from the previous films, such as character growth and feeling the bond that these characters share. Some people may not like the minor changes with the characters or may not be fully invested as much as me, but this movie did something that surprised so many people and it's definitely something that should be watched, especially with people who loved the overall series."

","Toy's Story still continued to their story premise, that no toy will never be left behind. This sequel shows that every one (or this case, every toy) deserved to be loved and looked after. I find myself questioning how a trash like Forky be considered as a toy while the group of Andy's toy considers Forky as what he is while Woody, being our natural hero, reconsiders that a trash like Forky is still special in his own way. And the fact that I never knew that the plot is not all about Forky, don't believe what you see from the trailer. This movie also foretells Keanu Reeves' (aka. Duke Caboom) future in his upcoming project in the MCU since he is now under contract with Disney - which made this movie more exciting! There's also more ACTUAL toys that sparked nostalgia in this movie, Polly Pocket and Sky Dancers for example - that left me in awe.<br/><br/>I love a movie that's unpredictable like Toy Story 4, how I keep telling myself that they're gonna kill Bo Peep and ended up wrong. So for those wondering that they'll be leaving the theatre broken hearted, missing a limb or two (lol) this is very unlikely Toy Story 3's ending. What's questionable is how the next sequel will end up without Woody on the main gang."

","As someone who loves Toy Story and was so excited foe the 4th I was bitterly disappointing with this. If this is all pixar / Disney could come up with then they should have just called it a day. They clearly ran out of ideas yet chose profit before reputation which is so often the case.
The movie had no charm, we didn't even see that much of the characters we have grown to love, with the movie being more focused on new annoying characters who we arent familiar with.
What should have been a celebration of friendship and adventure turned into a movie which didn't follow the identity of the others and desperately tried to cover it up by pulling at the heartstrings of loyal fans by separating woody from his beloved friends.
It felt like the whole production team of the previous 3 movies packed up and left, and someone who had never seen any of the 3 previous movies in their life came in and made this.
The movie also goes against its principles and what woody has been preaching the whole time. ""Friends stick together"". Hes spent the whole time trying to keep friends together but then he just ditches them all for little bo peep, in some act of love which was never built up in any way. The furthest we got to see any kind of love interest between them was little bo peep telling him shes ""just a few blocks away"", hardly some long yearning love which you'd ditch your whole group of friends for. I will continue to watch the first 3 movies with my son but ive written 4 out of my mind and wont ever watch it again.
Not enough airtime for the toys we love, not enough interaction between buzz and woody throughout the fim, plot focusing on new meaningless characters."

First of all the plot is all over the place. And the characters do not behave the way they have behaved in the first three. This was especially jarring since I had watched the previous three installments in a mini marathon. It is as if the writers had never taken the time to watch the first three.
The biggest disappointment by far was the ending. Woody always, always stuck with his friends. And he was the central character. And a toys Main reason for existing is to be played with. By abandoning his core values at the end of this movie I was really let down and angry.

","I was as skeptical as anyone when this movie was announced. ""Really? A 4th one? After the 3rd one ended so perfectly? What a cashgrab! Why is Disney forcing them to make this?"" But this movie actually had a lot of heart and effort into this. If ""Toy Story 3"" made you cry, oh boy. This will make you cry maybe even harder. They didn't need to put as much effort into this movie as this movie as they did, but they did. They did that for us. This is one of the great Pixar movies! I noticed that the Pixar movies hardly anybody remembers such as ""Brave"", ""The Good Dinosaur"", ""Monsters University"" and ""Finding Dory"" (just to name a few) are the ones that have little to no emotion put into them, but the great ones such as ""Inside Out"", ""Coco"", and others are the ones that make you feel something. They raise hard questions, they make you evaluate your life. They can be kid-friendly, but also mature. And this is one of those. As soon as the opening credits started, I started tearing up, and the film just didn't let up from there. This has themes of letting go, accepting you can't have what you want in life, finding your life's purpose. It's some pretty mature stuff for the audience of 5 year olds. But there is so much heart and effort put into this movie. Pixar has done it again. If they put even half the effort into ""Incredibles 2"" as they put into this, that could have been one of the great Pixar films. Despite my skepticism, this was a thoroughly emotional film, with lots of heart, and lots of laughs.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"

","For those of us who grew up in the late 90's and early 00's, the Toy Story movies are popular favorites among our demographic. For everyone, though, they've gained a reputation as some of the best animated films of all time and having an impact on children and adults alike. 9 years after their previous adventure, Woody and the gang return to the big screen once again. This time, they go on a road trip with Bonnie and her friend Forky, a living spork that she made while lonely in school.<br/><br/>The way the characters develop in this movie is very well done. Woody is no longer the favorite toy and has effectively been cast in the wayside. Despite that, he still feels an obligation to care for Bonnie and do everything for her. In some ways, it's a movie about getting old and how hard it is to move on. Instead of caring for the kid as he always has, he now has to teach Forky how much toys mean to children and the power that that holds. It's a surprisingly poignant movie. Meanwhile we have Bo Peep, who's been a free toy for years, showing Woody the benefits of living without a kid.<br/><br/>We are introduced to some new friends in this movie. The most important of the pack is Gabby Gabby, who has always wanted to be there for a kid and sees Woody as the means by which she will achieve that. She's a good character because even though she's a villain for most of the film, we still back her completely by the end. There's also Duke Kaboom, played by Keanu Reeves. He's a comic character, and a good one at that. Ducky and Bunny are also like that. It's ironic that Jordan Peele is in this movie given the content of the movies he makes. Unfortunately, with all these new characters many of the familiar ones like Buzz and Jesse are effectively sidelined. Hamm, Rex, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, and Slinky are barely present. Are the Little Green Men in it at all?<br/><br/>As someone who adored the first two films when I was around Bonnie's age, I think the ending had a harder impact on me and people of my age than others. Having Woody, Buzz and the gang return was like getting a visit from an old friend you haven't seen in years. With that last scene, with Woody and Buzz realizing they're going down separate paths, was heartbreaking, yet relatable. We've all had those friends, especially childhood friends, who we parted with. We grew up and we parted. In a similar way, our animated friends grew up and parted just like we did. That final ""to infinity and beyond"" definitely got the tears rolling, in me and I'd imagine in many audiences.<br/><br/>With such a conclusive ending it begs the question: will they make a Toy Story 5? Probably. It would have to focus on one of the two sets of characters now, which could work. While it may seem unnecessary to us now, bear in mind that many people deemed this one unnecessary before it came out. Pixar clearly understands how to run this franchise."

","When the inevitable Part 5 comes out, I NEED to see it in theatres. If there ARE theatres in 2035.<br/><br/>I curse this movie I granted 9 stars out of 10 and barely fell behind #2 as my 3rd favorite of the series. (Seriously, it was so close to a tie with #2, more later.) I know, I shouldn't be mad with a movie I rated so highly and it's not the movie's fault. I just happen to pass out THREE times while trying to watch it. And I even nodded off this 4th time...Either it's the movie's fault or I'm not getting enough sleep...<br/><br/>I DIGRESS! This movie is amazing. But, just like Part 3, it doesn't become amazing until the 2nd half. For both Parts 3 and 4, I liked the movie just fine with some smirks, laughs and ""AWWW!""'s from me in the first half, but then the movies kick into high gear to finish off the adventures. Only, this time, in a sequel frankly NO ONE ASKED FOR (including myself,) the last 50 minutes topped all of part 3 by a landslide.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 reminds us, once again, of the other 3 chapters and then brings us up to speed. Only, now, there's a trashy new plaything and Woody has to spend a large chunk of the time convincing it (Forky) to be the toy ""new"" kid Bonnie loves. Meanwhile, Woody has to find HIS new place with some old and new friends/enemies. Actually, explaining the plot for this kid's movie is just as complicated as the movie, itself. In fact, I'm shocked in how many characters, plot twists, stories, messages and details are in here for a KID'S movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, everything worked. Everyone fit nicely together and the messages were easy to follow and I loved how the arch of Woody's story - it's really his story, after all - plays out. While most moviegoer fans felt enormous nostalgic at the end of Part 3...I felt this was the true story of Woody's belonging. (Part 3's, in fairness, was the end of Andy's story, this: Woody's.)<br/><br/>I wasn't on board when this was announced and then almost immediately released following. It was a great trilogy that ended perfectly. But, I did love how they went one step further to complete Woody's story. Now, I'm NOT onboard for another chapter, but as long as they include Woody and Buzz again, I will watch it.<br/><br/>Just that time, in the theatre. And with plenty of sleep. And sober.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Here are the movies ranked. Keep in mind, for the first time in my ranking, there was ALMOST a tie (#s 2 and 4. They were SOOOO close!!)<br/><br/>1 Toy Story
2 Toy Story 2
3 Toy Story 4
4 Toy Story 3<br/><br/>Quick Recap. When #4, one I DID want to eventually see, but missed in theatres, FINALLY come available on Disney+, I decided on a marathon that opening weekend's Saturday. I did manage to get through Parts 1-3 and part of #4 before, again, passing out. My thoughts:<br/><br/>Toy Story 1 (9/10 Stars,) which has always been my favorite, made me cringe this time with the graphics. I forgot how far we've come from the first Pixar feature length. Now, that said, it still remains as my favorite for my own nostalgia and it did make me laugh, smile and wonder the most of the four movies. In my opinion, it's the most creative, despite its limitations with graphics and BARELY falls behind...<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 (9/10 Stars) is absolutely amazing in the LEAPS and BOUNDS of growth in computer animation. I've heard the stories about them losing most of the footage and scrambling to complete the movie on time and that it was supposed to be direct-to-video at first. It's incredible that they finished this on time, showed how beautiful Pixar could be and that the story, laughs and ingenious ideas could increase. PLUS, it featured my favorite Pixar song (and one of my all-time favorite movie songs): ""When She Loved Me."" (Makes me cry every time!) This movie is near perfect and if not for a just slightly more creative and fresh original film, it barely makes it my 2nd favorite. Side note: I've hated Jessie for decades now. This viewing marks the first time I not only accepted her, but liked and understood her. Thank goodness, there's no room for hate in our hearts!<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 (9/5 Stars.) See Above.<br/><br/>And finally, but not least: Toy Story 3 (8/10 Stars.) Don't get me wrong with the one entry with a half-star less review than the others. This franchise still remains as one of the best ever with creativity, heart, depth, animation and characters. But, this one didn't do it for me this time. It felt too long with too many endings - a pet peeve of mine. I understand they thought it would be the last so they tried to wrap everything up, but at times, this movie felt like it wouldn't end and while everyone OHHH'd and AWWW'd at the tug-hearted ending, I was like, END ALREADY! That all said, the 8/10 star rating should speak for itself. I really did like this movie, including the heart, comedy, Spanish Buzz and ""You Almost Went There!"" fiery finale. No discount at all and this series is not complete without watching this with the rest."

","My expectations for Toy Story 4 were low considering how the previous installment had gone. So I was super stoked throughout the whole movie when I realised how much more of a success this one was going to be.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is the perfect blend of nostalgia for its original audience ('You've got a friend in me' goes without saying), combined with different settings and characters for its newer audience, as well as great character development and emotional investment. It wasn't trying too hard to bring back all the jokes and tip offs to previous movies, yet it still felt really familiar, being in a child's room at the start, flying out the windows, all the characters together. It still felt modern too, with new characters and significantly better animation when compared to the first Toy Story.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were a class act as well. Great one liners as usual. Buzz's inner voices jokes esepecially. The emotion at the end of Buzz and Woody having to say goodbye was excellent, it felt like watching the finale of Friends. Saying goodbye to old friends (So much history).<br/><br/>Bo Peep's reintroduction and character development was clever and kept it exciting. Her scene in the atinques store showing Woody up on many occassions was necssary as Woody had just gone too long on being the one in charge and showing everyone else what to do. Her almost bar like scene reminded me of Star Wars with the trumpets and all the aliens in the bar. Great chance to show off a variety of funny toys.<br/><br/>Although, poor old Buzz was definitely side-lined in this movie and was much more of a side character, and that goes for the whole gang actually, they felt like they were not even part of the movie to be honest. Maybe it was for lack of time, but a few extra scenes of these characters doing something funny would've added extra roundedness to the whole series. They just felt a bit forgotten when compared to the first two movies.<br/><br/>The new characters were mostly successful I'd say. Ducky and Bunny had some great scenes together and we're an easy win for the younger audience who no doubt would have went away recalling some of their scenes. Gabby was creepy enough with her minions (perfect choice of creepy dolls, who doesn't hate those things), her purposes were made clear and were pretty rationale. The build up to her being reunited with her child was made to be quite brutal when her child just threw her away. This was quite effective and hopefully got children thinking about not just wanting the newest and coolest toy to only use once or twice before throwing it away.<br/><br/>Forky though was a bit of a hit and miss for me. It doesn't quite make sense that the human capabilities of the toys can be passed onto anything that is made and crafted. What about all the other things that are made in arts and crafts? It seemed to push the past the limits of what was reasonable in this world. Lastly, Duke was great fun, and hilarious at times., had to rate his jump when he surprsingly hit his head going for his 40 foot jump.<br/><br/>Overall I found myself cracking up at the jokes, being quite invested in the story and satisfied with the finish at the end. Woody did have that annoying Batman quality to him where he always had to do the right thing. But it makes sense with his character. This movie for me was well worth putting the time and effort into and will be one I'll look forward to watching again in a few years time."

","I waited 9 years for this film! 9 years! Toy Story 4 was disappointing. Yeah, it was good, but it was nothing like Toy Story 3. This family film is about Forky, a new toy, who abandons the gang and Woody goes to find him. But they think they have found Bo Peep, Woody's old love interest. Toy Story 4 has the best animation out of the full quadrilogy and loveable characters. Toy Story 4 is suitable for all the family. 8/10."

There are no sadistic kids or malevolent toys, yet there is still plenty of exciting action and also a genuine deep emotional connection that takes the audience to another level.

","The Cult of Pixar is odd to me. You hear about these people, childless, watching cartoons in public, without shame, etc., but to see them out in the wild... that is a different beast. It's off-putting, but only in their knowing glances back at me, Mr. Normal Man. To each their own, of course. If you want to watch a children's movie because you think it is the good stuff on its own merits outside of the child-verse, who am I to poo-poo that? Like what you like, I say! I am always going to choose the movie made for adults, but my time is not always my time since I got the kids now and whatnot. Perhaps more interesting of a story than any critique of the film (which was totally fine and entertaining! Keanu as a Canadian daredevil? The best!) is my theater-going experience. The AMC in Cherry Hill, NJ is a dump, unfortunately. Poorly run in every which way imaginable and this all came to a head on the weekend afternoon that I took my daughter to see Toy Story 4. Showed up right on time for a 4PM showing and the movie just... didn't start. Twice I went out to find someone to complain to (with my restless, confused daughter) as did other patrons. Eventually, at around 4:30, the screen turned on. But it was playing the pre-trailers commercial reel. By 4:45 the coming attractions hadn't even started! (Apparently their was a power surge? And, apparently, no one who worked there thought this ~1-hour delay was worth mentioning to moviegoers?) But since I am not only very normal but very smart, I whipped out my ole cellular telephone and saw that there was a 4:30 showing of the film in the special Dolby Cinema theater. So my daughter and I marched on into that theater, through the black-lit corridor, ticket-takers be damned (like anyone who works there gives an S). The Frozen 2 trailer was just starting as we gazed upon a sea of black leather recliners. Nobody with children had ponied up the extra ten bucks or whatever for this action; we were among the Cult of Pixar now. And that was fine. No more waiting. Comfort. Sound and color. Let the Entertainment begin."

"stevenrotherforth","8","0","2","22 October 2019"," Magically brings out the inner child in all of us
","Toy Story 4<br/><br/>When Toy Story 3 ended it pretty much brought the tale of the worlds most famous toys full circle.
We said our goodbyes with a tear in our eye and that was that.
However when a studio owns a mega money franchise such as this it would be ludicrous for them not to churn out another.
Thankfully the creative minds at Pixar haven't just churned out another movie.
Toy Story 4 is a great entry into the franchise and hopefully we will continue to see more.
There's always a way to tell another story.<br/><br/>This time Woody and his buddies must rescue a
lost toy named Forky when they embark on a family road trip and the new edition to the toy family is accidentally left behind.<br/><br/>Whilst probably not the strongest entry, Toy Story 4 is still a huge amount of fun.
Returning voice cast including Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear are joined by a whole host of new talent.
Keanu Reeves is splendid as Canada's greatest stuntman Duke Caboom.
As are Keenan Michael Key and Joran Peele
as Ducky and Bunny.
Annie Potts also returns as Bo Peep.
The list of excellent characters could go on, so I'll just say it. Every one here is great and clearly having a good time.<br/><br/>The most impressive thing about this movie is how far animation technology has advanced.
The opening scene with rain pouring down is photo realistic. This is a sumptuous looking film.
As a Hi-Def/4K experience this is a feast for the eyes.
HDR really allows colours to pop. The fairground scene is HDR demo worthy with sublime colours and inky blacks.
With the added resolution of UHD each character has added sheen.
Bo Peep in particular looks polished and vibrant whilst environments are also spectacularly detailed.
Grain on wood looks very real and certain areas of the screen is often hyper realistic against the contrast of the animated fictional characters.
Toy Story 4 is a marvellous technical achievement.
Sound is also impressive with the punchy musical score at the forefront.
Surround sound effects are immersive and constant allowing for a truly engaging cinematic experience.
I had a great time with this movie and putting aside that this is clearly aimed at kids. Us grown ups will find much to relish."

","It was inevitable that the series was going to have a fourth - and probably final - installment. It's fun, if not a masterpiece. New cast members include Christina Hendricks, Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele, Keanu Reeves and Patricia Arquette.<br/><br/>But here's what caught my attention: the references to ""The Shining"". The original reference in the franchise was the carpet in Sid's house, which matched the Overlook's carpet (which Stanley Kubrick intended as a representation of the hotel's repetition of events). The obvious reference here is the phonograph playing ""Midnight, the Stars and You"", which got played at the 1920s ball attended by Jack Nicholson's character. Then there's the typewriter, 237, and some others. I'd like to see the ""Toy Story"" franchise crossed with ""The Shining"" (presumably Woody is married to Bo, and Jessie is their daughter; Woody gets a job as caretaker of a hotel, but Buzz's ghost tells him to ""correct"" them). Yeah, I have too much time on my hands.<br/><br/>Anyway, fun for its runtime. It was high time that Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner provided voices in an animated feature together."

","I am a big fan of any kind of animated cartoons. So Toy Story 4 did not pass by me. I've been waiting for it's premiere so long, because I cannot describe by words my impressions after watching previous parts. So it is not surprising at all that I was one of the first viewers of ""Toy Story 4"" after its release.<br/><br/>Woody and the gang embark on one last adventure in Toy Story 4. While on a road trip with her parents Bonnie losses her new favorite toy that she made in preschool and the whole movie Woody attempts to get him back. In addition to this, on one of his adventurous days he founds his long-lost friend Bo Peep. So together they overcome different obstacles in order to complete their mission.<br/><br/>It was funny, touching and charming. I enjoyed it. I do not think that this particular part of Toy Story has any weaknesses, even if previous parts had some. That said, I felt it was not needed to add a fourth chapter. I have a feeling this is really the end and if so it ended on the right note. Disney will always know how to tug at your heartstrings.<br/><br/>Finding your purpose, embracing your destiny are mature themes for a children's film, but ""Toy Story 4"" handles them nimbly while still managing to be a colorful family adventure."

","The Toy Story movies have been consistently good, and in spite of taking a while to get started, this one is no exception. The beginning is mild, as Woody frets about the happiness of his latest owner who creates her own very peculiar doll, but once it gets going with a wonderfully funny and creepy scene in an antique store it never stops, is wonderfully inventive, and in the new tradition of kick-ass heroines gives us a rogue Bo Peep.<br/><br/>Like Toy Story 3, the movie's finale is an elaborate caper type of thing, and while I wouldn't say it was quite as perfect as the equivalent bit of Toy Story 3 (my favorite film in the series), it is very well done.<br/><br/>This is also possibly the most touching movie in the series, perhaps because it looks like it may be the last. But if they decide to make another one in spite of an ending that would seem to preclude that, I'm totally on board."
"yehaa","7","0","1","9 October 2019"," A good story, but the a few noticeable problems....
","I've been watching Toy story for 13+ years and through each movie and its stories I've always enjoyed them and have enjoyed the way they ended. This movie however has an awesome story but with a not so satisfying ending, at the end Woody ultimately decides to leave the group to become a "" Lost toy "", this part of the movie did break my heart and it was sad to see woody leave buzz even though they've been through some much form the movies, shorts, video games, and even TV specials. It just didn't make sense that a toy like woody who was all about being there for his kid whether if it's Andy or Bonnie decides that helping toys get to toys a greater/alternative purpose for a toy. And the whole arc with gabby gabby was sad and although she did get what she wanted in the very end there's things that could've definitely been changed. First thing ""Gabby Gabby: The Lost Toy"", I felt that woody giving his voice box was sort of kind but mainly a bunch a BS, with the way this movie was telling us about this lost toy thing they could've made gabby gabby a lost toy following in Bo peep's foot steps. Second thing, ""Woody's voice box"" honestly the more a think about this subject the more I get kinda angry, Woody gives his voice box in order to give gabby gabby a chance in having a kid. The first attempt ultimately failed as she didn't end up getting the dream child she wanted (this is when she could've become a ""lost toy"") even though the second attempt did work woody didn't have to give up his voice box. The reasons for this are that they could've either fixed it or they could've decided that she could be a toy that didn't have that (since their are plenty of dolls like that). And finally Bonnie, Oh Bonnie. In this movie I almost instantly disliked her, the way she just all of a sudden forgot about one of her favorite toys absolutely shocked me and gave me the thought maybe woody should've left with Andy in the 3rd movie. Because of the way Bonnie treated woody in the beginning gave me the thought that oh wait maybe when they lost both woody and forky she'll realize how much she actually need them BOTH and woody would be her favorite sheriff again and forky could be the favorite deputy. BUT NOPE SHE DISOWNS MY DUDE AND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE FORGETS AND DOESN'T CARE ABOUT HIM ANYMORE, EVEN WHEN HE GETS BACK FORKY . Not only that she completely broke Andy's promise to keep all the toys safe. I could honestly go on but I do not want to keep typing with a mad face. The movie was good/okay with outstanding animation, with a cool story but unsatisfying ending and weird character screen time."
"ladyinblack326","6","0","2","9 October 2019"," Remember this is for our kids not us.
","As a kids movie is was pretty good. I can nit pick a lot of things. There are also things that seemed glaring. There is no reason for instance that the whole gang couldn't have gone on the adventure.<br/><br/>I did cry, quiet a bit, I also started laughing more then I have in any movie in a very long time. The car scene was really funny. My kids 8,6 and 1 were laughing, and I was laughing because oh my goodness that poor dad right, but that's from a parent's perspective.<br/><br/>I think stand alone it's fine, but I also feel disjointed with other movies in the franchise. The girl was only in kindergarten, meaning the very max amount of time from the last one is 3 years. And that assuming she was just three in the last one one now 6 and going to kindergarten. Just because your kid isn't playing with a toy now doesn't mean that won't change, especially for girls where traditional toys seems to hold favor for longer. There is no reason for woody to leave. Hubby said and I quote ""all for a piece of tail"". Now there is no problem heading that way, we grow up and leave home with someone we love and that's okay. But this wasn't that, it didn't strike me as change is good, it just seemed a bit flat.<br/><br/>The antagonist girl doll was great. I also liked forky. My 16month old made a small play dough guy recently and holy cow she loved that thing. If it hadn't been so, well playdough then I could have completely bought this situation. Bo was fun, but I keep thinking there were so many others ways to do this or end this. A happy ending isn't always needed, but in a kids movie (a small kids movie) it should be clear and not horrible. This was just odd.<br/><br/>Are they leaving room for more movies with woody? Are they leaving room for more movies with the other gang and not woody. I didn't hate it but I agree that the over all feeling was different. But again as a stand alone would be fine."

","Number 4 has its moments that children will find funny, amusing and delightful, grown-ups will know and understand its deeper and wider implication of the narrative to see that this simply goes just beyond cuteness and cuddles. If you're unfamiliar with Toy Story and this franchise it all started during the last millilumen and the year 1995, then the second instalment fell into our laps in 1999 and subsequently propelled into the new-age for number three in 2010, and now, 2019, this fourth adventure of friends and frolics has hit the Big Screen and being produced by both Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures.<br/><br/>Throughout the franchise's history its main projectile has been to convey the lifelong traits that come with companionship, camaraderie, ownership via family, trust and love. All fitting attributes to enlighten, educate and entertain through the medium of cinema. Number 4 is no different, but we are aware that this is, so far? the final addition to this tetralogy and has further significance within its framework.<br/><br/>There is a story here that portrays all of the above, expectedly, and we see the usual gang, of course, and there are a few waifs and strays adding new personas to freshen and lighten the mood along the way; wonderful stuff.<br/><br/>With this course of action, we see a new generation and their love all all things that those young at heart love best; toys and toys as playthings.<br/><br/>This is the charming and underlying journey that stands out, as too, the perpetual theme throughout, of the toys as they hit the road to a new adventure; Roads are long and roads are never ending. It is this journey that Woody & co. find reason, faith and belief not only amongst themselves but within their own strength to take a wider responsibility and to broaden their own individual horizon. A fortitude to encourage those young of mind and to evaluate for those of a road further trodden; A journey, a story, fit for all, including grown-up, kids and toys alike."

","So, now we see how the Disney of its early days became the boring, heavy-handed Disney of my childhood. No matter how many people lauded Disney's movies for being wonderful children's movies when I was a kid, all I saw was boring. And, I actually loved the earliest (1940's and earlier) Disney cartoons.<br/><br/>In Toy Story 4, you see glints of the fun, interesting Pixar of old, but you're constantly bombarded with boring storyline that doesn't seem to go anywhere. Only in the end do you see the overall plot and Disney's life lesson that took an entire movie storyline to communicate: in this case, it's that everyone learns to let go.<br/><br/>In Toy Story 3, we saw the sad end of the path everyone travels from childhood into adulthood. I cried and my heart ached at the inevitable separation we experience as we all become adults, as seen through the eyes of the child's toys we had all grown to love since Toy Story 1. Inevitably, we all leave our childhood playthings behind.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4, if you watch it through to the end, extends that story to the toys like Woody and Bo Peep, showing them also grow in that way, leaving behind what they always clung to, what they always used to justify their existence. And, interestingly, Bo's character has grown into a strong, modern female character because of that, implying nobody, especially women, needs to cling to another person (man or woman) to justify their existence and give them purpose. It's a great message.<br/><br/>But, what you end up with is, overall, BORING. Never, ever, in the past have I ever started to fall asleep during a pure Pixar movie. I did during Toy Story 4, several times. My daughter just wasn't captivated by this movie, not enough to watch it more than once, and I doubt she seriously put together all the pieces to get that message as I stated above. There were a half dozen good parts of the movie, but it was mostly just DULL -- like the Disney movies I grew up with that I generally didn't care to watch.<br/><br/>So, if you deliver a good message that requires you to watch the entire movie, not missing parts of it, putting all the pieces together in the end, have you accomplished anything worthwhile when nobody will stick around to the end? The Pixar of old entertained kids and adults together, in different, refreshing ways, and delivered good messages at the same time.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 just shows that the Pixar revolution has, in fact, been fully absorbed into Disney's fun-destroying movie distortion field. I would not be a bit surprised if the next Pixar project is a Care Bears reboot movie..."

New toys are always welcome. Peele's bunny is a perfect addition to the family , giving this sequel 'humour' that it's predecessors lacked(although not by much) . Also who wouldn't love Canada's greatest stuntman (he's the man : Keanu Reeves!).<br/><br/>I would've given this movie a perfect score , but there's something holding it back. I feel that the movie is a tad bit stretched , especially towards the end.
But a constructive plot , free of clichés ; is always welcome , as is here.
Younger viewers will have something to take home too , I believe.<br/><br/>It's hard to make any movie , difficult to make a really good one , and (you've guessed it) even harder to make a good sequel.

"MinistryofDoom","9","0","2","1 October 2019"," A Wonderful Entry in the beloved Toy Story series
","Toy Story 4 is a great film that very much feels like a curtain call for the series from the start. It both delights and saddens but keeps you aware that an ending can always become a new beginning. This time around, the story takes place much further than Andy's old neighborhood of the previous films. The cast of characters , once again led by Buzz (Tim Allen) and Woody (Tom Hanks) are taken on a road trip where they run into obstacles and cross paths with new toys played by newcomers to the series including Christina Hendricks, Keanu Reeves, Keegan-Michael Key, and Jordan Peele.<br/><br/>Pixar has really advanced their story-telling and animation far beyond where they began in the first Toy Story, 25 years ago. It's hard to imagine that it's been that long but it only feels like yesterday that we saw Woody and Buzz wrestling in the parking lot outside Pizza Planet. The film looks much more amazing that previous entries in the series. The colors are much brighter, the animation is more fluid, some scenes and props almost look like live footage, and the story-telling is deeper, more grounded, and touches on much more serious themes than before. Veterans to the series will also be happy to know that composer/singer-songwriter Randy Newman is back too.<br/><br/>Overall a fantastic film and a great book end to one of Disney/Pixar's most popular and most beloved properties."

","Growing up, Toy Story was a movie I would watch over and over again. I was captivated by the incredible animation and heartfelt stories of toys trying to find their place in the world. Toy Story 3 gave me a sigh of bittersweet release as I saw the characters I grew up with finally find peace with Molly and Andy heading to college. Like many, I was upset upset with the announcement of Toy Story 4's production, but after seeing the movie, I found myself liking this movie for the reasons I thought I would hate it and I hated it for the reasons I thought I would like it.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 follows Woody and his role as Molly's toy. He is not played with very much and misses the days of making Andy happy. This plot point makes for a very interesting character arch for Woody as he figures out his purpose in life. This movie is 100% about Woody and I thought that it worked wonderfully well. These themes may appear complex, but the movie does a wonderful job of explaining a toys purpose through the complex antagonist of Gabby Gabby, who simply wants a single child's affection, to the free-spirit nature of Bo-Peep, who finds enjoyment in being a lost toy and becoming her own person outside the role of toy. Combine this with the absolutely beautiful rendering and lighting, along with Randy Newman's incredible score, and you have an incredible movie.<br/><br/>That is if the movie was only about Woody. It is evident throughout the movie that the writers had little idea what to give the other characters of the toy gang to do. The side-plot follows Buzz as he attempts to become a better leader by ""listening to his inner voice."" This gag plot line gets tiring fast as every time it happens, you are reminded of the great leadership Buzz had exhibited in previous movies, especially 2. This movie completely mischaracterized Buzz as an idiot rather than the fish-out-of-water ignorance he had in previous movies and this detracts from the movie. Any new character that wasn't Bo-Peep or Gabby Gabby felt under used or unnecessary for the movie.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this is a solid movie with heart and a good movie to watch with the family. But i think I'll stick to watching the first 3 over and over again."

It had a great, intriguing plot which is definitely similar to another Toy Story movie about a toy getting lost, but it had unique twists to it. I'm not sure about the ending though; I don't like the idea Woody has left all his friends behind, especially the ones who have through a lot with him in the other movies like Buzz and Jessie, but I guess he can be happier now that he's got someone to love. However, I wish it was Jessie instead of Bo Peep especially with what they went through in Toy Story 2, but I guess it doesn't really matter that much.

Nothing really happend. It's all kinda happening in one place. And it can't be compared to the other three. And also I strongly dissagree with the ending. It shouldn't have ended like that.
But the movie was far from bad. It was good. But not that good. So if you want, go see it. It's not as bad as other people describe it."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","4","12 September 2019"," The franchise keeps going strong even after all these years
","Okay, here we have ""Toy Story 4"" and the title is somewhat self-explanatory almost as this is the fourth installment to the famous and super-successful animated film franchise and this one was released now in 2019, almost a quarter of a century later than it all started. And also almost a decade after the third Toy Story movie which many (inclusing myself) considered perfect closure really, but as always with almost every very commercially successful film series they keep coming up with new additions. Still, this is not meant as a negative criticism because if they turn out as nice as this one here, then there are no regrets from my side they made it. And honestly when can you ever not trust Pixar and Disney. Very rare. So now the director of these 100 minutes here is Josh Cooley a voice actor on Up and Oscar-nominated for his really witty and funny ""Inside Out"" screenplay and after some short film directorial efforts they leave the fate of the newest part of the franchise in his hands and they made no mistake doing so. As for the script, Cooley is also involved, but you also find the name of Pixar Legend John Lasseter and surprisingly also the one of Parks&Rec actress Rashida Jones who I really did not expect here, but it shows how much talent this series has to offer beyond Pratt and Poehler and also some of the others for sure. But back to Toy Story now. I thought it was a fun watch, even if I must say I am still a bit baffled how these toys manage to keep their very agile life in secret still and have done so for years, decades really because lets be honest here sometimes they can be pretty clumsy. Or lets take one specific example, namely when Jessie gives back the sheriff star early on to Woody. Now had Bonnie a better memory, then she would have been surprised what's going on, but this is not what small children remember I suppose. Okay, so much for the realism component. Lets not dissect the film from that perspective now, but at least take a look about all the many things gone right here.<br/><br/>The first and definitely among the most important aspects is that they got all the voice actors back from the older movies. This includes Hanks obviously, but also Tim Allen who was like the alpha male comedian/actor when it all started (look at his programs, or don't) just in case you wonder why he is doing Buzz Lightyear. But also many of the new characters they introduced like the Canadian stunt motobike rider (Reeves) or Ducky and Bunny (Key&Peele) are worth it and breathe new great life into this not dusty franchise at all. Often these kind of films stand and fall also with the antagonists and how memorable they are and in this department it is a success too as we have a little doll who wants a part of Woody, but it really isn't one Woody needs too much and it helps her in fulfilling (what she thinks is) her dream, so it is all good and she is not scary at all. On the contrary, they are helping her with her dream too in the end. And her aides are these seemingly robot-like gentlemen who are honestly slightly scary also with their faces, but not in a really bad way honestly like they are really just following orders. Still, there are these moments when they are turning their heads and one occasion even 180° around, which reminded me a bit of The Exorcist, even if I had no idea if it was meant this way, but it is one of the things that grown-ups will recognize and kids probably won't. Now if grown-ups even watch this film. In my showing I was the only one in the audience altogether, which was nice, but definitely not what the film deserves. Still it's been in theaters for a while already at this point, so I guess early on more people watched it and it was a commercial success again too.<br/><br/>Another character who deserves a mention is Forky (Tony Hale, Veep), who was among the best and funniest things of the entire film when he was introduced with his constant attempts to make it to the bin, a real case of lost identity and he has to come to terms first of all with being an actual toy and not garbage, even if it is never really too much on a more serious note about that. The comedy completely prevails with this little fella and how long they really kept his story line going even at the center of the film showed how classy the script is. Luckily for him, at the end, he even finds a partner, which will make things easier for him. So yes as good as the film was in terms of drama and emotion as always with Pixar and Disney really, comedy is mostly key here. I really adored the ""has a child"" running gag used on several occasions and it really doesn't get old. And there are many other funny moments. You will recognize them when you see them. The old and new characters who all have a lot of attention to detail make them work without a doubt and will have you in stitches at times. Just one more example when Buzz finds out about his inner voice and how he reacts to it was really great. Now I like Woody and cowboy( toy)s are cool, but by now he feels more like a vehicle to boost all the other more special characters around him, even if at the very center of it all he is still in the middle of the plot too also when it comes to making crucial life decisions. Maybe this did not do too much for me because I have never been a really big Bo Peep fan, so it is at least partially subjective, but makes kinda sense that the sheepkeeper ends up with the cowboy. I'm just more of a Jessie fan, I can't deny it. But still the more serious stuff does not come short either. Like when Woody says bye to all his friends at the end (now that will be a challenge to reunite them for a fifth film, which will certainly come), it is pretty touching no denying. And what else touched me was Gabby Gabby's fate because you could really see how the girl she wanted to be her child would not love her as much as she wanted it to happen, but when she finds somebody else who was as lost as herself, it is just the sweetest moment ever. You can also make real life parallels about love and attraction here. Still very subjective, you will maybe be moved by other moments more. But you will be no matter by what. Okay finally a few words on some of the audio. Randy Newman is back with his easily identifiable voice to provide some new songs, but we also hear some of his old works. And I watched the German dub, so I cannot say anything about the English-language actors this time, but the dub was fine, even if Bully Herbig was the only truly known name. or maybe because of that because all the supporting characters were voiced by experienced voice actors and not big name German actors. The only other one I knew was Kavanian, not a surprise he is in here next to Herbig with their common past. So this was a really good film, three stars out of five and if I gave half stars maybe 3.5 even because at its peak it is certainly 4 out of 5. Again a definite contender for Best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars with inclusions maybe for screenplay or song too. We will see if Frozen 2 can be a worthy contender in the key category. But it doesn't matter anyway, even if I am glad they are pushing each other to new heights. No losers in/for this movie except those grown-ups who still refuse seeing the newest so so good animated movies. Their loss. A definite thumbs-up for Toy Story 4!"

","After over 20 years the toy story film franchise begins to fragment and diverge. Once more returning for an emotionally crushing outing the toys are back this time concerning a fear of becoming unwanted. Exploring new settings and introducing new characters it's remarkable how it dabbles in other genres such as horror and comedy and is a truly outstanding final product. Boasting an all star cast of A listers the new introductions don't disappoint and the ending of woody leaving the core cast was similar to the ""I love you 3000"" of Endgame earlier this year. A triumphant return and hopefully a good start point for diverging toy tales"

","I honestly don't understand these people who are saying such harsh things about ""Toy Story 4"" (2019) this film has NOT ruined my childhood. This movie felt complete to the whole franchise! And this movie is about Woody. After Andy gave Woody and the gang to Bonnie. Playtime was just as perfect as when Andy used to play with them. And Woody was enjoying it! But after a few months later, he finds himself being played with less and less and felt like he is useless to Bonnie now. After Forky came around, he made sure that Forky understood that Bonnie loves Forky and that he means everything to Bonnie. Woody's job is to keep an eye on Forky and make Bonnie happy. Later on in the film Woody finds Bo Peep and reunites with her. Bo trying to help Woody understand that there are plenty of kids out there and to have a better place in the world than just sitting in a child's bedroom. Woody starts to realize that and even though Bonnie doesn't care for him anymore, he will be leaving his friends. And he makes a heartfelt goodbye. This movie is DEFINITELY worth it!!! I HIGHLY recommend watching the final chapter of this beloved franchise! If you don't have the heart to even enjoy this film in the first place. Or not a fan at all WHY wast your time! This movie is meant for US FANS who grew up watching this franchise. And deserved this final chapter. Toy Story (1995) is about friendship, Toy Story 2 (1999) is about Love and Sacrifice, and Toy Story 3 (2010) is about growing up. So this movie is another message to us all about letting go and moving on. And I find that absolutely GENIUS! I am so great full that we all have one last Toy Story film that succeeded to stand tall with the first three films!"

","At last I saw the movie with my kids.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I got what I expected, though I'm also not sure that's a bad thing. For example I read many complain about the scary scenes (ventriloquist dummies really feel like zombies) but they have probably forgotten how scary the altered toys were in the first movie - and probably they did not watch the movie with kids back then. As for the movie, the numerous rewrites show, as it's slightly unfocused and the drama - of which we have a lot - might be a bit less effective than it could have been, but otherwise it's a rather interesting one - that is, I believe, not a kids' movie anymore. I mean, yes, kids (those who don't get scared) might find some scenes to enjoy (probably fewer than in earlier episodes) but it's a lot more for adults who grew up watching Toy Story. Or...<br/><br/>...maybe it's not even really for them; it is mostly for Pixar. It's one of the very personal Pixar stories. Pixar likes to tell stories about themselves. That's how, when they introduced the (more or less) first full-length CGI movie it was about a toy with new technology vs. toys with old technology and finding how these can exist together. Cars, the other love project for John Lasseter, was also about new (highway and race car) vs. old (route 66 and cars), the new one helping out the old one in the end. Then there was Ratatouille, made at the time Pixar was considering leaving Disney, also a movie that was almost completely rewritten during production, and it was about a rat who proves to be a great successor of a mouse a chef who appears holding pans in Mickey Mouse shape or, once, in a traditional animated form, while the head of the restaurant was trying to make more and more money by franchises instead of focusing on quality and bringing out the childhood wonders from their guests, finally the rat opening a succesful new restaurant independently. And now Toy Story 4 bears the credit of 8 people as 'original story by', including John Lasseter who did not take part in the movie in any other way (not even as a producer) after leaving the company for the known reasons.<br/><br/>Whatever Lasseter did or did not do, I believe his leave must have been a somewhat bitter event for the studio and it shows in this movie that is full of leaving and finding new friends, giving others the possibility to talk and entertain others, finding your love, finding out who needs you the most... and letting go. Of course it also works if we have no idea about Pixar; it's growing up and leaving your family, it's getting older and letting your kids have their own life, so it's about fundamental developments in life which makes it strong... even if not the happiest episode in the series."

","Disney has had a huge impact on me ever since I was a little boy. Somehow it's just naturally become a part of my life and I think it's one of the best things that's happened to me for crying out loud. Saying that, I'm probably not the most objective one out there when it comes to Disney but hell bare with me and here's what I thought of its latest movie releases ""Toy Story 4"".
So I'm this 00's kid aight so one of the first animated movies I actually remeber seeing was ""Toy Story 3"", which blew my socks off and today I still think that it's one of Disney's best works in the last 20 years and even beyond that if you will. So when a couple of years ago it had been confirmed that the franchise was to have another sequel I admit at first I didn't want to hear anything about it, especially having had the previous chapter sum up so well. But there was no way I would've missed it for the world though and I must say that ""Finding Dory"" and ""Incredibles 2"", both sequels of our childhood favourites ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Incredibles"" being fairly above average gave me some faith in this one. And man it actually was really good, way better than I had expected.
First things first, I really appreciated the first scene that took us back in time cause it finally showed us what had happened to Bo Beep. After that, in present day Bonnie had grown a bit, she was almost ready to go to school but first her and our beloved Toys went off to one more trip. If it only weren't for Forky, the newest member of Bonnie's collection of Toys. That's all Imma say, you gotta find out what happened next yourself. But I do wanna say that this little adventure they all got into was really fun and full of reunion, humour and different characters that all together were a perfect match. I liked the story, though now that I think of it the whole franchise didn't necessarily need it, but I don't mind it at all. The ending was rather surprising for me, but one could actually see that coming. And omg those easter eggs (you'll know when you see them) lifted it even more for me. It was great.
I also wanna point out the high level to where the animators have got as of today. It's so wonderful to see those changes, all those details have been elaborated so well. You can feel how real it's become to be. Soon enough we might not be able to distinguish a movie from an aninated one.
Yeah in conclusion I enjoyed it more that I thought I would. I was literally the older guy with all those kids gathered around me from this meme. Obviously everyone that's been on this journey with Disney forever now shouldn't miss this one either."
"austinthescienceguy","6","0","4","18 August 2019"," Shh, Don't Tell Anyone I Liked It!
","Do people really hate this movie this much? It's really not bad! Not great, it's no Toy Story 3 after all, but it's really not terrible. Yes the movie is mostly about Woody, and some of the old characters don't get as much screen time as they used to, but that didn't really bother me much. The only complaints I have with this movie are that Toy Story 3 was already a good ending to the series, rendering this movie unnecessary, and the two plush carnival toy side characters were kind of annoying. But all in all it's a decent movie with an okay story, decent humor, and beautiful visuals. If you want to go see this movie, go see this movie. If you don't, then skip it, but if you do, don't let the vocal minority turn you away from it."

"dfranzen70","8","0","4","7 August 2019"," Freedom for the toys!
","I enjoyed Toy Story 4, which is sort of like saying I like to breathe. It's nigh impossible to dislike Pixar's flagship series after 24 (!) years of laughs and heartstring-pulling. Now, along with most people I figured that Toy Story 3 was the end of it all, as Andy goes off to college and the toys wind up with another kid, named Bonnie. But oh, no! There are more feelings to be felt. Bonnie, then a toddler, is now entering kindergarten and is very anxious. Woody sneaks off to her orientation and watches sadly as Bonnie interacts with no kids and appears to feel excluded. Left to her own friend-making devices, she constructs a new friend all of her own, a spork with googly eyes, pipe-cleaner hands, and popsicle-stick feet named, uh, Forky. And by putting her name on his feet, Bonnie gives Forky life. So now we have an all-new toy, one who has never been a toy before (he insists he's trash, as his components were fished from a trash can). Woody sees how much Bonnie needs her new toy, as sort of a security blanket for the stress of kindergarten, and he's determined to make Forky understand his lot in life and his importance to Bonnie. Along the way, Woody has a chance encounter with a figure from his own past - Little Bo Peep, who appeared in early Toy Story films but who has been gone for some time. Bo has it going on, living the life of a ""free toy,"" i.e., one not belonging to any kid - even though that's (apparently) what most toys want. Woody's been someone's toy forever - is this something he wants as well? This movie presents a bit of a crossroads for Woody (less so for the other toys), and as with special messages in the previous films, it is wonderfully handled and expertly expressed. First, let me look at the good stuff, of which there's plenty, from this movie. The voice actors are, as usual, pitch perfect - and it's nice to hear Annie Potts back as Bo Peep. Key and Peele are along for the laughs, and Christina Hendricks, Tony Hale, Keanu Reeves, and Ally Maki are each wonderful additions; everyone feels like a natural fit, not shoe horned into a role. Then there are the inevitable action scenes, some of which are copied from previous TS films and others that are brand spanking new. Very well done; if this were a live-action movie, I'd be praising the choreography. Also, despite the contemplative, life-affirming lessons presented by the plot, the story never stagnates, and the toys learn on the fly (as opposed to learning after deep inner reflection, I guess). Now, the only slight downside for me was that this, again the fourth effort in the series, doesn't quite match up with the others for pure sentimental grandeur. It's not that the plot is trite; kids should love it for the same reasons they loved the other movies. It's just that it feels as if we've been led to the emotional precipice more than once in the toys' journey, and the journey (even with its inevitable strong payoff) doesn't pack the same punch as the first one. And that's about the extent of it. For me, the best movies have several scenes where I hear a sentence like the following in my head: ""This is why I love movies."" There was one such scene in Toy Story 4, which is one more than most movies but fewer than the first t three in this series."

Yes, it is easily the most pleasing visually, the technology has clearly evolved so much since the original. Should it exist? Unfortunately, I have to say no, there is just no need for this film, 3 boxed things off nicely, all this film succeeded in doing was making an ordinarily emotionally stable adult slightly sad with its ending.<br/><br/>The simple truth is this film has a predictable story line which isn't even really a good one, it feels messy and written with dollar signs in mind.<br/><br/>Will I ever watch this film again, yes of course but it will always be tinged with a bit of sadness that this film was conceived with merchandising opportunities in mind and to allow one character a last hurrah."
"tobyjames03","8","0","4","3 August 2019"," Woody's Story not Toy Story.
","Widely dubbed as one of cinemas all-time greatest trilogies, Toy Story was an unblemished set of films, never misplacing a step, and while the surprise 4th rendition isn't quite that level of excellence, it's still as charming and heartwarming as ever.<br/><br/>The gang that we grew to love is still very much together, under their new 'kid' Bonnie. Woody our ever present source of righteousness finds himself struggling to come to terms with no longer being the beloved favourite. Something's never change though, as Woody remains the kindest and loyalist toy you would ever want. He goes the extra mile to ensure that Bonnie doesn't get down in the dumps with her kindergarten blues. This leads to the introduction of our newest member, the surprising engaging 'Forky'. Several events follow until we end up riding that old movie trope, The Road Trip.<br/><br/>Slow to get going, the story gets stuck in a loop. It's not till the end where you see the Toy Story you love begin to flourish and blossom, making you feel all those emotions this franchise has made you ever so familiar with.
Repetition runs rife, woven into the fabric of the narrative. The repetition begins and ends with Forky, the newest member of our toy chest. Suffering from a crisis of identity and belonging Forky seeks refuge in the place he believes he belongs. Thankfully this source of personal irritation is lulled by a tender scene, ran by Woody.<br/><br/>While it may start slow, the opening sequence is quintessential Pixar, a delightful recap (that I was more than grateful for), brimming with warmth and emotion, just lovely storytelling. Quickly catching you up on Bo Peep's initial exit, before her return as a kick-ass, wandering renegade, seeking a life of freedom, which opposes the standard Toy life.<br/><br/>As for the new characters, they're all good, and there's a few I would've liked to see more of - and had their backstory improved upon. Gabby is a refreshing antagonist for a film targeted towards kids. She operates in the grey area of 'villains', she is without a doubt an intimidating on-screen presence, but the lines are blurred between good and evil, which is pleasing to see. The other side characters are all good, standouts being Duke Caboom and Bunny and Ducky. Ultimately they're sacrificed as Woody takes centre stage. He dominates the screen time, gobbling it all up.<br/><br/>I do feel I should acknowledge that this 4th tale of the toys hits on similar beats covered in the first three tales. There is a distinct similarity in how the plot and character actions are bent to progress the story. At times it may feel contrived, but that feeling will be over-run by sheer nostalgia and joy that will never leave these characters.<br/><br/>In Toy Story 3 we all felt like the story had ran its course, and finished perfectly, but we were wrong, Toy Story was finished, but Woody's Story still had legs in it yet, and I'm pleased to say that this 4th installment did a wonderful job of telling and closing his arc, that meant so much to so many.<br/><br/>Simply it's Woody's Story not Toy Story."

","With this being the fourth installment of the Toy Story franchise, it surprisingly works out great and is super enjoyable. Pixar outright shows off their graphical skills with this film and is definitely eye-candy to all who are watching. The story concept seems to be very similar to the last three films (A toy gets lost/goes missing, other toys go to save it, etc.), but tweaks it up a little bit, which quiet frankly works and is not completely a big problem with this type of movie.

"diegosays","8","0","4","1 August 2019"," If Toy Story 4...
","I watched the first Toy Story movie when I was a kid. I watched Toy Story 3 before starting college.
And...I watched Toy Story 4 as an adult and it is good!
BUT, I feel like it could've been an historic film.
When I first heard there was going to be a fourth movie, I knew that the ending had to be about Woody and Buzz final adventure together.
When John Lasseter said he HAD to make a fourth one, this finale had to be the only option.
After the ending, of course we all cried...
I cried like a f#ing baby...
I mean... It's Woody and Buzz saying their last goodbye!!
But even though it is the perfect ending, I thought it was a little weak.
Here's why:<br/><br/>1- The final moment of this beloved toys lasts like 5 seconds.
I think I'm talking for everybody who grew up watching Toy Story, when I say that we wanted a longer goodbye between these two characters.
2- All the other main characters like Ham, Slinky, Rex, appear in the movie only for a short period of time and without that funny, interesting energy they had in the previous films.
3- Forky was a main character who, in my opinion, wasn't that funny and the viewer doesn't care too much if ""he"" is in danger or not. I like the idea of Bunny creating her own toy, but the idea of trash coming alive if you add feelings to it I think is a little weak.
4- They completely changed Bo Peep. We know that times are changing for good, but in this movie they really wanted to show it.
Bo Peep was turned into a ""women empowerment"" reference with her new ""outfit"" and all of those Tomb Raider action scenes and ""I don't need Woody"" anymore.
I'm not saying it was wrong, but I do believe it wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>5- Don't get me wrong, I really thought that in the final minutes of the film, a very romantic kiss between Woody and Bo Peep would happen.
And If someone told me: They're toys! What is wrong with you?
Let me remind you that, in the final scene of the first film we can notice that Woody and Bo clearly have a romantic relationship but they never completely show it.
If only...
If only Toy Story 4 would've had a longer goodbye between the characters, less Forky and the other unfunny characters...that kiss between Woody and Bo.
It would have been the best finale and yet historic ending of a Pixar movie ever made.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading."

","Forky was hilarious and a great addition at first and still is. But Woody leaving the ""Roundup Gang"" was personally awful in my opinion and another bad thing is that a selfish toy (Gabby Gabby) wants a voice box but did woody have to give it to her? Anyway Toy Story 4 was a good movie overall and I think we'll buy it since it was such a good movie... until the ending."
"Zappluger","7","0","1","31 July 2019"," It's The Best Weak Squash...
","As a child, Toy Story was something I would love and savour. Woody was a hero, one of the protagonists of my childhood; not to mention Buzz.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is a visual marvel, no doubt. The lighting and textures are GORGEOUS, and the sound design is similarly spectacular. The story is what knocks this down a few tiers.<br/><br/>The thing is, this movie is pointless. The story is easily the weakest, far weaker than the rest of the three masterpieces, and the themes of the film, namely what it means to be a toy, aren't explored creatively enough or thoroughly enough to merit anything else than a brief sense of sorrow.<br/><br/>It's lost potential. You don't see much of the characters from the prequels , and the ones that appear the most (Woody and Buzz) seem like they were written by people who don't really know the characters, diluted into much less soulful characters than they once were.<br/><br/>That being said, there are moments of comedy and moments of sadness. Toy Story 4 is certainly not bad, as I found the comedy to be some of the best of the four films in the series.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, Toy Story 4 is a film worth watching, but the diluted nature of both the plot and characters warrants only a 7 to the prequels scores of 9, 9 and 10 respectively."

","I will give this movie an 8 out of 10 because of how well made it is. All the technical aspects are world class. But this might be my least favorite of the Toy Story films, and that includes that shorts. I know that my opinion is influenced by the fact that I consider Toy Story 3 to have the most perfect ending in movie history, and that left my expectations as high as possible. I enjoyed the little glimpses of Bonnie we've seen in the short films, and I was excited to see what they would have her do with a full length story. I have to include in this review that I love the fact that they are consistent in having Bonnie say ""Hi"" and ""Bye"" to her toys without exception. But I didn't feel like #4 had any standout moments, like the toddler playtime in #3. It was just fine. I really hope that after some time passes, I'll watch it back and my appreciation for it will increase. I can't say I was disappointed, but it did leave me somewhat unsatisfied."

","Toy Time 4 was good!

She pleases the feminists by acting as the strong independent female lead, while also bringing the viewers a good time.<br/><br/>Only complaints are as follows: Those dummies are creepy af and gave me a week long of piss filled nightmares. Buzzy essentially has nothing to do all movie and it shows. The only moment of importance he had was to say goodbye to our favorite sheriff. The rest of the movie he actually does nothing and learns nothing.<br/><br/>Forkmeister is a despicable addition to the cast.

","Did it need to happen?No.But i am glad it did.This movie is just fantastic,the story is so emotional.The themes of this movie is just phenomenan the way the characters talk but existance and stuff is just one the most mature things I haver ever seen in a Pixar Movie.The final scene is just heartbreaking and satisfying.I am not gonna spoil it but it is just sad(in a good way).The new characters in this movie are actually very good,they have clear goals and they are not annoying.Woody being kinda of a father to Sporky is a blast to watch,and so is the movie.The only thing that I wanted more in this movie is more scenes between Woody and Buzz,because their relationship is very strong,and it is one of the best things in the previous movies.Overall a great movie,with flaws,but with great themes,characters,and a photorealistic animation that looks real."

"ildudeentertainment","9","0","1","28 July 2019"," The Send of Toy Story Needed
","For a lot of people when they hear or think about CG animation the first company that comes to mind is Pixar, and with countless instant-classics, there's a reason for that. Of course, Pixar first hit the limelight with its flagship franchise ""Toy Story"". Back in 2010, the film series wrapped up its trilogy on a sad but heartfelt ending with next to no loose ties, making news of a fourth movie all the more concerning. Lucky for myself and countless other fans, Disney and Pixar know how to live up and surpass expectations.
The movie picks up off the heels of its third entry and involves the toys embarking on a road trip only for the newest toy, Forky to get lost along the way. Woody seeking purpose after losing Andy goes after the toy on his own. ""Toy Story 4"" (2019) is Definitely Woody's story, with the other characters taking a major back seat for much of the film. While I must say, the new characters introduced are instant favorites, as is the newly introduced Bo Peep, it does stink that classic characters like Buzz and Jessie became background characters in possibly the franchise's last installment. Personally, I would have enjoyed the film's B plot to be a tad longer and have it feel more important. On the topic of characters, this film's villain is probably one of the best in the series. Gabbing Gabby like previous antagonists in the series is bitter in part of not having the ideal toy life and feels that fixing her voice box by using Woodys will fix that. There's never a point in the film where you don't understand her motives or pain, and while it's not overly different from what we've seen in the past it does come off better than ever.
While this movie's plot and script are incredibly well crafted, I feel the most important thing to address is its animation. While watching the movie there are so many amazingly well-designed scenes, filled with just the tiniest details. Whether it's the fur on a cat, blades of grass, or branches separating on distant trees you can't help but be in awe of it all. Then when you think about the animation of the first movie, how far we've come since then, it's just remarkable. This realization even brought a tear to my eye upon realizing how young I was and how old I am now in relation to the progress of the animation. At the moment of writing this, I can't imagine what the future of this art form will look like but I'm all for it.
The fact that ""Toy Story 4"" (2019) isn't just a mere cash grab, but instead a story that had every right to be told is just a huge testament to how amazing Pixar is. While I do wish some of the other characters got a better send-off, this is definitely an amazing ending to Woody Pride's story (and yes that is his official name. I just saw an article about it prior to writing this.) Growing up with this franchise I'm so happy to see it end on another high note. Without a doubt, this gets a 9/10 as it's incredible from Infinity to Beyond."

"dfle3","8","0","2","26 July 2019"," I wonder if this film will give very young children nightmares! 80%
","It's been years since I saw the last Toy Story sequel, which was Toy Story 3, I suppose (I had to look up the Wikipedia entry for that earlier film to see if the plot rang any bells for me). It sounded vaguely familiar, so I just might have seen them all by now. Perhaps the fact that I can't really recall any of the previous films in the series doesn't speak too well of them. Sure, I could recognise a photo of Woody, or Buzz Lightyear etc, if you had showed them to me prior to watching this latest instalment. On a good day, I could have even have remembered their names! It should be noted that I saw the series as a young adult at the cinema, not an impressionable child.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm guessing that this is the best film in the series. It has quite mature themes of love, loss and sacrifice.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the group of toys' new owner (I'd forgotten their old one, to tell you the truth!) a young girl called ""Bonnie"", adjusting to life starting kindergarten for the first time. Finding it difficult to fit in at kindergarten, Bonnie creates a toy from a plastic spork (i.e. a cross between a spoon and a fork, used at fast food restaurants). She becomes very attached to it and is unaware of its existential crisis caused by it being made into a toy.<br/><br/>Soon after, Bonnie's family embark on a road trip, with her toys. Plenty of drama ensues.<br/><br/>Now, to why I wonder whether this film might be scary to very young children:<br/><br/>Things are decidedly creepy in an antique store some of Bonnie's toys visit on their road trip. As an adult, I was amused by a jump scare, which fans of adult of horror movies would be used to. No doubt completely going over the heads of children, there was, I think, the use of a song which can be heard in the classic adult horror film ""The shining"" (based on Stephen King's novel of the same name).<br/><br/>Two toy characters, who sound like African Americans, are almost psychopathic, one could say! They fantasise about being violent to humans and in one scene, it was implied (or I had inferred) that they had killed a human. Intended to be comical characters, they do strike me as an odd choice to include in a film aimed at young children, especially.<br/><br/>Why do I mention this? Years ago I heard of a review in the US media about the Australian film ""Babe: Pig in the city"" which commented that it would be scary for children to view. Not having seen that film, I can't comment about that criticism, however, if you feel such criticisms are important to flag, then I've just done that here.<br/><br/>As an adult, I was amused by parts of the film. There is some slapstick humour to it. At least once I had a literal ""laugh-out-loud"" moment. I also appreciated the subtlety of the film. For instance, at times the dialogue would make you realise that what you'd heard before was ambiguous, and the later dialogue would disambiguate what you had heard before. That was nicely done in a scene involving the toys Woody, Buzz and Bo Peep, near the end.<br/><br/>Random observations:<br/><br/>* There is a scene in the film inside the antique store. It struck me as having video game potential...kind of like a Toy Story meets Metal Gear Solid game.<br/><br/>* ...what some of the toys do to a young man running a game of chance at the carnival struck me as being...somewhat socialist in nature! Bad for business, surely!<br/><br/>* The closing credits has an ""R.I.P"" for Don Rickles. Looking at Wikipedia's entry for this latest film now, I see that they used archival audio for his character's dialogue.<br/><br/>In conclusion, since I can't remember much of the preceding films' content (and former The Age newspaper columnist Jim Schembri's hope that Toy Story 3 be the last in the franchise as he liked it so much), I'd say that Toy Story 4 is the perfect ending to this story. I like how it has ended and I'm not really sure where the creatives can go to from here to keep milking this cash cow. Sequels would be contrived and any ""final"" film in the franchise would, no doubt, be subject to the studio not wanting to milk the series for more money...in which case they could reboot it...or start a new franchise with different characters...with maybe some cameos from the original series. I dunno.<br/><br/>N.B. I was going to give this film a score of 75+% but I've bumped that up to 80% just for the scene involving Duke Caboom's last jump on his motorbike!"

"DarthVoorhees","7","0","3","25 July 2019"," An enjoyable but gratuitous epilogue to the superior 'Toy Story 3'
","'Toy Story 4' feels like another tap into a drying well. That isn't to say it is bad. I liked it but I'm sorry I do not agree with those who say it is on par with the original three. As a piece that advances the story and characters 'Toy Story 4' really feels like a needless epilogue at best. It's just a movie that is in the shadow of a far superior preceding entry.<br/><br/>It isn't a bad film by any stretch as there is certainly a lot to like here. But it's heights do not come from Pixar's story telling strengths. The highlight here is the humor. The movie has some very funny moments( from Ducky and Bunny especially). The movie really goes for the jokes but the emotional moments don't really land. problems really has to do with the script. I think the existential crisis that Woody goes through isn't really earned and it just doesn't feel organic to his character development through the original films. 'Toy Story 4' also poses a lot of questions about a mythology that seemed pretty established by this point. It never really was explained how toys came to have lives of their own and so it was kind of interesting to see Forky's origins. I guess I just thought that what gives the toys their life and soul was their kids. It's kind of odd just to have the toys venture out on their own.<br/><br/>The good news is that the animation from Pixar keeps improving with each picture they make. 'Toy Story 4' is an astounding visual achievement. The color palette is breathtaking and the characters are more emotive than ever. This series is a perfect study in looking at how animation evolves.<br/><br/>I liked 'Toy Story 4', it's a sweet funny film that children will enjoy. It just didn't convince me of it's necessity to exist."
"littleangelik","8","0","3","24 July 2019"," A nice wrap up to a great series. Better than expected.
","I enjoyed all the previous Toy Story movies and was skeptical (as many were) about a fourth instalment. After all, what could be done after Andy passed off the toys to Bonnie? Although not as good as the other three, Toy Story 4 did manage to bring an additional conclusion to the story, and I felt it was done rather well. I think those who said this was more of an end to Woody's story were on the mark, especially since the focus was on him and Bo. Let's just hope that this is the final, final instalment. Please don't ruin what you have done Disney/Pixar. Sometimes you just need to leave well enough alone."

Deeply layered & textured w/the winning combo of comedy & heart that the best of Pixar produces, this film rewards in abundance."

","Toy Story somehow kept getting better across parts 2 and 3. They introduced characters you immediately cared about. They found new layers of emotion.

There were some diminishing returns this time around: this chapter of the story was not really needed, and we did not get much time with some of the characters we grew to know/love. Buuuuuuuut...it was still a solid story. The antique shop worked. The carnival worked. The last chapter for Woody worked. As a result, I found myself caring and laughing and getting more emotional than I expected. It was not Toy Story 3, but that's a high bar.

Mostly everything was good. But I will admit this film was unnecessary and had it's flaws. I didn't like how they portrayed Buzz, they made him weak and dumber while in the previous films he grew so much. I also think Toy Story 3 ended the beautiful franchise perfectly and it should have ended there instead. But in the end, Toy Story 4 was great.

","Let's be real about this, I (YoPeace, from Fanatically Correct) never thought we would ever get another Toy Story sequel after that awesomeness that part 3 was. But here we are again, as I bring a new review for Toy Story 4. As you can already tell from the previous sentences, this movie is not better than part 3 or part 1 for me, but it was a great movie to watch nonetheless. The movie will take you back to this incredible Pixar world, and will concentrate on a main theme that should explain on why it was made in the first place. That theme for me was closure, and it was very well portrayed in my opinion. It's a great family summer movie for the kids but mainly for the ones that grew up watching as these toys came to life before their eyes. The jokes are still as great, and the new added cast fits very well. With that said, I really hope this movie is their last run, because I don't think my heart can take more of this.<br/><br/>I (Omega from Fanatically Correct) second this review. I will add, that in my opinion, though this movie comes third in overall story, it just might be second in laughs. Some hilarious moments here.

","Like a lot of people I was a little apprehensive about Toy Story 4. The first three movies were fantastic and managed to build on the previous stories whilst being breathtaking in their own right. The third movie seemed to be the perfect end to the story. Another movie smacked a little of an easy cash cow. Whilst it's hard to get way from this there's no doubt that this is a fine movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a flashback to the days when Andy was still young and we find out the fate of Beau Peep which I can't recall being included in the original movies. We then get into the story of how the toys are fairing with Bonnie who received the toys from Andy at the end of Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Whilst the movie never quite scales the heights of the original 3 movies it's still a great ride.

After suffering the ordeal of a forcible amputation (at the hands of a doll NOT named ""Lorena!""), can a maimed Woody fare better than ""Jake"" did as twilight falls in THE SUN ALSO RISES? Or will TOY STORY 5 take a tragic turn, with a homeless Woody swearing off Bo, as unable to perform when it counts as ""Papa Hemingway's"" frustrated Mr. Barnes? Pixar's animated features are notorious for their dark undercurrents, and TOY STORY 4 is no deviation from this pattern.

","Toy story 4 is very different from its previous films, the story was executed beautifully and it was funnier than the last three films.

Although it ignores the other characters such as buzz, Jessie, Rex, Ham and so forth. Buzz is portrayed as an unintelligent person (in the previous films he wasn't) and is mainly there to play a comedic role, which he played well. But I can't just stop feeling that his character and personality was wasted after all these years. Furthermore the old toys barely had any lines, except for Jessie and Rex.<br/><br/>This movie was very new to me but it was overall enjoyable.

"sleepybone","10","0","4","14 July 2019"," Yes, TS3 was great. Now let it go!
","Almost every negative review I've read of Toy Story 4 makes some reference to it's being ""unnecessary, "" or that ""they should have stopped with Toy Story 3."" In other words, instead of fairly reviewing TS4, they're expressing their love for TS3 and its beautiful ending. Of course they are! How else could you explain giving such a wonderful movie a less-than- five-star rating? And anything tied up with childhood memories is bound to make emotions run high...but...<br/><br/>Before I wrote this review, I saw TS4 four times (so far). I also watched the first three movies over again. Plus, I have the advantage of having been an official, chronologically speaking, grown-up since well before the inception of the series, which may aid my objectivity. There are only a handful of movies that I've wanted to watch over and over again, and the reasons are always the same: good story, good acting, and good cinematography, plus the one undefinable quality of--no other way to say it--magic.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 has it all; in my opinion, even more so than the other great movies in the franchise. I must point out my special affection for Gabby Gabby, a three-dimensional role if ever there was one. Yet all the main characters display recognizable human qualities and growth. The uplifting ""message"" conveyed in the plot is that happiness is found through the selfless service of others, and that there is more than one way to be of service.<br/><br/>There are some scenes that will seem spooky to children, but nothing as downright horrifying as the denizens of Sid's room in TS1.<br/><br/>The graphics are amazing. Some of the backgrounds made it hard to believe that I wasn't watching a live-action film. But go for the story--it has an appeal that, again, I can only describe as Magic! No doubt, TS3 was a great movie, and had a tremendously moving conclusion, but lucky for us, the creators took the story to a higher level. This is not primarily a ""money grab"" (but of course, movies are made to make money), it's a beautiful labor of love. Don't miss it!"

","The fourth and we are told concluding segment of the Toy Story franchise, looks amazing but in truth never comes close to equalling let alone bettering any of its predecessors. Somehow the dazzling brilliance of real excitement and dazzling action with rib bending humour simply is not present. The movie simply limps along, never quite boring you but just never quite meeting your heightened expectations. As 2019 follows 2018 big Hollywood is failing it's audiences as one so so remake - sequel - prequel - franchise instalment - reboot - spin off after the other dulls the senses with dearie barely adequate increasingly boring story telling. Hollywood must learn and quickly that making the same film over and over is not the option to keep cinema relevant in the age streaming. We the audience are crying out for some originality, simply blasting the screen with more and more computer generated effects is simply lazy.

But - good things about the movie went around word-of-mouth, and me being an avid Disney fan, I finally decided ""Why the heck not?""<br/><br/>To start off, this movie looks AMAZING. I thought Toy Story 3 set the bar for beautiful and realistic visuals, but Toy Story 4 threw all that out the window with the opening scene. Everyone hyped the cat from the trailer (which still looked amazingly realistic), but I was more impressed by Pixar's use of lighting and color.<br/><br/>Story, on the other hand, felt weak for me, especially for a sequel. As I was watching it became difficult for me not to compare this one to its predecessors. Most of the characters we fell in love with in the previous movies played very smaller roles in this one (to make more room for the new characters to develop). Like Toy Story 3, Buzz was once again just a one-dimensional comedic character, and Jesse sat in the backlines. The pacing of this movie also seemed off for me since Forky became less of the main focus after the second half of the movie, and the ""B"" story (Buzz trying to save Woody) ended rather quickly. Overall, I felt like I left the movie a little empty, unsure if I agreed with Woody's final decision.<br/><br/>(Still, as an adult who grew up with movies like Toy Story, I found myself tearing up when Gabby helped the lost child, and she easily became one of my favorite Toy Story characters.)<br/><br/>In the end, do I think this movie was necessary? No. Is it as emotional and witty as Toy Story 3? No. BUT! Do I think it still has a good message (for both kids and adults)? Yes. Do I think it's still an enjoyable ride overall with plenty of laughs? Of course."

I liked the attention to details when Bonnie (the main girl character) picks up her backpack, she also moves a book. A lot of small details like this in the movie. Generally, in cartoons, on the image, there's the background and there are the main characters. The background is just there to be ignored. Here, sometimes things in the background matter.
At some point, Bonnie is called to eat some food, but is warned to wash her hands first. At some point, another warning, to use sunscreen. I liked this part, with educational tips & tricks.
""Listen to your inner voice"" - this is one main element in the movie. If you approach this as ""trust yourself"", I agree. If you view this suggestion as ""listen to your first instincts"", I disagree with it.
Things which are opposed in the movie:
Old habits of Woody vs. a big change in his life.
Disgust (garbage toy made of elements from the trash can, very realistical graphics, with sometime not-so-good-looking things, flashing neon, and so on) versus pleasure (beautiful graphics, images with the sky, clouds, fireworks, chandelier).
A range of emotions, laughter, romance, sadness, suspense, thrill, envy and so on. You are taken through a lot of emotions in the movie.
A balance between clichÃ©s (things work out as you expect, physics and so on) and surprise, you are amazed by somethings, didn't see that coming and so on.
A lot of time, you see toys (mostly, but also other elements moved by the toys) and the people not once look at the objects in their new positions and say ""Hmm, the object X has moved, I don't remember it being here 30 seconds ago"". It's a very nice game, I really liked it. As a viewer, you always look out for the change ""what's going to happen when they see object X having being moved"", but this never happens. But you think about it, and await a response, and the game is fine.
""It's not like in commercials"". Really enjoyed this. Brings realism into the movie.
Some toys are scary-looking (the Bensons) or disgusting (garbage toys) or old-fashioned and envious and angry (Gabby Gabby). In the movies, you can generally estimate ""oh, this is a bad character because they've made it ugly/angry/displeasing"". Here, some toys adapt (Gabby Gabby turns good), grow (garbage toys evolve), or get on the good side, but also get ignored (the Bensons). In most movies, a bad character, once recognized by some external features, remains the same throughout the movie. Here, it changes.
I liked the retro toy (Gabby Gabby) and the classic look of the Bensons.
The police are either men (one person) or women (two officers). ""What, women can't do X job?"". I guess that's fine, I don't think it should come on purpose, I would do this naturally, not on purpose (""let's make character X a woman"").
About saving everybody - some characters accept their fate (Bo Peep), others start a new life as a toy of children, others start a new life by helping others (Bunny, Ducky), others are ignored in the end (the people from the club inside the antique shop). While I appreciate Disney's/Pixar's wish to save everybody, I think a valuable lesson is that you just can't do this. Too many. Focus on the main issues. I like that.
The supernatural in the movie is all about the toys. Their ability to talk, their ability to be invisible to humans, while still interfering with their life, their overall impact on the course of action. Here, ""magic"" is about the main characters, which are the toys. Keep focus. :) I like that!
The most important factors in deciding the future fate of the toys in this movie are just two: Bonnie's love for her toys, and Bo Peeps relation(ship?) with Woody.
Overall, I perceived the movie mostly on a cognitive, not an emotional level. Inside Out (2015) touched me emotionally, some other cartoon where fun to watch, this was a very smart movie, but I didn't consider it very touching. Disney/Pixar surely tried a lot to bring emotions in the movie, but I didn't feel it that much.
At the cinema, pretty much no one stays after the credits start rolling, I would have stayed in the room just after the credits finish, but I'm generally the only one doing so.
There are some movies which are either highly emotional, or I just enjoy seeing them a lot. This movie didn't fit any category.
I've seen the movie with Romanian voices, not the original voices. I've watched two trailers of the movie after seeing it at the cinema and I didn't feel I missed much by not having the original voices. But I would have preferred the original voices of the actors.
Final conclusion: smart movie, well done, worth watching, but not rewatching, and while a good movie, not a great one."

","The movie is strong as Disney's developmental psychology is always strong and funny as Disney knows so superbly to entertain.... but is this job done to hasty?
I loved the third installment as much as I can love Lion King or any other Disney production that brings psychology and popcorn-fun to the ultimate levels of a masterpiece.
This fourth one could have been there too, if it was not a bit clumsy. Theme's in the story are not worked out properly and some characters don't add to the premise. Some action-sequences miss sparkle etc...
But it is looking for nails on low tide. The movies is just great.<br/><br/>The strongest part for me was the 'creation' of forky. For me, being interested in spirituality and technique, Toy-story is closely connected to the ideas on robotics and the origins of our moral compass. For me it strongly dives into the mysteries of early creation and what responsibilities mankind has, once creation 'earlyl ife' on its own.
The 'inner-voice' theme, throughout the movie, playfully touches this question too. It seems to suggest a 'trial by error' kind of origin, which i don't believe but do like. It's american pragmatism, which is a refreshing counterpart to my too philosophical approach.<br/><br/>Anyway, if there will be ever a fifth installment I hope the brilliant and warm-hearted creators od Disney and Pixar take more time to create a fresh approach, with better character development. In the meanwhile I will remember the little kid next to me who just laughed it's little ass:-))
Maybe thats the most meaningful proof that this movie is worth an 8"

","I am still torn as to whether I wanted this movie or not. I still think that Toy Story 3 was probably a narrative end that had no means of continuing the story. But lo and behold, we have another one. Toy Story 4 suffers because of some choices made at the end of Toy Story 3. Allow me to explain, Andy's toys should never have been donated in the first place to Bonnie because she never wanted them! And so now we have a situation where Woody is sidelined and not played with and his badge is stripped off and given to Jessie. What the hell man!! Really, I mean way to overdo the whole women power thing. I just thought that it was quite literally jumping the shark. Also, Gabby Gabby was promoting socialism. I can't believe it. I mean, I have to give credit to Pixar for introducing such a complex topic in an animated movie but then again, it was more like promoting it. to kids! I just can't take my mind off of that scene. However, the reason this movie is a pleasant surprise is because the new additions to the story especially bunny and ducky are absolutely amazing. Their interactions and humor infused dialogues bring such fresh air that I can almost overlook the egregiously bad things that happen in this movie. Another welcome change is Bo peep's character. I thought she was brilliant in the way her character arc titled towards becoming a lost toy. Her leadership skills though, need work and then the ending, which oh my god, is again questionable. So let's not go there. But overall, the movie is ok and worth watching AT LEAST ONCE."

Fun, but occasionally sloppy, it is nevertheless a home run.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 has two main qualities going for it: character-driven story and unparalleled animation. The action is driven by the characters' motives, not as mere fanfare. Woody gets lost, once again, when his new owner, Bonnie, made a new toy named Forky who has an existential crisis on his identity and purpose in life. As they journey back to their owner, Woody encounters his old flame Bo Peep who has been living without an owner for years. Bo Peep opens a world greater than serving a lone child. Conflict ensues as they encounter another toy, Gabby Gabby, who wants Woody's voice box so she can feel the love from a child. Toy Story 4 also expands the franchise by adding more characters. Despite its depth, the story occasionally gets sloppy due to execution mostly in the middle part. The animation, however, is unparalleled.

","The movie is very good. It's nowhere near as good as the original trilogy, but it is very good and it feels like a toy story movie rather than a cheap moneygrab (although, let's be honest, it is). Anyway I left the film with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth - what is Woody's purpose? All throughout the original trilogy and up to the finale of this film Woody lives for one purpose: to make his kid happy. In toy story one this idea is put to the test when a new toy takes his spotlight. In toy story 2 this idea is put to the test when it is suggested he might bring more joy if put on display for all kids to enjoy. In toy story 3 it is put to the test when he is forgotten about and held captive by another toy who was forgotten. These 3 films present meaningful and substantial challenges to Woody's purpose that he must overcome as it is his duty as a good toy to do. So is it ok that at the end of this fourth film he realises that he doesn't need to make children happy. That this is not his purpose any more? I understand why he would want to: he gets played with less than the others, he sees no peep perfectly happy without a kid, he passes on his voice box to another toy. But things like this never stopped him before!"

","Yes, I actually put up the money to see Toy Story 4 with the fiance and her niece and nephew. It's rarer than I'd like that we actually go to a theater..<br/><br/>I need to preface this review by saying I had EXTREMELY high expectations. Before this, TS3 was one of my favorite films of all time. The second was my least favorite, but I still enjoyed it immensely. The thing I think I loved the most is the ensemble that the toys create throughout the first three films. Yes, Woody feels like the main star, but then there's Buzz. #2 saw Jesse, and Rex, the aliens, Slinky, and all have their place to shine. #3 saw Trixie and others who really helped to build this cast of loveable characters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Toy Story 4 felt more like a spin-off about Woody, Forkie, and (not a spoiler since shes all over the advertising-----) Bopeep. The scenes that included everyone were some of my favorites, however, they were far more seldom than the previous entries into the TS saga. The animation and voice-acting were top-notch as always. but that's not what I go to a toy story movie for. Everyone I was with liked the movie a lot, but no-one was raving about it like I had hoped. The story felt predictable, the Forkie character began to feel flat after the novelty wore off.

Seeing his importance to Bonnie, Woody (Tom Hanks) desperately tries to keep him onboard whilst the family go on a road trip. Their escapades lead to Wood reconnecting with Bo Peep (Anne Potts) who was passed on by Andy's sister several years earlier.<br/><br/>I don't want to go overboard with my criticism here, there is plenty to admire with ""Toy Story 4"". As with all Pixar films it looks fantastic, the surfaces and textures are great. There's lots of work done on the backgrounds, cameos and Easter eggs filling the shelves of the antique store. There are a few moments that are funny enough to register with the adults in the audience, mostly revolving around Key and Pelle's characters or Keanu Reeves' Duke Kaboom, an Evel Knevil parody.<br/><br/>The problem is, it's just not as good, worthy or significant as ""Toy Story 3"". It's not as emotionally satisfying as it essentially reheats some of the series story points, there's no real villain to the story. The ending is a little contrary, both in terms of the ""rules"" of being a toy and anything we've seen in Woody's personality previously.<br/><br/>As I said, let's not go overboard with the criticism, it's a perfectly solid entry, but for Pixar and for the franchise, it feels a little underwhelming"

","Toy Story 4 is a surprisingly great movie. I was cynical going in, partly because Toy Story 3 was so conclusive, partly because I was disappointed with Pixar's sequels outside of the Toy Story franchise. I expected this to be a lazy, cynical cash grab but it turned out to be a funny, exciting, even emotional chapter in the series. The animation and voice acting is great and the film has a surprising amount of character development and depth for a children's film. The plot still suffers from the excessive reliance on nostalgia like the third film and implements many of the same tropes and themes from previous Toy Story films. Also, Buzz is strangely stupid and his relationship with Woody isn't as well-developed as in the previous films. However, I enjoyed Toy Story 4 far more than expected and I honestly think it's Pixar's best film in years. Don't see it with a bunch of annoying children though.

","I was pretty tough on this movie because I loved TS3 and believe it is the best in the series with a perfect ending. I was pleasently surprised at how they managed to include new characters in a meaningful way, with Bo-peep's return and character evolution being a highlight. Unfortunately, all these new ideas take away from the old characters screen time considerably. Rex, potatohead, ham, slinky and friends have a disappointingly limited role in this movie. A shame because I think had they made this movie longer and more complex, they could have included them in an active role, perhaps one similar to TS2. Buzz's role and character is also strange and I don't know what they were doing with him. Why so doubtful when we've seen him step up and become a leader at other points in Toy Story 2 and 3? As for Woody, this movie cements him as one of the most complex characters I've ever seen. After you see it, compare him at the end of this one to him in TS1, it's completely transformativee, yet still believeable (and a tearjerker). While some story/character arcs could have been done better, I still am okay with the ending they presented, as it doesn't undermine the ending in 3. It's a well done movie in of itself, but unlike Toy Story 2 and 3, I felt the story would have still been complete without it."

Perhaps not really a surprise, much like how Sling Blade began and it was obvious what would happen. The real problem I have with this movie is that there is alot of motion, and you have to really be able to watch this on a day when you are focused enough for your brain to process it: I mean, there is an RV road trip element to this movie, and the toys are constantly moving around, so it is important to follow what they are doing, intently. I think small children might have problems following it as well...

"aweynand96","7","0","3","2 July 2019"," Jumping the Shark: A Pixar Story
","Batman & Robin. Shrek Forever After. Spy Kids 4. These are a handful of examples where a studio puts their back into a trilogy, and then releases a forgettable, unnecessary, lackluster fourth entry. As it tends to go, most franchises eventually run out of fuel - it's enormously difficult to maintain quality with each successive release given budget restraints, popular demand, and changes in cast/crew. The good news is that as far as fourquels go, Toy Story 4 is far and above the majority. The bad news is that it's just not as good as the first three.<br/><br/>The magic of Toy Story is unparalleled, and there's a reason there is a market for it despite the original film being released nearly 25 years ago. Through the first trilogy we follow a band of unique and empathetic toys who deal with themes of loyalty, change, and self-confidence. Even after so many years the original film is such a joy to watch, and the third film wrapped up the characters' story in such a beautiful and satisfying way that it genuinely defied expectations. We got to witness all our favorite toys experience sudden turmoil in their lives and persevere through immense uncertainty; we also laughed, cheered and wept possibly more than either of the first two films. It was nominated for Best Picture for God's sake - that doesn't happen for animated films. It's safe to say Pixar absolutely nailed it.<br/><br/>Then the world got word of a follow-up, and expectations ran extremely high. Rightfully so, in my opinion, after such a strong finale nine years prior. We wondered if they would tell a story which takes place during some other time before the events of TS3, or if they would explore new and intriguing themes, or introduce fresh and fun characters. One of the three proved to be true. It's a new story, following soon after the events of the third film, and it is extraordinarily colorful and creative. But the great things about TS4 don't end at the setting; we reunite with an older character who introduces a new lifestyle, the animation is gorgeous, and the comedy, for which Pixar is usually known (though not as much lately), is ubiquitous. I loved the new cast and I enjoyed Woody's relationship with Bo Peep. I even liked the storyline in the antique shop, as obvious as the outcome was. The magic was present. The voice actors were excellent.<br/><br/>But as fun as it was, this movie is easily the worst in the series. I mentioned that it achieved only one of the three expectations - fresh and exciting characters. As for new themes, there really weren't any, and we instead retread over old motifs such as a sense of belonging, loyalty to your friends (and your kid), and, yes, consciousness as a toy. People may argue that the new character ""Forky"", who was crafted by a toddler, brings up new subject matter regarding existence; but Sid did this in the original Toy Story with his ""Island of Dr. Moreau"" creations. The conclusion of Forky's storyline is simply that he is a toy whether he likes it or not and that his purpose is to make a child happy - you know, like in TS2 when Jessie and Bullseye realize they can do the same for Andy. There is nothing really new here.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the simple and honest mistake of continuing the story after the events of the previous film. Instead of going a different direction and telling a delineated tale, they follow up with Bonnie, and it just does not have the same emotional impact as before. The shark, as they say, had already been jumped; the giant claw already saved the toys from mortal peril in the fiery trash pit in 2010. This movie feels like a soft, safe return to the familiar world, but with no real stakes, and no real new ideas, and far less of a connection. I liked it, but that's just it - there's not enough love. Whereas people still talk about Toy Story 3 today, I think this will quickly be forgotten. If we see a 5th film, here's to hoping they bring something different, and memorable, to the table.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","Toy Story is a remarkable franchise for its consistently enjoyable content, with similar plots and characters but different ideas and focuses in each. Toy Story 4 continues with the toy in danger that must be rescued from evidently evil people and Woody searching to understand his purpose. I found the humor in this one to be effective, between Key and Peele bringing laughs (especially the three scenes where they talk about taking out the old lady) and Buzz being really funny with his inner voice. The ending was fitting in Woody accepting that he couldn't live the same life he did with Andy and could let go. Him being with Bo and living more freely was a nice conclusion to the series. However, I do think it could've been better developed in this movie. We should have seen Woody develop from his staunch toys are made to help children into a broader toys can pursue their own lives, as Bo believes. Instead, all movie Woody continued with his complete loyalty to Bonnie, and then strangely decides to leave her to live his own life with little justification. Similarly on the other side, Bo refusing to help Woody and then nothing changing but her deciding to go back and help him was also illogical. More generally, I think the movie spent too much time on exposition and packing all these subplots and characters in, like Duke, instead of deeper character development for Woody, Bo, and Buzz and a more fleshed out plot than the wild heist. Still, Toy Story 4 delivers on fun and does ask interesting questions about what it means to be a toy with Forky and what their goals are. Far from a letdown, Toy Story 4 wraps the series up in a reasonable and satisfying way, even if it may be the weakest of the four movies."

BUT, I cried most of all when all the toys are hugging Woody when he decides to join Bo-Peep as a ""lost toy"", but it really killed me when Buzz and Woody hug for the last time and then the film closes out with Woody and Buzz saying ""to infinity and beyond"" and the film ends.

","By no means was Toy Story 4 a bad movie, I just don't feel it was needed. Toy story 3 gave us a satisfying ending to the series with Andy becoming older and giving all his toys away to Bonnie. The story could've ended there, but they made a 4th. Toy story 4 was enjoyable and gave me some laughs even as a teenager now, and even seeing the characters again gave me nostalgia and memories from my childhood. This movie actually gets a little deep when they get into lost toys and being outdated. The way the 3rd movie closed off would have been a more satisfying for the series than what we got in toy story 4, but I'm definitely ok with the 4ths closure. Overall a pretty good movie that was just unneeded."

","Brilliant story, some good laughs from the toys especially newcomer Forkie. But I felt the main characters were missing the enthusiasm in their voices. Hanks and Allen appeared to just speak their lines with little emotion to each situation.
Don't be put off by my observation. The film is good. Action packed, scary dolls, and a cracking script. But not a patch on 1, 2 or 3."

"pritol","8","0","4","30 June 2019"," A nice addition to the original trilogy!
","Toy Story 3 ended in such a well rounded way, with Andy having grown up and the toys being given to a young Bonnie. Any additional film in the series was always going to be more of a stand alone...<br/><br/>With Toy Story 4 that is certainly the case. Whilst the story does follow a few of the typical Toy Story themes (i.e - lost toy needing to be saved, a new toy that may not be as friendly as first thought) it is really Woody's story. The other toys, even Buzz, don't really feature anywhere near as much as in previous outings.<br/><br/>The introduction of a some new toys is well done, with a lot of laughs and feel good comic relief, typical of the Toy Story franchise. There is also the return of a previous favourite who has a strong impact on Woody's journey in more ways than one.<br/><br/>As always the story is nuanced in a way which makes it incredibly fun for the younger viewers, but also plays to the older crowd. In that regard the film does touch on some mature themes, such as, the ability to change and move on when your life no longer has the same core purpose, and it's never too late to have a second chance at love.<br/><br/>The animation from Pixar is absolutely fantastic, their best work yet with incredible detail evident in every frame. Overall, it is a familiar and enjoyable feel good experience. Like an old hoodie, it's relaxing, comfortable, and makes you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside."

She wants to see ""Annabelle"", which is a creepy horror film. I suspect she didn't want Mom-Mom to see a scary film OR she didn't think I'd want to go.<br/><br/>I've never went to an animated film in which at least one character resembled somebody famous. In the case of ""Toy Story 4"" it was a character named Gabby Gabby who looked exactly like Katy Perry.<br/><br/>First, the very best thing about the movie....the animation.<br/><br/>Yes great characters, great drawing, great animation. Of course it's by Pixar, master of such things.<br/><br/>Now we discuss what wasn't so good about the movie....I thought it boring.<br/><br/>Further, while the toy characters were intriguing, to include an astronaut, Little Bo Peep and all her sheep, a Sheriff and other characters that intrigue...what the heck is it with that fork toy?<br/><br/>It seems that the main child character went to Kindergarten for the first time and created her first toy.<br/><br/>It involved a plastic fork that Bonnie (the girl child main character) created during her first school day. She affixed ugly fake eyes to the eyes, some kind of string for the mouth. It was cute for a kindergartener but hardly any sort of ""toy"" a child would lust over.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is that the fork toy continues to dive into any close by trash cans because, well the fork thought it was trash, NOT a toy.<br/><br/>One more thing, don't bother with the 3D stuff.

"jkylebennett","6","0","1","29 June 2019"," A Fine Ending to Hopefully the End of the Franchise.
","The movie was solid. As far as the four movies go, this one isn't my favorite. It has a couple of very good story points. I found the movie to be a bit dull at points, particularly at the center of the movie. There were just a few times where I felt that it was a bit slow. It didn't stop me from enjoying the movie, but I did struggle to maintain interest at times. Let's just make this clear, I stand by the belief that these movies are for everyone and not just kids. So the excuse that ""it's a kid's movie"" doesn't fly with me. It's a family movie meant to appeal to everyone. What I had hoped for was a few more laughs. I really only snickered here and there, but I had hoped that I would have been laughing loud and proud at least a couple times. In all honesty, the theater was quiet. If anyone laughed, I sure didn't here them. I say that with remembering that I always laugh good and hard with the first 2 movies. I will stand by this, though. I fully believe that this movie is far better than the third. Toy Story 3 was okay, but I never really enjoy that one in the way that I enjoy 1 and 2. I'm sure that this one, the 4th, will grow on me over time. But, for now, I can say that this one didn't quite resonate with me as much as I had hoped. So, I guess I had my hopes a bit too high. I will say this. Toy Story 4 has a truly surprising twist ending that I definitely didn't expect. Though, If I had to chose between the 3rd movie's ending and the 4th, I would actually have to go with the 3rd. It felt more complete, making this whole movie feel rather unnecessary. Good, but unnecessary. If anything, this ending kind of undermined the ending to the third in terms of Andy's instructions to Bonnie.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't like Buzz's characterization in this movie at all. He was made out to be a bit of an idiot. He always felt more capable in the first two movies, and was decently capable in the third. But, this time around, he seemed like he had no idea what he was doing. It was as if he was there, but he wasn't present in mind. He lacked the ability to think for himself, which was never the case in the first two movies. He didn't seem like he was on his toes. It just felt very out of character for him.<br/><br/>Lastly, I really hoped that the other toys would have had a lot more to do in this movie. I know it's tradition for most of the toys to play background while the focus is on Woody and a couple other toys. That's what these movies are about. But, with such a large cast, there was plenty of opportunities for the others to get more chances to be involved. I feel that that was a lot of squandered characters and opportunities and talented actors to wind up getting shoved in the background with next to no lines.."
"julian-43","7","0","1","29 June 2019"," Superb animation but a Toy Story too far
","Firstly the animation: glorious and gorgeous. Pixar are still miles ahead and make the competition look like amateurs. The only downside was not the quality of animation per se but the choice of complexion for Bo Peep which irritated me throughout. How they settled on it after, no doubt, many many meetings is beyond me.<br/><br/>And now to the story and sadly and very surprisingly, a big disappointment<br/><br/>Forky is a fantastic character and provides much humour but feels underused as a central character compares with Buzz and Jessie.<br/><br/>The marketeers at Disney appear to have won the battle against the storytellers by sidelining Woody and our favourite toys from the previous films with new and relatively uninteresting new ones. An absolute and unforgivable waste of Mr and Mrs Potatohead, Hamm, Rex and Slinky. And sidelining both Jessie and even Buzz is a big, big, disappointment.<br/><br/>There were definitely tears throughout the long carnival scene at the end but there was not enough character development shown to convince that Woody would have made his final choice.<br/><br/>On a final note<br/><br/>The reference to Dreamworks and another film was appreciated<br/><br/>Don't leave the cinema until the very end of the credits<br/><br/>The final line of dialogue is absolutely perfect and poses the obvious question that has been unanswered throughout all the films. It should go down in cinematic history alongside that of Casablanca, Gone With The Wind and Some Like It Hot."
"leomoviecritic","8","0","1","28 June 2019"," Great add-on, but weighed down by too many new characters
","Getting this out of the way first: the first three Toy Stories are 10/10 movies in my opinion. The fourth had the potential to be on the same level, but it (just barely) misses that mark. I say this because it works amazingly as a movie on its own (great balance of breathtaking animation, good humor, interesting characters), but it slightly disappoints in the area where it really matters (giving fans of the first three a chance to see all of their favorite characters again). I get that the movies have always been focused on Woody's story, but his group of friends deserve more than a few lines each. The new characters (especially Key and Peele's stuffed animals) are funny but not interesting enough to justify pushing Buzz Lightyear into a minor role. Sticking with fewer new characters (was the mini cop toy really necessary?) would have made so much more sense and opened up opportunities to fit in the rest of the original Toy Story cast. When they make a fifth Toy Story (which is sure to happen, judging by the box office receipts), I hope to see more of the other toys we have been following since 1995."
"liamsnowball-28068","7","0","1","28 June 2019"," A final goodbye
","I have loved this franchise ever since I was a kid and watching the original all of the time on VHS. This was a very enjoyable film, however it has to be said it is the weekest Toy Story film (possibly Pixar's)
The plot for me was fine. Forky provided some excellent comedy throughout the film. I personally loved the scene where Forky kept jumping into the trash and Woddy having to stop him from doing so. Now let's talk about the ending. How were Pixar meant to end this? For me this was the right way Woddy leaving as he'd served his purpose and knowing so for me was great (possibly leaves it open for a cash grab spin off if they wanted to go down this route) it's a kids film so those complaining what did you want Pixar to do? Kill off the toys? Definitely not the ending was fine in my eyes.
All of this being said this is the weekest of the four films, it's nearly as good as three but to get anywhere near how good the original and the second film were this needed to be spectacular, which it sadly wasn't.
Definitely worth a watch for any Toy Story fan.
One final thing the scene with the camper van being drove by the toys and getting the dad stopped by the cops was such a great scene!! Probably worth a watch for that scene alone!"
"isaacj02","8","0","1","28 June 2019"," Familiar yet fun escapades with Woody and the gang
","Some may say the first three Toy Story movies are a prime example of the practically perfect trilogy; heart-warming, intelligent and entertaining, Woody, Buzz and the gang have become pop culture staples that have defined the childhoods of a generation. I approached Toy Story 4 with a healthy level of scepticism; what more could possibly be added to this franchise that had culminated in such a faultless conclusion? Yet here stands a fourth instalment, asked for or not... that in many ways keeps itself comfortably in the formula we know and love.
As we saw by the tear-jerking finale of 3, our favourite bunch of toys now spend their days playing with 'their new kid' Bonnie. Toy Story 4 starts off with a fuzzy familiarity that eases us in... until the introduction of a new character, Forky (a neurotic spork voiced superbly by Tony Hale). Expectedly, Forky becomes lost in a circus in the midst of a family road trip; it's up to Woody to get him back. The adventurous escapades that ensue are undoubtably good fun; for me, it felt like a much more low-key Toy Story film, the grandiose nature of some of its predecessors replaced with something smaller and more character driven. First time Pixar director Josh Cooley and writers Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom put together a neat package full of clever humour and all those other qualities that make a Toy Story film tick. Naturally it wouldn't be a Pixar outing if some deeper themes weren't explored; in Toy Story 4 we delve into questions of sentience, loyalty and purpose with all the maturity and compassion you would expect from this studio.
Tom Hanks once again delivers a heartfelt vocal performance as Woody, giving more raw humanity to a cowboy doll than should be allowed. Though this is suitably Woody's story, he is flanked by a colourful cast of supporting characters; notably, Annie Potts gives gusto to an old face and Key and Peele lend their talent to some delightfully fluffy comic relief. I would have liked to have seen a bigger role for some veteran Toy Story alumni (what are Jessie and the Potato Heads doing these days?), but the newer players are a lovable lot... and the level of fun you can tell Keanu Reeves is having as Duke Caboom is enviable. Every character and the world around them is fully realised in simply breath-taking animation, hyper-realistic yet still with a slick sense of style.
The question can still be raised, however, of the necessity of this film's existence. The truth is, apart from brief moments, we're retreading old ground here, exploring familiar themes and ideas. Whilst this typical Toy Story fare is successful in pushing the nostalgia buttons and entrapping us in escapism, there's very little new that is being brought to the table. From the storyline to Randy Newman's jubilant score, it's a caper we've seen before that loses just a bit of its charm. Despite this, however, Toy Story 4 is still a sure hit for Pixar and knocks most franchise four-quels out of the water in pretty much every way. For some, its conclusion will prove to be another tug at the heart strings... and even if (like me) you don't quite buy it, the whole thing is sure to leave you with a warm, pleasant feeling inside. All in all, Toy Story 4 may not be a revelation but it's a kind-hearted, amusing and entertaining film that harks back to everything you loved about the other movies. If only for that, it's certainly worth your time."

Right from the start Toy 4 was very easy to follow and maintained its smooth ascend all the way to the end (which came quick!!!). That said, I immediately give recognition to the writers and then, of course, to the cast/crew.

Overall I really enjoyed this movie and will one day see it again. It just has flaws<br/><br/>(Negative) My main criticism is the ending. Before that there are smaller other things such as Buzz not having being able to think for himself and in the end think of a plan. (Excluding the main toys like Buzz, Jessie, the other toys like Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato head didn't have a impact on the plot. It seemed like they were just there to make you cry at the end. Speaking of the ending I wasn't a huge fan of the way they ended Toy Story 3; however comparing 3 and 4 I much prefer 3. 3 left things on a bitter sweet side the gang made it out of sunny side together and they had a new kid too look forward to playing with. I didn't see it like that at the time and I needed time to understand it. In 4 even though Woody is happy it doesn't make sense. Woody has spent more time with the gang why would he just leave the gang? He's a loyal guy who would not leave a toy behind. YET HE LEAVES! IT IS HYPOCRITICAL! Bo could have joined like Jessie and Bullseye did at the end of 2. Woody didn't go to Japan he didn't leave the gang. My theory is that the writes at Pixar saw what Disney is doing with the older movies and making them spin off from one another. This movie was going to be a success at the box office no matter what and the executives would want to make a 5th movie in a short period of time.

"lukesbroadley","7","0","1","25 June 2019"," A GOOD Film, But Not So Special
","Non-Spoiler:<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 is a great film! It's great to see the gang back together one more time - or at least for a scene or two. That's my main problem with the film: there's not enough of our favourite characters (buzz, bullseye, slinky and the aliens). The film does provide an enjoyable watching experience with a story that is exciting and interesting. Woody is back again and with some new friends, but these take the place of the old favourites leaving the audience with a feeling of lacking, a lack of toy story's magical charm. This feels like a forced and unnecessary spin-off of sorts, yet is still a greatly enjoyable film that I would still recommend watching.<br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>The film opens with a fantastic scene, arguably the best scene of the film. This is the one part that really captures the old charm of all the toys teaming up to save the day. It's so fulfilling to see slinky and the monkeys, and RC's appearance really brings back nostalgia for the original masterpiece. The film then attempts to make the audience cry with the departure of Bo Peep, which, whilst not tear worthy, is moving.<br/><br/>The first half of this film is a very good experience with enough callbacks to the original trilogy whilst mixing it with a new story. Our first introduction to the fair and the playground with the return of Bo Peep is a truly heart-warming. Unfortunately the film becomes lack-luster after this.<br/><br/>The plot here-on is repetitive, and eventually repetitive and boring, with woody rescuing forky from the antique store 3 times! I heard genuine groans when he went back the third time. The sacrifice of his voice box seemed out of character and uncalled for, as Gabby Gabby did not deserve it.<br/><br/>Finally, the heartbreaking ending is sad and disappointing to me as a toy story fan. I do not believe that Woody would ever leave the gang for Bo and the new toys. This was totally contradictory to the message repeated throughout the the toy story saga! The importance of having a kid and making them happy - ""the duty of a toy"" - is completely bypassed and left me feeling genuinely disheartened leaving the film.<br/><br/>There are many great things about this film that do partially make up for its many disappointments. The score by Randy Newman is phenomenal and there are countless hilarious gags spilled throughout the film. The new characters (Ducky and Bunny, Forky, Duke Kaboom and the new and improved Bo Peep) are all fantastic additions to the toy story world. Unfortunately, this film feels out of place as a forced addition to the series after the beautiful ending of Toy Story 3. The lack of older characters saddens me as an audience member and many story points feel unnatural. Toy Story 4 does not live up the magic of its predecessors.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 starts off very promising but ends leaving us feeling disheartened. I would recommend the film, but do not expect it to be the spectacle that the originals were."

The elements are all there for a great Toy Story addition.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty good. Forkie is made from trash so he thinks he is trash. He constantly tries to run away to go be in a trash can and Woody is having to pull him back since Bonnie, his kid, loves him. One night, while on a road trip, Forkie gets loose and Woody must find him and bring him back before Bonnie wakes up. Along the way he runs in Gabby Gabby, a talking toy with a broken voice box that wants Woody's.<br/><br/>All the original voice actors are back including Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Annie Potts as Bo Peep who is now a lost toy. They are joined by friends from the second and third movie as well. Some of the new voices include Keanu Reeves, hot off his fan favorites John Wick 3 and Always Be My Maybe, and Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key as conjoined toys.<br/><br/>There are some pretty intense and scary scenes, most Toy Story films have them, so it might not be good for smaller kids. While Toy Story 4 doesn't do anything different or new it's still a great film that the family will love. It's funny and has it's teaching moments. Toy Story 3 had a great ending so I was a little hesitant about this movie. Was it needed? Not really but it was a fun conclusion to the franchise. Or is it a conclusion? Toy Story made $120 million it's opening weekend so I doubt this will be the last we see of the toys."

","Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang have managed to smoothly integrate themselves into the lives of their new owner Bonnie and are quick to welcome Forky, the newest addition to the group who doesn't quite comprehend life as a toy. While out on the open road, Woody (as loyal and intrepid as ever) finds himself separated from the gang on a mission to find Forky. Encountering new faces, and some familiar ones as well, Woody begins for the first time to justifiably question his purpose in life. Despite being the fourth installment in the series, this latest feature is just as engaging as its predecessors, with a well-crafted story that manages to unfold in very surprising ways, along with stellar animation, terrific vocal work, plus the charm and nostalgia of spending time with so many characters that fans have grown to love. Feel-good, touching, and adventurous, with clever gags, and moments of true hilarity thanks especially to the work of newcomers Key, Peele, and Reeves; for series fans it shouldn't disappoint. ***"

","I was super excited for Toy Story 4, love all the others but this one just fell short.<br/><br/>The opening scene was fantastic, beautifully showing the toys through the years with Andy and how/why Bo wasn't in the third film. After that the story was lacking, I felt it quite a simple story. Don't get me wrong he film has lovely messages and has some of the funniest moments of any Toy Story film but laughs aren't enough.<br/><br/>Personally the biggest thing missing from this film was Buzz and the gang. The Toy Story films have brought us a wonderful cast of characters that were just background roles in this one, it also felt they'd made Buzz a bit of a tool.<br/><br/>That being said I did cry, I mean did you see Rex's little face!? TS3 choked me but 4 made me cry.<br/><br/>I hope my opinion will change when I see it again but sadly as it stands I'm in no hurry to do so. 3 remains my favourite.

And the beginning credit scenes are out of place normally they would have the after credit scenes AFTER THE CREDITS. I mean, I thought the end where the Canada daredevil is the lamp and high fives the blue soldier, who hadn't been high-fived the whole movie, was clever, but shouldn't they have the beginning credits somewhere else? 8/10, very good, would watch again."

","I was rather skeptical going in. After the 3rd movie, I felt it ended the series perfectly, and that continuing would only be a money-grabbing mistake that would ruin the series. So, naturally, I didn't set my expectations too high when I went to see this. However, I was pleasantly surprised. They did a good job, and in a way, seemed to close the book on Woody's story in an appropriate way. If I had to put it certain way, I'd say that this movie felt kind of like epilogue to the series. True, it wasn't as good as its predecessors, but they still did a good job that left me satisfied. If I had one real complaint, it's that we didn't see enough of the whole toy gang, as the story focused almost entirely on Woody and Bo. Even Buzz seemed to get pushed into the background a bit. Other than that, they did a good job."

","So far ""Toy story"" is one of the best trilogies ever, and a fourth seems completely un-neccesary.

Unfortunately they have only managed to hit some of these marks this time, with some of the new characters (Who have more screen time than some of our regulars) no where near as likeable, and it all ends with a bit of an anticlimax.<br/><br/>Still it could of been so much worse and the animation is gorgeous."

I was really emotional to see Woody's devotion to Bonnie when trying to rescue Forky at all costs. The operation with Gaby Gaby was fantastic as well and yes I sobbed again.

","The previous 3 are great movies. But let's try not to compare too much.
Is it a good movie in itself? Yes, lots of fun moments, and with a nice hook of a story (forky) in the beginning to get everyone interested.
As do with all films and animations these days, there are hints of feminism for the sake of feminism. I think they (Rashida Jones in particular) wanted to make a female hero. Toy Story already has a hero (Woody) but out of all the Toy Story animations, TS4 makes Woody the most powerless, and the power is given to Bo Peep, a character that nobody cared about for the past 3 films.
Obviously, this is similar to controversies surrounding Captain Marvel.<br/><br/>Either way, the film kind of breaks Woody's ""be loyal and be a good friend to your kid"" motto is completely thrown out the window. It doesn't make sense.
TS4 is a fun movie, but to true fans, it will feel like it screwed up the franchise,<br/><br/>I think there's going to be Toy Story 5, and it's just gonna get worse from here."

","Toy Story 4 is a quality sequel that stands shorter among the other films in its series, but standing alone is a strong story. It is crafted to please old fans and new alike and delivers a nice ""once and for all"" ending. Also, I really like how the characters move like they would in real life. (I.e. some are stiff and jointed while others are flexible)"
"shaht-16429","9","0","3","23 June 2019"," It hits all the beats a Toy Story film should, although somewhat less effectively
","Toy Story 4 is another story that tackles the difficulties of growing up and moving on. On Kindergarten orientation day, Bonnie (McGraw) creates another toy: Forky (Hale) who has an existential crisis about his place in the world. While on a road trip with Bonnie's family, Forky ejects himself from the family RV, thinking he is trash, that is when he learns what it means to be there for Bonnie and what it means to be a toy. Along the way, he runs into some new faces and some old ones as well. Through many adventures and missteps does Woody realize his place in the world.<br/><br/>What the Toy Story movies have always done well is make the audience laugh and this is no exception. Ducky (Key) and Bunny (Peele) steal every scene they are in and are definitely the best additions to the cast, other great additions are Duke Kaboom (Reaves) and Forky who are welcome new addition with their own quirky character traits and well developed character arcs. Although what Toy Story movies do better than any other animated movie do is make the audience cry, and yes, this movie did in the best way possible. Growing up with these characters over twenty years can make one nostalgic for the times they were a kid and think back to all the toys they have had and the lives they might be living now. Toy Story 4 basically takes everything that made the first three great and does it again, but with new ideas and new characters. Although it comes at a cost, and that is it minimizes the screen time of all the characters that were so necessary to the first three movies.<br/><br/>Some characters like the Potato Heads (Rickles and Harris), Rex (Shawn), Jessie (Cusack) and Bullseye for example take a back seat while Woody (Hanks) and Buzz (Allen) get all the fun with Bo Peep (Potts) and Gabby Gabby (Hendricks). It is a similar problem that the Last Jedi has as well. An abundance of new characters and old characters is great, they don't have to have arcs, but they should not just sit around while the plot happens. They should be more involved in the story or they should be removed completely. These old characters only exist in the story just because they have to otherwise fans would be upset. What is really unfair to fans is saying a character is in the movie and then having them do basically nothing.<br/><br/>My only other problem with Toy Story 4 is the re-animation of old characters like Andy and his mom. It's understandable that animation has progressed over twenty-four years, and it is understandable that animation quality has improved over nine years, since the last movie came out. However the animated appearance of these old human characters is a little unsettling, similarly to that of Princess Leia and General Tarkin from Rogue One. It was done well in Toy Story 3, so I am not sure what happened here. All that being said, the animation is phenomenal, the ceramic, glass and scenery as well as cotton is animated with immense detail, and the toys look more realistic than they have ever, there is no uncanny valley with the toys, or the settings.<br/><br/>This is admittedly my least favourite Toy Story movie, but it is still fantastic. It was originally billed as a standalone sequel, however it relies too much of previously established nostalgia to really be its own thing. Admittedly what separates this movie from the group is that it doesn't have that one suspenseful scene. For example, the first one had Woody and Buzz flying through the air, the second had the airplane chase scene, the third one had the toys holding hands in a furnace, number four had no such scene, or if it did, it did not have the same effect as the other three. It's not necessarily a bad thing, in fact it is a good thing that this movie isn't repeating similar beats as the first three. It is essentially the least Toy Story-like Toy Story movie.<br/><br/>In the end, the Toy Story trilogy is perfect and did not need a fourth movie in the first place, however I gladly welcome it, love it, laugh at it, cry with it and sometimes even be scared of it. I didn't ask for it, but I am glad it is here. Although the whole movie is basically an elongated episode of 'Tidying Up with Marie Kondo', if the objects were sentient."

"jadepietro","8","0","1","23 June 2019"," Toys R' Us
","GRADE: B<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A visually dazzling sequel whose animated heroes work overtime to save their film from a formulaic action-driven plot.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Toy Story 4 still follows its heart-warming, yet predictable, formula of lost toys and childhood innocence and the film wisely relies heavily on its well-established and beloved characters. Hail, hail the gang's all here, and then some, even if it seems a tad worn for wear.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Stephany Folsom and Andrew Stanton successfully updates its story for this new generation of moviegoers. The story takes everyone cross country as little Bonnie enters kindergarten and begins to lose interest in her toy friends. However, this sequel spends too much time on the film's action-driven plot and non-stop chases. It's all road trip adventure and rescue missions, and not enough of an emotional build in its storytelling as in previous installments. The film introduces new characters that just do not register as effectively as Mr. Potato Head, Rex, or Bo Peep. Instead we encounter Duke Caboom, a small daredevil unsure of his own courage, Ducky and Bunny, two stuffed teddy bears lacking any heart, and a dumb spork named Forky in search of a brain. They're off, but not to see any wizard.<br/><br/>Still, the technical aspects of this film are beautifully rendered with stunning use of stark shadows and bright lighting. Scenes are densely composed with such unbridled mastery. The background detailing is remarkable, especially the subtle discarded remains found inside a cluttered antique store. Very well directed by Josh Cooley, the film is a lovely visual treat. One simply forgets that we are watching animation at its zenith.<br/><br/>Even though the story doesn't quite compare to other chapters, there are some truly wonderful sequences to enjoy: an opening credit scene that fluidly shows the changes through the years in everyone's lives, a chase sequence staged in the confines of a curio cabinet, a carnival barker unaware of a toy uprising, and my favorite, a macabre encounter with a creepy Gabby Gabby doll and her ventriloquist dummy henchmen stalking Woody in search of his valuable voice-box.<br/><br/>And Tom Hanks does have a valuable voice-box as he perfectly inhabits his sensitive friend in me. His voice-over work as Woody is in a class by itself. Once again, Tim Allen brings to his character the needed swagger, bravado, and comic elements. Solid support is given by Annie Potts as a newly empowered Bo Peep, Wallace Shawn as a nervous dino, and Joan Cusack as Cowgirl Jessie. Breathing life into their new characters are Tony Hale, Keanu Reeve, Jordan Peele, Keegan-Michael Key, and especially, Christina Hendricks as the menacing yet vulnerable Lady in Pink.<br/><br/>Toy Story 4 may not be the series' strongest entry, but the bar is still high compared to other animated films that usually go for cheap laughs and sophomoric humor. This highly engaging film has more to say about the human condition than most animated or, for that matter, live action movies nowadays. The artistry is there in full force, with much to admire, even if the film's narrative loses its way on its nostalgic journey in search of childhood memories and the value of friendship. Yes, this series still has a friend in me."

director:Josh Cooley
starring:Tom Hanks,Tim Allen,Annie Potts,Tony Hale,Keegan Michael Key,Madeline Mcgraw,Christina Hendricks,Jourdan Peele,Keanu Reeves,Ally Macki,Joan cusac,Wallace Shawn,John Ratzenburger,Blake Clarke,Don Rickles,Estelle Harris etc<br/><br/>overall rating 95/100<br/><br/>I was admittedly nervous about a 4th installment in the toy story franchise due to the trilogy having a perfect ending. But i have to say this film lived up to the hype and was on par with the original films and is another win for Disney/pixar.<br/><br/>First of all lets start off with the incredible visuals and animation. Animation has come a long way since the first toy story and in a good way, Every single character or set piece or weather condition looked extremely life like it was almost scary how realistic everything looked. Bo Peep actually looked like porcelain and little things like the raindrops looked fantastic.<br/><br/>Next the film was hilarious. Most of the humour came from the new characters of Bunny,Ducky,duke kaboom and forky but we will talk more about them in a bit. But this film made me chuckle throughout and no joke fell flat. The tone was consistent and never went of course and all the running jokes were not overplayed and worked well. All the toys and voice actors had great comedic chemistry.<br/><br/>Next i loved the relatable themes and ideologies that Toy story 4 gave to the audience. The fact that Bonnie was so nervous to start kindergarden and it reflected on her parents will reflect to a lot of parents who will go to see this film with there children. So the film did well with capturing the relatable themes of peoples life.<br/><br/>Next i loved the nostalgia that the director managed to create with the aesthetics and soundtrack of the film. To start of the film in the clouds and to have youve got a friend in me playing really awoke a lot of memories of watching the original when i was younger and i am sure this will be the same for other people who grew up with this film series so this was a really nice touch to add to the film. And it was just nice to see the gang back together after so long. And all the voice actors for the beloved characters did a fantastic job again with bringing these characters back to life with the same personalities and phrases that we know from them.<br/><br/>Next i loved all the new characters that they introduced to us during the film. I am especially highlighting Forky ( Tony Hale) bunny and ducky ( Key and Peele) and Duke Kaboom ( Keanu Reeves) Forky was hilarious during the film and not irratating like i thought he would be. The fact that he did not know why he existed and his love for trash was very interesting and funny to watch his character development into realising his purpose was for Bonnie. And Key and Peele were fantastic. They had great comedic chemistry and stole many scenes with there interesting ways of retrieving things. And finally Duke Kaboom, His whole story of his child disowning him due to him not being able to do the things for his advert really was entertaining to see. And his development and relationship with Bo peep was interesting as she was the voice of reason for Duke and encouraged him to take advantage of his weaknesses and make them a strength so i really felt happy for Duke when he eventually did succeed.<br/><br/>Next i just have a couple of little nit picks that bought the film down just slightly. I felt like some of the characters were underused slightly. A fair amount of the original gang of toys were not involved in a lot of scenes which was a bit of a shame but they were in the film just about enough to not get to annoyed, and i understood that they wanted to put the shine on the new characters. And secondly i found Bo Peeps personality to be fairly odd and irratating at times. She was surprisingly harsh in a fair few scenes which i thought was a slightly unneeded change to her character. And she was very indecisive which i found annoying just a bit.<br/><br/>I loved the films links to other pixar films. Like the previous films in the franchise this had many links to other disney/pixar movies i am pretty sure there was some disney princesses that i saw. But also the gas station was Dineco. And there was even a monsters vs aliens reference which was not even disney or pixar but dreamworks! so this was a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>Next i loved the character arcs and development for the characters of Woody ( Tom Hanks) Bo peep ( Annie Potts) and Gabby Gabby ( Christina Hendricks) First i loved woodies character arc in this film as for the first time we see Woody without a purpose and unwanted by an owner. To see his loyalty to Bonnie throughout the film really made you love his character. And he was almost like a father figure to Forky making sure he was safe to make sure His child was happy. Next i loved Bo Peeps character. Her Whole character arc of being a lost toy was really intriguing and a new plot that they have not gone into before in the franchise. You really understood why she enjoyed not being tied down to a child so i am glad she has become such an important character, and they finally had more character development between her relationship with Woody which i loved as well. And finally i loved Gabby Gabby as a villain but also a character to sympathise with. Yes she was technically a villain which she played very well with her creepy voice and puppets. But actually we went deeper into her character arc you found out that she only wanted woodies voice box to attract a kid to her as she never has had a kid to play with. When she got rejected by Harmony you genuinely felt sympathy and sadness for her character. And happiness when she did finally get a kid so this was one of the best parts of the film in my opinion.<br/><br/>Ending on my final two big positives. Firstly the film had excellent and more developed world building. I loved the set design of the carnival and antique shop and the film did a really good job with going into detail about the characters surroundings which were new to them. And It was interesting to see them explore this new world. And finally the film had a lot of great emotional weight to it. The whole franchise is known for its tear jerking and heartwarming moments and this film was no different, When Gabby Gabby was picked by her first child was incredibly sweet and really tugged at your heartstrings. But the most heartbreaking part of the film would be when Woody said goodbye to his toy friends to live a new and exciting life with Bo and gang. It felt like an end of an era due to everyone growing up with these characters. But I also understood woody wanting to live a life in the real world without a kid as he was no longer needed with Bonnie so the film really did not disappoint with what we have come to expect with this fantastic franchise.<br/><br/>Despite me and no doubt most people being anxious about this 4th installment. Toy story 4 reunites us with the beloved characters in another excellent movie that is as good and even better then some of the previous films."

DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!<br/><br/>
1) To suggest that Bonnie suddenly stops playing with Woody and only Woody but plays with all the other toys the same as always is ridiculous. Makes ZERO sense. She is only starting kindergarten. If she was leaving out several members of the gang, I could buy that. If she was a little older.. ok. But specifically just leaving out Woody.. no way. That was too contrived to steer the plot in the direction the writers wanted. Lazy writing.<br/><br/>2) Gabby Gabby allows herself to be found at the carnival by a lost child. This kids parents are just going to let her keep a doll she found without turning it into Lost and Found? Are these the worst parents in the world? Well they did lose their child at a carnival, so maybe they are. Still not a good lesson for the kids in the audience. If you find something that does not belong to you, you turn it in to Lost and Found. YOU DO NOT KEEP IT! Once again, lazy writing.<br/><br/>Other than those 2 glaring items, the rest of the plot holes were easier to over look."
"ryanshelbyeasterling","9","0","2","23 June 2019"," this generation is too sensitive! Great and beautiful film
","For all the beloved fans i can assure you this film is a great addition to the toy story series and had me laughing and tearing up on multiple occasions! I am one of the biggest toy story fans and I'm sure a lot can say the same thing. I went into the movie expecting it to be unnecessary film but I was wrong.<br/><br/>Yes I do wish some original characters had a bigger part in the film but loved the new ones they introduced! If y'all don't remember there were new characters introduced in all the previous films so that came no surprise to me but I guess to others it did. Yes woody is replaced by ""trash"" but I think that is a very realistic thing for them to do. I have kids of my own and can definitely say they have bonded with the simplest things and called them toys. It is sad to see all the hate from multiple people but everyone is entitled to their own opinion and that is fine but I think some are too harsh and compare to a very hard to beat toy story 3! Yes that ending was amazing and beyond beautiful but the ending of 4 in my opinion hit me hard in the feels and totally caught me off guard. I'd never expect for the greatest animated duo of all time to split and go there own way but it happened so perfectly I couldn't be more satisfied. Woody needed to move on and having a girl kid (Bonnie) made it easy to understand why!<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film it it obvious that woody isn't favored seeing he has collected his first dust bunny and hasn't been chosen to be played with for a couple play times now. It just makes sense in the end for him to stay behind and further his joy in uniting kids to toys.<br/><br/>Others have also said that the film is too dark and creepy but I think this generation is a little sensitive and I would have to disagree. There has been darkness is all the films from Sid burning woodys head and the creepy toys that attack him in the end! In toy story 3 all the toys were almost burned alive! In toy story 4 the creepy character Gabby Gabby ended up having a true reason to her creepiness wanting nothing more than to be loved by a child. No other toy story has made the ""bad"" character turn good until toy story 4 which I thought was a great idea for them to do!<br/><br/>The film was great and to me well worth the wait! They have yet to let me down and I welcome a toy story 5 in the future to add to the collection! Great work Pixar! Let the haters hate and keep up the good work!"

","I thought this film was a fitting end to the series, Toy Story 5 might be pushing it a little so here's hoping that doesn't happen.
Although I'm sure people thought that about this one.<br/><br/>I thought it was really up to par with the others and it introduced new characters that I loved, Duke Kaboom played by Keanu Reeves and Gabby Gabby played by Christina Hendricks.<br/><br/>The Jokes and gags were as good as ever, including the emotional bits.
It didn't make me tear up as much 2 & 3 though but I think that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Like other people, I wish there had been more scenes of Woody and Buzz together, but I was happy with what we got.
Watching it I did miss having the old gang around e.g. Potato Head, Hamm, Rex etc, so I wish they had a bit more screen time.<br/><br/>It was cool having Bo Peep back, good to see exactly what happened to her before Toy Story 3.
I don't want to call the villain of the film a villain, so I think semi-antagonist works better. I genuinely felt bad for that character and by the end of the film they were one of my favourite characters.<br/><br/>Best line: ""How are we alive? I don't know."""

","Toy story was a great franchise building up momentum up the 3rd movie that is infinitely great and a real heartbreaker. While this film is a tear jerker it makes you feel and see what is beyond the infinity.
Comparing the film's shouldn't affect the sequel simply because each movie is a different story to tell. On this movie expect 3 batches of characters that makes the film fair.
The new characters shines everytime they are on screen, while a new batch of main characters such as Woody, Bo, Forky and Gabby Gabby generates a new experience that touches and realizes new worlds that can be explored and seen it simply take mainstays such as slinky, rex, hamm, potato heads, jessie and bullseye to little screen time that makes a little bit of efforts on the story. Surprisingly Buzz Lightyear just becomes a secondary character for the movie to give way to characters such as Giggle Mcdimples, Ducky&Bunny and Duke Kaboom. Bo and Woody's relationship is tackled and it shows their own kind of accepted differences.<br/><br/>The conclusion will make you frown and gives teary eyes but would still have a smile for the beloved characters."

","I was worried when I came home after the movie to see bad ratings for this film, because for me, I didn't spot anything bad.
I was exceptionally relieved when I found that the film received 8.6 stars. This film made me and my cousin laugh, it made me smile, it even made me feel tears in the back of my throat. This film was one of the best. There were jokes and parts where everyone laughed at, understanding. I don't remember a time where I've laughed so much during a film.
There were so many childhood memories from this, and it's honestly sending a very strong message for every child throughout the world, and especially adults. I'm hoping to watch it again and I hope that many other people enjoy this film.
I came back feeling happy from the film and that's something very intriguing. Thank you for giving me this. It has been a great experience watching Toy Story 4.
P. S. I ship Woody and Bo!"
"ethanthespeed","9","0","3","23 June 2019"," An almost perfect ending.
","This film is the best possible amalgamation of everything I want in a Toy Story film. It has all of the heart, all of the laughs, the best characters all in one movie. If I'm being completely honest, I never expected this film to release, but I'm so glad it did, as so far this is my #1 movie of 2019. I have minor problems with it that don't really stand out too much, but can be annoying when you start to think about them. Though, I can overlook them when I'm so entranced by the animation, the story and the fantastic characters.
9/10."

","As others have stated toy story ended with the 3rd film which was without doubt one of the best endings to any film or franchise. This film is pale in comparison but with how it ends it felt more like a new different direction and start on a new path for future films ( which will happen with the money they make ) which will introduce new characters and stories if they follow the new group ( which I see they are going for ) or if they stick with the old group there are no stories left so it's the end"

","When i heard Disney and Pixar are making Toy Story 4 i gonna say WTF are they do. I mean Toy Story 3 is a great ending, for what they making a fourth movie. But when i watch a fourth movie my previous words were like nothing. This film is a best animation movie in 2019 so far. With the CGI effect that is increasing from the previous film, this film really spoiled my eyes. At the end you must watch this movie if you are following Toy Story movie cause this movie is a Perfect ending of Toy Story"
"bensee-50800","8","0","1","23 June 2019"," What was predictably a cute, funny animated Disney movie
","Toy story 4 gives us a film that by many account was not necessary, and that Toy Story 3 already gave us a big theatrical end to the Toy Story franchise. But then Disney gave us this new trailer for a new movie, and all of us probably groaned at the thought of Disney making more movies. But hold on for a minute because this movie was actually pretty awesome. It gave us time with a new kid Bonnie, gave us new settings including a carnival and a antique shop, and let us check back in with some of Disney's most popular and well known characters. Also including new characters which definitely added a new touch of hilarity to the film, one who was voiced by Matrix actor Keane Reeves. To add one aspect of the film that I didn't enjoy was the aspect of the creepy Slappy like dummy's from the antique shop. This is a kids film, not a horror movie. To add something like that to a Toy Story movie, especially a Disney film. Is very risky and might've scared children who watched this film. In conclusion Toy Story 4 was a fun, clever and well written movie that will make people shed a few tears a long the way, and definitely deliver a few laughs."
"rachelgallit","7","0","1","23 June 2019"," Like a Designer Mess
","Given its 2019 release date, this movie was uncharacteristically wholesome compared to the other popular media at the moment, which is no doubt the reason behind its wild success. Woody, unaccustomed to not being a favorite toy, gives himself purpose by babysitting the toy his new kid (Bonnie) made from art supplies. Woody and ""Forky"" attempt to reconcile their new place in life, while navigating the pitfalls of reunited long lost love, predatory dolls, and unclear motivation. This movie was utterly enjoyable, make no mistake. But my experience was like admiring a fantastic antique picture frame. The outline and all the key ends of the film were glorious, visually stunning, and well structured. Just like the picture frame, however, the middle was absolutely empty. The middle was too long, reiterated the same point many times to the point of sullying the emotional impact, and seemed to be an excuse to show off the gorgeous animation. The key events hit home, the emotional and life messages were well articulated and did translate across the generations, and the animation blew my mind. In summation: worth the $15 I spent, but not a penny more."
"leobbiagi","7","0","1","22 June 2019"," Almost the best but not quite
","The previous Toy Story films are some of the best animated films ever made. While the fourth installment is far from bad it doesn't live up as much to its predecessor. In the beginning of the film you see Woody struggle with not being the main toy played with yet he doesn't get jealous or angry showing how much the character has grown over the franchise. When Bonnie brings home forky woody makes it his job to look after him because he has nothing else to do. Forky is a great addition to the group, he is very funny and bring in some deep existential questions and choices that make this a very mature tone for the G rated film. However when forky jumps out of the car and woody saves him and explains to him what its like to be a toy, forkys arch ends there and he becomes a plot devices that the hero's have to get. It is great to see woody reunited with bo peep, showing the now very different lives they lead. When buzz goes looking for woody he gets some hilarious laughs and picks up new and interesting characters. While it is great to see the new characters that are multi dimensional and all have goal and an arch the film puts all of the original characters to the side with some loved characters only getting a few lines. Normally I would be fine with this but since this is the last movie in the franchise it would be nice to show more of the old characters. The villain is actually scary and has realist goals and motivations however she is not really a bad guy and half way through the third act she becomes a good guy leaving the final at with no villain or challenging obstacles. The ending is the main reason why this film isn't as good as the others. The ending of the third film was amazing and tear jerking leading me to believe that the end of the franchise would have a sadder ending, while the ending does shed tear after the film was over I had felt cheated. When woody decided to leave and stay with Bo Peep he says good bye to all of the old gang however this was a spilt decision and the goodbyes are quick without as much emotionally gravity. It also seems out of character for Woody because he doesn't even see Bonnie before he leaves. Also bo Peep could have easily gone with woody because she has nothing holding her to the carnival while woody has friends and family at Bonnies that Bo Peep knows. The movie overall was a lot of fun and had some great themes the only thing holding it back was the rushed ending."
"cruzchristopher","7","0","1","22 June 2019"," Good, could've been better though
","My main problem was forky and how he was portrayed. As a suicidal spork. And that's quite an issue in this day in age. I'm too young to have remembered the first two but eventually I watched them. 3rd was the best ending in years. With this you don't continue the end. You let it be. 7/10 is the highest I can go."

","I find it best not to consider this film as part of, especially not the final chapter in, the overall Toy Story canon/story line. As a stand alone film it does some great things. If you don't consider everything the toy gang has been through then you won't be disappointed. If you want to see the whole gang, and all it's heart, involved in a hilarious, crazy adventure I went back and watched the straight to TV Toy Story of Terror. It takes place right after Toy Story 3 so it's all up to date, and you get to see the origins of a character in Toy Story 4 that some might not recognize. The DVD of Toy Story of Terror has great 'toons' too.
As far as this number 4 goes, the decisions made were indeed confusing. Just try to enjoy the new characters and animation and you'll enjoy it."

"jakehenry-80471","7","0","3","22 June 2019"," Pointless Sequel but still good, ruined by the ending
","First I'll start off with the great parts of the film. The new characters are great especially Ducky and Bunny played hilariously by Key and Peele. It's great to see the returning characters from the series and the start really helps to bring back the nostalgic feel. However, the reason this film feels a bit off is because of its terrible ending which craps all over the other films especially Toy Story 3's end. The film ends with Woody leaving Buzz, Jessie and the rest of the toys that he's been friends with since the start of the series because he isn't being played with to go off with Bo Peep. While the decision makes sense in the context of the film it makes Woody seem really selfish as he's ditching his best friends that he's been with for more than a decade all because he hasn't been played with. Not to mention it ruins the end for Toy Story 3 because Andy didn't want to give Woody away but decided to because Bonnie wanted him, making Bonnie really unlikable and Woody's decision to move on meaningless."
"CrazyBlueTiger","9","0","1","22 June 2019"," Woody and Bo are the stars of this heart warming film
","When Toy Story 4 was announced , I was worried that it was going to be a cash grab and ruin the perfect ending of the franchise which was (previously ) Toy Story 3. But Pixar has managed to create a film which makes you smile. Again.
Woody and Buzz's friendship could have had a tad bit more screentime but overall I loved every minute of this film. And although the ending wasn't as tear jerking as Toy Story 3 , you will definitely leave misty eyed. Forky and the other new characters mingle perfectly with the existing ones but at times it feels like the old characters were neglected a bit. And Bo Peep's mysterious disappearance from the franchise is FINALLY solved. I found her new persona to be extremely cool. Toy Story 4 requires you to watch the other 3 films first as most of the plot is interwoven with them as it might become a bit confusing if you go there without any idea who Bo or Bonnie are. Watch the movie for the nostalgia of the simpler times.<br/><br/>P.S. - Buzz's eyebrows have been tinted a bit more dark than it was originally and no one can tell me otherwise"

","Just watched Toy Story 4, and I have to say that it did not fail to meet expectations. While it may not certainly be better than the last one, it had something that I think the past 3 installments lacked in: humor, and lots of it. And while it may not have as many memorable moments as the other Toy Story films, I felt it was well-rounded and it never was boring. A solid score of 8 from me."
