","Closer: A<br/><br/>Mike Nichols delivers his best work yet. CLOSER is a well crafted dissertation on art's reflection of the human condition, particularly the dependence on romantic relationships. It delivers an intimate film that actually achieves depths rarely seen on screen. Kubrick's Eye's Wide Shut only scratched the surface of literal naked lies that represent sexual game-playing on screen. His work came off as a freshman treatise on relationships in a pervy, self-obsessed way. Nichols and screenwriter Patrick Marber deliver a full and rich study on the difficulties of love and sexual tension. Without ever showing a sex scene on screen they are able to portray the nasty nature of jealously, lust and obsession without actually exploiting these acts as Kubrick and countless others have done. The result is a pure _expression of the realization that we don't know anything when it comes to assessing truth in character. <br/><br/>Alice (Natalie Portman), a former stripper, is hit by a car in London as she forgets to look right. Dan (Jude Law) comes to her rescue and guides her to the hospital before guiding her into his life. Dan writes obituaries but soon finds a novel in himself thanks to Alice. While shooting the photo for his book he falls for the photographer Anna (Julie Roberts) who pulls back from him given that he's with Alice. For light-style revenge Dan sets up Larry (Clive Owen) in an Internet sex chat room to meet Anna thinking this will embarrass him and her. Cupid backfires thus throwing Larry and Anna into a relationship of their own. First impressions, like all art, can only show you broad strokes of character like stereotypes and lies. Alice is presented as a young girl in need of saving, literally. Anna is a strong, independent artist who seems smart in her career and choices. Dan is a struggling, sensitive writer in search of a muse, someone to inspire and rescue. Larry is a sex obsessed dermatologist and self-described caveman. By the end of the film, however, the audience will get a deeper and more profound view of all four characters and realize we just don't know them as well as we think. <br/><br/>Acknowledging that film can be art, the screenwriter is skilled with dialog that reflects the illusionary quality that is art. Every piece of conversation, every word has meaning, reflection and sometimes foreboding for what is to come and the gaps in story and exposition brilliantly leads the audience to fill in those elements with their own interpretations. It is those interpretations and broad-stroke impressions that the film is there to question. Alice, in the scene at Anna's photo exhibit, discusses this very concept to Larry when discussing her reaction to the photos and the show. The function is just a big lie, the glossy photos of people's faces don't' show the real person, the fancy people at the party only reflect that same quality. Everything is for surface show - one-dimensional illusions of character. Alice, Anna, Dan and Larry are those photos just in moving form but that makes all the difference. The movement and editing of the film allows us to jump through months and years of their relationships to unpeel parts of the illusion of character and stereotypes. We can explore wrong assumptions about characters and that should make us explore the real-world difficulties of knowing people, really knowing them and not just their image or attitude. Many will just see this film as a sad story of four wounded people making bad relationship choices. This is really sad because this film is truly a great wake-up call to humanity to embrace a new approach and attitude about art and people. Strength can be a weakness. Vulnerability can be empowering. Dependence can be comforting. Nothing can be valued or viewed without bias and prejudice. Great art, like this film, can sometimes achieve a new way to show us how wrong we can be when we let our bias prevent us from just experiencing life and being open to shifts in perception. So take a closer look, at this film and the life around you. You just might find happiness in walking away from the expected."

","I've been hearing lots of negativity about this movie. I think a lot of people have been shocked, frankly, by the raw and rough nature of the film. Having read the play, I've been looking forward to it for about a year now, and it's honestly one of the best plays I've ever read. Mike Nichols presents it in an amazing way, very faithful to the words as they're written (and they should be, for the movie is also written by the man who wrote the play, the brilliant Patrick Marber). <br/><br/>It's a brutal topic, sex and love, especially when they're combined. I thought the movie was amazing. It captured all of the vulnerability, caustic harshness, and acerbic flirtation that the play vibrated with. All of the cast brought the movie alive. It uplifts and then brings you way down, but that's the point, and yet at the end, I didn't feel depressed or saddened, just really really awake and curious. It's the feeling you get when you get ""closer"", I suppose. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman, in a tour-de-force performance, is the standout by far. Maybe it's because she's the youngest, and not expected to be that awesome, but she is. Anyways, her Alice is flirty and sweet, caustic and manipulative, evasive and yet very open, sexual and gloomy all in one character. She has the best chemistry with the men - whether it be purely sensual with Clive Owen, or innocence and affection with Jude Law. She comes alive with the two guys, and their scenes are ones to look forward to.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts, whom everyone looks towards, is not bad in this film. She's very understated and good, but she is outshone in nearly every scene by whomever she's acting with. <br/><br/>Clive Owen is absolutely astounding, and he's definitely on everyone's radar screen. As the man of experience and ""simplicity"", as Jude Law's character comments, he's brash and hotheaded, but also extremely clever. Owen perfectly plays the sleazy, unlikeable character, but somehow manages to appeal to the audience and even though he's a disagreeable character, I think many managed to find something all right about him - Owen's human sense in Larry. <br/><br/>Jude Law is simply very very good; neither astounding nor bad. The only reason he does not stand out is the fact that we've all expected him to do a good performance. And he does, he has a great performance. He and Portman have amazing scenes together, and he's always on par.<br/><br/>Simply put, the movie is not for everyone (especially not for seeing with a parent or young child); it's a mature adult flick, and does not back down from anything. It's high drama - with all the uplifting romance and brutal arguments of relationships. It's a story about people."
"OverAnalysisBoy","8","43","55","30 January 2005"," Flawed and cold, but sharp and haunting.
","I've seen Closer described as a cinematic triumph, but it's precisely not. The film wears its theatrical origins on its sleeve, and the presence of the camera is mostly irrelevant.<br/><br/>It also fails in a more subtle way. Initially, I watched four apparently amoral people, devoid of depth or shame, being clever at each other in increasingly hurtful and exploitative ways, and my mind rebelled. This can't be right, I thought, people don't talk like this. Hell, people don't *act* like this.<br/><br/>Then the light dawned. The characters seemed inhuman because they are. They aren't people at all, they're philosophical positions. When they talk, they're not talking. They're saying the things that people only dare think, asking the questions that haunt anyone whose relationship has gone horrifically pear-shaped. This isn't the story of four people and four relationships, it's an attempt to compress everything the author believes about human relationships into a film and bend it into a story. It feels artificial because it is.<br/><br/>With that realisation, I actually began to enjoy it, because Closer is a very clever film. I wish I could disagree with more of it, because many of the things it has to say about human relationships are painfully true. Every mistake you've ever made in a relationship is in here, and it's guaranteed to make you squirm at least once. It's also blackly funny in many places.<br/><br/>Without exception, the performances are fantastic, with the honours going to Natalie Portman's emotionally scarred escapist who wears lies like they were armour, and Clive Owen's brutal, perceptive, and ultimately absolutely human dirty doctor.<br/><br/>Be warned! The marketing campaign may lead you to think it's a comforting rom-com, but it's not. I wouldn't advise going with your partner unless you're rock-solid. You may leave asking some uncomfortable questions, and wondering how well you really know them..."
"arichmondfwc","8","420","626","21 December 2004"," Who's afraid of Closer?
","Mike Nichols directed, in my opinion, one of the three best adaptations from stage to screen. ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf"" (The other two being Sidney Lumet's ""Long day's journey into night"" and Elia Kazan's ""A Streetcar named Desire) After the extraordinary television adaptation of ""Angels in America"" I also would have pleaded with Mike Nichols to do ""Closer"" Sorry I'm rambling. What I'm trying to say in a rather convoluted way is, simply, thank you Mr. Nichols. Adult themes, conceived and performed by adult artists. I hope it makes zillions of dollars so we can have more of it. Jude Law is a Peter O'Toole without the steroids, Julia Roberts a Jeanne Moreau with an American passport, Clive Owen is a child of John Garfield and Peter Finch and Natalie Portman a Jean Peters with a college degree. I saw the film twice in a row, I hadn't done that in years. Not since ""Drugstore Cowboy"", ""Apartment Zero"" and ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" The unfolding of the dark happens in front of our eyes and it feels chillingly familiar. Lies we tell each other with so much conviction with so much honesty. The only real thing is the pain and the loneliness. It doesn't sound like a very entertaining night out but believe me, it is. Go, see for yourself. You may have to confront something you didn't want to confront. That's part of the process call growing up. Who's afraid of that?"
"pic23ent","10","317","470","8 December 2004"," Closer to reality...
","This is the most honest film I've ever seen. Although I'm sure there are critics out there who will comment on the explicit language rather than the story, anyone who's ever been in a dysfunctional relationship can relate to at least some part of this film. I for one found it a very personal and shockingly accurate depiction of how human beings use love and sex to unintentionally destroy each other. The performances were magnificent from all angles. Mike Nichols has done it again. This film is ""Carnal Knowledge"" for the new millennium. If the Academy does not recognize ""Closer"" as a Best Picture candidate, then the Academy should no longer be recognized as the authority on achievement in film... yes, it's that good."
"marcosaguado","8","395","595","15 December 2004"," I Stayed To The End
","What a treat. Most of the people who came with me, left, half way through the film. I stayed to the end and I loved it. It moved me. A rarity this days. The face of Jude Law is, still, so full of possibilities. He seems unafraid of darkness. Strong. This is his most grown up performance. I can't wait to see what he'll become. (If he stays away from Hollywood as much as temptations permit, and keeps that purity, that makes his darkness so powerful, as intact as humanly possible). Julia Roberts is wonderful in a performance part Margaret Sullavan, part Jeanne Moreau but all her own. Clive Owen is a force of nature. Dangerous, compelling, human to the hilt. And what about Natalie Portman? Wow. No surprise here. But what a surprise. I'm sure she is going to amaze us for years and years to come. I'm really glad I stayed to the end."
"rcavellero","9","378","571","4 December 2004"," DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO PERFECTION!
","It's once in a very rare time that I go to the movies and I'm treated as an adult. I see a film that is intelligent, thought provoking, provocative and rawly realistic. Closer is that film. It present an honest portrayal of four severely unlikable characters and they screw with each others love lives back and forth. The film is told in adult sporting complexity through the growing plot points , the way it's filled and it's tasty advancing dialogue. Everyone in the film turns in a powerhouse performance worthy of Oscar consideration. Ms. Portman is wonderful as Alice shedding her blockbuster star wars acting skills and portraying someone multi dimensional with heart and pizazz. Julia Roberts stars as Anna in a cold, subtle performance which will leave audiences appreciating her acting believability as she pounces through each of her scenes with charismatic force. Jude law and Clive Owen are the real surprises here both turning in wonderfully appealing performance. Strong, weak, flawed and memorable. Especially whose last outing was the entertaining but mediocre action summer pic King Arthur. The film has wonderfully tight direction and sports beautifully placid colors and a fine adult score. The film draws dangerously close to being a near perfect film. I only wish it could've gone on for abit longer I wasn't completely satisfied to the ends of the characters on which we were give. but life itself isn't perfect or satisfying and this is a slick of someones life. Rush out and go see Closer! Oner of the best film's of the year!"

","Have you ever seen a human heart? It looks like a fist wrapped in blood.... Only in the film Closer can the universal symbol for love and devotion be brutally manipulated into a tool, one whose sole purpose is to express men's vile and barbaric proclivities. But this isn't your ordinary love story, in fact when viewing Mike Nichols newest drama, you can throw everything you thought you knew about modern relationships out the window. In Closer, your best bet is to expect the unexpected.<br/><br/>If you are searching for a traditional romance of sorts, this isn't the film to turn to. If you are searching for a film to bolster up your Holiday spirit in anticipation for the Christmas season, then have a Jimmy Stewart marathon. But, if you are open to the idea of seeing a film thick with hostility, brutal honesty and dizzying intellect... then this could be a film that could satisfy your expectations. Let it be said, that at the very least this is a film to be marveled. It is such a well-crafted production, that you can't help but appreciate the obvious talent that went in to making this movie look as glossy and stylish as it does. Not to mention, how splendid the cast is... I only wish I could say the same for the characters that they play... <br/><br/>These gorgeous creatures, exude radiance and outer beauty, yet what lies within their psyche is brutal and cold. Based on pre-conceived notions, it's hard to see 'America's Sweetheart', Julia Roberts, or the charming Brit, Jude Law utter such biting, vicious, and somewhat disturbing statements. The character's have virtually no consciences, and care about little more than appeasing their own personal urges and impulses. The men in particular seem to be the most primitive in their acting upon their animalistic instincts. Although, the woman are far from innocent. Each of the four leads harbors a series of secrets they are hesitant to unleash upon their counterparts. This blanket of mystery leads each to act in contemptible ways. The character's are all terribly detestable and obnoxious, yet still put on a facade of refinement. It's unbelievable how articulate and intelligent these characters really are. Every line that comes out of their mouth has an aura of brilliance, and while one may find their comments offensive, you can't deny that there is a lot of truth behind their sentiments. The dialogue drives the film, and serves as another artistic device for the director... it is truly poetic. The entire film is in essence, a critique on the human race... a social commentary that exposes the underbelly of the modern relationship. A disheartening subject to be sure, and Nichols does not shy away from stating it like it is.<br/><br/>The story basically revolves around four characters and the ensuing relations between them. It is a very slow moving film driven entirely by the intelligent, cynical and piercing dialogue that spills out of the character's mouths. There are probably only ten scenes in the whole film, which goes to show you how lengthy each episode runs. Yet, I never felt as though time was standing still... I was so wrapped up in the character's lives and their ever present struggles to worry about the scene's length. A technique that was implemented by the veteran director, Mike Nichols is that there is no real sense of time in the film. The story spans over four years, a gimmick which I thought was a brilliant way to disorient the audience into the same dizzying mindset the characters themselves possess.<br/><br/>The four leads, are remarkably and perhaps unrealistically witty... Yet, in many instances they use this uncanny intelligence in ways that make you cringe with disapproval. Those with an optimistic attitude, would be best off suspending disbelief while watching this film. An open mind is a must, and if you are easily offended... then you'd be best off watching Disney cartoons or after-school specials. This movie doesn't even attempt at hiding behind MPAA restrictions, and instead pushes the limits by having the entire film revolve around the 'behind closed doors' aspects of a relationship. Sexual slurs, derogatory statements, and painful betrayal all pollute what in an idealistic world would be a text-book perfect relationship. Don't expect a happy ending. But, be sure to expect dialogue that sizzles and pops, and stings those who it is directed at. C|oser is a film that divides audiences like none I have seen before. Love it or hate it, you will be glad you saw it... 3.5/4"
"besopbabe","10","213","335","6 December 2004"," Flawlessly From Stage to Screen
","The strength of Closer, both as a play and a motion picture, is the flawless, mature and beautifully crafted dialogue. Patrick Marber's screenplay is a testament to his truly great writing ability, as not much of the original text needed to be adapted in order to work appropriately and effectively on screen.<br/><br/>The raw emotion and base convictions of these four tragic characters (all acted exquisitly) is given to us primarily through their words and those words are all we need. <br/><br/>If you need more than words and are looking for a feel good love story, steer clear, you will only be disappointed.<br/><br/>However, if you are looking for a piece that will intrigue your senses, causing you to examine your own soul, your own convictions, then I highly recommend Closer.<br/><br/>Like Shakespeare, Williams, and O'Neil, whose words are a testament to the condition of their lives and times, Marber, through his language and presentation of these four exquisite lost souls, forces the mind to acknowledge and deal with the most base of our natural tendencies, painting a brutally honest portriat of the human condition in the 21st century."
"rdekoch","1","56","86","29 December 2004"," Far, Far Away: America Loves Delusion
","I won't reveal what ultimately happens in Closer but I will confess that I was disappointed that it didn't end with a fiery double-decker bus crash that left no survivors. This film would have been stale 20 years ago, but it's completely ridiculous now. The ""truths"" about relationships that the movie attempts to reveal are just nuggets of stereotypical nonsense that you could see in a TV movie(Men thrive on conquest and dominance, Women can't resist being treated like whores, etc.). The film, like it's characters is shallow and dishonest underneath the pretty exterior.<br/><br/>Of the four main actors, Natalie Portman fairs the best. I didn't buy her character, but I didn't want to beat her with a lead pipe either. The other actors aren't so lucky. Clive Owen is in total stage actor mode. I have long suspected that Julia Roberts is actually computer generated or a state of the art robot and this film offers more compelling evidence in support of my theory. Jude Law is a total non-presence here which is a shame because he shows hints of charisma in other films. <br/><br/>I am absolutely dumbfounded by claims that this movie is in any way truthful, real or gritty. It's incredibly stagey and the dialog in no way resembles the way people talk when they're not performing on stage. I thought Neil Labute's The shape of Things was a low water mark that no film adaptation of a play could surpass in awfulness. Not the case. I am intrigued yet horrified that this film seems to resonate with a large chunk of viewers. The characters are total constructs: the Arbus rip-off photographer, the duplicitous writer, the educated yet primitive doctor, the wise stripper. <br/><br/>Maybe the film is realistic in the same way that Iraq was full of WMDs and privatization will solve the country's social security ""problem"". The real truth seems to be that most folks aren't interested in reality. It doesn't look like four pretty people in London."
"nycritic","10","45","68","22 April 2005"," Exquisite Cruelty.
","Mike Nichols must have a thing for dysfunctional quartets, as this is his third entry that tells a story of how four people damage each other with their callousness and emotional immaturity.<br/><br/>With CLOSER he decides not to go loud as in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? but to misdirect the viewer into thinking he is watching a series of Meet Cutes between the four leads. This is really only the setup for something completely rotten that comes out in a crucial moment, when both Natalie Portman and Clive Owen discover that their spouses, played by Jude Law and Julia Roberts, have been quite shamelessly carrying on and excusing their affair with wordy denials as if that would remedy the situation. To see Portman express total devastation in the fact of infidelity as she asks Law how can he go on with his cheating is to see her innocence and purity of emotions taken away, turned into something that later on becomes ugly and manipulative, although of the four she is the one whom at the end rises above and detaches herself of a damaging relationship.<br/><br/>Owen's descent into conscious perversion is also disturbing. Already apparently heavy into Internet chatting, he is introduced as someone who would innocently chat with what he thinks is a woman and actually believe ""she"" would meet him later for a quickie, and this gullibility is what also has him believing his wife would not leave him for anyone else even when it's clear she's carrying on with the same person who introduced them. He later decides to hurt them both, and succeeds so, but in trying to tie Roberts to him, he is only cementing the grounds for more mental and emotional cruelty.<br/><br/>Definitely not a date film nor one to watch on Valentine's Day, this is one of those films that takes the notion of love, sets it up on a pedestal, and them hacks away at its limbs and stabs it repeatedly in the heart until there is nothing left but hurt and more hurt and no way out. Ironically, it's physical abuse, never seen throughout the entire film until the very end, that sets at least one character free. Powerful, ugly at times, CLOSER betrays its title and makes you want to remain single for a long time."
"dcloysmith","1","238","404","6 December 2004"," Extraterrestrial relationships and Hollywood inanity
","Given that the National Board of Reviewers ranked ""Closer"" as the third best movie of 2004 (behind ""The Aviator"" and ""Finding Neverland""), I'm still stunned at how patently ridiculous it was. As one friend said afterward, ""I'm in the mood for something relatively painless--like a full-body chemical peel.""<br/><br/>If you're expecting a movie that faithfully portrays relationships between men and women (at least those folks who live off Broadway and outside of Hollywood), you won't find it represented in a single frame of this movie. For 100 minutes--going on six hours--my friends and I waited for a recognizable human presence to grace the screen. Instead, here's what we learned from the alien life forms responsible for ""Closer"":<br/><br/>1) Julia Roberts has one acting pose: stare off-camera and look pensive.<br/><br/>2) Clive Owens has two acting emotions: fresh-shaved and unshaven.<br/><br/>3) Jude Law decided to reprise his role as the robot in ""A.I."" in every movie he's appeared in this year.<br/><br/>4) Natalie Portman has never been in a strip club. (Her 'pole-dancing' maneuvers--apparently inspired by her turn in ""Mars Attacks!""--provided the movie with the most unintentionally campy scene since 'Showgirls.')<br/><br/>5) The screenwriter has never been in a relationship. (And if he has, he simply wasn't paying attention.)<br/><br/>6) When straight couples tell each other they've been cheating, they act excruciatingly polite for several minutes (except Julia Roberts, who stares off-camera and looks pensive). Then the cheated-upon will ask the cheating spouse how the sex was and insist on hearing the explicit details. This is the part of the discussion that finally gets a response, ranging on the emotional spectrum from the kissing and hugging one usually experiences during such fondly remembered heart-to-heart talks to exquisitely scripted battles of screaming wits.<br/><br/>7) Internet sex chats are astonishingly tedious on film, but are useful budget savers for the director who wants to make a 100-minute movie seem like six hours.<br/><br/>8) American women who live in England are willing to have sex to get whatever they want--even to get their ex-spouses to sign their divorce papers. (You have to see this scene to believe it has actually been committed to film.)<br/><br/>9) Audience-goers laugh at clichés. The more movies the cliché has been used in; the harder they'll laugh. (Then again, given how many people left the theater, maybe they were laughing at the movie itself.)<br/><br/>10) The new Hollywood formula requires a ""surprise"" twist at the ending, even when it's not a surprise.<br/><br/>I haven't seen so many people walk out of a movie in years--and this was on the East Side of New York, which has a high tolerance for the inertness and amateurishness one often sees in ""art"" films. At the end, there was mostly booing and catcalls from the survivors, accompanied (oddly enough) by a scattering of applause--from those, I would imagine, who were probably relieved that the rolling credits didn't show the outtakes.<br/><br/>Every once in a while, I'll see a low-budget independent ""gay film"" that is so lifeless that I am embarrassed for ""my people."" It's nice to know that there are equally unwatchable ""straight movies"" about relationships (although with Hollywood budgets, celebrity casts, and big-name directors)."

The complete desire and need for another person, wanting to hold them close to you, while at the same point in time the mere vision of seeing that person and hearing their voice sends you into utter misery and you feel repulsed by them. Jude Law is masterful in his role, and he is matched equally by the performances of Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts. A brilliant movie with many mixed emotions. As soon as you think, okay, this is where they live happily ever after, another twisting tale occurs. This is as real as it gets folks.

","The only redeeming thing about this movie was its cast. I watched this with my two roommates and at the end we were all depressed and confused as to why four such excellent actors would ever sign up for this movie.<br/><br/>When I say depressed, I mean DEPRESSED. This has to be one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen, not necessarily because of the subject matter (though that was depressing) but more because all four of the main characters were unlikeable and miserable the entire movie (Julia Roberts smiled maybe twice in the entire thing).<br/><br/>The movie tried to establish a theme of Lying and Being Lied To, but in the end just ended up being entirely predictable and boring. By the end you didn't really care who was lying and who was being lied to, nor did you care what happened to the characters because they were all so completely unlikeable (immoral and bland are the two best words that come to mind). Bland is a perfect word for this movie. Every scene was filmed in a dull, colorless location, with the exception of the strip club scenes, which were really the only salvageable scenes in the entire movie.<br/><br/>I really expected more from Mike Nichols, who directed the Graduate, a masterpiece where this was more like a flop. Some movies you can seek out the good points even if you dislike it in its entirety, but this had nothing short of the strip scenes and the cast to fall back on, and in the end that just wasn't enough.<br/><br/>I give it a 1/10. I was going to be generous and give it a 2, but that Damian Rice song, that just wouldn't go away, happened to be the straw that broke the camels back."
"alex_mcghee20","4","37","56","11 March 2005"," Closer - pointless, grating and unrelenting
","There is much hype to be found surrounding Mike Nichol's 'Closer', celebrated for its frankness and ""Oscar-worthy"" performances. I despised this movie however. Not that it is particularly badly written, acted or directed, but I found 'Closer' to be inane, inept, and totally unlikable with no apparent reason for existing other than to highlight the worst aspects of humanity. The movie is plodding and its cynicism about relationships and life in general is far too overblown. Infidelity and repeated sexual liaisons interchange between the same four characters for the entire length of the movie. Are we supposed to care about these people or their relationships? Are we supposed to care how cruelly they treat each other? It certainly doesn't appear that way, the film seems to want us to be distant from these characters, but for what reason? It's utterly pointless, banal, and the characters are just shallow, especially Clive Owen's Larry, whom I found to be completely repulsive. I am comfortable with explorations of sex in film, but here it is just tiresome; ""controversial"" and ""sexually honest"" material is substituted for any real, or at least interesting, character development. If this had been successfully achieved, we could connect with these people on some level, any level. Does the film wish us to applaud its excessive use of sexual expletives as bold; daring? It is frank, provocative, and often interestingly in-you-face honest, but as the film drags this approach just becomes grating and unrelenting. Add to this, the movie jumps ahead months and years at a time, which furthers our detachment from ever fully accessing these characters, ever fully understanding these characters, as if we are only offered the worst moments of the last four years of their lives - this continual distancing is distressing. This movie just rubbed me the wrong way.<br/><br/>I think there is enjoyment to be had from 'Closer', with some memorable performances, but that is about all this film has to offer. Many people may find this movie endearing, but unfortunately this movie failed to grab me. 'Closer' is sometimes effectively emotional in its exploration of diminishing trust and love in modern relationships and Natalie Portman is remarkable. She is undoubtedly the standout of this film, bringing a much-needed, though never fully realised innocence to the film (although her talents are wasted on this trite film), and Clive Owen successfully inhabits the persona of sex-craved man, seemingly without redemption. Julia Roberts as Anna and Jude Law as Dan are impressive, though less impacting than the others. Patrick Marber's screenplay has some high points and the dialogue mostly works, but as we, completely drawn back, continue to watch these characters dig themselves deeper into their own sh*t, the film ultimately becomes a mega- disappointment. As a harsh social commentary it does its job, but there really, truly is no point to 'Closer' other than that life is crap, relationships are crap, people are crap and these people end up with other crappy people."

","This movie completely fails to convince that any of its characters are living, breathing, complex people with any kind of life beyond the immediate frame. Even within the frame they appear to be entirely two dimensional. They move about and talk about sex -- that's about it. <br/><br/>No fault of the cast, who all do sterling work with the most threadbare of scripts and with Mike Nichols at the helm, it's little wonder that they were attracted to the project.<br/><br/>Apart from the incidental pleasure (for this resident, at least) of seeing London depicted in the background, plus one or two smart-aleck exchanges of dialogue, one wonders what Nichols himself saw in it? Nothing here approaching the earlier wit of Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf?, The Graduate or Carnal Knowledge, each exploring similar territory, not to mention Catch 22, Hearburn or Primary Colors. Well, everyone is entitled to an off-day. <br/><br/>The action leaps ahead by months or years -- or maybe it just feels that way -- when suddenly the recollection of a long-past infidelity rents asunder a relationship based solely on sex, or so it seems. Fair enough but what on earth did they find to talk about in the meantime? Utterly unbelievable."

I had to suspend my disbelief less for South Park Uncut. Nothing that any of the characters ever say or do is even remotely plausible.<br/><br/>After the first half hour the film becomes risibly predictable because you know that whatever choices the characters are faced with, they will take the most preposterous option. At one point I thought ""if Julia Roberts does X now then this is the worst film I've ever seen"" ... I clearly wasn't alone as when she did (inevitably) do X, a neighbour stood up and walked out of the theatre.<br/><br/>Oh ... Clive Owen puts in a convincing performance (as the biggest arsehole in a foursome of arseholes). But it's scant consolation for the rest of this nonsense."

Save your money at all cost. For a movie that was so over hyped, I'm glad that it was surprisingly a commercial flop. It's gotten to the point where large critics make me sick.

","Imagine your partner has cheated on you and you get the chance to confront them and have them openly answer all the questions that just rip your heart out of your chest. Not the standard questions that we all see on television dramas, but the questions that will induce deep emotional wounds. <br/><br/>'Was he better than me?' <br/><br/>'Did you have sex in our house?'<br/><br/>'Did he make love to you differently?'<br/><br/>These are questions that should remain in an impermeable vault. No response will be satisfying to the inquirer. But these are exactly some of the questions that are thrown at the audience when two of the four major characters in Mike Nichols new film Closer admit to their infidelity. <br/><br/>The film focuses on four individuals, Alice (Natalie Portman) who meets Dan (Jude Law) after being hit by car on a London street; Anna (Julia Roberts), a divorced photographer who ends up meeting Larry (Clive Owen) in a way that is far too interesting to reveal here. <br/><br/>In fact, this movie is so character and story driven that it benefits the viewer from watching it play out rather than spelled out, so I don't intend on offering many plot points as part of this review. <br/><br/>What I can say is that this is a good film that gets great performances from all its leads. Clive Owen in particular gives us a suave dermatologist with fits of rage that border on the violent. His performance is mesmerizing and his presence is commanding in along any of the other three more commonly known stars. When he confronts Anna after coming home from a business trip, he is enraged, hurt, inquisitive and broken hearted. Being able to convey a cavalcade of thoughts and emotions in such a powerful scene reminds us of the promise he conveyed in his first mainstream film, Croupier back in 1998.<br/><br/>And while Larry works out what is to be his new life of bachelor ship, Alice equally confronts her betrayer with raw emotion and a lack of understanding.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, like Owen is on the brink of stardom that should have both their trophy cases full of statues before their careers are over. Asked to hold her own amongst strong actors twenty years her senior, Portman matures in her role as Alice and becomes the pin-up 'girl to watch' for the next decade.<br/><br/>Based on a screenplay by Patrick Marber (adapted from his own play), the movie plays out like a stage performance. There are primarily only four speaking parts and very few sets and location shots.<br/><br/>The result is a very strong-dialogs film. Very strong. Those that see the trailers and expect to see Oscar contenders Roberts and Law have flightless banter, be warned. Director Mike Nichols incorporates explicit details about their sexual encounters with every foul word in George Carlins dictionary being paraded in rapid-fire progression.<br/><br/>But hell, we're all adults here, and if you can get beyond the utter deception that almost every character tries to hide, yet reveal, yet hide (you'll have to see it to understand), you will find a real good movie that could have been titled Eyes Wide Open. <br/><br/>So, I can't recommend this as a date film, but if you are in the mood for a movie about betrayal, love, obsession, sex, pain, lust, fear, loneliness, commitment, jealousy and honesty, this might just be the Christmas movie you are looking for."

","I am unable to recall a film with characters less appealing than the foursome of ""Closer."" Each character has his or her shade of nastiness that runs through this excruciating film experience. <br/><br/>One of the problems is that the dialogue does not provide the star actors (Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman) with sufficient motivation for the two pairs of lovers to be starting, ending, swapping, and resuming their relationships. The sudden and awkward transitions leave out the crucial scenes and moments where the relationships change. Out of this muddied and amateurish mess, there emerge three questions:<br/><br/>(1) Was this film intended to be funny? If so, the effort falls way short of the satirical writing of Edward Albee in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""--a film that was also directed by Mike Nichols. <br/><br/>(2) Was this film supposed to be engaging in the psychology of love? If so, the better films in this category would be ""Dangerous Liaisons"" or ""Valmont."" <br/><br/>(3) Was this film intended to depict the realities of contemporary romantic relationships? If so, the better film would be ""Cast Away"" wherein we see a much more healthy relationship with Tom Hanks and his soccer ball named Wilson. <br/><br/>In the closing credits of ""Closer,"" Patsy Rodenburg (one of the world's leading experts on Shakespearean text) is listed as the dialect coach for Natalie Portman, whose character is from New York. The IMDb bio of Natalie Portman indicates that she completed high school in New York. Did Patsy coach Natalie on her New York accent, or only on her Iago-like line readings?"
"AidanManchester","1","124","228","23 January 2005"," Superficial and contrived plot, improbable situations and too many high profile actors in one flick.
","I was extremely disappointed and irritated by this film. Movies should be about being transported into the lives and situations of the people on the screen but that singularly failed to happen in the case of 'Closer'.<br/><br/>The characters and relationships definitely do not ring true at all. It's not a question of not liking the people depicted, though none are likable, especially not the irritating doctor character. It's not a question of finding some of the language shocking - it is no more shocking than you'd see in a TV drama and there is virtually no nudity or sex. It's just that you couldn't care less about the characters as you don't really get to know them. Each one has no feeling of reality, no subtlety and no authenticity. They do things people only do in films, not in real life.<br/><br/>Do doctors really sit and engage in chat room sex talk in a hospital back office before going into the theatre to do an operation? Would photographer Anna have talked to and befriended sleazy doctor Larry in the aquarium... and then married him? Do people really hitch, split, re-hitch, bitch, bawl and spit at each other over who's been doing it with whomsoever's extramarital lover - or just ex, and is not telling the truth? Truthfulness toreal life is something this story lacks completely.<br/><br/>I found the dialogue wooden, the words contrived, the performances staged. Maybe it works better as a play. If so then it has not transferred successfully to film. I found it suffocating to have so many high profile actors together.<br/><br/>You know when a movie isn't working when you start to see the script roll in front of you like an autocue, and when you think you can see the crew looking on as the actors work through their lines.<br/><br/>After wasting two hours and five pounds on this movie I am losing my confidence in going to the cinema, except to see something I have seen before or has been personally recommended to me."

","I prefer when a movie is a movie. But when a movie is a very good play, we should be happy as well because there just aren't that many good things around.<br/><br/>This is a play, there's no mistaking. All the dynamics in it are seated in the words, all the motives in the four beings. There is no cinematic device used or necessary, except the revealing of the passport at the end, and I am sure that was handled differently in the stage version.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols makes a living out of taking constructions that work well on the stage and adding a few cinematic glosses so that the thing gives the impression it was born as a screen being. I find his tricks in this regard distracting, even a bit offensive because he hasn't adapted as the visual vocabulary has. <br/><br/>Never mind. Just eliminate the film components of its being and focus on the stage components and you still have something worthwhile, because here Nichols is still fresh.<br/><br/>You can read other folks to learn the story. It hardly matters. What matters to me is the clever, deep way the writer has constructed the thing. The visceral effect is from the panic and desperation of love. Nothing new there. What makes this effective, I think, are two things. Writerly things.<br/><br/>The first is that he hasn't just described the tippy balance of living in a romance. He hasn't just displayed the radical fuzziness and unpredictability of a world where that is all you know. He's made it the root of the story. This story has absolutely none of the logic to it that you expect when you see a love story. Everything seems real and natural after it has happened, but there's no way at all to predict what will happen next when you are in the thing. Its a great help in storytelling; you have to cling fast to what is happening. Its the best type of engagement, sucking you in by simply making you wonder, even worry about what is going to happen next. Its rare. Its good.<br/><br/>I'd like to point out how the four characters are constructed. A popular writing technique is to take one whole soul and break it into bits. Then the bits can get fleshed out imperfectly and interact so that the interaction has a being. In this case, start with a movie. What four pieces do you need? The writer (Dan), the photographer (Anna), the actor (Alice) and the director, the person concerned with the ""skin"" of the thing.<br/><br/>Its no accident, I think that it is impossible to settle on any one of these characters. You can go through this experience time and time again, each time tracing a different person's path, or the path of a relationship or even an urge.<br/><br/>This part is great too. Apart from Nichols' cinematic naivety, there's only one blot: Julia Roberts. She just doesn't understand what it means to be part of an assembly. She's not an actress in the real sense, the theatrical sense that Nichols knows how to sculpt. No wonder he wanted Cate Blanchett instead.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

A large portion of the film consisted of the men asking the women (and sometimes vice versa): What did you do? When did you do it? How did you do it? Where did you do it? After the first hundred questions I didn't care what the answer was, I just wanted these people to shut up already. I on the other hand have just one question: Is this the way real people talk to each other? <br/><br/>In addition these are four of the most unlikeable people I've ever seen in a movie.

","Unnecessarily tangled romantic relationships among four beautiful people in modern London form the core of this Mike Nichols directed film, based on a play. About the only thing I liked here was the melancholy song ""The Blower's Daughter"", sung by Damien Rice, that opens the film. The film's script is wretched.<br/><br/>Selfish, self-absorbed, obsessed with sex, vindictive, and shallow are how I would describe the four main characters, people who are annoyingly photogenic and ""hip"". The dialogue is like an interrogation session, with characters asking prying, intimate questions, over and over. These characters don't talk like real people. They emote, as if their words came straight from a screenplay, which makes the story seem ... fake. The dialogue is so contrived, so expedient to the plot, that I couldn't take any of these vain people, or their drama, seriously.<br/><br/>The film's action trends static. Characterization and dialogue are what count here, the back and forth banter that describes these miserable people.<br/><br/>Casting is terrible. I would have had more respect for this film if the four beautiful people had been played by less well-known actors. All four of the A-list actors here ... pose. They convey the impression that the film is about their performances, their careers.<br/><br/>Visuals are acceptable, if unremarkable. The highbrow, artsy music is fine, except that it amplifies an overall sense of pretentiousness.<br/><br/>With such unlikeable characters and with dialogue that is super, super contrived, this film left me bored and eager for it to end.

I don't mean the characters are bad people, I'd have no problem with that, I often root for villains. I mean they are unlikable. All four of the characters in this movie are pathetic.<br/><br/>They sleep with each other in Hollywood fashion, meaning relationships are never established. Falling in love takes place off-screen, though unannounced jumps in time, all we see is fighting.<br/><br/>The lapses in logic are amazing, meaning these characters do not act like normal people, they act like Hollywood people. All of the situations the characters find themselves in are fantastical and not grounded in any kind of reality.<br/><br/>I didn't watch the whole thing because there was a scene were the two males leads meet and one starts crying when in real life they would have beaten the crap out of each other.<br/><br/>yeah this is one of those movies where the female lead can't decide with one of the men she loves and the two men are both too dumb to drop her like a sack of potatoes, go share a few beers at a bar and sleep with ANYONE ELSE.

","This film has been continuously praised as being 'adult' and 'realistic'. Firstly I might point out that the demographic breakdown on this site of viewer's ratings for this film shows that whilst the average rating overall is 7.4, amongst under 18s it is 8.1 and this figure gradually goes down with each successive age group so that over 45s give it an average rating of 6.8. Not perhaps the breakdown one would expect from such an adult film.<br/><br/>Of course the above does suggest that people by and large like this. This mystifies me and I can only think that perhaps people want to like it precisely so they can think of themselves as more mature, adult and realistic for doing so - a feeling typically stronger in under-18s with a maturity-related inferiority complex and less prevalent in people who few would suggest are immature - over 45s. Whatever the case, my own thoughts on the film are this: If this is realistic then happiness must be damned near impossible to achieve. Indeed this movie depicts such despicable characters so consistently doing despicable things that each plot twist becomes utterly predictable once the film is about 1/3 through. A viewer can count on things turning out for the worst in every situation that arises and sure enough this is what happens.<br/><br/>It is an empty, barren and depressing film. As far as I recall the four main characters were the sum total of all the speaking parts in the movie, something I believe was primarily responsible for the aforesaid barren feeling that pervaded everything. The movie also has an unfortunate tendency to leap suddenly months or years in advance without any particular warning and in the end this, rather than giving an entertaining survey of the characters' severely dysfunctional lives, instead gives a viewer the feeling of watching a horrendously prolonged montage. The rushed pace with which it moves along, the inhuman coldness of the characters in their dealings with another and the consequent impossibility of actually engaging with them or sympathising with them leave the viewer not really caring what happens to them. Certainly one begins to know whatever it is it will be bad anyway. In short: there's no particular point to watching the film at all.<br/><br/>Now it does have a few (very few) redeeming features. Firstly Clive Owen is perhaps the best here and is the only character one might feel vaguely tempted to care about, though even he is required to work from this script and thus is required to try his absolute hardest to be unpleasant. His delivery of the much-quoted line regarding the human heart is perhaps the single finest point in the movie, and really, when you get down to it, the seconds it takes to deliver aren't really worth sitting through this dark, grey blur for.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts is utterly cold and flat and not remotely interesting. Natalie Portman plays a character that is interesting in the opening scenes, but as cold and cruel as is to be expected from this movie shortly after. Jude Law plays Jude Law to begin with before sinking into the same icy, vindictiveness of every other character. Indeed, in truth, there's really only one character in the movie, played by four different actors.<br/><br/>In its efforts to appear realistic and avoid the usual Hollywood happy, overly-optimistic view on human relationships this film viciously veers in the opposite direction, presenting an unhappy, overly-pessimistic view on human relationships. In other words, it's unrealistically negative. The ways in which the characters so rapidly turn on one another is beyond a normal human and ventures into the realm of the psychopathic.<br/><br/>This movie does contain one meaningful exchange, however, between Clive Owen's and Natalie Portman's characters in which Portman states, with regards to a photography exhibition: ""It's a bunch of sad strangers, photographed beautifully and all the glittering assholes who appreciate art say it's beautiful because that's what they want to see."" The irony is, I'm sure she's actually talking about the film."

","Closer may not be the worst movie ever made. I haven't seen every movie ever made, so I'm not in any position to make that evaluation. I can simply say it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is dull, repetitive, unbelievable, pretentious, sophomoric, and vulgar. Its leaden pace induces narcolepsy even as it desperately tries to titillate with the language of fornication. The ""adults"" in this movie are like the incarnation of the fantasies of a psychologically troubled 15-year old boy: both obsessed by and disgusted with their own sexuality. In one interminably long, dull scene, Jude Law -- impersonating a woman -- has cyber-sex with loutish doctor Clive Owen. The embarrassing part is that Director Mike Nicholas is so out of it that he thinks there is something inherently novel about this all-too-common internet phenomenon and so lets the stale scene play out at a laborious pace somewhere between cosmological entropy and stop-motion-photography. We're left to watch these blandly pornographic proceedings with all the enthusiasm of a half- anesthetized dental patient awaiting the drill.<br/><br/>About halfway through this movie a mischievous thought occurred to me: perhaps something more interesting was going on elsewhere on the premises. So I left my seat, retired to the men's room, and, at great leisure, relieved myself of my previously delicious dinner.

","Now, I know that proponents of this film are forming an opinion about what I have to say before I even say it. They're assuming that I didn't care for this film because there weren't any explosions, or there wasn't any gun-play, or because Ahhnold wasn't cast in the lead role. While I admit that my viewing preference circles around the horror/sci-if genre, the lack of violence in this film in no way contributed to my critique. In fact, when my girlfriend asked me to come see this film with her, I had quite the open mind. After all, half the film circles around sex, so what is there for a 24 year old male not to like. It was about fifteen minutes into the film, where Dan (Jude Law) and Anna (Julia Roberts) had their first encounter when I realized I had entered the ninth circle of hell.<br/><br/>The foundation to creating a quality film of any genre, but particularly a dramatic one, is to make the watcher believe that he is truly part of the story, that the plot could take place on nearly any street in any city in any town. With horror and science fiction films, leeway is given due to the fantastic nature of the genre, but with drama, there is very little room for error.<br/><br/>It is in this crucial element that the film fails miserably. It attempts to portray the gamut of human emotions, love, fear, anger, despair, that are put on display when one chooses to expose themselves to the world for the sake of the love of another. The premise is a bold one, and totally achievable, if the dialogue and plot had chosen not to get in the way and destroy it. While the actions of the characters seem believable per se, the way in which said actions are portrayed cross way over the line from dramatic into the melodramatic. The first encounter between Dan and Anna appears so rushed, so scripted, you don't believe anything that comes out of their mouths for the rest of the film. It's as if it were a poorly scripted reality T.V. show in which their true actions become overly exaggerated for the sole purpose of attempting to get a rise out of the audience. I imagine that proponents of this film also adored Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, which could have been a beautiful love story, if the plot were allowed to cultivate over 48 months, not 48 hours.<br/><br/>There are a few poignant places in the film where the dialogue, mostly that of Natalie Portman's character, forces one to step back and truly reflect on one's own existence, but the majority of the movie reminds me of oh so many daytime soap-operas, where the true lesson is lost amid an orgy of artificial emotions and unrealistic character development. It's truly sad to see such a bounty of super-star talent wasted on a film better suited for dish-washing housewives with nothing better to do on a Tuesday afternoon.<br/><br/>Kevin<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>I'm sorry Julia, I still love you, even if Damien Rice can't sing."

The story is simple, Dan (Law) a mediocre writer, goes to Anna (Roberts) to get a photo taken. Dan seems to know all the right things to say even though Anna keeps writing him off and from the start it is clear that for him this is love at first sight. Alice(Portman) is Dan's stripper girlfriend who saw Dan kiss Anna though he dosn't know. We are introduced to Larry (Owen) a dermatologist, in a on-line sex chat with a supposed women (in reality it is Dan's little joke.) who sets up a date with him. He includes things about Anna as a way to find ""her"" at the aquarium. Well Anna is really there and this leads to a very embarrassing situation. Some time later and Larry and Anna are married, and when Anna comes out with her affair with Dan to him this is where the movie starts.<br/><br/>Jude Law is the perfect example of what i call a great actor, he was good as the heartbroken, lovesick Dan and he could not have done any better, he seems to be so pure in this movie but he is out shined by the two supporting actors.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts falls flat. she just has no charm, no intensity, she seems bland. Jude Law outshone her in all there scenes, and i can only imagine how great it would have been if Cate Blanchett had done it.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is amazing. She is funny, cruel, cold, vulnerable all in one role. She does not impress me till (in my opinion) the best scene in the movie. Where Larry goes into the strip bar and she is there. She is so calm and cold as he pours his heart out to her, as she says ""Lying the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off, but it's better if you do."" Her facial expressions are outstanding.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is what i call a brilliant actor. He could carry this whole character by the emotions that are shone through his eyes, but no thats not enough, he throws in some smoldering presence, a forceful voice, an intensity that is not usually found in most actors. He feels every line and while you know you should hate him in the scene where he is forcing Anna to tell him how she slept with Dan in very graphic detail, you can't help but feel sorry for him, you can feel his pain. It is funny that the films two most powerful and the most emotional have him in it. Him and Natalie Portman have amazing chemistry and are by far the best performances in the film. He blazes on the screen and leaves an impression like an uncovered light bulb.<br/><br/>In a summary, this film wile make you cry, make you want to throw up, make you realize the parallels in your own life.

The performances were good, given what the cast had to work with (Clive Owen is best, but they're all remarkable actors), but good performances mean bugger-all when the characters aren't believable. It was all so much melodrama, I could've gotten the same thing from three or four episodes of All My Children. ""I love you, I never loved you, I'll always love you, I hate you, I love her, Now I love you again, oh wait, I'm just lusting after you, but really I love you..."" Come on. <br/><br/>This movie was totally empty. And don't say that ""emptiness"" was the point, because you don't get that point across by just leaving huge holes in the narrative and the character development. <br/><br/>And whose idea was it to compare this garbage to Lost in Translation? Closer is totally devoid of substance, is very shallow, and deals primarily with empty lust. Lost in Translation, on the other hand, has several different levels of depth, meaning, complexity and deals with real emotions, love (platonic or otherwise)... has well developed characters... I could go on and on. But, yeah."

I did find it extremely boring with very few redeeming qualities at all, i found it very hard to sit in the cinema and watch this to the end but only because it bored me to tears! Mike Nichols as a director can normally be relied on to bring real human emotion to even the most depressing subjects, try renting any other film he has ever directed...as this is his worst so far by a very long way! If the comments made by most of the rest of the audience on the way out the cinema, no matter how much publicity this film gets word of mouth by the paying audience should make sure this movie does not have a long run in UK cinemas...although i found the 101mins is 101mins too long!"

Natalie Portman is not an innocent beautiful young girl anymore, she is a full fledged Hollywood beauty in a role that even her OB/GYN father would blanch at. She is however fabulous. Jude Law also gives a terrific performance as he normally does. Newcomer Clive Owens is the perverted one, who also gives a very strong and very raw performance.

","Anyone who says closer was crap obviously didn't understand it and should probably look in to watching less challenging movies. I've seen it at least 5 times and every time I find i like it more for different reasons. The conversations are so rich, fast-paced and intense, i think that's probably why i've heard so many complaints, i guess those kinds of people aren't used to having to think in movies. I mean come on am I the only one who read into it? The whole movie was so brutally honest in the way it spoke about sex and lies, love and compromise. It brought everything to the surface, like how we all live with this naive idea that honesty brings people together but in reality it does the opposite. The only couple to stay together did so on a basis of lies, compromise and denial. and most importantly the thing that had never even crossed my mind before closer, the notion of love at first sight. I think most people believe in it yet don't admit it, but anyway what most people don't realize is, that even when you find it, you never stop looking, waiting for it to happen again. Cause that's all it is, an instant connection with a perfect stranger, love of what we don't fully understand. but of course that dissolves, reality sets in and what you know you don't really like in that person. Truth is a bitch. We're only truly close when we're strangers i say. By far one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. The only thing I'm upset about is Clive not winning supporting"

While I realize that is purely a matter of taste, I am sure I am not alone in believing her part was terribly miscast. The dialog is provocative, and definitely cuts to the quick on a lot of issues, but more importantly keeps you watching. But I wouldn't go overboard with the praise heaping on this film, because in the end its main tool is shock through brutality, crassness and vulgar lower the bar even more pillow talk. It is startlingly intelligent and even fresh, yet I don't care how its dressed up, or who the director is, the film is not dark as everybody labels it, but base.

","Watched this last night and loved it. This movie is perfect for those that are pretty familiar with the constant b.s. that goes on in relationships and anyone who has ever dealt with situations even remotely similar to what the characters in the movie go through. <br/><br/>Mike Nichols does a great job directing this film about two couples who basically crash into each other's lives and spend the rest of the film trying to pry themselves from the wreckage and move on. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie is absolutely phenomenal. Even though at times the dialogue is spoken as if it would've been more at home on a stage, that detail can be overlooked because the story was originally written as a play. Everyone turns in a pitch perfect performance but in the end, the movie belongs to Natalie Portman who I think we can all agree has grown up. Her presence in this film is so powerful that you can just feel her around even in the scenes that she's not in. Jude Law deserves a mention because he can play the good guy or the scuzzball and delivers consistently. He plays a real bastard in this, so all you girls who adore him might want to avoid this, along with his more dentally challenged role in ""Road to Perdition"". Julia Roberts felt very natural for the part as did Clive Owen, who was great as the guy who gets his heart broken. Speaking of which, the movie is a very painful experience. I think it is one of the more accurate representations of just how selfish people can be when it comes to their needs and desires. <br/><br/>To sum it up as best as I can, if you've ever had your heart broken, believe me you'll relate with one or even all of the characters in this film. Watching this is like watching someone you know sacrifice their dignity for someone who doesn't deserve it.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film enough and it's a great example of how a film without any action can grab you just with the power of the spoken word.<br/><br/>RATING: ****1/2 out of *****.<br/><br/>P.S. **MINOR SPOILER AHEAD** If there was one problem I had with the movie, it was just that I couldn't buy the whole thing about Natalie Portman's character not ever revealing her real name to Jude Law in all the time they were together. The way it looked to me in the movie, she was really in love with the guy and was willing to take a lot of crap from him. I just couldn't swallow it completely but in the end, it still played out nicely when Jude realized he'd been duped."

Dan writes a book, inspired in the life of Alice, and while photographing for the release of the book, he meets the American photographer Anna (Julia Roberts). Dan ""introduces"" the dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen) to Anna, and they get married. However, Dan and Anna have a passionate affair, complicating the relationship of the couples.<br/><br/>""Closer"" is a magnificent romance, but recommended for adults. The dramatic story is an intriguing tale of relationship, with love, passion, betrayal, forgiveness, insecureness, infidelity, elements that shall be handled very carefully by the director and screenplay writer; otherwise it might have become a boring or corny soap-opera. In this regard, the screenplay of Patrick Marber, and the direction of Mike Nichols, using ellipsis and flashbacks to present the events, sometimes years or months later, is spectacular, working perfectly in the film. This is the first time that Clive Owen proves (at least for me) that he is a good actor, with an awesome performance. Natalie Portman is also fantastic and they really deserved the nominations they received in many awards, including the Oscar. Natalie Portman is also very beautiful and shows an astonishing body. Julie Robert, still a very pretty woman, and Jude Law, complete the outstanding cast of this great movie. I liked a lot the surprising revelation disclosed in the end of the story.

","A few years back I saw the play of Closer on stage and while I wasn't truly in love with it, it had stayed with me during all of the intervening time. There's been talk of turning it into a movie since before the Broadway run, and finally with Mike Nichols at the helm it arrives on movie screens.<br/><br/>How is it? A well acted, well written mess that suffers for the changing. Bouncing through time the story tells of the coupling, uncoupling, re-coupling and uncoupling of four people who try as they might not to abuse the hell out of each other.<br/><br/>What worked on stage doesn't here. Conversations that took place in one place over a brief period of time are opened up and seem to stretch through various locations and so seem to be artificial, or having been staged by a director who was afraid to make a talking head picture.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's character seems to have been reinvented and for the most is not the disaster I had feared. I do question her constant smoking since it seems to have been put front and center as a means of making her seem older (or closer to her actual 20 something age) than the 15 years of her looks.<br/><br/>There are several changes to the source material, in particular at the end where the fate of one character is completely different, and the stunning ending of the play is muted.<br/><br/>I know I should not be comparing the play to the movie since they are ultimately different, but the only way to express why the film didn't work for me is to compare the two. I had given up any real hope that the film was going to be the play early and so took the film on its own terms and found it wanting. It just doesn't work on its own terms except fleetingly.<br/><br/>The performances are first rate and as a series of unconnected scenes this is dynamite, but nothing hangs together. Its as if Mike Nichols had several very fine pieces of cloth but couldn't bring them together as anything that looked like the quilt he had in mind.<br/><br/>See it or don't, I don't know what else to say since its such an almost film it may click with you or it may grate on you, the choice is yours."

These moments jarred and in so doing they ruined the credibility of the whole film. The name of the Natalie Portman character? Clive Owen's first conversation with the Natalie Portman character? Natalie's last action in the film? I'm a fan of Patrick Marber but I felt that events were thrown in just because they looked clever. The overall effect was that this was a contrived film.

"bob the moo","Null","11","21","17 January 2005"," Well acted but too extreme, convenient and lacking the development that would have made the characters people I care about
","After a chance meeting at the scene of an accident, Alice and Dan start seeing each other and fall in love. When Dan has his photograph taken for his new book, he meets Anna and kisses her  starting a desire for her that continues even when a practical joke sees her happening to meet Larry. Anna and Larry fall for one another and start seeing each other while Dan and Alice continue their relationship. However desires, the truth and complexities in modern relationships all see things falling apart as easily as they first came together.<br/><br/>Perhaps it says something about the majority of films released in the cinema these days but, whenever we get one that is dark, adult and edgy it is almost a given that the critics will fall over themselves to praise it and many viewers drawn to it will go ready to appreciate it no matter what. So it seems with Closer: an adult, bleak, dark look at the selfish and fleeting nature of ""love"" that is deeply flawed despite being still worth a watch. I heard one critic say that he disliked this film because he just wanted to get up on the screen and slap all the characters for being stupid  I don't totally agree with him but the problem that made him say that (I think) is pretty much the same problem that I have with it. That is the narrative and the lack of development. You see, the film jumps years at a time without ever telling you it has  and it jumps from one ""complex situation"" to another with nothing in between. Therefore, although much of it is well written and convincing, it is never happening to real people or even characters we know or care about it  it feels like you're standing in the street watching a couple fight, you have no involvement but it is of some interest.<br/><br/>Like I said, a lot of it is convincing; yes these people are stupid in love, driven by desires and unlikely to ever be happy but then that is what a lot of people are like to a lesser extent. The exaggeration and the lack of inner development within the story combines to damage this and it does regularly lose this convincing touch because it goes too far or does things in a lazy fashion (the heavy reliance on coincidence early on is an insult to the audience). For example the final twist in the film is very interesting but yet we are given nothing to help us understand the character it involves or even care about it retrospectively. It is a real shame because the cast try so hard and are so good that it is hard not to like their performances. Roberts is very low key and, perhaps deliberately, underplays a lot compared to the others. Owen is the standout  playing a nice guy on the surface but much more just under the surface; it is difficult to ""get"" a simple character sometimes but here he does this complex one justice. Like me, Law may not have totally understood his character and didn't cope as well with the complexities within him but still does well with the role. Portman is difficult for me to judge because I do have a lot of time for her and it is hard to be objective. I didn't feel that her character was well done at all but that she as an actress had done the best she could with it regardless.<br/><br/>Overall this is a dark, edgy and adult film and it does make a change from the constant action movies and teenage thrillers in the multiplexes but these factors alone do not make it a fantastic film, even if it does make it an interesting film (it is certainly not a ""triumph"" as the poster proclaims). The narrative only concerns crisis-points, sometimes years apart, without putting anything in between and it exaggerates things to the point where it is hard to really let them touch you even if a lot of it is pretty convincing and realistic (at least in the heart if not actions)  this leaves us without characters we care about and just performances to watch. The cast are roundly great but it is hard to really care about it enough. I didn't want to get up and slap the characters but the film was a bit like watching a couple fight  interesting, realistic but neither requiring nor allowing any emotional involvement from the viewers."
"satchmostrong","Null","7","12","3 December 2004"," Emotionally Distant
","Nichols paints a pretty grim world where love is a game of deception and manipulation, and sex is wielded by the players as a weapon. It's no less merciless than a deathmatch arena, where the only redemption can be found in loneliness and isolation.<br/><br/>The title represents a playful twist to the story. Even though the main characters are physically intimate, they are impossibly distant emotionally. Set in central London, the backdrop is emphasized by a depressing grayish sky. Harsh lighting and cold warehouse-style sets reinforce the emotional desolation of the characters.<br/><br/>And fitting to the theme of treachery, the most seemingly vulnerable character turned out to be the deceiver, and the one you trust the most betrays you. At the end, no one is left unscathed and everyone is emotionally bereft.<br/><br/>I don't need to reiterate that the film is aimed towards a mature audience. Anyone who is into glitters and pyrotechnics will probably drift into a coma before the movie ends."

","Looking at the previous reviews and the message boards, it looked like some people were offended by the moral universe occupied by the characters in the movie. You'd think these people would recognize a morality play when they see one! This movie is clearly a cautionary tale, a fulfillment of the old proverb, ""if you can't be an example, at least be a warning."" The Greeks were writing stories like this over 2000 years ago, full of murder and mayhem and deceit, of people having sex with their mothers and poking their eyes out. Yet I haven't heard the ""Christian"" conservatives getting all worked up about THAT.<br/><br/>Of course these characters' behavior was offensive. That was the point of the movie. We watch as the brazen disregard of moral laws wreaks tragedy on stage or on screen, thinking to ourselves ""boy, glad I'm not that screwed up"" (or in some cases ""boy, I'm really screwed up""), and then we walk out of the theater vowing to behave better than that. Didn't we all learn this in 10th grade literature class? Anyway, to me this movie was about trust, honesty and deception. This was most clearly played out in the strip club scene, but it was a central theme throughout. At times a character would show an incredible level of trust in one of the others, often in a completely amazing and charming way. Sometimes this trust was rewarded, and sometimes it was violated. At times one of the characters would break another's trust through deception in a completely vile way, sometimes over a long period of time. At times we in the audience would find that we ourselves had been deceived by one of the characters. This plays out especially well in a scene near the end that reverses several of our earlier notions of who was deceiving whom, and when.<br/><br/>The old adage, ""what a tangled web we weave, when we endeavor to deceive"" is illustrated vividly here. The clear message is: don't behave this way, folks. And don't get tangled up with someone who does). I know some have expressed amazement that anyone would live like this. Is it any more surprising than finding out there are people who rape or murder others, molest children, or start wars needlessly? Most people aren't like this, but there are those who act without conscience, either continuously or at convenient times. This story sets out to illustrate the damage they can cause.<br/><br/>After setting that record straight, I have to say that although the acting was fantastic all around, I thought the script and dialogue were a bit flat in places, and this film just didn't grip me as well as it should have. 7/10."

","If you have ever wanted to confront the brutal truth and lies about human relationships, then get ready to get Closer.<br/><br/>Be warned - this film pulls no punches and quite intentionally shocks and offends us through the script and the characters. It will relentlessly draw you in and spit you out at the end. If you want warm and fuzzy romanticism, stick to When Harry Met Sally or Ghost.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols takes us, so successfully, into the darkest and warmest depths of the human heart in lust and love and thrusts us into a web of relationships where identities are withheld, selflessly revealed and even emotionally raped.<br/><br/>This masterpiece depiction of who we are as individuals and why we are certain people to some and other people to others will command you to examine your own identity and re-evaluate your views on love, lust and relationships.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's performance as Alice/Jane is spectacular from start to finish. She delivers this massively complex character to the screen with brilliance. But keep up or you will miss the diversity (and yet simplicity) of her character. Clive Owen delivers a remarkably brutal honesty as Larry. You will love and hate him at the same time.<br/><br/>This movie tells it how it really is. It is thought-provoking, to say the least. Where other movies have skirted around the raw and real, Closer grabs you by the scruff of the neck, slaps you in the face with a wake-up call and reminds us that these characters exist all around us, if not within us ... we just don't like to admit it or talk about it and we most certainly don't want to be confronted with it.<br/><br/>They are real, fake, honest, deceitful, loving, ruthless, caring, selfish, likable, loathed, unbelievable and believable. You decide! To truly enjoy this movie, I would recommend that you pay very close attention to the dialogue. Every word, sentence, action and reaction is a revelation of character. If you miss the dialogue, nothing will make sense and you will walk away from this masterpiece feeling disappointed.<br/><br/>Get comfortable, forget everything you think you know about relationships, put your seat-belt on and enjoy the ride of your life into the beauty and ugliness of the human spirit.<br/><br/>This is by far the best film I have seen.

","People aren't having fun. The world isn't nice and reality is cruel. The deep core of relationships consists in the end of pure self-humiliation. The human heart looks like ""a fist covered in blood"" and we should ""try lying for a change, it's the currency of the world"". This is ""Closer"". Four people that go around in circles through each other, exploring the art of heartbreaking. By the credits, all of them has been (and cheated) with each other. In the beginning, nobody is particularly happy. In the end, nobody is particularly happy.<br/><br/>This has been seen before, but seldom in Hollywood. It is very understandable that there has been a hype surrounding this film, given that it is an American film and not, specially not, European. The raw and totally unforgiving tone is daring indeed. Mike Nichols, on the other hand, has always been dancing around the thin line of what is sentimentally ""under-the-top"" and his very raw directing is of course a given trade of success for ""Closer"". The precision of the work in this film is, at moments, pure brilliant. The Production Design is always reflecting the hollow and artificial, the music is symbolic to the very last (wether The Smiths ""How Soon is Now?"" or Mozart's ""Cosí fan tutte"", translated ""So do they all"") and while the audience never gets to witness any real love sequences, the characters are constantly finding aways of avoiding emotions when faced with them. It is very well-made and the collaboration between the elements are giving a solid rock foundation for the film which makes it deliver it's punches.<br/><br/>There are problems, though. In an absurd way, while the themes are heavy, there is something very ""easy"" about the film. If there ever was a ""feel-good""-movie playing with the audience instinctive emotions, ""Closer"" is quite the ""feel-bad""-film, doing just the same. And while ""Closer"" has a realistic portrayal of the real life, the film also feels somewhat unrealistic at points. The screenplay is filled with smart and overly coherent dialog, but it doesn't give anything else. In all the wit of the dialog, the coherence vanishes. The characters, specially Julia Roberts', tend to come off blank and fuzzy, going from one point to the other constantly and without any reason. Nichols' directing makes ""Closer"" look the real world, but the screenplay shows us things that, without being exaggerated, still come off like something that simply doesn't happen.<br/><br/>Still, ""Closer"" is a refreshing American film. It's too shallow and unambiguously written to be any near a masterpiece, but the good craftsmanship makes it a worthwhile and recommended tragedy."

I have seen Runaway Bride and My Best Friend's Wedding and she is really horrible. It just shows though, if given the right direction and dialogue, an actor can do anything. These four actors shine and really impressed me with their realistic portrayals. Jude Law's character of Dan was everything that Jude himself is not---pathetic, weak, insecure, and needy. Well, I guess I don't know that for sure. But it seems that way. His ""I have to see you---you kissed me"" was one of the best lines of the movie and really helped establish him as a whiny playful love obsessed guy. Natalie Portman's performance was also very good. A lot of people say she acts like cardboard. I guess they must have been watching a different movie than me. The shining performance of the movie was, hands down, Clive Owen. Wow. This guy is talented. His delivery, his glares, his facial expressions, his reactions to others. It was all so crisp and precise. I was blown away.

In fact, while, closer is a very heavy movie, It is an intense, performance driven, Emotionally brutal film that, while draining to watch, is fascinating in it's sheer effectiveness in exposing the raw emptiness and utter lack of meaning that can and does, exist, in those 3 magic words: I love you. Closer was originally a play and you can kind of tell that within the first few minutes of the movie. Although, this story is more suited, in some ways, to the stage, I think all involved did an excellent job in bringing it to the big screen.<br/><br/>There are only 4 characters in the whole movie and all 4 performers were wonderful in different ways. (They would have to be for a movie like this to maintain it's power.) I know, to many, the strong amount of cursing and vulgar language might have been a negative, but I think it added to the emotional power of the movie. I also found Some of the scenes disconcerting but the movie was very honest in it's telling of the power games, battles for control and obsessive love/hate struggles that actually go on in many, though not all, of romantic relationships. Many of my friends who did not like this, in fact, said the reason why they were uncomfortable, was that it was to true to life. I think the majority of people will be uncomfortable watching Closer and if the movie made one mistake it Was not advertising in an appropriate way, many I knew went, thinking it would be another sunny Julia Roberts comedy which it obviously isn't although I think Roberts turns in her Strongest performance here to date. Closer isn't afraid to take chances and to me, it is very accurate in showing the ugly side of relationships. <br/><br/>Everything is explored here from power games, dependency issues, sexual obsession, intimacy, infidelity etc. The words I love you are rendered almost meaningless here. Closer also shows how little people can sometimes know each other no matter how deeply involved they may be. And the audience gets to know the people on screen as these characters come to know each other and what develops isn't predictable. I thought this film was superb. <br/><br/>Beyond the incredible performances turned in here, I hope Closer wins best direction. The scene at the strip club between Alice and Larry was the most well directed scene I've seen all year and that one scene alone is enough to go see the movie.<br/><br/>In closing-this isn't for everybody or maybe not even the majority but I thought it was very well done, was almost flawless (the lapses in time, while maybe working on stage, Served to confuse many seeing it as a movie.), and contains some of the best and most intense performances of 2004. One of the best of the year."

","I saw Closer when it opened here and was not expecting a beautiful time with it. Having been a fan of the stage play and seeing the cast I was not flat out pleased. However, the one thing that I liked was Mike Nichols.<br/><br/>He is a brilliant director who has proved he can adapt anything or create anything into art. So the next good thing about this piece was using Patrick Marber (the playwright) to adapt his own play (ala Tony Kushner adapting Angels in America [another brilliant play adaptation]).<br/><br/>So I sat down and began to relax...<br/><br/>The title came up and a song began to play and I was plunged into the most fascinating movie on adult topics, with adult speech and adult emotions that I can ever think of. This was a brilliant piece of art.<br/><br/>I must say that the love square: Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law, and Natalie Portman were astounding in their scenes together, functioning opposite each other. And Julia and Jude Law seem to have more experience on film but the real standouts were Clive Owen and Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>Clive Owen has been constantly good and a brilliant actor in his work thus far in his career, but gives the performance of his life in this. I hear the Oscar bells ringing.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman has always been my guilty pleasure even in the Star Wars movies and between her performance in this and Garden State, I will be disappointed if she doesn't at least get an Academy Award nomination.<br/><br/>Again, it was a beautiful movie for the 18 and up age range just based off of emotional content and adult situations.<br/><br/>***** A+++"

","What is learned about people through this film? I learned by clicking on the writer that is was based on an award-winning play, and upon learning this my bewilderment was compounded. This film was not one constructed for entertainment. It does not depict young people as being kind or particularly sensitive, nor does it depict them as being particularly bright or courageous or capable of contiguous, if not rational, thought processes. It does not depict men as being interested in much beyond seeing or penetrating a woman's vagina (or being responsible for or counting her orgasms). It does not present three dimensional characters (nor developed character arcs for your screenwriters out there) whose motives, desires and frailties are explored, examined, or deconstructed with any depth whatsoever. So I am left with nothing but an empty, hollow feeling because once again my generation specifically, and humanity generally, is being compressed into a tiny, incoherent, two dimensional space. And if, for some bizarre reason beyond comprehension, this film was made for entertainment purposes, I'd have to say that Mike Nichols has failed, miserably.

I can honestly say I have never been so let down by a film since I walked out of ""Eyes Wide Shut"". The performances of each leading actor were wooden, unrealistic and with the exception of Jude Law (who I have yet to see a performance to justify the hype) I really would of expected better- especially from the increasingly excellent Natalie Portman. This film has a go at what could be an excellent storyline, but by halfway through has disintegrated into a mish-mash of unnecessary obscenity and filth. None of the characters are believable, and the jerky, unconnected plot fights tooth and nail to try and hold the whole sorry mess together. Sadly by a third of the way through, it has lost a very difficult battle. I am most sorry I wasted 2 hours of my life on this film. If you have yet to go and see it, save your money.

","Synopsis: Dan (Jude Law) meets Alice (Natalie Portman) after she is hit by a cab. She's just moved to London from NYC. He takes her to the hospital, where they chat and become friends. He writes obituaries; she's a stripper.<br/><br/>A year later, Dan and Alice are living together. He's finished a novel and falls for the photographer that takes the picture for his book jacket, Anna (Julia Roberts). He introduces Anna to Larry (Clive Owen) and the four people become sexually entangled over the next few years.<br/><br/>Review: Closer is a respectable effort. The film had a lot of potential, but failed in so many ways. Closer can be seen as the anti-date movie. It's hard to like the characters, and even harder to like their actions. Even so, it paints a picture so close to reality.<br/><br/>A controversy revolving Closer was the sexual content. While sex never occurs on screen, it's a prominent topic and is actually the plot (if there is one) to the film. The only nudity is seen at the strip club, but the dialogue is almost repulsive. Most is not needed, or could have been better if it was only implied. A scene in the strip club with Alice and Larry is probably the height of the vulgarness. <br/><br/>Julia Roberts and Jude Law turn in good performances, but are easily out acted by Natalie Portman, who proves to be an adult, and Clive Owen, who shows incredible emotion with his sleazy character.<br/><br/>Closer is the perfect example of love at first sight. The tag line for the film states: ""If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking."" That's essentially the core of the movie. Were these people truly in love? If they were, why would they be so unfaithful to their ""true love""? Is appearance and first impressions an important factor in determining who we're going to spend our life with? <br/><br/>Each character in Closer has their share of lies. Lying to their current lover, lying to themselves. It effectively shows that men will do anything to get what they want, and how quickly the women will fall for it. I'm not saying that the female characters are any less guilty in immorality or whatever you'd call it, but they seemed to be the more naive of the four. <br/><br/>Closer contains a great deal of good, but in all, it doesn't add up to a complete motion picture. The sexual content could have been reduced, thus unneeded in many instances. A very depressing film, but thought provoking nevertheless. Good performances abound, but do not make up for holes that could have easily turned this average film into a more compelling motion picture. Viewer discretion advised: Closer is not for everyone.<br/><br/>C (6/10)"
"FilmOtaku","7","5","8","3 February 2005"," A searing drama that made me want to shower afterward
","Mike Nichols' film ""Closer"" is simply a study in human relationships. Other than the four main characters, everyone else is an extra, with minimal dialogue, if any. Jude Law is Dan, a struggling writer who is a member of the Obituary staff at a London paper. One day he catches the eye of Alice, (Natalie Portman) who is walking down the street toward him, newly arrived from the United States. They lock eyes (in the film it seems like minutes, but is probably seconds) before she steps into oncoming traffic and gets hit by a car. Her injuries are not serious, but they are the beginning of a long and painful relationship. Some time later, Anna (Julia Roberts) a photographer, is snapping a photo of Dan for his upcoming debut novel when he promptly hits on her. The attraction is obviously mutual, but she manages to hold him off since he is involved with Alice, and she is newly separated from her husband. Some time later, he is messing around on the Internet, pretending to be a woman and chatting with a completely clueless doctor, Larry (Clive Owen). Dan arranges to meet Larry at the aquarium and tells him his name is ""Anna"". Of course, Anna is sitting there, Larry thinks she is the one he talked to, she is clueless, but figures out that Dan played a joke on both of them. Soon, THEY begin a relationship. Throughout the next year or two (the passing of time is so off-handedly managed that it is hard to determine exactly what time frame we pass) relationships get blurred, soured and, I hate to create a pun here: closer.<br/><br/>The tagline for ""Closer"" is ""If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking"". According to the action in the film, truer words were never spoken. The moral of the story is that everyone cheats. And if they don't, they are excessively co-dependent. (And actually, there are some cheaters who are excessively co-dependent.) While the story was very intricately woven, impressively so, it was still hard to take, particularly during a scene in which Clive Owen confronts Julia Roberts about her infidelity. The pain that these people cause one another is so pervasive that it becomes almost a character itself. And while the sleaze factor was so high I wanted to shower with a particularly abrasive soap the second I got home, the film's story was actually extremely thought provoking and discussion-worthy. Just driving home, my boyfriend and I got into a discussion about the characters, and he said that Anna was the most despicable character Julia Roberts has played, while I thought that Clive Owen was a bit much. I think the film acts as both a solidifier and divider between men and women on a few different levels, a sign that the film obviously succeeds in proving its thesis.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Closer"" is first-rate. I have never seen any of the characters in better form, quite honestly. Portman, an actress that I have marginalized as mediocre since every performance after her stunning debut in ""The Professional"", also impressed me; she subtly exhibited both weakness and slyness in a manner that made her character purposely hard to read. I actually consider Jude Law's performance as Dan to be his best since his role in ""Road to Perdition"". (Certainly a feat considering he was featured in no less than 653 films in 2004.) Roberts was actually mesmerizing (she's come a long way since the insipid ""Pretty Woman"") and I look forward to seeing Owen have a well-deserved prolific film career. As for the direction, Mike Nichols is flawless. He has really become a master at his trade. This doesn't necessarily mean that he is ceaselessly compelling, though he made all the right decisions in ""Closer"" from the pacing to the soundtrack, particularly the Damien Rice track that plays a couple of times throughout the film, (though I would have liked to have heard the Suzanne Vega song that is featured in the trailer) I would not go out of my way to see a Mike Nichols film based on his name alone, but I put him higher on the cred ladder that Ron Howard is also on; the films are usually good, but they don't always completely enthrall me.<br/><br/>This was not the case with ""Closer"" however. I walked out of the film not liking it at first, but I think that was because it was such a depressing commentary on relationships. The more I realized I was thinking about it even days after seeing it, the more I realized that it actually was a good movie with an unpleasant theme and some great acting. Whereas I would have given it a lower score right out of the box, I give it a supportive 7/10 now.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"movito72","9","5","8","19 December 2004"," A harsh but brutally honest and outstanding film
","In this bruising, emotionally scarring but beautifully made film, four people discover the ups and downs of relationships and the effects of switching partners. Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman play the four using every ounce of talent in their souls, infusing these unlikable characters with real emotion so that the viewer's heart grieves every time one of them hurts another. It is quality of the highest caliber, and I did not notice until the closing credits that these four are the only characters in the film. They carry the weight on their own and are aided immeasurably by veteran director Mike Nichols.<br/><br/>First, Dan (Law) meets Alice (Portman) after their sidewalk flirtation results in Alice getting hit by a car. Dan, a newspaper obituary writer, is inspired by her life as a stripper and writes a novel. When he is doing a photo shoot to publicize his book, he falls for Anna (Roberts), the photographer. As a practical joke, he sets her up with Larry (Owen, ""King Arthur""), a dermatologist, but they eventually get married. However, Anna sees Dan the whole time. This is only the beginning of the partner swapping. By the end of the film, every character has been revealed to be dishonest, manipulative, and they all cry at some point. This is a very hard film to watch because of its brutal dialogue and generally unlikable characters, but as I said before, the actors bring such a sympathetic quality to their roles that it is impossible to stop watching the movie. Like the four people, the audience hopes for a happy ending, but of course there is none. By the end of the film, when one character realizes that he truly loves another one, so much backstabbing and betrayal has gone on that it is too late for them to be happy, and this leads to a an ambiguous ending that ends the movie on a pitch-perfect note.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols (""The Graduate,"" HBO's ""Angels In America"") uses his almost-forty year experience with films to deliver a whopping, emotionally draining piece of celluloid that is lyrical and beautifully moving in its images and soundtrack, transcending the despicable characters. But it is this fact that the people are not likable that really makes the film outstanding. The dialogue (adapted by Patrick Marber from his play) is so witty and piercingly honest that it hurts to watch the characters spar off, but it is so tantalizingly interesting that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Nichols uses Damien Rice's song ""The Blower's Daughter"" in the first and last scenes of the movie as a beautiful, stirring component to wonderfully shot sequences. It is this care that every member of the film uses in every frame and that is what, when all is said and done, puts ""Closer"" among the best films of the year."
"WCS02","Null","5","8","14 December 2004"," Remarkable. Raw and True.
","Two pivotal ideas make this film memorable: Clever euphemisms and (conceptually) 'the moment' of change. When exactly does someone fall in love? How does someone? Euphemisms weave their way throughout the dialog, tossing four people ragged on the seas of love without dramamine, to discover The Moment. Closer  the title itself  is euphemistically used to help me understand the moment in the games people play en route to falling into and out of love. <br/><br/>Nothing is held back. No bridling. Passion and emotional turmoil are served up raw. That Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts are the female objets'desire drew me in from frame one (and there's Jude Law and Clive Owen for the ladies - no worries). <br/><br/>Unless ice water flows through your veins, you'll get Closer to the work of Mike Nichols - who started down this path with Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff four decades ago, his first and best gem. <br/><br/>Enjoy! I did. 8 out of 10."
"DuckieMah","9","5","8","5 December 2004"," Witty, funny and thoughtful
","Some Spoilers!<br/><br/>I was blown away by this wonderful film. The script was both witty and intelligent. For those that don't believe in the 'realism' of this film, have never truly been in love. Those unfortunate people cannot even imagine the eruption of spiteful and vengeful actions that result from having your heart gutted out by the person you hold dearest to you. I know that if this ever happened to me, I'd want to know all the excruciating details and want revenge, as awful as it sounds, to make the other person feel the same, if not more, pain that he caused me.<br/><br/>The acting was mostly top notch. Julia Roberts, who did NOT deserve the Oscar over the wonderful Ellen Burstyn in Requiem For a Dream, once again fails to show any real range as an actress. She displays one emotion throughout the screen, coldness. She should stick to the bubbly and busty characters she usually plays on the screen. Jude Law is wonderful as always. But it is truly Clive Owen who really knocks this one out of the park. His character is intelligent, calculating and selfish and Owen plays these traits out effortlessly. Natalie Portman has always been a talented individual but, has not yet truly reached her maximum potential as an actress. Her work in this film has solidified her position as a star, yet I feel as though she is lacking the acting ability to play an adult character convincingly. Her youth is still too apparent in her voice and physical actions.<br/><br/>For those that did not get the film, have to look deeper into the words of the characters. This film, was after all, taken from a play and the heart of the characters are in their words not their actions.<br/><br/>This story in intentional and does accurately depict human nature, you just have to look 'closer'.<br/><br/>Alice, a stripper, lives a life fulfilling other people's fantasies. Her work is built on lies so it is no surprise to see her personal life treated in the same respect. Her role as a stripper allows her to have control in the fantasy, it is this control that rules her life. Recall in the beginning of the movie, Alice tells Dan, something along the lines of I will leave you. She only takes him back just so she can assert her need for control.<br/><br/>Dan, the writer of the dead, is so completely uncreative he has to borrow the life of Alice to write his book. His worklife is also driven by lies and it is his eventual search for the truth that collapses his entire world.<br/><br/>Anna, the photographer, makes her living by taking pictures of melancholy people. She is incapable of being happy and wants to live in an unhappy relationship. She thrives on guilt and it becomes her reason for staying.<br/><br/>Larry is selfish and calculating. He is a skin doctor who knows how to get below the surface of a person and give them what they need. He does this with Anna, he does love her, but loves himself more and will do anything to possess her and ruin the lives of those who stand in his way.<br/><br/>The words are indeed the soul of this film.

This is definitely a movie that should be seen, not just for the phenomenal acting but for the imagery as well. The scene where Natalie Portman's characters uses her ""real"" name as her screen name and how that plays out in the end was interesting and gave plenty of food for thought. The switching and the revenge sex that was prevalent throughout the movie was thought provoking. Jude Law's character though reminded me a spoiled child, he wanted to have his cake and eat it too. He could not deal with Julia Roberts' character because she had slept with her ""ex-husband"" though he got her under similar circumstances and goes out of his mind when he finds out that Clive Owen's character slept with ""Alice"".

Jude Law is as always sensational as a variant of his Alfie charaacter, and Natalie Portman has reached a level of maturity that was truly surprising, not to mention wearing some of the sexiest stripper outfits one can imagine. And Clive Owen is a perfect match for Jude that turns into a perfect ego cock match that creates so much delightful drama that you wonder how far they will push the edge.

","Closer is a British-American relationship drama about people that really are not too likable, but that it is part of what might be a kind of working thesis for the film should be taken into account. The four principles- Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen- are like amalgamations of all of the lesser characteristics of those in post-modern relationship plays and films, where the love and goodness in them is subdued under their lack of connections to one another. That it all doesn't work as well as, for prime example, Nichol's own Carnal Knowledge, may be because of the script more than anything. What is successful from Marber's work- of showing four characters who find what they are looking for, then go into complete and utter disillusionment- it really has to walk a fine line of having these people talking truthfully, honestly not just in the context of their characters but how MOST people do talk in relationships. Sometimes its quite believable, and sometimes not, and when it's not the script lends itself more to the basis of 'hip' language, like Kevin Smith if he substituted pop-culture references for rough innuendo and hurt. It's a hit or miss script from a play that may or may not have been better for the stage where it's necessarily a dialog-driven medium. And because of the time lapses and twists and turns given to the characters over the course of however many years pass in the film, it's as much worth to do for the filmmakers as it is a possible liability.<br/><br/>This all being said, Nichols does give all four characters the proper actors for what they're required for. Even the lesser two of the four (from my point of view), Roberts and Law, have little fascinating moments amid their shallow and flawed sides (and this is from someone who can hardly stand most Roberts movies). Owen, meanwhile, is so good and precise and with flair and directness that it does practically impede on the others to keep up with how much he's into his character's cold, reaching psychology. Portman is actually just as good though, and proves once again her stamina for dramatic scenes, and even for the steamier ones; the scene in the strip club between Owen and Portman is probably the best 'sexy' kind of scene the actors and Nichols have been involved with. As all four reach into a revelatory- and if you're looking into it almost obvious- conclusion, one has to admire the depths that are being plunged here, however lacking some of the more darker realities of the world. It's a story of affluent, ranging middle-class types who are far from stupid, but also have some harsh problems with one another when seeming to have what they want. It doesn't have the exemplary power and theatrical grace of a Bergman theatrical drama, but it is a nifty example on its own for those very familiar with the actors. One more thing, the opening and end credits song, for lack of a better word, comes close to killing the mood big time for me. 7.5/10"

","Two utterly beautiful American women (Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman), two good-looking British guys (Clive Owen and Jude Law), a sharp script from the writer of the original play Patrick Marber, the London where I live, and music by Mozart - there is lots to like about this movie. It begins romantically as each of four inter-related liaisons takes off in charged circumstances, most notably an electrifying kiss between the Roberts and Jude characters. But this is a milieu created by director Mike Nichols in which words are weapons, loving is lacerating, and infidelity is inevitable. As one character puts it: ""What's so great about the truth? Try lying for a change - it's the currency of the world"".<br/><br/>For once, at a little over one and a half hours, we have a film that doesn't over-run its course. Over four years, relationships start and finish and we are left to imagine what went in between. The language is as sexually explicit as any mainstream movie that you'll see, but there is virtually no flesh and certainly no sexual activity on display.

Although there are some fairly prominent themes present including the uglier sides of human nature and dysfunctional relationships, I felt that it wasn't a particularly deep film.<br/><br/>I thought the performances were quite good (especially Natalie Portman) but I often felt something was missing from the characters. Although I appreciated the way the film focused on their nastier sides in an uncompromising kind of way, perhaps the characters could have used some more development as responsible adults to contrast against their arguably childish behaviour. Maybe the characters were intended to be as shallow and insecure as they came across but I think without some fundamental redeeming qualities they become less interesting. For example, many of the verbal jabs thrown around seemingly only to cause pain came across as unrealistic for the most part.<br/><br/>To the movie's credit, despite these weaknesses, I always found the characters interesting and the scenes engaging. It just meant I didn't feel Closer was very effective in expressing some kind of deeper meaning. Actually, while watching the movie, I got the impression that it was primarily intended to entertain and just hint a little at some more substantial ideas without actually having the commitment to pursue them.<br/><br/>In this way, Closer works just fine. Some parts are funny, some parts are a bit disturbing or even touching in various ways and most of it is enjoyable to watch. So I thought it was good, quite good, just not great though I don't think it was meant to be."

","This is just an amazing and bruising film. I haven't been affected so much by a piece of art like this since I read Les Liaisons Dangereuses. The film has the same stinging, cynical, and truthful nature. Every line is witty, to the point, and cutting in the worst way (especially those of the caveman of a dermatologist). Every character has an attractive quality to them, but all have disgusting flaws. <br/><br/>Nathalie Portman has finally impressed me, and Julia Roberts gave the best performance of her career, Clive Owen is so intense and animalistic (scary as hell), and Jude Law also gives a good performance.<br/><br/>Definitely not a first date movie or beginning of a relationship movie, because it will make you question everything about your relationship and relationships in general. In my opinion its the movie of the year cause nobody will leave the movie unscathed, and it doesn't underestimate its audience. It's an adult film, unlike all the rest of those ""inspiring"" sappy Oscar contenders out there that are too pretentious and ultimately juvenile."

","""Why is love not enough?"" a tearful Alice (Natalie Portman) asks her boyfriend Dan (Jude Law) at a crucial point in ""Closer.""<br/><br/>Her question is at the crux of Mike Nichols' brutal film about love, lust, lies and the lengths to which human beings go to make themselves happy, even at someone else's expense.<br/><br/>Be warned: If you go to movies to be entertained and feel good about life, ""Closer"" isn't for you. It's not a fluffy romantic comedy, despite starring Portman, Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. It's a disquieting film that frankly and bluntly discusses sex and human relationships. Also, if you believe, say, the execrable ""The Bird Cage"" (1996) was Nichols' finest work, you'd be better off staying away.<br/><br/>""Closer"" recalls Nichols' best work very early in his career, when he made two great movies about relationships - ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (1966) and ""Carnal Knowledge"" (1971). He didn't quite rekindle the same magic in 1986's ""Heartburn."" <br/><br/>This time, he comes closer. The characters in ""Closer"" aren't quite George and Martha, though you can certainly picture Larry (Owen) and Anna (Roberts) turning into Edward Albee's famous wedded pair when they get older.<br/><br/>What makes ""Closer"" absorbing are two terrific performances by Portman and Owen. Law's acceptable. Unfortunately, Roberts is the weak link. She's a pretty woman adept at playing spunky, lighthearted comedic roles. Even her Oscar-winning Erin Brockovich (Laura Linney should have won that year) was more comedic than dramatic. When it comes to drama, however, Roberts can be downright awful. ""Mary Reilly"" (1996), anyone?<br/><br/>Roberts' dramatic range is about as wide as Patrick Swayze's. She runs the gamut of emotions from A to B. In ""Closer,"" she's out of her depth. Whenever she's on screen, you can feel the story sputtering as she struggles with trying to make her role real, something it desperately needs. You see her bland and expressionless Anna - especially during a critical scene with Larry - and wonder how much better actresses with real dramatic talent, say, Cate Blanchett or Natasha Richardson (who played Anna on Broadway), would have been. And how much sharper and more potent ""Closer"" would have been.<br/><br/>Portman, on the other hand, is sensationally good as young Alice. Her two performances this year - in ""Garden State"" and here - might just be enough to wash off the bad taste of the next ""Star Wars"" film, if her stiff turns in ""The Phantom Menace"" (1999) and ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002) are any indication of what to expect.<br/><br/>Her Alice has the ideal amount of charm, perkiness, vulnerability and confidence. She warms our hearts with her giggle, breaks 'em with her tears. This beautiful young actress has one heck of a career ahead of her.<br/><br/>Owen is deliciously smarmy as Larry, a man who simply revels in playing mind games with people, and Law's wimpy enough to be convincing.<br/><br/>""Closer"" isn't so much a love story as a chilling tale about what happens when couples lose their spark, when they start tiring of each other and find new people more attractive. People usually lie to keep the harsh truth from a loved one. Not here. These people tell the truth no matter how hurtful it might be. But they also lie. ""Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off,"" Alice observes. ""But it's more fun if you do.""<br/><br/>These characters aren't being cruel only to be kind; they're being cruel for the sheer pleasure of it. They may not be completely familiar with one another, but they know which buttons to push. And they do it with such glee. Especially Larry, whose final words to Dan don't simply cut to the bone, they saw right through. And the smug expression on Owen's face is priceless.<br/><br/>Patrick Marber's smart script, based on his hit play, often bristles with ferocious honesty. Watching these people prey on each other's vulnerabilities can be painful to watch, yet it's compelling. One particularly candid moment between Larry and Alice stings because neither knows when to stop. That scene would have absolutely sizzled with Blanchett, by the way.<br/><br/>The characters are unsympathetic; yet, rotten as they are, there's something awfully interesting about them. Not everything about ""Closer"" rings true. But there are many more true moments than false. ""Everyone loves a big liar,"" Alice tells Larry, and nothing in society today seems to suggest otherwise. Just take a look at who our elected leaders, pop icons and sports heroes are.<br/><br/>Genuinely adult films are rare these days. So it's refreshing to watch a film that isn't dumbed-down or pandering to the lowest common denominator. As much as romantic-comedies and action-adventure yarns should be made to keep the masses happy, American cinema would be so much the richer if Hollywood made more films like ""Closer."" The film deals with harsh issues bound to unnerve many because much of it looks and feels real."
"kjosm","8","7","13","4 December 2004"," An interesting, oddly-moving movie
","When I went to see Closer last night I wasn't exactly sure what I was in for. I had read a few reviews and knew it was mostly dialogue and that the movie could span months and even years in a few scenes. But the plot looked unique and I love the actors so I drove the extra thirty miles to Salem, the closest theater that had it playing, with a friend of mine to watch it.<br/><br/>I was very impressed. The acting was amazing. I especially loved Natalie Portman's performance. The scene with her and Clive Owen's character in the strip club was really fun to watch; definitely new territory for the actress. She is so gorgeous, too! I have known that, of course, but saw it more in this movie. I love the flawless-ness of her face. (I'm envious!) She did a really good job with her character, and was by far the most intriguing character of the movie. She was mysterious, had lots of moods, and lied much more than you realize at first, even though she really is the only ""victim"" of the movie.<br/><br/>I liked the job Julia Roberts did just because it was so new for her. I thought that her and Jude had great chemistry and it was nice to see her break out of her romantic comedy roles. Jude did wonderfully, as always, although you inevitably hate his character. Clive Owen, whom actually acted in the original play, did a likewise good job at being very unlikeable. <br/><br/>The plot itself was very unique, and although weird at first, I ended up liking it. Especially on the drive home discussing the movie with my friend. I really think its a movie you appreciate more as time goes on. It starts out with the meeting of Jude and Natalie's character and then jumps a year to the next scene where he's written a book using her life (or at least what he thinks his her life) as his inspiration. Here you see him getting his picture taken by Julia's character and they instantly hit it off and start kissing. It's reeling at first, very hard to believe after just watching him fall for Natalie, but once you get into the pace of the movie you stop thinking about stuff like that. The scenes between the characters are so absorbing and their conversations so emotionally charged and shocking that you just live for the moment and the scene in the movie and forget about the fact that you didn't see the relationship lead up to this point.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is out to see something different-as long as they can handle some very sexually explicit language-and anyone who wants to see well-known actors try something incredibly new for them...and do a very good job at it."

This movie should have an X rating, and in my opinion, no one under the age of 21 should be allowed to see it, as it portrays sex at its lowest and most degrading level. Although sex is not portrayed visually (at least in the first half), it is discussed in graphic detail in a manner that I found to be disgusting and completely offensive.

It's the kind of thing that people see so they can go to the next cocktail party and preen themselves on being tres sophistique' as they talk about how searing it all was. Surprisingly, the actor who comes off best is Julia Roberts - she doesn't have to throw any tantrums, and she just gets through it with professional aplomb. All the others are blubberingly sincere, when the only way to deal with such crap is either with cool irony a la Kingsley and Irons in ""Betrayal"" or honest, unsentimental romantic passion like Bardem in ""Segunda piel"". And the dead hand of Mike Nichols turns it into an excruciatingly tasteful TV movie (ah, that chic classical music - Rossini for the oohlala email exchange and Cosi fan tutte wafting through Julia's apartment like the latest fragrance from Guerlain)."

"secondtake","10","5","9","6 September 2010"," A drama through and through--dense, fast, extraordinary, and made cinematic and large
","Closer (2004)<br/><br/>Mike Nichols made clear in his first film, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" (1966) that he was going to make intense, inter-personal films that carried over the best of serious theater and that were photographically cinematic. He's succeeded like few, if any directors, have. And he's a comic actor, a comedian, at heart, which might explain the humanity and laughs that infuse some gripping situations.<br/><br/>""Closer"" is based on a play, and like ""Virginia Woolf"" it has four principle actors whose lives and actions interweave and collide in the most disturbing and believable ways. This core is essential to getting somewhere gutsy. In less than two hours, the nature of this kind of liberal contemporary relationship is plumbed more convincingly that you would think possible. <br/><br/>Not that this is exactly a realistic film. It's too extreme, too perfect, too glitzy, too fast to quite accept as ""true."" But it's convincing the way great drama is, and all four actors, amazingly, rise to the occasion. Clive Owen stands out for his charming and very masculine intensity, and Natalie Portman for her self-destructive and angry neediness, yes. But equally important are Julia Roberts in a role where she uses her simpler complexion to open up to a fragile interior, and Jude Law in a role where his tenderness and lack of inner strength are in the end his undoing.<br/><br/>Everyone here is flawed, and everyone is admirable. And for a movie to make this clear, and to make a workable, fast plot unfold, in such a compact and beautiful way is a marvel. Nichols is really at the top of his form. If the visual tapestry isn't as mind boggling as ""The Graduate"" and if the plot is not as politically savage as some other earlier films (""Silkwood"" and even the flawed ""Catch-22"" are two), it makes up for it by being really tight. There's not a square inch or a bare second wasted here. In fact, the speeding through a year at a time, from one cut to the next, makes you have to pay attention, though the clues are carefully in place.<br/><br/>A masterpiece."

What a film...what a story...and what PERFORMANCES!! The thing that is so amazing about this film is the performances and writing. The actors do a magnificent job of playing these parts that were written to be performed by physically beautiful people. They portray these characters who know, on some level, that they are beautiful, whether they'd admit it or not, and it shows...<br/><br/>Julia Roberts, who I love, gives the performance of a lifetime, in that this is outside of ANYTHING that she has ever done. She is so human in this role that it cracks you up to see her play with the character of Dan, and then it breaks your heart to see her admit her faults to Larry. What a performance!! <br/><br/>Jude Law's Dan is like so many other silently conceited men in the world. He is basically saying, ""I'm not confident...even though I'm leaving this gorgeous woman who needs me for another gorgeous woman who doesn't, knowing that if the new one doesn't work out, I can always have the other one back who is completely infatuated with me."" This is why he cannot wrap his brain around losing her in the end. He does this so well. What a performance!! <br/><br/>Clive Owen is just....MY GOSH....he is so sexy and hateful and gritty and nasty.....and I LOVE IT!!! His Oscar nomination was so well deserved. Everything down to his sly smile and posture was perfect. What a performance!! <br/><br/>How can I accurately describe Natalie Portman in this film? She was so deliciously good and SEXY in this film that you could just poor gravy all over her and sop her up with a biscuit........and that's coming from a gay man. I came out of theatre after seeing this a knew that if anyone was getting an Oscar nomination, it was her. Her Alice is so honestly and beautifully longing for realness and terrified of it at the same time. Seeing her in this made me realize that this will only be the first in a slew of awards and nominations throughout her career. What a performance!! <br/><br/>I actually saw the stage play of ""Closer"" last week and didn't realize that Alice gets hit by a car in New York and dies in the end. The movie somewhat hints at this in the end when she walks right into the street while the ""Don't Walk"" sign is lit, but it's VERY subtle... At any rate the play didn't do much for me... All in all, a fantastic film with brilliant performances. Definitely a love story for adults."
"dockarla","Null","5","9","7 December 2004"," Well worth it
","Closer is a great movie. At first, I thought that it wasn't very realistic, but, after thinking about it I realized I was wrong. <br/><br/>These characters may seem unrealistic to many, but what I see is a movie whose characters ACT on their thoughts, emotions, and feelings (even if they are wrong, selfish, or confusing). Most couples have similar adulterous emotions / thoughts while involved with someone, but many do not act on them, and therefore, still are potentially deceiving themselves and the one they are with.<br/><br/>The movie is not meant to entertain or show you character's motivations, thought processes, or development. The movie attempts to show you the result of actions, and how raw the emotions can be.... 'Developing' characters more or showing their 'reasoning' for actions would detract from the message of the movie. <br/><br/>Love bites. What is real in love? Is it real? What makes it end? What makes it spark? How does it last? Why do we doubt what we have? Why do we throw love away? Why do we take love for granted? And, why does everything about a person seem like a lie when they deceive you about love?<br/><br/>The movie demonstrates the result of the many things that are never said (about love) to each other when dating, courting, or married. Things we try to hide or bury. Doubt, regret, selfish needs, obsessions, unhappiness, sexual desires, weaknesses, greed, etc. The movie is honest, and so it is shockingly good.<br/><br/>The characters demonstrate selfish needs without regard to others. Love without intimacy, and intimacy without love. Lies, deceit, manipulation, and games all from people who think they know what they want but don't.... and who think they are playing others, yet are only playing themselves. In the process they show a lack of respect for others and themselves. None of the characters are honest, but all try to achieve fulfillment of their perceived needs, including Alice. Most posts claim Alice as the most 'innocent', which the movie clearly demonstrates she is not. In fact, Alice may be the scariest character, as she is easily able to divide her psyche to adapt and cope to her world to fulfill her needs.<br/><br/>The truth hurts. I see individuals and couples behaving(and thinking) in these ways all the time. Sometimes outwardly, sometimes with subtlety. Either way, whether a person acts out on these emotions is irrelevant.....the result is the same, and can have damaging effects to a relationship. <br/><br/>This is our society, and if one can't see this, you are either blinded by the romantic mythology of happily-ever-after Hollywood marketing or have your eyes shut to what is real (and hidden) in relationships.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie worth seeing."

Her acting is great, and in my opinion,she is one of the biggest reasons to this movie make success. Her role as a stripper really is different when you remember her in the role as Queen Amidala. (Star Wars) I also was surprised with Clive Owen. I mean, I didn't like his roles in KING ARTHUR and SIN CITY, and I never thought him as a great actor; but in this movie, he is pretty convincing as doctor Larry,and his moments of tension or despair looks real."

Anna (Julia Roberts) is a photographer, she is decisive, intelligent and beautiful and finally Larry (Clive Owen) a doctor, brilliant and successful.<br/><br/>Four different characters, none of which are quite what they seem, as their individual relationships grow, so do their inner most desires to get what they want.<br/><br/>Wonderfully directed by Mike Nichols, and with truly outstanding performances from all of the cast, Closer is in a class with films like 'American Beauty'.<br/><br/>Almost entirely character driven, Closer is not for the casual viewer, the story gradually moves along, unfolding the characters backgrounds and emotions, cleverly weaving in some twists and shocks.<br/><br/>Compelling, uncompromising, sexy, dramatic and at times tragic.

The ending of the movie made Julia Roberts look like a wuss and I have no idea what Natalie Portman's deal is. I guess the director wants us guessing on that one.

"Galina_movie_fan","5","4","7","19 May 2005"," I don't want to get closer or why did not they ask Helen?
","My three favorite films from last year ""Sideways"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", and ""Before Sunset"" have a lot in common; they all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances. <br/><br/>There are more similarities in three my favorite films  they all have characters I liked, I care about; often, weak and certainly not perfect; sometimes, confused and immature but sympathetic, and real. <br/><br/>This is not the case with ""Closer"". My problem is that none of its four main characters was at least slightly interesting, appealing, likable or just realistic. And it is not the biggest problem that they were not likable  I can live with that and still love and enjoy the film. Examples  Nichols's own fascinating debut, ""Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf"". George and Martha (Liz Taylor and Richard Burton) were a couple from hell but like a theme song in ""Closer"" goes, ""I could not take my eyes off them"". I still remember Taylor saying in the end of the film, ""George and Martha: Sad, sad, sad"" and it was sad. I'd learned something about the characters that were deep and complex, troubled and disturbed. They were persons, the human beings, not the caricatures. Another example, Ingmar Bergman's ""Scenes from the marriage"":<br/><br/>""Bergman and his leading actors Liv Ullmann and Arland Josephson give one of the most truthful, honest, heartbreaking and credible portraits of a couple, one of the most intense character studies ever done on film. For five hours, we share twenty years from the lives of Johan and Marianne as well as their love, hate, misunderstandings, insecurities, anger, jealousy, denial, sadness, pain, despair, and loss. We witness the moments of incredible tenderness and unexpected and shocking violence, both physical and mental. There are no depth that they have not descended in the search of themselves and the meaning of their relationship.""<br/><br/>As far as a film about the selfish, self-obsessed, unsympathetic characters goes, ""Faithless"", directed by Liv Ullmann and written by Ingmar Bergman could be the most similar in its theme to ""Closer"" and they both have almost identical twist plot toward the end. The difference is huge, though. ""Faithless"" has a high and unbearable tragedy that characters brought upon themselves, ""Closer"" is smug, full of itself and tries to hide its emptiness behind often disgusting and unnecessary dirty language. Did I learn something about four beautiful people in ""Closer""? Sure. Dan's sperm tastes like Larry's but sweeter; Alice's c*** tastes like heaven, and Anna does not kiss strange men and does not understand why sex is so important. I don't want to get closer to learn all this; instead, I'd like to respond like Helen Sinclair, ""No, no, don't speak. Don't speak. Please don't speak. Please don't speak. No. No. No. Go. Go Don't speak.""<br/><br/>Enormously talented and famous (and rightly so) Mike Nichols made an elegantly looking, well acted (Natalie Portman and Clive Owen are very good) and quite amusing film which is a screen adaptation of a popular play of the same title. Popular or not, the play was not a great work of writing and its problems are very obvious after adaptation to the big screen."

","Here we have a house built of sexual envy, unfettered passion, deception, longing, betrayal, hatred . . . insert your own cliché. But in bringing these bricks to the building site, writer Patrick Marber has forgotten one crucial thing . . . his architectural drawing. In other words, Closer is a rickety edifice permanently on the point of collapse.<br/><br/>Marber is not helped in his task by two of the most woeful pieces of miscasting in mainstream cinema history. Yes, I'm talking about the two 'big names'.<br/><br/>Jude Law is execrable as newspaper obituary writer Dan. His character is supposed to be enigmatic, artistic, a romantic. What we actually get is an utterly unbelievable, two-dimensional fallacy. At no point does the viewer engage with his persona, such as it is. One never feels sympathy, empathy or even antipathy, simply a numb disbelief that he is here at all. Law is not just wooden, he's cardboard.<br/><br/>And if he's cardboard, Julia Roberts playing Anna (a kind of glammier Annie Leibovitz transplanted to London) is overstretched rubber. As a femme fatale, she makes a great candlestick. For her, acting is a business; a by-numbers routine in which the only digits she seems to care about are the ones on her pay cheque.<br/><br/>So, half the main cast might just as well not have turned up. Which is a shame, because the other two have something of the superb about them. Natalie Portman as the stripper Alice is more than mere eye candy; she has a naturalness seldom seen on the big screen (even if the lap dancing scenes jar).<br/><br/>But far and away the best performance comes from Clive Owen. It is in his character, Larry, that Marber comes closest to achieving his goal of bridging the gap between entertainment and philosophical contemplation. Larry is a feral, animalistic, dermatologist for whom love is really only skin deep. Through his predilections and tastes, he proves that as a species, we are deluding ourselves if we think human beings are anything more than a series of sensation-seeking interconnected orifices.<br/><br/>If anything, Owen is too good for this film. We are meant to be appalled by him, to be repulsed by his base desires. But it is such a relief when he is on screen, that all his character's sins are forgiven."

","I went to see Closer with two of my friends and both of them said they hated it cause it was too depressing, which was the whole point of the movie. People are really bashing this movie cause it's about sex, betrayal and other stuff that's not exactly moral. But the movie isn't preaching morals to anyone nor is it saying that adultery is OK. In the film, adultery is portrayed as something that comes with severe consequences and certainly doesn't promote anything- it's just depicting one situation in which these themes are involved.<br/><br/>The acting is great all around, especially Natalie Portman (I almost forgave the Star Wars movies) and Clive Owen (I almost forgave King Arthur). Julia is OK- she's never been my favorite but she's decent here. Saying this as a fan of Jude Law, I think his performance here is completely overshadowed by Owen and Portman. It's still good but not as good as we've seen him before (primarily Talented Mr. Ripley and Road to Perdition). He seems to do so much better in supporting roles for whatever reason."

People who go through this much emotional trouble don't talk as wise and philosophical, SO smart. On a large screen, where the images should count more, it's even worse. But hey, Julia, Jude, Nathalie and Owen are nice to look at, and I got the ticket for free, so what the heck, and they are certainly good enough actors. But other than that it's a movie where I felt like a wise guy was trying to teach me a little bit too much."

","Closer (Spoilers) Clive Owen, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman turn in great performances in this silver screen soap opera. Those performances are perhaps the one upside of this film. They each play deceptive lovers who never change and never arouse emotion for the viewer. They are, put simply, unlikable characters. This, however, is precisely the point. We are not supposed to like these characters, however we begin not liking them and we end not liking them.<br/><br/>The writing is very good in this film, however, the story is not. There are far too many aspects to suggest how deceptive these characters are. They go back and forth between lovers not one too many, but just way too many times. Its a simple conflict that we are forced to endure several times throughout the film. Natalie Portman's character has a different look all the time, not to mention her fake name, suggesting once again, that she is a liar. (As if we didn't already know that about her from the rest of the film) I hate to suggest that this film is an excuse for beautiful people to talk dirty to each other but it seems that 2/3s of the film is just that. While we never see any of the sex that goes on, we hear plenty about it.<br/><br/>The relationships in this movie are so clearly love/hate. This could have been very easily taken in the right direction, which may have been that they all want the same thing but can't get it because of their lies, however it skews in so many other directions along the way that it is simply a mess.<br/><br/>It is not a bad film, in other words, I was never tempted to walk out. It was entertaining enough to keep me there to the end, however when the end came I was not rewarded. There are no redeeming values, not character changes and no conflicts other than the one presented to us over and over again.<br/><br/>2/5"

"rosscinema","8","4","7","12 December 2004"," Scathing look at two couples
","This is one of those films that will undoubtedly make casual viewers feel uncomfortable and I think the reason for that is that the script depicts it's characters baring they're basic self in a manner that isn't contrived. Story takes place in London where we first see an obituary writer named Dan (Jude Law) meet a young and pretty American girl named Alice (Natalie Portman) who's a stripper from New York and they end up having a relationship that inspires him to write a book. While Dan is getting his picture taken he starts to flirt with the photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) who is attracted to him but she meets Alice who instantly notices the attraction between them.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>After living together for a year Dan tells Alice that he has been having an affair with Anna and that they are breaking up. Meanwhile, Anna explains the same thing to her husband Larry (Clive Owen) who forces her to tell him their intimate details in an explosive confrontation. Things get complicated over the next few years as Larry finds Alice working in some strip joint and keeps wanting her to tell the truth about who she really is and Anna who stuns Dan by getting back with her husband. Larry tells him that he should get back with Alice because she really loves him but before he leaves he tells Dan that he also slept with her.<br/><br/>This film is directed by the great Mike Nichols who has tread on material like this before with ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and ""Carnal Knowledge"" but the script here by Patrick Marber is definitely a darker look at relationships. Marber's script is from his play and like other character studies this film is chock full of brutal honesty in the dialog. The actors are up to the task and while some may think Roberts is slightly miscast I found her more than holding her own and reminding us that she should be considered for more than just romantic comedies. While Law is on screen for the majority of the time (and is very good) the performances that standout come from Owen and Portman. Owen's character not only has a dark side but is always within a word or two of being verbally abusive which is in contrast to what critics usually say about him. As an actor, Owen has been called anything from brooding to complacent but here he's nothing short of explosive and it's a performance that should raise some eyebrows. Over the past few years Portman has matured as an actress right before our eyes and this role should forever keep anyone from considering her in anything but adult parts. She's a revelation here and Portman displays so many layers to her character that when we find out the secret at the end of the film we feel overcome as we remember some of the previous scenes. This is a dark and angry film about four characters that like to boast about being honest but the one thing that they don't boast about is they're own selfishness when it comes to relationships. It would be easy to dismiss this film because the characters are so unlikable but for me this is the type of film that should be considered the norm. With strong performances and the unabashed portrait of self loathing this is a film that doesn't care what others think and dares you to take a look."

","I liked CLOSER a lot more than I expected - I had friends who had seen the popular play in London (it later transfered over to Broadway and did okay in NY - but a much bigger hit in London)- my friends said it was well-written but a little overwrought for their tastes. So I had rather low expectations and I was very impressed with the performances of the four leads - they ALL have their moments - real quiet, REAL moments but Clive Owen and Natalie Portman hit it out of the park. Clive Owen is brilliant in the indie film CROUPIER, did nice work in GOSFORD PARK and continues to grow into a powerful film actor. He is amazing in this film and Portman follows up her solid work in this year's GARDEN STATE with a delicate, emotional performance as a little ""girl lost"" in London who falls madly in love with Jude Law. Law and Roberts also do fine work and even though the screenplay is full of ""written"" back and forth, snappy dialogue and rather cruel putdowns - the whole thing moves at a brisk pace under the steady hand of master director Nichols. An adult movie about jealousy, insecurity and fear - not everyone's cup of tea but if you feel like watching a mature film about troubled relationships - check it out."
"candlemaker","4","7","15","12 February 2005"," words and actors fail me
","A few home truths... Jude Law is inept at drama. He does not pull it off. Never has. Weak in Cold Mountain, very weak in this. In Alfie he was OK in the cheeky moments but the instant he had to show emotion, absolute zero! Julia Roberts is better than she has been for the majority of her career but still lacks the gravitas that someone like Julianne Moore or Nicole Kidman would've brought to the role. Clive Owen is very good but not worthy of winning the Oscar, whereas Natalie Portman excels (and will definitely walk away the Academy Award) following up her excellent performance in Garden State with another polished turn.<br/><br/>As a film, Closer remains a dull, pretentious and extremely fake film. Roberts' character would never fall for the loutish Owen, or indeed the spineless Law. The way Roberts and Owen meet is so implausible you can hear the audience groan. And Nicholls directs with little more flair than 'point & shoot' with his actors failing to command your attention."

I found it, the language used, to be unrealistic several times. Most women I know would not act or react in the ways the characters did. <br/><br/>It was plain vulgar at times. I'm no prude, but I found myself squirming in my seat at times and feeling it was totally unnecessary for the script/actors to be portrayed this way. It was vulgar and there was no real story that I could see, and what there was, was unlikely and unbelievable. Why would anyone stay with or even marry or go back to Larry (Clive Owen) who Anna (Julia Roberts) married in it? Eeeeewwwww, gross horrible character - and I didn't really like his ""acting"".

","If all films were like Closer, I'd never go to the movies again. As it is, it's a film adaptation of Patrick Marber's play, and this is the type of play that gives theatre a bad name. Marber writes in a style that ""serious philosophers"" will probably find very deep, but I couldn't stand it. I don't think talking about sexual details with total strangers is deep. I don't think it's deep to assert the idea that technology which is supposed to bring us ""closer"" actually distances us so much so that two men could accidentally have cyber-sex without knowing the gender on the other side of the screen.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman are the key players in the film, each torn between two lovers. Anyone who is past their teens knows sex isn't the way to get to know a person, but in this film, the characters think jumping into bed or having extremely frank, inappropriate discussions about sex means they're getting ""closer"". It's not deep, it's not interesting, and it's not even well-acted. Clive and Natalie were nominated for Supporting Oscars, but I don't know why. Natalie prances around a stripper pole in a pink wig and a thong, so I can only imagine members of the Academy were distracted. I don't think showing nudity means the same thing as showing talent, but time and time again the Academy nominates women for baring their bodies.<br/><br/>Teenaged boys will probably love this movie.

Mike Nichol's study of the complexity of relationships features four of the most unappealing characters to ever appear in one film; great to look at maybe, but still unappealing. They lie and cheat to those they care about and, although that maybe the point, I guess I'm an old romantic at heart and spending 104 minutes watching people betray those they are meant to love is just not my bag. If I wanted to spend that long seeing how much idiots can hurt each other, then I'd watch Jackass The Movie.<br/><br/>However, it must be said that the talented leads (Jude Law, Ms. Portman, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen) are extremely good in convincingly portraying the four screw-ups destined to never be content with their lot, and if morose drama is your cup of tea, then I guess you'll love this movie."

Two drawling Yankee stars in London who ask each other where the ""loo"" is! How charming! We'll overlook Marber's utterly blatant device of disguising his ignorance by making one of them a ""waif"" so secretive (or vacuous) that she has no background at all, while the other is a ""photographer"" ---- need one say more? Or, for that matter, less? Marber, like Noel Coward, must be one of those men who ""love their privacy"" and write dirty about women, just as Noel Coward did, so very successfully in the 1920s, then went on to star in stiff-upper lipped anti-camp war movies. Talk about discipline, dear! War is relevant, because Marber accepted an award for his play from the London Evening Standard newspaper, which only a couple of years later was faking its front-page to make it look as if a huge crowd had cheered the demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad, instead of a rag-tag group of stooges admitted by watching U.S. Marines psy-ops men. That when he was 25 Marber contributed to sketches by progressive comedian Rory Bremner and by the time he was 35 was composing this theatrical contrivance says everything about passing 30 and remaining trustworthy. Let's end this by listing just a few of the ways Marber demonstrates his utter ignorance of how an American woman works: 1. When she is knocked unconscious in the street by a passing car, she wakes up, smiles, and says: ""Hello, stranger"". 2. Although she works in a strip joint, and knows only his first name and entrance to his place of work a world away in Canary Wharf, she moves in with him. 2. Although she is a top professional photographer, she takes pictures of an unknown author for his first novel (that is the most ridiculous idea of all). 2 a. At his behest, she starts necking with him. 3. When she meets another American woman, a rival for her man, she inquires: ""Where's the loo?"" although she has just arrived in England. 4. She never speaks about herself. 5.

The director should have chosen unknowns for these parts.<br/><br/>If you want to see stories about relationship breakups, I suggest you try Annie Hall or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. These are films where the actors actually demonstrate why they are together in the first place and it mixes comedy *with* tragedy. Edward Albee does the same. Closer just shows shouting matches and pouting and lots of pauses that last forever.<br/><br/>These strange creatures from Closer shout at each other for hours and I couldn't listen anymore."

","This is the worst movie ever. Beginning looked promising, but quickly deteriorated into vulgarity and coarseness. Four vacuous characters who have no morals and obviously no conscience and who can't distinguish between right and wrong. Couldn't develop even an iota of empathy for any of the characters and couldn't wait to get out of the theatre so they can carry on their meaningless, ridiculous lives without me. And if every sentence contains the F-word, then I guess you really don't need a script. This is one DVD I won't be buying upon release. Four great actors wasted on a sub-standard plot and vile language and situations. Shame on you, Mike Nichols."
"ben_taylor","1","5","10","6 February 2005"," Worst film for some time...
","Bad film.<br/><br/>Superb opening 30 seconds - Damien Rice song fits the middle-class middle-browness perfectly, good acting as the two attractive leads walk towards each other.<br/><br/>Only spoilt when the dialogue starts. Truly some of the worst dialogue in movie history (after that scene in Gladiator when he talks about the afterlife. And that scene in Gladiator when he talks about being imprisoned, being free etc. And a few other bids in Gladiator). Possibly the worst scene of many is the one in the strip club. Don't even ask.<br/><br/>Jude Law is quite good in the first segment - actually acting, bit normal, bit nerdy, bit English. Then the first of several jump cuts which go too far and leave too much inexplicable, and suddenly he's - well, jude law.<br/><br/>This is one of those films set in a London where everyone lives in big central apartments next to landmark buildings and stations, where all the cabs are black, arrive the instant you lift your arm, and are all driven by cock-er-neys.<br/><br/>Perhaps its their attractiveness (though the woman off star wars is surprisingly unattractive, perhaps their stilted, affected rendering of bad dialog, perhaps their rich, amoral, pointless lifestyles (as unbelievable as the characters), but you just don't give a f uck who they fuc k. And as a series of unlikely co-incidences completes their merry-go-round of sole-less affairs, everything seems terribly unimportant, roughly to the extent They Are Saying Important And Coolly, Cruelly Ironic Things to each other in Big Fu cking Sharp Capitals.<br/><br/>Oh, and you get the Damien Rice again at the end (this will do for him what being sung by Kathy Burke at the end of This Year's Love didn't do for David Gray - though that's a better film to watch if you want the same kind of scenarios just a bit more human) - and a stupid sub-twist that makes you want to throttle the director in the same way the lame ending of Blair Witch did. The point is the same -a twist (or 'surprise' since this doesn't actually qualify) for its own sake just destroys the suspension of disbelief and devalues the entire attempt to generate a reaction, an experience, from or for the audience - its just that Blair Witch did at least manage to manipulate you along the way.<br/><br/>Under-stylised or over-stylised, this could have been better if they made it really unbelievable (perhaps set in the 80s, its spiritual home), or if they made it slightly real - but either way, plot and script would have to change.<br/><br/>Two names to remember - Mike Nichols, Patrick Marker. Avoid at all costs.<br/><br/>The amusing thing is I actually saw the play, and disliked it almost as much for pretty similar reasons. I only watched this because we thought it was a bit much to pay £8 each for Meet the Fokkers, and I got it confused with Sideways - two films with single-word adjective titles, y'see.<br/><br/>Wish I'd walked out - at least that would have had some style."

","Dear ones, I went to see this movie with great expectations,mostly because of the household names and the director also.I was looking for two hours of good entertainment. What a foul surprise! The movie Closer has nothing to do with love,it is only closer to a obscene, pornographic dialog,that starts from the beginning between the very acclaimed actor Jude Law who after this movie should change his name to Jude LOW also the other actor genius that performed this filth. Director Mike Nicols must not know what love is. This is sad for someone who suppose to know good artistic qualities in all different kind of roles to be so in bad taste.The behavior in this movie is of a BORDELO standard. I guess a lot of the celebrities in Hollywood,actors and others will compromise and cheapen themselves for the ALMIGHTY DOLLAR. Talking about values!!! If I was Julia,Jude, established actors, I would never accepted to be a part of such production,full of promiscuity,vulgarism,adultery,foul language etc.It is shameful. There is a place and time for everything.The big screens of the theaters are for the public of all ages, no matter who they are.What is the example that you portray ? I am glad I went alone to this movie, so I only embarrassed myself, and stayed to see how far you guys will push this so called art ? Did Hollywood went nuts? Do not understand me wrong. I am a normal person with natural healthy desires, but I do not respect the low class material in this movie that is so bad you have to reach up to hit bottom. How can you nominate movies like this?.Also the Fockers.? Just a comment: It is only normal for your standards,I guess to sabotage Mel Gibson and Jim Caviezel.Even if you don't share the message, from the artistic point of view, you know that the acting and directing was and is more brilliant then all the movies this year and it will be forever. Youcan not blind the people or insult their intelligence. We are not that ignorant as you may think.It seems that you are the ones who do not feel the pulse of the people.

","I am shocked how many people actually seem to like this film, especially those that usually adhere to serious films, rather than crap movies. I normally can be found agreeing with the serious critics but THIS WAS PAINFULLY BAD!!! 1) not credible, the events are edited in such ""out of sync style"" that the rapid changes felt completely unrealistic. Worse still, the acting did nothing to bridge the tough script...example, first encounter between Roberts and Law..nothing happening and suddenly they are kissing...right! 2) acting, Owen, what is going on with this guy. Very painful to watch. Serious case of overacting. Should be in a 1,000+ theatre, not 10 inches in front of a camera.<br/><br/>3) Nice camera shots, yes, but poorly integrated style, with rest of movie which has a sort of gritty street touch..<br/><br/>4) editing, crap!! check out the scene in the bus between porter and law, feels very off...just like the sound btw.<br/><br/>PAID 10,50 UK pounds: this is almost 20 USD in a top cinema in London (so the sound and images should have been excellent).

Again looks paid a big part in the casting of Alice, but for goodness sake, beautiful faces are not enough, why was there such angst from this character. We might have got there in the end, but I can only take so much squirming in my seat and this movie is so bad it should have been put out of its misery before production got under way.<br/><br/>Trite, formulaic, done before and better.

","Closer has all of the ingredients to be a fantastic film; however, it failed miserably. It entices the movie-goer, or in my case a film historian, with a story about love, loss, deception, and intrigue plus the chance to enjoy such powerhouse acting as Roberts, Law, Portman, and Owen. My enjoyment was quickly replaced with disgust and embarrassment. This is not an artful movie but simply smut. Instead of uplifting the individual viewer or providing insightful commentary into this love quadrangle, Closer decided to bombard us with verbal pornography, disgusting situations, and cheapened scenes. When is it fantastic or fabulous to use each disgusting slang term for genitals, sexual experiences, or situations? This film was degrading to everyone who was a part of the production and most importantly to the individual viewer. This movie deserves no further recognition by me or by any academy."

The last movie that did that to me was American Beauty. This is one of the best character studies I have seen.

","Although I was comPLETEly engrossed in the drama between these characters (on the edge of my seat even!), I have to say one of my friends totally passed out in the movie theater--clearly, this movie is not for everyone.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" almost seemed like a French movie in English: it is dialogue-driven, with complex characters and relationships. The viewer is not spoon-fed a storyline, and watching it does require some intellectual participation.<br/><br/>I suspect many of the negative reviews were the result of unmet expectation--this is not lighthearted romantic fare, nor is it thinly-disguised softcore porn in the form of a Hollywood movie. That being said, I am truly surprised at all comments from viewers horrified by the 'dirty language.' There is a LOT more disputable things in Hollywood these days (heads blown off, gratuitous sex scenes) than a few naughty words. It's really nothing you've never heard before (come on), and I found the lewdness to be necessary and real, and not inserted just for shock value.<br/><br/>At times the banter between the characters had a stage-play feel to it, making ""Closer"" a stylized version of reality, but the acting was just about always superb. Even if none of your relationships have ever been so deceptive and twisted, you will DEFINITELY find some aspects of the relationships in ""Closer"" applicable to your own experiences, and you will leave the movie with a lot to think about.<br/><br/>If you read the user comments, it seems like people either loved or hated this film. I think that any film that elicits such a wide range of passionate response is worth seeing."
"FilmSnobby","3","5","10","5 December 2004"," Old, familiar ground.
","Mike Nichols clearly felt that it was time to remind people that relationships between men and women are still sadistic affairs. Based on a stage play, his new film *Closer* goes back to the halcyon days of the director's own *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?* and especially *Carnal Knowledge*. The results are not quite as bracing, though credit must be given to any director who dares to ATTEMPT to discuss sexual relationships with honesty. Watching *Closer* reveals just how much Hollywood has babied us recently, with one schoolgirl's romantic fantasy following upon another. Indeed, at the showing I attended, three ladies in front of me got up and left during the scene early on when Jude Law (posing as a girl) and Clive Owen engage in dirty chat on the Internet. ""Definitely NOT what I expected,"" one of the women murmured as they rose to leave. Those expecting a chick-flick are well warned to save your important dollars.<br/><br/>However, let me also warn away cineastes expecting challenging cinema. *Closer* treads upon well-worn paths, paths not merely blazed by this director. Bottom line? If you're familiar with the two Nichols films mentioned above, *L'Avventura* and *La Notte* by Antonioni, *La Dolce Vita* by Fellini, *Hiroshima, Mon Amour* by Resnais, and even *Eyes Wide Shut* by Kubrick, and on and on and on, *Closer* will be something of a chore to sit through. It's the curse of being an experienced movie-watcher:<br/><br/>one's patience wears thinner and thinner when presented with familiar material, no matter how potentially explosive that material might be.<br/><br/>The movie is a negative chamber-drama that shows us the basic incompatibility of men and women. Two British men in London meet two American women -- basically by accident -- and fall in love with them. Utilizing a curious (and pretty successful) narrative structure that skips over lengthy gaps of time in order to jump to the next crisis, Nichols orchestrates a series of infidelities, recriminations, soul-baring monologues reminiscent of Mamet, and escalating power-plays in a game of sexual one-upsmanship. Jude Law abandons Natalie Portman for Julia Roberts, who is married to Clive Owen, who in turn goes after Natalie Portman, who . . . you get the idea. In order to avoid making all of this seem like a commedia dell'arte farce, Nichols makes sure that all of the potty-mouth dialog from the play remains intact in the movie. What makes it High Drama, presumably, is that they tend to either shout or weep when declaiming their urbane obscenities.<br/><br/>All in all, I believe that Nichols isn't ""re-making"" his older films so much as he's responding to Stanley Kubrick's final film. In *Eyes Wide Shut*, Kubrick thought he could blow the lid off sex for a mainstream audience by presenting it with two Hollywood Superstars and showing the actual sex in a baroque, explicit manner -- but his dialog was its usual clinical, Kubrickian self: dry as dust. Nichols, with the same goal in mind, tries to achieve it in the direct reverse of Kubrick: not a single sex scene, but with oodles and oodles of graphic sex chat. The result is much the same: mannered and pretentious. Maybe this is because the Sexual Revolution happened 40 years ago, and the purveyors of this sort of material need to be of the New Generation: artists like Neil LaBute and Todd Solondz, artists who do not remember the old sexual repression and thus have a more modern, relevant take on today's sexual mores.<br/><br/>Nichols' direction is unobtrusive, as expected, which allows us to focus on the characters . . . but even so, the script is overly dependent on the individual actors to carry a sense of identity across. The two successful ones in this regard are clearly Clive Owen and Julia Roberts, perhaps because they're a bit older, a bit less pretty, and a bit world-wearier. Owen, who appears to have actually originated Jude Law's character on the London stage, tears into the part of Larry like a wolf going after a raw cutlet. Owen strides across the screen in a fury, revealing a nastiness that was not evident to us before. His Larry, with his addiction to pornography, whores, and strip clubs, is an angry misogynist and incipient rapist straight out of the LaBute pantheon. This guy could be the love-child of Jack Nicholson from *Carnal Knowledge*. The biggest SURPRISE would have to be Julia Roberts' portrayal of Anna, the woman whom Larry eventually marries. Nichols absolutely reins in Roberts -- she doesn't flash that megawatt smile even once. It's a depressed, shrinking, cringing role that requires the world's most famous actress to totally sublimate her considerable ego. Roberts pulls it off. Perhaps the fact that she's pushing 40 -- no longer the ""pretty woman"" -- helped in this regard. As for Law and Portman: Law doesn't quite break through as Dan, though I regard this as the fault of the character as written. Law can be brilliant, but he needs a strongly written role (for instance, he made a curiously stronger impact in *I Heart Huckabees* -- a mediocre movie, but Law's role was a cinch). Portman is in over her ahead amongst all the adults, and it certainly doesn't help that her character is that most laughable of clichÃ©s currently favored by recent male writers: the Sensitive Stripper.<br/><br/>*Closer* gets 3 stars out of 10 for the initiated; perhaps up to 5 for the novices."

""What was Mike Nichols thinking?""<br/><br/>One of my least-favorite plot mechanisms in books or movies is what I call the ""never-ending downward spiral of misery, ending without hope"".

Neither the plot nor characters were even developed at all - it all sort of ran in a vicious circle. <br/><br/>On the plus side, the actors are beautiful, the film has a slick look, and the theme song is very nice.

It's well made and there are good performances, but I wouldn't'y watch it again if you paid me- it's just not worth it."

","I just don't understand the other comments made about this film. It truly is awful!!! It is up there with the worst films i have witnessed. They are all loathsome vacuous people, which I'm sure is the point. But i have to agree with the critics for once. Maybe I'm missing something. For other awful films watch, Snakes On A Plane and Wolf. Films i know should be about personal choice and if everyone like the same things in this life then it sure would be a boring place and i know you should never ever really trust one persons point of view, be it movies, music or theatre. But due to the freedom of speech, that we kind of have i will stand up and say that this film is an absolute stinker!!! The acting i felt just left me cold right from the beginning and like i have said the characters portrayed were just unpleasant to put it nicely. But saying that, its one of my fiancées favourite films, so what do i know."

","I forced myself to sit through this to find out whether anything of any significance, or that would make any sense, would eventually happen - it didn't. The characterisation was too shallow and the dialogue too glib and full of clichés. The storyline jumped around serving little more purpose than to provide the actors with the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to act out various emotions in a number of set-pieces. This is not a clever or grown up film - some of the acting was good, I must admit - but I do not see that the quality of this movie warranted the number of nominations and awards that it picked up. A pointless way to spend a couple of hours and a definite 1 out of 10 for me!"

","I have just got around to seeing this on DVD, and wished I hadn't bothered. How can such a talented director and cast get it so wrong - apart from choosing an abysmal script, of course? And how can such a dud movie garner so many awards and nominations? Pointless and virtually plot less, this involves four unpleasant and unsympathetic characters spouting unconvincing, crude and - on occasions - unintentionally hilarious dialogue, so bad you wonder whether the writer didn't have some scenes left over from his days working with the deeply unfunny Steve Coogan. Jude Law seems to be playing two different characters. For the first ten minutes he is reasonably OK as a slightly diffident hack journalist, but then changes without rhyme or reason into... well, Jude Law. Clive Owen must be a better actor than he shows here, as a crude doctor with the worst bedside manner you could imagine. And Julia Roberts plays her part as if it was a first-rehearsal read-through for her role in Notting Hill, minus the charm. Only Natalie Portman emerges with anything resembling credit, but again, her character fails to genuinely convince. And a note to the casting director: aren't strippers supposed to have tits? There's a scene in the middle of the movie where Jude Law and Julia Roberts arrive late at the theatre, and decide to have a drink in the bar rather than watch the performance. I know how they feel..."

"gus120970","3","3","5","6 August 2006"," Unbelievably drab
","It's clear from Closer just how drab Americans think we brits are. We live in a drab city, with drab weather, wear drab clothes and have drab, superficial relationships. Closer is like one of Woody Allen's down movies on downers. It's devoid of both wit and emotional intelligibility. I'd go further and say its artfully fake, with the conceit of a big name four-hander cast attempting to wallow in indecipherable emotional intensity for the sake of creating the sheen of an art-house effect. The script reference to an 'Elle Decoration' inspired bathroom is resonant to the entire motivation of the movie - it's relentlessly superficial, watching it is like having a conversation with a model in a New York cocktail bar. Loft apartments, photography exhibitions, arguments at the opera, the damien rice soundtrack: two hours of middle class tedium. Ironically, the film is peppered with endless references to sexual activity, obviously engineered to provoke some kind of polarised reaction from its audience, but there isn't actually any on-screen sex, which, given the billing of the stars might have redeemed some of the entry fee in curiosity value. Clive Owen perhaps deserves some kind of honorable mention as he battles to give some sort of 3-dimensionality to his rather sad sex-obsessed doctor character, and Portman threatens to be interesting on a couple of occasions. However, Law is consistently bland and Roberts, trying to play serious, looks as if she is medicated during most of her scenes. The script and plot is laughable, inexplicable and relies on the simply unacceptable coincidences happening after unsettlingly long gaps of time. The characters do the most bizarre things, justified in terms of emotional cowardice or obsessive love, but having 'done' both of those to some degree in the past, I didn't buy any of their actions or motivations. By the end of the movie, when one combination of the couple has got together/broken up yet again, I was literally begging for the credits to signal the end of my involvement in these dreary fictive lives."
"InvadersMustDie","Null","3","5","22 March 2006"," Best Film Of The Year
","Closer is one of the most underrated movies of 2004. At first I was hesitant of seeing it (I thought it was a ""chick flick""), but I was totally wrong. Closer approaches love, sex, and relationships in a brutal and truthful manner. Many may argue that it isn't realistic, but it is one of the few films that is frank about the topics. I think that the negativity has been revolved around the fact that the movie is and honest portrayal of people. No matter all the pain someone may cause they won't and can't admit that they're a bad person. One of the things that brings this movie to life are its performances.<br/><br/>The movie is about two couples in London that by destiny get together. Alice (Natalie Portman) is run over by a car. Dan (Jude Law) goes and helps her out by getting her to the hospital. There the flirtation starts. Dan writes a book about Alice's life, so he goes to get a picture taken by a photographer named Anna (Julia Roberts). Dan and Anna flirt with each other and end up kissing and having a child-like crush on each other. After that, Dan goes to a chat room to ""have a little fun"". While doing this he meets Larry (Clive Owen) and plays a joke on him (he sends him to The London Aquarium)in which he meets the real Anna. There the movie starts to unfold. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives one of her best performances in her career. Being the youngest nobody really expected her to live up to the role of Alice. Nevertheless, she and Clive Owen stole the show. She does an amazing job of playing a provocative, cheeky, yet innocent stripper. Thanks to this film she proved that she can give a mesmerizing performance. Her portrayal of the needy Alice and the cold-hearted Jane was superb. <br/><br/>Julia Roberts gives a good performance as a depressed Anna. She wasn't bad, yet she wasn't mind-blowing. Most of the audience would have frankly, preferred Cate Blanchett to play her. However, I think that she could've definitely given a better performance.<br/><br/>Clive Owen......... all I can say is WOW. I had seen him in Croupier and King Arthur prior to seeing Closer. I dare to say that his best performance is in Closer. He blew me away...... his brutal portrayal of a cold-hearted Larry a.k.a ""The Caveman"" was exceptional! Not only his delivery of lines, but all of his body language was perfect. He deserved to win the Oscar, but maybe he'll win it in a near future.<br/><br/>Jude Law gave a brilliant performance of Dan. He made him sensible and vulnerable. Yet, he made us sympathize with him even though we couldn't agree with his selfish actions. Yet, none of the characters were ""good"" or ""bad"" since they weren't likable.<br/><br/>In summary, Closer is a brutal and truthful masterpiece about love and people. Mike Nichols directing was superb as so was the script. I would've loved to see the play, but unfortunately it isn't possible. However, the film isn't suited for all audiences (I doubt an 8 year old would understand its message) but many people should somehow relate with the movie's honesty and its new approach to passion, affairs, and love."

I didn't see any chemistry between any of the actors. The bed swapping wasn't realistic. Julia Roberts is getting too old to play these types of parts and I think she was just going through the motions...getting millions for a poor performance.

","Where do I begin? I know. This movie was complete garbage. The acting was mediocre at best, the script appeared to have been written by a 15 year old high school dropout, the movie had no point and worst of all their was no ending. No really there was literally NO ENDING. Someone once said, ""A man without a plan is not a man."" This translates to film making as ""A film without a point is not a film."" That pretty much covers the point that I am so explicitly making. The four characters are supposed to be in love with each other. The writer tries to pound this point home but he forgets one thing. None of the characters have the slightest idea what love is and it is painfully obvious to even the most dimwitted individual. Telling someone ""I love you"" doesn't prove to the audience that they actually feel that way. Yet Jude Law's character tells Julia Robert's character this the first time they meet after 20 minutes together. If you told that to a grown woman the first time you met she would immediately laugh in your face then ask you to leave. I don't care how good looking you are or think you are. I really wonder how this movie got nominated for four Academy Awards but more importantly what possessed these four to sign up for this disastrous bomb? It will not be remembered fondly if remembered at all and a serious film watcher shouldn't watch it once much less twice."

","While I am not inclined to make negative comments, in the interest of those who value their time, I must say that both my wife and I feel we wasted ours with this movie. In the movie at an art gallery, one of the characters comments about how one is not supposed to question the art. Likewise, it seems most reviews here are by the 'art critics' of the movie-going audience. Praise for 'intelligent dialog' and depth seem hollow. This film, like a number of the other highly acclaimed productions that seem more about what is trendy rather than what is substance, seems to exist primarily as a 'teaser'. It is a long, quirky excursion of continual suggestiveness. There are no 'sex scenes' as would be generally referred to, rather, the movie spends a lot of time talking about truth, relationships, and the intimate, specific details of unseen sexual acts repeated for the voyeuristic satisfaction of the two male leads. I'm sure many will want to point to the 'brilliance' of using characters so convinced of their understanding and devotion to the best of relationship values while constantly repeating failure after failure of each of those same values. Perhaps urine in a jar and monkeys throwing paint on canvas does make art--if so, this is your film. If not, don't bother. Society and each of us can, of course, use the benefit of entertainment to reflect us and to reflect on. However, lately that seems to mean find the lowest common denominators, portray that they are both uniform and accurate in describing our worth, and then repeat the same format of failures in a time line that is broken, jumbled and asynchronous and you have what will surely bring Oscar nominations and high praise as another brilliant work of art from Hollywood. And having recently seen ""11:14"" on DVD with Patrick Swayze reduced to mockery of himself, I should guess that Julia Roberts presence in a movie is no longer an indication of quality. But as they say, ""ya pays yer money and ya takes yer chances!"""

There was absolutely no plot or storyline to support the actors. There was no beginning and definitely no ending. It just starts and stops, without any back story. The movie jumps around so much that the viewer has no idea exactly where the story is going. And not to mention the disgusting language and sexual references that are so prominent in the dialogue.

","Well, here's the movie that every man wanted to see because Natalie Portman was supposed to be nude in it, however unbelievable that very idea may seem. Well, she again plays a seemingly innocent sweetheart, although she is a stripper. But this movie is a lot more than that, and thankfully, is actually pretty deep.<br/><br/>The story revolves, quite simply, around four individualstwo American women and two British menwho spend five years revolving around each other creating four distinct little relationships and a helluva lot of personal confusion and drama. The ideas of sex and relationships seem like games to two characters, while the other two seem like pawns in the game. However, this role is reversed at least once per character. Like the now classic ""American Beauty,"" each character is individually explored, and a large amount of depth is shown. Four very distinct personalities appear, and seeing how they interact is entertaining and believable. Overall, it plays a bit like a parable with punishing moments following the many apparently foolish decisions. This is also a first (at least for me), as I've never seen Julia Roberts portray such a sexually conflicted individualon top of which, the film creates a clear mental image of her performing oral sex. <br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>--The writingmany conversations are quick and to the point, but very witty.<br/><br/>--The direction.<br/><br/>--The actingexcellent with very believable characters.<br/><br/>--The humor and drama all appear in equal and comfortable doses, and lets us get to know the characters.<br/><br/>--The depth of the individual characters.<br/><br/>Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help It:<br/><br/>--Good atmosphere & music.<br/><br/>--Good cinematography, the movie, like ""Lost in Translation,"" really feels at times like an independent film.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>--Nothing really, although, as deep as the characters are, at times it seems none of them are what would be called: ""likable.""<br/><br/>The Ugly:<br/><br/>--Is this the end of Natalie Portman's innocence?

"film-critic","9","3","5","29 April 2005"," i can't take my mind off of you...
","Upon first viewing of this film, I wasn't a huge believer. I thought that Clive Owen deserved every accolade that was handed to him. His performance was breathtaking and so full of life that his character was the one to watch for when each scene began. He epitomized the level of good guy and bad guy all into one. So, I was happy with his performance. I was excited to see him playing well with others, but was this a great film? At first, as I said before, I didn't think so, but then I thought about it. This is one of those films that requires you to take a breath and think about the effects long after the final credits have finished rolling. It takes your current relationship and places it right before your eyes. This film will speak to anyone that has been in a relationship or is currently in one. After watching it, you will think about your relationship and the horror will settle in. This film will speak to you, it did me, and it really put into perspective the world of dating and relationships in this modern culture. Nichols has crafted a masterpiece, and while it may not be appreciated as much now, it will remain in our society for a very long time.<br/><br/>I have spoken briefly about the acting, but I would like to say that without a decent crew, this film could not have been as emotional as it was. Julia Roberts turns in a performance that is very unlike her and will disappoint those who are die-hard fans, Natalie Portman proves that she is more than just Star Wars material, and Clive Owen  Oh, Mr. Owen  there could be nobody greater. He controls this film and really takes his career into a new level. I am not ashamed to say this, but I am a huge Clive Owen fan. He does not disappoint in this film. Then there is the snivelly Jude Law. I must say, his performance in this film was the least impressive. He somehow finds himself falling into very similar roles in each film that he picks up. If you have seen Alfie, then you have seen a bit of him in Closer and vise versa. He just isn't as great as he was when he first burst onto the cinematic scene. Perhaps it is because he is wearing thin and cannot create fresh characters  I dunno  but whatever it is, he did not provide anything worth-wile to this film.<br/><br/>So, with the acting strongly in place (sans Law), Nichols tips off the iceberg with some unprecedented cinematography that allows strong storytelling to take place. One of the biggest elements to this film that captured my attention was Nichols ability to allow time to pass with the greatest of ease. I thought at first that this film was going to happen within the course of a couple of days, but he builds a sense of a strong relationship by allowing it to pass over the course of several years. You really get this feeling that these characters are together for a certain period of time and that development is occurring. I never felt as if something suddenly happened, over the course of four years these acts of the heart take a form of their own through the watchful eye of Nichols. It impressed me. Also, Nichols' use of bold white coloring not only expressed the light of relationships, but also brought out the brilliance of each scene. You became focused on certain elements, the purity of the heart, and so forth. It was cinematic history in the making.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to say that this film was nothing of what I expected. Natalie Portman's final scenes were riveting and really brought the rest of this film together. Scenes in this film happened for a reason instead of just a chance to impress the audiences. It was a delight to finally see a movie that came directly from the heart as well as shot to your heart. It will invoke fear and make you appreciate the relationship that you have. I have never experienced a film quite like this before and cannot wait to see what the brilliant mind of Mr. Mike Nichols will bring next to comment about our society and culture. He does have his hand on the pulse of our lives, and Closer proves it.<br/><br/>Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film. I have always been impressed with the work of Mike Nichols' work ever since I first experienced The Graduate and this film was no different. He has this amazing ability of building tension and love together in the same bundle. I remember feeling similar emotions during Closer as I did while watching The Graduate. It is this ability to pull at your heartstrings while still maintaining that sense of realism. I could connect to some portion of this film, and I loved it. I strongly recommend this film, but do not take your gut reaction as the first response. Think about this film, think about yourselves, and then make your decision. It is what I did and somehow this film still remains in my mind weeks after viewing it. I am impressed.<br/><br/>Grade: **** out of *****"
"ceburns-1","10","3","5","11 December 2004"," I knew what to expect and I loved this film
","In my area, this film was described as adult in content--not because it contained material that would be unsuitable for younger viewers, but because it would be wholly uninteresting to them. I knew it would be full of angst and neurosis when I went to the theatre, and perhaps for that reason I was able to enjoy it for what it was.<br/><br/>I feel this film can be summarized as an exploration of the difference between emotional and factual truth. Natalie Portman's character is, where actual facts are concerned, the biggest liar. Yet she announces herself as such. As she says in a scene with Clive Owen, ""Lying is the most fun a girl can have with her clothes on, but it's better if they're off."" She is also the most emotionally truthful and therefore vulnerable, which makes her courageous by comparison to the others. She is the first to learn the truth about her lover's wandering heart, she makes her grief over this known to the other woman, and she continues to love her man anyway. Portman's character is like the Cassandra of this story: she foretells what her lover is thinking and what he will do, even as he denies it, and when she tells the truth to Owen's character, she is not believed. It is as if she sees all the true natures of the other characters most clearly, and yet she throws her heart into a doomed relationship anyway.<br/><br/>Owen plays a self-proclaimed ""caveman"" who is, of all the characters, the most comfortable with his own nature. He is not afraid to win his woman or to exact revenge through brute emotional force. He is the type of manipulator who tells those he manipulates just what he is doing.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts's and Jude Law's characters are, in contrast, completely insecure with themselves, and they are the ones who engage in the most hurtful (and long-term) deception of their lovers.<br/><br/>It is significant that Roberts's and Law's characters each initiate their betrayals on the eve of what could be successful moments in their careers--Law propositions Roberts while she takes his photo for his first novel, after a career spent writing obituaries, and Roberts only succumbs to his advances after a gallery show of her work.<br/><br/>Also significant is that Law's book is based on Portman's life, and one of Roberts's commercially successful photos is of Portman as well. For her part, Portman deems both works a lie.<br/><br/>Ah, the irony. The biggest liar of all can spot all the lies and yet do nothing to extract herself from the painful betrayals to come; the man who was afraid of failure already had found acceptance when he was a nobody; the woman afraid of success attains it in her profession only to sabotage it in her personal life again and again; and the man who is the most honest about his nature becomes the most successful manipulator of all.<br/><br/>I found the movie to be very engaging, and likely to spark a lot of lively discussion afterward. It is not, however, a good film to see on a first date or just after making up with one's lover."
"eisak","Null","3","5","4 December 2004"," POSSIBLE SPOILER: A writing masterpiece
","This movie is a writing masterpiece. It is beautifully directed, the characters are each sympathetic and grotesque at different points without changing their basic personalities, and the audience is jilted by an ending that could be happy - if looked at from the right perspective. This is the ""Catcher in the Rye"" of cinema.<br/><br/>""Closer"" is a movie that demonstrates love in its most selfish and shallow. We are repulsed by every character at some point, but also made to be sympathetic at others.<br/><br/>This demonstrates a side of relationships we often refuse to see - that the idea of ""love"" can be gallivanted around and put on display like the pictures taken by Julia Roberts' character. <br/><br/>One of the greatest moments in the movie is when Natalie Portman speaks with Clive Owen - making the observation that sadness is not something that should be stripped and called ""art"" by the rich. Well, neither is love. It is here where, I would argue, the writer is commenting on the premise of the entire movie.<br/><br/>If anything, this movie should not be taken at face value. We are glad to be reminded that, after all, we aren't trapped in this misperception of love like the characters. We aren't victims of an idea...are we?<br/><br/>If anything, I believe that this movie is about growth. The two most perceptive characters are Clive Owen's and Natalie Portman's. Both understand the other two (Jude Law, Julia Roberts) better than they know themselves. Notice that, in the few times Portman and Owen interact with each other, they are completely honest and direct with each other (despite the disguises to the contrary). It is Law and Roberts who are the children, and can't understand their feelings.<br/><br/>This is going on my shelf of epics.<br/><br/>I read an earlier review that expressed hatred of the fact that the movie incorporates swearing. Swearing, in my mind, is fine as long as it is appropriate to the situation. <br/><br/>(Note: I find that many critics comment on the story premise instead of the execution of the movie. Whether or not the subject matter is ""good"" is purely subjective, however, the quality of writing, direction, and execution is not as easily subjective. Too many people confuse the two. Yes, premise is an important piece, but it isn't necessarily what makes or breaks a movie. Arguably, if a screenplay were written and directed right - we could be entertained by a movie about dog poop.)"

Although rash, Larry's character is the only truly honest person in the entire movie. While the other characters swim to find their true desires Larry never faltered or withheld like the others did (especially Dan (Law)).<br/><br/>Its hard for the viewer to have sympathy for such poorly developed relationships. All we are shown are the milestones each couple experiences and nothing in between. Certain things simply are not plausible when their visual presentation is omitted. The audience has no choice but to believe that Alice (Portman) used to be/is a heroine addict and that Dan went from a hackneyed obituary writer to a published author in just 2 years despite no personality/character changes whatsoever.<br/><br/>The heated dialogue the characters have with each other is the saving grace of the movie. This is the only time the characters seem real to me. As the movie progresses the arguments/conversations get more brutal and more honest, each time more and more truth is revealed.<br/><br/>The final piece is left up to the viewer who decides which character was the most deceptive.

","I couldn't wait to see this movie. Now, I realize I should have waited to see this movie until it could be rented.<br/><br/>This is a very cold film about some very unpleasant people who don't seem to be able to make up their minds about much. I liked the way it was done, I loved the acting, and I loved the use of ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" throughout the film. Yet it left me feeling empty. I never saw the play, but I imagine it was quite powerful. As a film, it had a deadly detachment.<br/><br/>Certainly when one looks at a film like Virginia Woolf, also based on a play, also directed by Mike Nichols, also about some unpleasant people, one wonders why Woolf came off so well and this one didn't (for me, anyway). I think it's because Virginia Woolf is an incredible love story - at the end, when George explains that they're childless, and Martha says ""We couldn't"" [have a baby], one realizes what's underneath all of the unpleasantness. In ""Closer,"" there's just no payoff. Four people change partners, hurt one another, are seemingly incapable of doing anything else, but no one tells us why. Only the Natalie Portman character shows some humanity. But some isn't enough.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols is a fabulous director, but the direction wasn't the problem here. It's the characterizations. I can't agree with some of the other posters that the film was fascinating. I didn't find it so. The theater was packed because of good reviews. I suppose the critics are hungry for something intelligent, and obviously the ticket-buying audience is, and who can blame them? But don't tell me this is the best you can come up with. When everybody walks out of the theater complaining, as they did after the showing I attended, there's a problem."

I went in not to see Natalie Portman topless or hear about Jude Law in bed (both of those come up and you're only going to see Natalie's back). Oh no, I went for some serious tension acting. What I saw was bastards. It almost seems like director Mike Nichols just spent millions to re-tell a story that happened to him, just to draw out all the guilty parties involved. I mean, where is the love? Two of the characters get married, and we don't see any of their lives between a conflict a few months before the wedding and a big conflict four months after. I mean, where is the love? What this movie lacks in affection it makes up for in lust. And what it lacks in lust . . . it doesn't lack in lust. But it's not even ""Well, at least there was that steamy lust between such and such"" lust. This was jealous, angry lust-speak. Granted, this one's good at arguments. Clive Owen is the real badass, better than any scolder I've ever known. Yes, he even scolds better than your mom (and with more whore-ible personal insults). And in a quasi-sick way, all those moments were awesome. I'll just say this, now that I've said all that: between the lack of affection, the cruel changes in time and heart, and the replacement of tension with ruthless actions, ""Closer"" is the dark, absolute antithesis to ""Love Actually."""

","Closer was a movie that had a screenplay designed for novels and plays, but never have I seen such bold discussion on the silver screen. All four characters have their goods and bads (mostly bads), so there is no hero and there is no villain. Everybody is just out to screw everybody else-literally and figuratively. Nichols cleverly decided that the movie would be strictly dialog and although sex is mentioned in virtually every scene, not once do we get to see the act itself putting all of the weight on the wonderful text. all four members of the cast did fantastic jobs, but Clive Owen is the one that breaks through here and puts himself on the best supporting actor market. the film did have its flaws. sometimes it got too deep, and there were moments where the dialog was forced, but these moments are quickly forgotten with the next scene. you have to go into this movie with the expectation that love becomes the awful four-letter word and sex is its tool or its vice. Don't recommend this movie on a first date. Don't bring the kids to this one. Many adults can't even handle this movie."

A combination of good reviews on this site and recommendations from a few friends changed my mind however and I watched it last night.<br/><br/>First the positives. The director showed enormous restraint by not showing any sex scenes in a film which is almost entirely about sex. Having said that he does strip Natalie Portman to a G-string at one point in one of the most gratuitous bits of on screen pornography that I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>My main complaint about this film is that you are never given a chance to like any of the characters. We see almost nothing of their lives beyond the confines of their relationships. It's a huge mistake not to introduce the characters in a film like this because without feeling anything for them you just never really engage with the story. At no point was I ever really convinced that any of them were in love. Compare this to a great film I just saw, Mike Leigh's Happy-go-lucky, which contained one of the briefest, most understated, convincing scenes of two people falling for each other that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>In the end my worst fears were confirmed.

I also struggled to imagine anyone acting in such a way as the ensemble - an impressive cast indeed - and simply could not relate to any aspect of the film. Jude Law's dialogue and Julia Roberts' reactions when she was photographing him were nauseating and the notion that she might not have simply laughed in his face defies logic.

","From my experience, the people who endlessly gush about Closer seem to be in complete awe of how realistically it portrays love and relationships. This deeply unsettles me. The characters in this movie are cruel, deceptive, indecisive, selfish, and generally just unlikable individuals. So you're telling me that, realistically speaking, love turns people into hateful monsters? Cynical much? This, I think, is where the movie fails. Sure, you can have an interesting story with a decent cast and all sorts of artsy frills, but when you get right down to it, what's the point if it's impossible to empathize with the characters? As the movie dragged on and on, I came to loathe all four of the leading characters and their almost adolescent shenanigans more and more. Yes, they were suffering, but I really didn't care. All of their problems they brought on themselves. By the end, I was so weary of them that I was actually pleased that they all turned out absolutely miserable. However, I'm sure that wasn't what the director intended.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I wasn't pleased.

","Alice. Dan. Larry. Anna. <br/><br/>Award-winning romantic drama Closer focuses solely on these four characters living in London and explores the complex relationships that form between them. There is infidelity, lust, love, misunderstandings and jealousy. Mike Nichols directs this character study of human relationships based on the same-titled play by Patrick Marber and the result is nothing noteworthy, in spite of having high profile names like Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Clive Owen and Julia Roberts gracing its cast list.<br/><br/>Closer is a poorly executed film that takes itself far too seriously by featuring pseudo-insights about relationships, and it breaks the fundamental rule of good film-making -- you have to care for at least one of the central characters, and none of these people are even remotely likable. In fact, they are downright selfish and superficial. What makes the film an even worse experience is that it features desperately quirky dialogue by these unlikable characters that just ends up completely unbelievable and often cringe-worthy. None of the high-profile actors manage to deliver these lines with any credibility, but in all fairness, writing like this is difficult to work with and having read the play by Patrick Marber, I found it far-fetched even on paper.<br/><br/>As for acting, Clive Owen does his best dry oak impression and whenever he is brave enough to actually attempt a different and less stale face, he ends up varying between two extremes -- wooden and exasperated over-emoting. Julia Roberts' emotion spectrum ranges from having a smug smile to looking 'slightly bothered', thereby cementing her place as one of the least versatile actresses working in Hollywood today. <br/><br/>The good aspect of Closer is its style. The direction by Nichols is subtle, the music score is sexy and this gives it an elegantly crafted style and tone. Of course, this makes the film break another fundamental rule of good film-making -- style over substance. Closer is watchable but humourless to the core and toward the end, I realised I didn't give a damn about any of the characters and instead wished they'd all end up alone to reevaluate their skewed perspective on relationships. <br/><br/>4/10"

It was border-lining incoherent at times, with a plot that inspires nothing and seemingly random turns for no other reason than the dramatic effect. Now, I like a good love story (or heartbreak story, this seems to be both) as much as the next guy, but this tried to do both and ended up doing neither all too well. It's not that the dialog wasn't good or the acting was bad (when in fact, it's probably the silver lining of the movie), but the turns of events in the movie occurs so often and so seemingly randomly (with not enough build-up in between) and the characters just seem so unrealistic that it's difficult to either sympathize or empathize with them. It then makes it much more difficult to find these events interesting. About the only event that I truly found interesting was at the very end when it is revealed that Alice's (Natalie Portman's character) real name was Jane Jones, which she had originally told Anna's husband when he was trying to get some honesty from her. That was the only time she truly let her guard down. However, that one part of the plot does not make up for poorly implemented parts of the rest of the plot.

So many people have suggested that I'm unsophisticated for detesting this movie, suggesting that I can't appreciate ""an adult movie for adults that uses intelligent dialogue and tries to delve into the nature of sex and love"" (and one that also may be ""brutal""). But I think Neil LaBute's stuff like ""In the Company of Men"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" -- which certainly fits all those descriptions -- is tremendous (and which I've seen ""Closer"" most frequently compared with). When I saw ""Company,"" I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. Its characters and settings were so brutally real that you desperately wanted to look away, but so compelling that it would have been impossible.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I thought the dialogue in ""Closer"" was not particularly intelligent -- it was more pretentious than anything else. It may have ATTEMPTED to delve into sex, but I've honestly seen that done with more wit in gross-out flicks like your average Farrelly Bros opus or ""American Pie."" And unlike LaBute's films, there was certainly no believable depiction of love -- a lot of talk about different characters ""loving"" each other but no development that actually demonstrated it. Brutal? It strived to be, but the attempts left me howling. Compelling? No way.<br/><br/>I will say that Clive Owen and Natalie Portman gave tremendous performances with what they had to work with (unfortunately Portman's character was very grating. Not her fault -- it was written that way). For that matter, each character was a caricature, and each attempt to make any of them seem human or real was totally unconvincing).

","What a colossal disappointment!! What a mammoth waste of time! What a tremendous waste of money!! I don't know where to begin explaining how disappointed I was with this film. Closer is a naughty, surprising, bore of a film. Maybe I expected too much in thinking there would be an interesting story and compelling characters. Maybe I gave this amazing cast too much credit. Or maybe this is just one of the most disappointing films of the year.<br/><br/>'Closer' follows the lives of four strangers (Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen) and how their lives are hopelessly connected. It basically tells the story of lost loves and failed relationships. Everyone cheats on everyone else and then they argue about it. That should have been the tagline on the poster, because that's the plot in a nutshell. This is a very serious film with only a few moments of humor (a rather risqué, though hilarious, internet chat.) The dark tone of the film hangs over the audience like a black cloud and really dampens any enjoyment of the movie. More humor would have been a welcome addition to the piles of hopelessness shoveled into the audience members' laps.<br/><br/>'Closer' features a copious amount of off-color dialog that serves no purpose other than to shock the audience with its unneeded vulgarity. Gasps could be heard throughout the theater as disgustingly obscene word vomit spewed from the mouths of the A-list stars. I was embarrassed for the women in the audience. The ladies in front of me buried their faces into their hands. I was embarrassed to be there with my wife although she fell asleep 30 minutes into it. I was embarrassed for the parents who made the awful mistake of bringing their children. I was embarrassed for Julia Roberts' reputation. I was embarrassed for the filmmakers involved.<br/><br/>I wasn't embarrassed simply because of the unnecessary vulgarity; I was also embarrassed for the filmmakers because of the absolute bore of a film that they no doubt poured their souls into. There were glimpses of greatness throughout, teasing us with what it could have been. Unfortunately, in the end it was just a movie about nothing. It was basically a showcase for the actors. There were plenty of conversations and arguments but they all ended up sounding the same. This film was a valiant effort by director, Mike Nichols. Unfortunately, oftentimes the more Herculean the effort, the more epic the failure is in the end. That is most definitely the case here.<br/><br/>Nichols' film jumps through time unexpectedly whenever a major event takes place. At first these strange leaps were interesting, but eventually they grew very tiring. It became work to try and figure out where we were now as an audience, and why we were there. The film doesn't jump between characters revealing clues or surprises as some multi-layered movies like to do. The way it is handled in 'Closer' feels much more like a trick, or an unnecessary attempt at fancy film-making.<br/><br/>Watching the movie unfold, it was very evident that the screenplay had been adapted from a stage play. The film concerns itself more with conversations than it does with plot. There really is no story. Every major 'event' (if you can call them that) happens off-screen. The audience is treated to heated arguments sparked by these events but we never actually see anything happen. Much of the movie involves simply watching the characters react to an event that unfolded off-screen.<br/><br/>Now for the good: The performances were fantastic. Each actor did a terrific job with the part he or she had. Julia Roberts was probably the weakest of the four and Clive Owens was probably the strongest (please hire this guy as the next James Bond.) All four really did do a wondrous job though. The problem is that the characters had no redeeming values whatsoever and the audience never feels any sort of connection with any of them. By the end of the movie, I couldn't even name 2 of the 4 main character's names. Maybe that's inexcusable on my part, but I tend to blame the inability of the director to connect with the audience. Make no mistake about it. This isn't a movie  it's simply a sequence of conversations.

The experience I was subjected to was taken straight out of Clockwork Orange - made to watch something atrocious and not being able to leave. I literally hit my head against the wall, it was so bad! Now, the thing about it is that everything except camera-work and the score was bad, really bad - the meaningless plot, the dialogue which vacillated between pretentious (Character X leaving Y: What do you mean you love me? Where is your love, can you point to it? What can I do with your sweet words? I don't love you anymore, good bye) and really dirty sextalk, regurgitated straight out of a bad porno. I really think that everyone involved in this project should take out an ad in Variety and apologize to all who had to watch it. This movie makes a bold step in modern art, leaving off where that god-awful exhibit at Saatchi gallery left off (Tracy Emin's My Bed), the one where a modern British ""artist"" put up her dirty, stained bed and called it art. It's a small step for bad art...yeah, just that - a small step toward crappy and pretentious."

"noralee","8","5","11","11 December 2004"," Hollywood Stars Using Lacerating Words as Sexual Weapons
","""Closer"" seems more about guys and sex than about relationships.<br/><br/>It is less a contemporary (including very blunt Internet chat) London take on ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,"" though there is a similar running theme of truth, lies and mutual fantasies, than a journey into Neil LaBute's scabrous territory where trust can't survive and male careers have a parallel with their possession of females. At least the women are in stronger positions than they were in at the time of Mike Nichols' ""Carnal Knowledge."" This film does make one wonder if the traditional practice of arranged marriages might not be as least as effective as love in serving as a basis for long-term relationships.<br/><br/>As a four-hander, it is weakened that Natalie Portman's and Clive Owen's performances blow Julia Roberts and Jude Law away. Owen's character is the showier male, with his hang-ups of rough sex fantasies and obsession with women as whores, while Law's character has some sort of mild mother complex.<br/><br/>Similarly, Portman's character is the more intriguingly independent female, recognizing the strengths and limitations of her sexual power over men she does and doesn't love, including passersby in the very naturally ironic closing shots. She is finally the most sympathetic character who we comparatively care about the most.<br/><br/>While Roberts almost manages to keep up, Law may be ill-served by the script. His character is practically two different people, one with one woman where he unsuccessfully tries to disappear from his physical beauty, another with the other where he uses it. He enacts them differently with different body language and props, but no motivation is obvious for his changes.<br/><br/>Nichols' directing is very involving, effectively opening up a play by opening up spaces, settings and locations. I don't know if the adaptation from the original had to account for the cast, but the script nicely incorporated explanations for having American women in London, as well as Natalie's youthfulness.<br/><br/>What didn't work was inconsistent changes in make-up and hair that did not support dialogue claims of a passage of time, as much as even three or four years between scenes, but nothing much changes in how they look, except occasionally for Portman's hair styles.<br/><br/>While it's a bit tiresomely arch having Law's character be a wannabe writer, Roberts' character as a photographer works very well for visualization, though her character's motivations are as inscrutable as her portraits.<br/><br/>Having a superstar cast as a Hollywood movie adaptation distributed in multiplexes causes audience problems as they were made very uncomfortable by the extremely blunt language, which wouldn't have caused as much of a ruffle in an art house audience, but audiences are just not used to watching these folks talk like this; Oprah's audience on a recent promotion for the film was so nonplussed that Roberts' joked that she had to learn these words for the film. I think independent films have been rated NC-17 for similar language. The language is so lacerating we think we are seeing more explicitness than we are.<br/><br/>The music selections are very effective, from the opening use of Damien Rice's ""The Blower's Daughter"" with its repeating chorus of ""I can't take my eyes off of you/I can't take my mind off of you."" But the repeating use of opera for inspiration and dates didn't really make sense for the characters and seemed more to indicate either an avoidance of time passage or that Nichols is out of touch with contemporary culture.<br/><br/>At least the strip joint played appropriate music. During Natalie's strip tease I kept thinking of Oprah asking her what her dad would think of that scene and she wryly responding that he's a gynecologist."

The pacing is interminable, the characters are snotty and full of themselves, and the stilted dialogue sounds too rehearsed to be actual conversation. If I hadn't shut it off during the ""Internet sex chat"" scene, I undoubtedly would have found more reasons to punch these characters through a wall.<br/><br/>I've sat through many ""art"" films, so it's not that I'm too inattentive or philistine to appreciate a leisurely paced movie with an intellect.

","Mike Nichols' ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" was about two couples whose relationships were so corrupted on an emotional level that they didn't have trouble using one another for hurtful purposes. I find the kinship too evident to be ignored, I could even find shades of Richard Burton fusing from the caveman charisma of Clive Oven, while Jude Law embodied the sensitive side of manhood, at least on the surface. I can mention the two female protagonists but this is a man's film, women's hearts are only tools forging the real rivalry between two schools of male sensitivities, the same premise with a female director would have totally changed the face of the story. But as a guy, I could 'feel' the film.<br/><br/>Jude Law is Dan, the intellectual or the artist, he's got that brooding hypnotic smile of a man constantly caressing the dream of becoming an acclaimed writer, from the obituaries he wrote, he developed a talent for smooth and euphemistic and words. He falls in love with Alice (Natalie Portman) a strip-tease dancer who left New York after a break-up, and immediately, he reveals his weaknesses, displays the kind of modesty that is so exaggerated it obviously confines to pride, but it works with Alice. It works because she is young and impressionable, she can see the game Dan is playing but she's enjoying it actually, she's not naive about men but so disillusioned about herself she indulges to childish lucidity and let him have the upper hand. So, when he announces his decision to leave her because he loves Anna (Julia Robert), she's angry but can't hate him.<br/><br/>She should have reasons to hate him, all he sees in Anna is that she's not Alice, she's harder to get, she's mysterious, she's taller and more mature, she doesn't need him so he needs her even more. Dan is a writer who sees life as a narrative and needs to earn her love, to be in control. Anna is a photographer and a well-established artist, but she feels like a hack, she only pretends to have talent while one can say she doesn't add much to the beauty shown in her picture. To a certain degree, she's closer to Alice in terms of self-esteem. It all comes to three persons who are not honest about themselves. Larry (Owen), the fourth force of the film, makes an accidental entrance after having a sexual chat with Dan, thinking he'll meet a nymphomaniac slut named Anna. The real bitch is Karma... and Dan, to a certain degree.<br/><br/>It's appropriate that Larry has the only regular job as a doctor. He's not an intellectual, he's manly, he's sexual and sensual, he exudes self-confidence but is distraught when he realizes that his rival is the baby-faced Jude Law. But as a guy, he can see behind his facade, when Anna leaves him, his manhood is hurt because Anna seems to be literally possessed by Dan and under the questionings of Larry, she reveals how good a lover he was, among many details. Larry fuels himself with enough anger and sadness so he can prepare his revenge on Dan. It's a matter of raw territoriality; he needs to possess his woman back and teach Dan one thing or two about women. While there's no good or bad people in the film, you can tell Dan and Anna are the one who're taught a lesson.<br/><br/>See the way they confess their infidelities, as sorry as they are, the hearts aren't there. They don't believe their own words; they just wait for the angry comment before moving forward. Everything is said for a purpose that can be either sincerity or fun. When Anna is about to leave Larry, she tells him that Dan is a gentler lover, when she gets back to Larry, she reveals that Dan is a mama's boy who weeps after sex so much for sincerity and sharing secrets. Larry throws that in Dan's face, triumphantly. He got Anna back by having sex in exchange of the divorce, Anna pitied him but he knew having sex would arouse Dan's old insecurities, because a man who wants to be in control can't accept a partial possession, Larry even affords the luxury to hit the final nail by having sex with Alice. Dan loses Alice not because of the act but the resulting suspicion.<br/><br/>The real character's arc closed here is Alice, she's the one who changes, who comes to age, the film starts and ends with her, as a girl who'll never be used. Dan realizes that he lost his love because of his own jealousy and might become a better man. Anna came back to Larry, maybe she thought she didn't deserve better but he played the game and used her and Dan with incredible dexterity, saving Alice in the process. Clive Owen and Natalie Portman were given some of the best roles of their career, rightfully Oscar-nominated. Even the script deserved a few nods because I've seen movies with marital arguments but rarely that rang as true as the one between Larry and Anna, this is a film that talk broadly about sex, understands the adults to the point of showing them playing dirty games, unintentionally or not. When Larry tells Dan that he had sex with Alice, there was something of Burton's smile after he had just played 'Get the guests'.<br/><br/>If the four characters of ""Closer"" seem less troubled and ill-intentioned than ""Virginia Woolf', they all seek love in a way we can suspect to be genuine and sincere, but during this four-year journey, the streak of betrayals will reveal how twisted our actions can be in the name love and the limits of the so-called selflessness of love, a dirty game where the ends justify the means. Forty years after ""Virginia Woolf"", Nichols prove that he still knows his business when it comes to intertwining couple troubles."
"A_Different_Drummer","7","2","3","23 February 2014"," not a movie as such, this is a time capsule..
","... which is the only deconstruction of this film that can ever make sense. Taken on its own -- what the French call the ""oeuvre"" school of film appreciation, not the ""auteur"" school -- this is no more than a strange tale of ""menage a quatre"" lacking actual sex, with clever dialog off the open that quickly degenerates into tripe an afternoon soap opera would not use. Ah .. but as a time capsule, as a record for future generations, this gets really interesting. Directed by the incredible Mike Nichols (THE GRADUATE among others) we have a director near the end of his career desperately looking for something unusual and strange to once more garner attention. Which was not a problem for Jude Law, who did the exact same role he has done in dozens of other films, this one he could have phoned in (his best work was in AI, where he essentially caricatured HIMSELF.) Then you have Clive Owen at the stage of his career where it was not clear (even to him) if he was about to segue into an action figure (did not turn out, not for lack of trying). Julia Roberts being quietly superb, which is what she does best, even with a script that, like old wine, turns to vinegar during the film. The revelation here is Portman. Wow. One gets a sense that in an alternate universe she could have ended up doing different films than, for example, Thor's girlfriend, where all she has to do is show up on the set. Real talent here, but talent that seems to have become lost in the swirls of time."

"cookiechip_07","8","2","3","27 May 2011"," Worth a Closer look! Your viewing time will not be wasted.
","Closer, directed by Mike Nichols, is a romantic drama that's little on the romance and high on the drama. It tells the tale of four strangers who, through meetings of chance, become two couples embroiled in the lives of one another, leading to an existence that can only contain false hearts. The film is hard hitting and to put it simply, strips the personal lives of leading characters bare. <br/><br/>We open the scene with Dan (Jude Law) a clever but unsuccessful journalist who writes obituaries, one day he chances upon Alice (Natalie Portman), after witnessing her being hit by a car he decides to take her to the hospital. Alice is a beautiful, care-free American girl, who worked as a stripper in NY but left to flee from a relationship. Alice immediately falls for Dan, and gives him her love without holding back. Dan is initially enchanted with Alice, and returns her affection, but while she inspires him to write his novel (based on her life), her neediness begins to wear on him. Enter, Anna (Julia Roberts) who plays a photographer hired to take a portrait of Dan for the dust jacket of his novel; Dan is instantly besotted by her, the two flirt and in his words 'must see her again'. <br/><br/>Time passes and a bored Dan impersonates a woman named ""Anna"" on an online chat room and sets up a date with Larry (Clive Owen), a stranger. Inadvertedly, this leads to Anna marrying Larry (an honest-but-bullish dermatologist) much to Dan's bemusement. Anna & Dan are in constant indecision about their relationships and the four lives soon become complicated and deceitful. What's intriguing is the fact all the characters conduct their private lives in a complete contrast to how they are perceived on the outside, maintaining clean cut images, dressing with style, all presenting a public persona without blemish! One might think they all are just interested in themselves. <br/><br/>Two things standout in this film for me; the first is the script. Written by Patrick Marber (based on his award-winning 1997 play of the same name) It contains brilliant dialogue which even though holds many profanities, is straight talking honest stuff which each character takes on with much aplomb. The second highlight of the film is the performance of Clive Owen. Each actor plays there role well and this is what we expect of such an A-list cast, yet the most notable performance is that of Clive Owen. His brash but truthful turn as Doctor Larry is acted with complete conviction, as if he himself has lived through such a twisted web of romance. <br/><br/>The director ensures the film comes full circle leaving you with a feeling of wonder when the credits roll. Throughout it, he keeps everything knitted tightly together and the viewer can feel the troubled nature of what is unfolding before them with scenes solely focused on the acting, as the rest of the mise-en-scène is kept sophisticatedly minimal and the use of camera close ups on faces help identify with the emotions being portrayed. Mike Nichols has a great CV and although this movie will not instantly jump out, it does fits nicely onto it and also shows he still has the touch in the modern era. <br/><br/>The reason many people will not highly rate this film is due to the uncomfortable 'everyday life' like plot. This being, the candid look at just how quickly things can change when instant attraction occurs. Closer is intense in its portrayal of relationship dynamics, its complexities and perhaps love, if we can call it that (because the four certainly do). A question that will be asked is, can they actually be in love when the word has lost all meaning in the betrayals that has been laid, or can it be restored when the trust which it is built upon has crumbled? My advice is if you after a romantic film with a happy ending then seek comfort in another film, but if you would like to view a well acted, unsympathetic, delight of screen play, then I fully recommended this."
"eschetic-2","9","2","3","4 January 2011"," An admirable stage to screen transfer which demands intelligent attention
","I first saw the outstanding Patrick Marber play, CLOSER, when it was on Broadway (172perf., March 25-Aug. 22, 1999, at the Music Box Theatre with the late Natasha Richardson in the Julia Roberts role following a successful run in London, where the play is set) and was enthralled with the cool cinematic dissection of the come-again-go-again relationship of four people. I liked the play so much that I somehow never got to the excellent film version with a well neigh perfect cast until recently on DVD.<br/><br/>Coming back to the piece a decade later, in a version which director Mike Nichols, working from the playwright's own screenplay, somewhat Bowdlerized (he eliminated the death of one character who now merely goes abroad and actually improved the opening of the Second Act in the Strip Club by reducing the ""ick factor"") in the vain hope of warming the piece for a broader audience, I am struck again with what a superb, un-sappy, universal examination it is of the motivations and mistakes which plague and bless interpersonal relationships. Many people will find this unromantic and cynical, but only if they are unprepared to accept how close the characters come to themselves or people they know in spirit if not in detail. People who thought the Prince/Sondheim/Furth musical COMPANY was somehow an attack on marriage rather than a statement of how essential ""coupling"" is to the human condition will simply not ""get"" this film.<br/><br/>Structurally, Marber still gives us a brilliant flow jumping back and forth in time and occasionally playing mirroring scenes overlapping each other. Under the earlier playwright's heavy influence, this is probably the best play Harold Pinter never wrote - improving on the master in Marber's clarity of vision and gift for real dialogue. All too often when a stage production glories in a ""cinematic"" approach, it is screwed up when it comes to the screen by a director who feels he must impose his own concept on the piece. CLOSER was blessed with the choice of Mike Nichols - a director who was sufficiently self assured not to have to worry about calling attention to himself, but merely serving the best in Marber's story.<br/><br/>The performances Nichols gets - from Julia Roberts as Anna the artist (unfairly criticized in some circles for precisely the emotionally inhibited quality which makes it real), Jude Law as Dan the striving author / obituary editor, Natalie Portman* (in the only fully professional performance I have ever seen from her - the director really does make a difference; witness her cheap scenery chewing in BLACK SWAN this year regardless of award nominations it may bring her) as Alice the damaged free spirit and the darkly sensuous and painfully insecure Clive Owen* as Larry the sex addict who finally finds a love he needs - are all as close to perfection as any audience could ask. (* = well deserved Oscar Nominations and Golden Globe AWARDS in ""Support"")<br/><br/>Although all of those involved have had bigger commercial hits, seldom have any of them done better actual work. CLOSER is not a film for the shallow or those who want fast, easy laughs or pat romantic solutions, but for an adult audience willing to engage their minds and pay attention, it's one of the great ones."

","I watched this movie over the internet nearly six years after its release and I'm very sorry for myself for having delayed it so much. Closer took my ideals about love and emotional attachment to another level, in the sense it quite exposed the actual want and outlook of human love and feeling rather than the mostly clichéd portrayal of the same. Usually when we see a movie which comes under the genre romance and drama, we quite often find that the emotions or feelings about love between two people are exposed in a manner which we think is what exactly happens in real life but sadly it is not so, in most cases. Closer, directed by Mike Nichols makes us understand the true nature of human relationships in a diverse and solid style by staying loyal to the real human psychology. Well to start with, this movie involves four people (just four) and how their lives are interlinked by this tricky and invisible rope called love. This rope plays a game with them and finally complicates their life with a near irreparable result. The actors in particular, brought immense life to each character, especially Julia Roberts with her surprisingly young looks, less talking and more of expressions. I did feel rather irritated sometimes with Clive Owen's whining and begging, maybe because I'm not used to seeing him in those shoes. The dialogues between Jude law and Natalie Portman are very interesting and intelligently crafted and both have done a great job. Some scenes in particular were very intriguing like the confrontation between Anna(Julia Roberts) and Larry(Clive Owen) and the final exchange between Dan(Jude law) and Larry felt real. Like every other movie Closer has got its demerits too. The story could have been organized in a more understandable manner, For example, half way through the movie you tend to get confused about who is with whom and maybe even jump to a conclusion of Larry being gay, like I did. Otherwise I felt the movie was perfectly fine with wonderful actors and appreciable music with one of a kind direction. Closer is definitely a must watch for all those who have got bored of or rather hate watching the usual romance of Harry and Sally."

If you can't take topics like infidelity, explicit sexual dialogs, obsession, passion, then you won't enjoy ""Closer"" that much.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the pace of the movie mainly because every scene is memorable and adds something to the plot. Every dialog means character development to the point that you actually care for the 4 main characters.<br/><br/>The Direction is top notch. It's dynamic, solid, captures perfectly the movie's vibe and makes the character's feeling look very real.<br/><br/>The acting is splendid.

Her display of sadness, happiness, being in love, and at last, rage; completely demonstrates her histrionic qualities. She's very versatile. Julia Roberts is very fine and adds the necessary amount of maturity to the movie. Clive Owen is a great actor and Jude Law although delivers the jerk attitude at some points, is also very good.<br/><br/>I will always remember ""Closer"" because of these scenes: the now infamous and sexy brother scene where Alice works, when Alice suffers an accident, Anna's photo presentation, Alice's cry, the obscene dialog during the chat, the shocking scene in the motel near the airport, the break-ups, etc.<br/><br/>Solid acting, mature dialogs, excellent direction, humor, and the display of power are the elements that make ""Closer"" an instant classic and one of the better ""true relationships"" movie."

Problem is, the feeling is slapped on two-dimensional, implausible characters in situations having no *weight*: realer people make trickier decisions than these day in and year out, and without the arbitrary conveniences of writing. Closer tries to boil all that messy ""life"" stuff off, and winds up substituting three sudden! reversals for every possible, plausible one it might have turned into a story.<br/><br/>So, grating. By the end, very, very grating. But, but, but: a reason to see this movie *maybe*, especially if you're appropriately foregrated--and I don't wanna overhype this, but it's just true, far more true than anything Marber wrote here--Clive Owen, about 75% of the time the guy's on screen, just *destroys* it. As in, ""acts"". As in, yeah, THAT is real love."
"axopnk","8","2","3","6 December 2008"," Be true to yourself
","I think the big thing this film portrays is the word ""Sacrfice"" (i think i read that somewhere in tag lines etc.). For those of you that want to side with one character, it is somewhat difficult because each character has their flaws but definitely Clive owen and Natalie portman's is the easiest to side with and her lines really portray what love is all about. Its not about saying ""i love you"" it also takes sacrifice even in situations when you don't want to. Best analogy is it's all about give and take. If you give to much the other person gets smothered while you are left unsatisfied. If you take too much you are seen as selfish and the other person feels unloved and abused. <br/><br/>In terms of Natalie portman her flaw throughout the movie was pretending to be someone shes not instead of being true with Jude law strait up. Her good points though, as stated, is she truly does know what love is all about. As Clive Owen said, she may be young but is definitely deceitful (meaning more mature and older for her age). At the end of the movie she learns the lesson that she should have been honest with Jude and also should have been true to herself (she knew he was cheating but choose to ignore it). <br/><br/>Jude law's flaw on the other hand was believing in love at first sight without really looking at what matters: the inside. If you think about it, he loved Natalie portman first off but later saw Julia Roberts and immediately fell in love with her to the point where he was willing to risk someone who actually cared for him because he thought it would be better. Later as he is with Julia he lies to himself to believe that she would never cheat on him (even though she already did so with Clive Owen) but eventually his love begins to fade. Jude laws character is interesting because he is conflicted by his own nature. In the end he learns that he was deceived by both women (Julia never truly loved him as much as Natalie, yet Natalie deceived him by being someone else). The lesson he learns is sometimes its better to have one in the hand then none at all as well as the phrase ""love is blind""<br/><br/>Julia Roberts character flaw was not taking a stance and choosing to give up a good marriage for something that she felt. She essentially lied herself into loving Clive Owen initially instead of just ""getting it out of her system"" with Jude law. Of course she didn't want to disturb Natalie portman, but again that's Jude's fault for convincing her to believe it would be OK. For her, she should have took a stance against getting with Jude law for her marriage sake and for Natalie's sake. At the end though she learns to take a stance and becomes the bigger person and goes back to Clive Owen to retry her marriage satisfied.<br/><br/>Clive Owen's character i found really no flaw. He's the rule of ""for every action there's a reaction"". He loved Julia, saw something in Natalie portman but was willing not to do anything to disturb his marriage. It's only later that he actually has sex with Natalie but only because Julia's actions (plus they were already separated).<br/><br/>Basically in a breakdown of sacrifice, Jude's sacrifice was to not give into his emotions but love Natalie portman regardless because she gave love. Natalie's sacrifice was to be herself even if people may not like who she was rather than living a lie with someone who gave no love. Julia's sacrifice was to preserve her marriage at all cost rather than gamble with someone who truly loved her. Clive's sacrifice (which he did correctly) was to try to repair his relationship even at the expense of never having something he wanted:Natalie portman. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is about being true to yourself. Don't stick in a relationship if your not sure. Don't love someone who loves someone else. Many of the characters don't want to tell the truth but the truth will eventually be revealed. Be truthful to a person but don't let it get to the point where someone will be hurt. If your gonna do something, break it off initially, don't wait. Most of all, for every action you take in love, think about what future consequences may be. <br/><br/>""Love can be right or wrong""-Bread ""Make it with you"""
"EUyeshima","7","2","3","31 March 2008"," Nichols and the Four Principals Overcome the Film's Hopeless Misogyny
","It is unlikely I have seen a more misogynistic film since Neil LaBute's ""In the Company of Men"", but director Mike Nichols uses his uncanny ability to delve deep into the human condition to come up with a challenging, superbly acted and at times surprisingly empathetic film about four self-absorbed, unsympathetic people. I'm not sure what other director could have been better qualified to translate Patrick Marber's stinging, cynical play set in an urban chic London. As he has proved from his 1966 debut, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" through 1971's ""Carnal Knowledge"" to ""Angels in America"" last year, Nichols knows how to humanize the brutality and emotional pain that people can inflict on each other. This master's skill is what prevents this 2004 drama from shriveling up into a wearing exercise in manipulation and deceit.<br/><br/>Writing the screenplay from his own play, Marber provides dialogue that is alternately sharp, observant and harshly erotic. At times, his acerbic work reminds me of Frederic Raphael's superb 1960's screenplays for ""Darling"" and ""Two for the Road"". The story that brings the four characters into a sexual intersection of tête-à-têtes and one-upmanship does get rather convoluted. The film covers about four years in elapsed time but takes liberties with scene transitions, focusing on the beginnings and endings of relationships and consequently complicating the chronology and timing of events, sometimes unnecessarily. Suffice it to say that each character figures out his or her capacity for hurting someone else and then goes about feeling empowered, guilty or some combination of both. It is telling that there are hints and often threats of physical abuse in the dialogue, but nothing is executed until a final, defining slap, filmed in slow motion, of course.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly strong, though I believe the ""beautiful people"" aspect of the casting does distance the actors from the audience, perhaps intentionally. I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts, but she surprises as Anna, the photographer who becomes the focal point of a shark-infested triangle. Looking rather sallow and absurdly thin, Roberts doesn't come across as all that attractive here, but her sullen demeanor seems to free her from the contrivances Hollywood has offered her for the past fifteen years. It seems inevitable that she is now playing the older woman archetype now, and she accepts her fate with a seasoned truthfulness that propels the rest of the characters. That she gives the weakest performance among this quartet is a tribute to the high caliber of the talent involved. At first, the overexposed Jude Law plays Dan, the ethically challenged writer who fails as a novelist, as a hopeless romantic, but what he gradually uncovers is a tormented soul weakening under the burden of his deceptions. It's a brave performance especially since his character is the one most willing to hurt the others deeply for his own selfish motives.<br/><br/>Playing Larry, the equally manipulative and sexually insecure dermatologist, Clive Owen finally sinks his teeth into a role that makes the most of his swarthy on screen persona. His emotional nakedness and bull-in-a-china-shop approach to his problems make a brutishly affecting counterpoint to Law's rather effete character. And in what amounts to a revelation, Natalie Portman is alternately vulnerable and bruising as Alice, the stripper who falls hard for Dan and won't give Larry the intimacy he needs when he is rejected by Anna. Eschewing any trace of the child actor she was, Portman tantalizes with her flighty sexuality and then grounds her character deeply when she is subject to an excruciating break-up from Dan. Her character's evolution, however sketchily it is presented, is the only one that achieves a poignancy that nearly transcends the story's cynicism. I have to admit the unrelenting tone does induce a numbing effect that makes you wonder why you should care about the fate of any of the characters. But leave it to Nichols to make you want to know what happens to each of them. The only significant extra in the 2005 DVD is a music video of Damien Rice's ""The Blower's Daughter"", which is used effectively as a musical bridge for their comings and goings. Highly recommended though don't expect to feel life-affirmed afterward."
"BVavs","8","2","3","17 July 2007"," Wow...
","You would think that a movie about a deceitful mix of four people, would be something along the lines of complete passion, that completely dismisses the painful emotion of love and replaces it with lust. This movie could be nothing further from that. A love triangle, or in this case a square (because it involves 4 people) where all 4 characters romance and ultimately sleep with each others wives and girlfriends. This movie could have easily tossed off as group of people who throw the word love around loosely and would rather get their rocks off than find eternal happiness. This movie could have also made each adulterous character out to be, what most of society would consider human scum. Therefore why have any sympathy for any of them, when each characters morality has been seriously compromised due to overwhelming attractions and lust. Mike Nichols however, avoids this entire scenario by delivering a highly complex, deeply moving masterpiece about the spontaneous attractions we have throughout our lives, and what might possibly happen if these temptations are in fact, acted upon. This movie is created in a unique sort of way. To go further into depth, these four individuals, regardless of what they have done to each other, you cannot help but feel endearing sympathy for all of them. Lines from the script are delivered with passion, conviction, and guilt. Its as if you want a reason to hate these people for their moral shortcomings, but you just cannot due to their vulnerability. I think as far as this film goes, it is a well crafted myriad of human emotion, and fully represents the frailty of what love really means. Well done film. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in a romance, that deeply treads beyond in it's complexity, and sensitivity."

"undertheskin23","9","2","3","15 April 2007"," love is a collision course
","Closer starts rather gently with a romantic song ringing ever so delicately as two characters approach each other, amidst the crowded streets of London. Then something happens, something injures. That's the story Closer is trying to tell. Two relationships sail smoothly across time, then something happens. Dan and Alice meet through an accident she sustains during a collision course with an automobile. They share information about their lives, jobs and romantic history. He shares more than her. He doesn't notice this, perhaps because all men are secretly into themselves. They visit places, a clinic, a memorial park, his destination. He almost leaves no mark but because he's taken with her, he leaves his name and she gives him hers. And they live happily ever after. Then something happens. He's written a book. Anna is shooting his portrait for the book's back cover. She's read the literature. She says she likes it. She's lying. She doesn't really like the book. You can see it in her eyes. He cannot though and when she tells him that she loves the book, he's flattered. He's attracted to the woman with a sad air, a secretive stare. He offers a kiss. She measures his intentions, his face, his game. She accepts the kiss. For a moment, she sees her life with him, yes, happily ever after. Then something happens.<br/><br/>Love is an accident, the film wants to say. Or is it love is a lie? Or is it secrets are lies. Or does it ask the viewer to choose, secrets or lies? The four characters in Closer are in a conundrum. They cannot choose between the two slippery choices. They think there's more in the menu. They choose secrets, the sneaking suspicion eats at them. They choose lies, truth knocks them in the head. They don't know. They can't see.<br/><br/>Closer plays like an antidote to the charming poison of the usual Hollywood romantic comedies or even the year's incisive but more hopeful offering, Before Sunset. It's a cautionary tale. The words are weapons, they're also the advice. This what you shouldn't say. This is what you should say. To salvage a relationship, to end another, what action is safer to take?<br/><br/>This is a wordy movie, relentlessly talky and heavy. Scenes extend because it wants to capture real time at parts. Monologues are avoided. The dialogue is clipped, sound and sudden. And they are delivered with venom.<br/><br/>The actors take center stage. Natalie Portman portrays Alice. She looks way too precious but she delivers her lines the way she should, with heart. Jude Law is Dan. He gives the character a knotted edge, as if on the verge of a solution but still blocked by a dead end. He's a pleasure to watch. Clive Owen is Larry. He's the alpha male, a scary figure, also the most humanly defensive. And of course, Julia Roberts is Anna. Guarded, docile in nature and the eventual prisoner. Julia portrays her character, devouring the entirety of Anna without fear. She gamely takes on her rotten first strike capability, her lockstep desires and loneliness with thespian magic. She proves us all right. She can do everything."
"geoffs9@aol.com","8","2","3","4 December 2006"," Natalie Portman Deserved an Oscar
","The range and depth of Natalie Portman in this film is amazing. The other three performances shouldn't be ignored but Portman stands out. Mike Nichols has created another masterpiece. As a reference point I recommend you watch Mike Nichol's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe? and Carnal Knowledge. Both about relationships and are structured similarly. Jude Law was very over looked for this film. Notice the change in his character which is subtle and you will appreciate his performance. It's all in the dialog and the subtext so pay attention and you'll find interesting character points. Has a French New Wave feel along with great photography and composition by Mike Nichols. Enjoy!"

","As Clive Owen's Larry often comments, ""how could he leave you?"" The idea of Jude Law's Dan leaving the sexy, exuberant and very snarky Alice for the plain-Jane Anna is a hard concept to wrap your mind around. You simply must believe in the concept of two souls so unbelievably drawn to each other that nothing else matters.<br/><br/>I feel as though I am giving Julia Roberts the short end of the stick, she acts the part with moderate success, only shining on the rare occasion that her dialog exceeds anyone else's. The movie is a tale of deception and love and complicated a complicated love...square?<br/><br/>Where this film exceeds more spectacularly is not only in Owen and Portman's brilliance, but in the outside character development. In many movies with similar story lines the two characters who instigate the affairs have significant others that are either a) unsatisfying and dull, b) too nice for their own good or, c) one who is not up to par with their partners. In this case, none of the above apply. Alice shimmers and turns heads everywhere she goes and despite her love Dan still finds it fit to cheat on her relentlessly. How he goes from attempting to convince Anna to see him to being loving boyfriend in a split second is quite amazing.<br/><br/>I am not the first to say that the two nominated for Academy Awards in this picture are truly the greatest, there was no oversight whatsoever for the other two leads. Jude Law does have chemistry with Alice that makes their relationship all the more believable, but you cannot help but wonder...why in God's name would he leave her?"

","I had read a lot of the reviews on this film before i watched it,so i wasn't surprised by the explicit language.Some of the dialogue is very crude, so be warned.The story starts off very innocent but then seems to get more and more sleazy,until we end up with Clive Owens character visiting Alice {Natalie Portman}in a strip club,and this scene in particular is very sleazy.Although brilliantly acted Clive Owens character is just not likable and does come across as a pervert.Jude Law's character comes across as more childish.A man who doesn't know what he really wants.And its Clive Owen that gets what he wants in the end of the film unlike Jude Law who loses out on both women.I wont say anymore than this as there wouldn't be any point in watching the film,as it doesn't have a big story.This is not a film everyone would enjoy,and i can see why some reviewers found it very annoying,you'd think by the actors in this film you would get a really good romance,but you don't,instead you get the misery that can come out of relationships.Some people may even be put off by having a serious relationship after seeing this film.To me the film seems to be about the male ego,as both male characters are rivals and seem to be more interested in knowing whether or not their rival was a better performer in bed,with the two women.The film is brilliantly acted and is worth watching even if its only once,as it has a difference to other relationship films in that its very intense,and its very modern.And in some ways its very true to a lot of relationships today."

So natural were the performances, I frequently felt uncomfortable, as if I had walked into the middle of a very private conversation.<br/><br/>All the actors are great, but Clive Owen is particularly solid. And Julia Roberts finally grows up and plays a serious adult role, without falling back on her usual bag of cutesy tricks.<br/><br/>If you value good writing and good acting -- and don't insist on fairytale endings -- this is a movie to see.

"imdb-12718","4","2","3","28 March 2006"," Lacklustre psychological torment
","I'm sure that the stage play from which this film was taken was highly effective, if your idea of a good time is seeing a bunch of characters set up for an author to have fun giving all of them a thoroughly rotten time. Does it say anything meaningful about relationships? Nope, don't think so. The cast is decent enough, if you can look past the uncomfortable fact that Julia Roberts can wipe the floor with the rest of them with one arm tied behind her back, but the translation from stage to screen is poorly handled. I'm sure the fact that no indication is given of time passing, so that you have to catch up with the time changes through the actors' dialogue, was done deliberately to be unsettling, but it just feels sloppy and disjointed, and leaves you with no involvement in what is going on. I watched this in the same evening as Flightplan, a routine thriller with no particular pretensions to being meaningful, but which still managed to say a lot more about relationships, and was a whole heap more entertaining to boot."
"Buddy-51","7","2","3","4 February 2006"," Flawed but compelling character study
","Based on the stage play by Patrick Marber, Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" is a generally uncompromising look at that great big messy thing we call love. The movie views romance as a kind of high stakes parlor game in which men and women jockey for positions of power, use sex and deception as weapons to annihilate their opponents or get what they want, and wind up settling for safety over passion when it's time to get on with their lives. ""Closer"" also acknowledges the sad truth that, when it comes to love, we tend to want what we do not have, then lose interest once the desired object is attained.<br/><br/>Marber has written a complex screenplay centered around four major characters. Dan is an unsuccessful novelist who meets and falls in love with Alice, a young American living in London. Julia Roberts plays a professional photographer named Anna, another American transplant, who has her first encounter with Dan when he comes to her studio to have some portraits taken of him. A mutual attraction develops between the two of them despite Dan's purported love for Alice. The fourth main character is a doctor named Larry who meets Anna and falls in love with her even though Anna's real obsession seems to be Dan.<br/><br/>For the next couple of years, the relationships between these four characters undergo tremendous transformations, forming and re-forming, grouping and re-grouping, until even the individuals involved no longer know what they feel or who they want. All they know is that happiness always seems to be vaguely out of reach because the person each of them is involved with has either moved on to someone else or has lost interest in the relationship. The film often condenses time by leapfrogging over months and years between major scenes without a great deal of transition, forcing us to pay rapt attention at all points throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Since ""Closer"" is derived from a stage play, it's not always successful at hiding its theatrical roots. Sometimes that's a good thing as when the movie achieves a sealed-off, claustrophobic atmosphere that enhances the personal drama. Like a lot of stage writing, the dialogue is often literate, sharp and insightful, but, towards the end, it occasionally feels a bit too clever and artificial for its own good. Once the characters start articulating the ""great truths"" of their lives, they lose authenticity and become mouthpieces for the author. And after about an hour of watching them sabotage their own happiness and listening to them whine about their lives, your patience and empathy may begin to run a bit thin, undercutting some of the positive feelings you've developed towards the movie in the first half.<br/><br/>In terms of the acting, three of the four leads - Law, Roberts and Natalie Portman - all deliver strong, subtle performances, but Clive Owen hits too many false notes, especially when he is called upon to emote to any great extent. Still, the others draw us into their insulated little world of drama and woe just enough to make us interested in what's taking place in their lives and damn thankful we aren't a part of it.<br/><br/>If for nothing else, ""Closer"" deserves plaudits for a clever, dead-on, hilarious and brilliantly sustained comic sequence involving internet cyber sex. That alone is worth the price of a rental."
"kalayaan48","5","2","3","22 December 2005"," Two couples look for intimacy and fail.
","As usual, anything Americans do is technically flawless. But people, this kind of stuff is never moving enough because it is not universal - two couples betray each other by having sex with each other and feeling guilty, remorseful, betrayed, about it. Only the English could have such a terrible time at sex. Think about it for a moment. How would the French have handled it? The Italians? The Chinese? This movie traces the journeys upper middle income Anglo-Saxons make trying to connect but failing - but Marber fails to show us what about modern love exactly that makes intimacy impossible - If Marber's point is that we don't know because we really can't know anything about each other (Jude Law's character finds out in the end he didn't even have Natalie Portman's real name), well, so what makes that modern exactly? Or that modern life has become empty and obviates against intimacy - though again Marber doesn't really show us how - Marber just says it but not shows us - so the only way these modern people connect is through sex but it doesn't work. (My grandfather could have told him that.) You can't have people obsess about sex and the lack of intimacy without building character. It's not enough to say oh, that's modern life. Strippers, photographers who take pictures of strangers, cybersex - it's not enough. It's character development that makes stories like this compelling. We don't really know who they are. We see what they do. We don't know what they want, what drives them. They remain abstract and general. It left me cold though it had great potential.

After that, I have no real complaints, except that the significance of Alice's (or rather, Jane's) fraudulent identity is not explored to the extent it should be.<br/><br/>The stage play has an entire scene with Larry, Anna, and Dan in Postman's Park where they discover Alice's memorial and talk about why she might have made herself up. It provides much better closure to the viewer and there's no schmaltzy slow-motion. About the slow-motion: the slap is about the characters, not about the action itself. This is once again something that worked better in the stage play. No possibility of adding slow-mo to a play. It maintains a focus on the interaction between Dan and Alice and not on actions themselves.

This was one of the only movies I have seen her in where I didn't feel like I was watching Julia Roberts play herself. Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen all are superb as well. The direction by Mike Nichols is awesome.<br/><br/>I see a lot of people seem to think that the message of this movie is ""don't fall in love, you'll only get hurt"" or calling the movie amoral. I think this movie actually has a very moral message. The message is that if you mistake lust or passion for love, you are going to have a really bad relationship. And that is a message this society needs to hear. The problem of falling in lust and thinking you are in love is rampant in our society. This movie is a warning about what can happen when you make that mistake.<br/><br/>As for the people that have said that it never feels like any of the characters care for each other, and deem that as bad acting. Well guess what, none of the character care for each other. No one in the movie loves anyone else. The only person in this movie that probably even comes close to loving someone is Natalie Portman's character; I think she may actually have feelings other than lust for Jude Law's character. Everyone else in the movie is just lusting after their current partners.<br/><br/>However, I will say this. Definitely not a movie I would bring my mother to see. There is no sex in the movie, just a lot of talk about it. Very graphic talk about it. If you can't handle graphic language, especially language using graphic sexual terms, then this is NOT the movie for you."

One minute it would two people would be talking and it would go to another scene and you don't get it until you find out it was actually like a year later. If i had to classify this movie, I would call it a more Hollywood version of Not Another Teen Movie. I still love the actors but I advise they not act together anymore, cuz this movie was absolutely horrible."
"Sweet_Ophelia","6","2","3","14 May 2005"," Realistic + ugly look at love in the 21st century
","Alice (Portman) and Dan (Law) are in love. Dan meets photographer, Anna (Roberts) and becomes infatuated with her. Dan and Larry (Owen) meet while having online sex (unbeknownst to Larry is Dan's gender). Larry meets Anna when Dan cruelly orchestrates a rendezvous. Anna and Larry fall in love. Anna and Dan fall in love. They all break each other's hearts.<br/><br/>'Closer' is a relationship merry-go-round, in which the four main characters; Anna, Alice, Dan and Larry all fall in love with one another; and while falling out of love with each other, partake in ugly, vicious verbal abuse and then pathetically go crawling back into each other's arms for another spin on loves carnival ride. 'Closer' is a realistic look at love in the 21st century. Forget the chocolates and roses; this film only ever offers the warts. Following two couples as they begin their relationships, but focusing more on the ways they destroy them. Everything about 'Closer' is confronting, uncomfortable and truthful and it's probably all that truth which makes the film so ugly. <br/><br/>There was a lot of hype surrounding the four actors of the film; praise was heaped but I simply don't see where all the fuss came from. Her golden globe aside, Natalie Portman's portrayal of a lovable yet needy stripper is pretty lackluster; which makes her character of Alice stick out like a sore thumb, because she's not nearly as aggravating and repellent as the other 3 characters. Somehow I just think that if she'd been a little harder, nastier it would have rounded out her character a little better. Equally uninteresting are Jude Law and Julia Roberts. For the life of me I cannot see what is so sexy and appealing about Mr. Law. He is plain, skinny and big-headed (not as in arrogant, I literally mean the man has a head too big for his skinny body!) His character of Dan does absolutely nothing to ease my dislike for him as an actor. Law plays him as a man who believes himself to be an utter romantic, when in reality (and as the audience can see), Dan is merely a creepy guy addicted to the newness and innocence of love. Law is utterly unimpressive and quite frankly, boring. He brings nothing of his own to the character. The same can be said of Julia Roberts; while I do commend her for taking on such an uncharacteristic role, her performance was simply dull. But I did find it amusing that even when she played a hooker in ""Pretty Woman"", she was never nearly as slutty as she is in 'Closer'. However; amidst the uninteresting and ordinary, there was one who mesmerized. Clive Owen. Not only is he utterly gorgeous - even when heaping ugly verbal abuse, particularly repeating certain four letter words which made even the teenaged me cringe; Owen is in a class all his own. Perhaps it's the fact that he played the role of Dan in Patrick Marber's original stage play. Perhaps it's the fact that Portman, Law and Roberts were so unimpressive, that anybody even a notch better, absolutely shines. Or maybe (and this is the possibility I like best) Owen really is just super talented, and one relatively new British actor Hollywood should sure be on the look-out for. Playing Larry as a very bi-polar lover; believing himself to be victim of love one minute and then suddenly turning nasty and barbaric the next; Owen's performance as scornful lover and smooth operator is the most realistic and confronting of all. All of the characters have one thing in common though; they are all weak. Despite the mess of their relationships, the ugliness in their past; these characters still go back to one another, instead of cutting loose and giving themselves a clean slate. This, for the viewer, is not only annoying but like a car crash, impossible to look away from. <br/><br/>For all of the film's emotional and verbal abuse; I liked the fact that director Mike Nicholas and play write Patrick Marber never included any loves scenes or physical aggression. The film is very much sexually charged; it has to be, with all the swapping and exchanging of partners. There are moments in which the sexual implications are a little uncomfortable to watch - most notably is the online conversation between Larry and Dan; just when you think their language cant get any filthier. Oh wait!... It does! But otherwise the film does well to portray just how much more wounding and debilitating people's words and actions can be. We never see the affairs taking place; what we see is the aftereffects, the ripples these people's mistakes and selfishness have on those around them. And that is far more human and tragic. <br/><br/>A very interesting film, delving deep into the darkness of relationships exploring topics which are often so uncomfortable to watch being played out, that you'll be wriggling in your seat. Despite being held up by a mostly dull cast (Owen being the exception), the film's issues are enough to keep you interested, if not a little appalled."

Between jumping through time and leaving out important plot points (if you care...which you won't) to an ending which leaves you both confused and ambivalent at the same time.

","Just saw this movie yesterday, and it was so good I watched it twice. I try to see everything Natalie Portman is in, and I have been liking Clive Owen better and better with every project he does, so I have been looking forward to seeing this one for awhile. I have been cheated on in a relationship, and all elements about honesty and needing to know rang true for me. The movie reminded me a little of ""Dangerous Liasions"" in that sex was used almost like a weapon by the characters. The whole ""Love at first sight"" thing was a great tag-line for this movie, because all the characters seemed to have that happen to them at least once during the movie. Also, seeing Portman play a stripper is a new turn for her. She's all grown up now."

","It was painful to watch these actors act out this most trite story about the charming stripper and the failed writer and all of the other cheesy clichés including the 'heart the size of a fist' that's been used to DEATH. EVERYTHING was so shockingly dumb and not the tiniest bit deep. I can't believe any thinking person would ever like this film. A waste of my two hours but, sadly for the cast and the crew and the producers, a waste of much longer and much more money. How a genius like Mike Nichols did this is beyond my comprehension. It was utterly without charm and the music stunk too. Sentimental man spew about boring sex between boring people."
"DICK STEEL","10","2","3","19 February 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Closer
","Hello Stranger.<br/><br/>Fate allowed us to meet, first as strangers. Then we become friends. We share a relationship, boyfriend/girlfriend, husband/wife. You tell me you love me. I tell you I love you too. But, do we really mean it? How sure are we about it? Will we stray from each other? Will we lie to each other? Or will we be honest about everything, and I mean, everything?<br/><br/>Mike Nichols opens The Graduate with Simon and Garfunkel's Sounds of Silence. Here, Closer opens with Damien Rice's The Blower's Daughter, whose lyrics contain the lines<br/><br/>""I can't take my mind off of you, can't take my mind... my mind... 'Til I find somebody new""<br/><br/>which forms the basis of the movie. ""If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking."" says the movie's tagline, and while watching, I was thinking about the loads of questions the movie subtly throws at the audience, about modern relationships, as seen through the eyes of and experienced by its 4 main characters, whose lives and relations become intertwined.<br/><br/>Fate allows the accidental (pardon the pun) meeting of strangers Jude Law and Natalie Portman, one a struggling writer, the latter a stripper. They become fast friends, and soon, a relationship develops. <br/><br/>But what happens when Law starts to also fall for photographer Julia Roberts? You'll start to ask - does he really love Portman? What's the deal with his feelings for Roberts? Love at first sight? Lust perhaps? Does he even care about Portman's feelings, or is he just selfish, wanting things his way? Is he tired of Portman? And Roberts, at first rejecting Law's moves as she knows he's attached, still finds herself drawn to Law's charms (ok, he's good looking), and giving in. Portman appears in that same scene too, and she can tell that something's not quite right. This was an intriguing 10 minute scene, and the conversations amongst the characters tense. <br/><br/>Law and Clive Owen ""meet"" in an interesting way, perhaps one of the more light hearted moments in the movie. Fate again intervenes - Owen and Roberts meet, and a relationship which led to marriage forms. Happy marriage? Think again - Roberts has an off screen affair with Law, and when confronted with it, Owens start to go livid, and wants to know every detail (even where they slept) to justify his betrayal and hurt. Law confronts Portman with the same, and we see the heart wrenching acceptance that Portman emotes. Again, questions are raised - do we sometimes become clingy, that you suffocate a relationship? How do you reveal the truth to the other party, while at the same time trying to cushion the blow? How do you walk away from rejection with your dignity intact? Or could you?<br/><br/>Owen and Portman met during Robert's photography exhibition, and again when Owen has separated from Roberts. They meet in a strip club, where Portman has taken up refuge in, entertaining men. This is a poignant scene, where more questions are raised, though in my opinion, it highlights Owen's lust on Portman.<br/><br/>What happens then, to the adulterous couple Roberts and Law? Are they happy together? Will someone in such a relation be open to the other party meeting up with an ex? If you're still in touch with an ex, will you tell your current squeeze? Why? Why not? Honesty? Will/Can your current squeeze accept the truth? What more if you slept with your ex?<br/><br/>We go full circle at the ending, where you might think that all questions are resolved, all questions answered. There's a twist at the end which leaves you wondering, who's playing who, who's trusting who, who's being honest with who. Is honesty always the best policy? But isn't honesty and trust the basis of any relationship?<br/><br/>I commend all four leads in the movie - Law, Portman, Roberts, Owen - they were excellent in bringing forth the various emotions required, and multi-faceted ones in fact. The characters are multi-dimensional, which makes them all the more plausible in real life. Nothing is cast in stone, everyone changes.<br/><br/>The movie touched me in a personal way, and I'd bet for those who have / are involved in relationships, you'd feel the same way too - you can probably identify yourself in some of the characters, and how they dealt with themes of love, relationships, betrayal, jealousy, honesty, maybe even sex. The movie has a stark social commentary, which will leave you thinking and perhaps reflecting on your personal relationships.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it to everyone. Go watch it, and start pondering."

","Somehow I lost it in Canada and US. Thank goodness for the European delays. Germany was overrated - I refuse to watch Julia Roberts dubbed in German. So, it was sheer luck to walk up the Champs Elysées in Paris and see the poster. I went in. It was a very cold day, very gray, very sad - a very ""Paris day"". Lunch time. The theatre was nearly empty. And then the movie starts. No, this is not one more of those feel-good Julia Roberts flicks. And yes, she still gives us enough of those gorgeous smiles aplenty. Enough to make me happy at least. But that is beyhond the point. In this movie, you see her and 3 other outstanding actors playing the theatre of life on screen. It's not the right movie for a sad day. You'll feel like committing suicide afterwards (or almost). But it is a masterpiece of human behaviour and human relationships. The dialogues are pure, and intentionally harsh. Intentionally real. The characters are intentionally sad and worthy of pity. One thinks: «oh, God, am I also like this? Does this happen in MY life?» That's the shocker. The movie is so real, so CLOSE. Masterful direction, and 4 actors who matured to do a movie with scenes of pure brilliance. A must-see. But not when you're sad. Consider yourself warned. :)"
"Undercover_Film_Critic","8","2","3","31 January 2005"," At last an intelligent Adult / Comedy / Drama
","This film is about adult relationships. I keep hearing people complain about the language in this movie. But at the end of the day isn't it how we speak in everyday life? Well it is where I live in the UK.I don't want to give the plot away to much. So this review is more about the performances. Let me start with Natalie Portman, I remember seeing her debut in Leon (The Professional) which just blow me away. You could tell she would be one to watch. But after seeing some of her other movies over the last couple of years, I was beginning to think this is just eye candy! But last month I saw her performance in the excellent ""Garden State"", and now in ""Closer"" which has in my opinion cemented her reputation as one of the best young actresses working today. (Along with Scarlett Johansson, Hilary Swank and Catalina Sandino Moreno). Jude Law is as likable and watch able as ever, and plays the part of man in love with two women equally as much, but must choose one over the other. Julie Roberts, now I admit I have never been fond of her. I don't rate her as an actress, and she has yet to prove her worth. But in this she plays against type and is similarly impressive as the rest of the cast. Finally, Clive Owen after the lackluster and disappointing King Arthur (American's Fuc*ing up a legend yet again!) I've only seen his performance in one other film, ""I'll Sleep When I'm dead"" in which he had his moments, but was just very... well.. mediocre to be honest. But in this film he shines and steals the show. If he doesn't win an Oscar (along with Martin Scorsese for the ""Aviator"") for his performance come February, then the awards truly are rigged and the academy should be ashamed of themselves. One other thing I should mention is the soundtrack to this film in one word AWESOME. The opening and closing slow-motion shots of Natalie Portmans character ""Alice"" walking on busy city streets accompanied by Damian Rice's ""The Blowers Daughter"" was simply breathtakingly beautiful. While this film is not for everyone, I hope it finds the audience that it truly deserves. A real surprise this one and NO guys this is not a chick flick, go watch and see for yourself."

","The screenplay was beautifully written. The cinematography was lovely as well. My favorite scene was between Clive Owen and Julia Roberts' characters. It is incredibly important that the actors listen to each other during a scene; these two execute this skill with ease. It was interesting to watch Julia Roberts give such a complex character life. I am pleased to hear that Natalie Portman and Clive Owen were given Oscar and Golden Globe nods. The director deserves respect as well, I think. This movie opened my eyes, and many others'. Unfortunately I had to see this in a theater full of disrespectful theater-goers. One should not see this movie in a drunken state."
"orangutan-1","3","2","3","2 January 2005"," Closer to what?
","The first ten minutes of Closer were endearing and set the pace for a typical love at first sight ""hollywood love story"". After that the script and the plot simply get a little blurry. It's definitely a dialog based film, and don't get me wrong I appreciate that; but to be honest there was really nothing thought provoking enough to make me appreciate the characters or anything they had to say.<br/><br/>Character development is simply non-existent. The film simply never allows the viewer to get to know any of the characters. This may be due to the fact that there are jumps in time, the in reality were uncalled for; and if your not paying attention the film doesn't let you catch up. For example the jump between the two main characters meeting and Julia Roberts first appearance, there were no inspiring couple scenes, nothing. You simply were served up the fact that Natalie Portman was in love with the main character and that the main character was in love with Julia Roberts character, and if you believe it or not this is the pace that the entire movie is set at.<br/><br/>The plot, and the script are the reason for this movie's failure at making any type of point whatsoever. However, I will say that all the actors did very well with the roles they were provided with (whatever roles they were). Natalie Portman deserves a pat on the back as she was the only remotely interesting character in the film."

But, I regret that he was in this film. He is too good for it as is Julia Roberts. She is such a fine actor and it is sad that this may be one of her last since she has now decided on motherhood as her career.

","I very much enjoyed this movie and want to recommend it to viewers seeking a quality film.<br/><br/>Having said that, I don't so much recommend it for how it is marketing itself -- as a deep, risk-taking movie that has the courage to speak edgey truths about men, women, sex, and love.<br/><br/>Rather, I want to recommend it as a sleek, witty, well-made movie that puts four of the most supernaturally beautiful people alive today: Clive Owen, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman, up on screen in one sexually provocative situation after another.<br/><br/>Yum.<br/><br/>The movie is intellectually and aesthetically above almost everything else in mainstream cinemas as I write this, winter 2004.<br/><br/>It's tighter, better constructed, and more economical than the narrative mess of the Howard Hughes biopic ""Aviator."" It's funnier than ""Meet the Fockers."" After all, the director is Mike Nichols, who gave us ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" <br/><br/>There are all sorts of gestures that an earnest English Major plunging, for the first time, into the mysteries of symbolism will pounce upon: one of the characters is a stripper who refuses to reveal herself even while stripping; one of the characters is a dermatologist -- a literal skin doctor -- a key scene of flirtation and seduction takes place -- oh, come on now -- in front of a tank full of man-eating sharks.<br/><br/>Add another main character who is a photographer who has dedicated herself to photographing strangers and a writer who ""steals"" the lifestory of his lover and you've got a full night of discussion over coffee and cigarettes.<br/><br/>In scene after scene, the outside world disappears -- this movie could have taken place almost anywhere, at anytime, it is so divorced from the surrounding world, and so focused on the bedroom problems of its main characters -- and the four beautiful protagonists are tormented by love, by yearning, by their partner's infidelity, by the physical attractiveness of people they cannot have, or should not have, by jealousy, by their partner's game playing -- really, it's an Olympic Decathalon of ""things that can go wrong when in love and lust."" <br/><br/>And the performances are first rate. Jude Law uses his beauty wonderfully to convey a man with more sensitivity than strength; Clive Owen uses his very different masculine beauty and intensity to portray a self-styled ""caveman"" with working class roots. Natalie Portman is terrific as a sensitive and yet savvy streetwise ""waif."" <br/><br/>Is ""Closer"" as deep as it thinks it is? Or is it just about getting to see Jude Law kiss Julia Roberts kiss Clive Owen kiss Natalie Portman? In bathrobes, stripper costumes, thong underwear? Well, look at it this way: suppose Amanda Plummer, Rhea Perlman, Paul Giamatti, and Jason Alexander were the leads? With the same script? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Really, I liked this movie. I liked seeing these beautiful people play very wittily written sex-head games with each other for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>I didn't, though, think that this movie was the equal of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" or ""Night of the Iguana"" or many another talky, character-focused movie that really did make me think twice about men, women, love, fidelity, sex, and yearning.<br/><br/>I still think it is one of the most worth seeing movie out there right now."

"eradle-1","Null","2","3","7 December 2004"," Show don't tell: so much babble, so little point
","First of all, Clive Owen is a total babe, even in this infinitely mediocre movie, where he plays an infinitely mediocre perv. The actors were lost, the script was trite, the tension was forced, but there were moments when you said to yourself:""OK, this movie could almost sort of kind of maybe at some point turn into something kind of OK."" Unfortunately, this never happened...the dream was dead before it was born. <br/><br/>If this movie had any point at all, it was this: Natalie Portman is hot. While this is incredibly enlightening, it doesn't really carry the movie. She plays a sassy American stripper, and couldn't possibly be more uncomfortable doing it. There is a scene where she struts around in a thong, but that just makes you feel like her god-parent, wanting nothing more than for her to cover up. <br/><br/>Jude Law and Julia Roberts...they're famous...they are very famous...and rich...and we all know them...because they're famous...but that's just not enough. Roberts expelled her character in a constapational fit...she tried hard...darn hard...and there were moments when she actually made it, but for the most part she was just a famous woman in terrible pants, saying some lines and crying a bunch.<br/><br/>When an actor can't even make you believe that he legitimately wears glasses, what does that say? I think it shows that some roles are just too big for Jude Law. <br/><br/>Clive Owen was fantastic, but that was only because he was in the play ""Closer"" a few years back. He knew what his character was all about, and he had some inkling of a clue as to what the point of all that babble was. The audience and the rest of the actors are not privy to that information.<br/><br/>What is the point of this movie? Why should we care about these people? What makes them interesting? What makes them do the things they do? This movie begins to answer these questions, and then falls short...way short. I don't know if I'm just a hopeless romantic, but was anyone else upset that no one died at the end? Not only this, but there were zero sex scenes...none...none at all...goose egg...not cool, not cool at all."

It was nice to see Julia Roberts in a very adult/sexual role which is a big change from the family friendly stuff she usually does. I am not convinced she was the proper actress for this role though. <br/><br/>It is sort of love story about 2 couples who cannot decide who or what they want in life. Do they want their own spouses or someone else's? Are they with this one person because they love them, or because they cannot have the one they want. If you cannot be with the one you love, love the one your with. <br/><br/>Clive Owen and Jude Law are gorgeous. Julia roberts, what a lucky gal to be able to snog these 2 hotties in one movie. <br/><br/>Brillian script. The writing on this deserves a huge honerable mention.

I wasn't much into the film, and in fact many people around me were squirming. This is the kind of film that film snobs love because it's ""edgy"" with the negative emotions and frank sexual dialogue. I can't identify with how badly these characters behave, thank God for that.

This movie is packed with all of the ingredients that make up a wonderful film - writing, acting, score, cinematography and all of the stops granted an artist of Mike Nichols skills and well deserved reputation - and yet fails to work together in harmony. Gestalt - the whole is greater than the sum of its parts - is what is missing from this film.

The movie features terrific performances by Jude Law, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman, and not much of a performance by Julia Roberts, who seems to have mailed in her performance.<br/><br/>It's all above love at first sight not being enough. Law's character, who should be the winner, ends up the loser. His entire world is a lie, as he discovers at the end of the movie. He's a terribly dislikeable fellow, and so is Clive Owen's character.<br/><br/>Roberts seems to have sleep-walked through this movie, which I really don't get. Natalie Portman is all grown up--she plays an ingenue who happens to be a stripper and a liar. She's the muse that drives Law, who turns his back on her.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols is a brilliant director. That much is clear. The problem, though, is that I still don't know precisely what this movie was supposed to be about other than as a study of human immorality.<br/><br/>The performances are largely worth seeing, but the story is muddled. I gave it a 6."
"A-ron78","Null","2","3","3 December 2004"," great performances, decent movie
","I'm puzzled by a lot of people who've torn this movie apart. Some movies I can understand people's scathing indictments of, but not this one. The only shortcoming of this film to me is that at many points it's TOO much like a play. Dialog in stage plays always seems a little too literate and over the top, something that's always bothered me with few exceptions of this ""genre"" (if indeed it could be called one).<br/><br/>That said, this is definitely a must see for anyone who wants to watch an accurate portrait of love/lust's darker side. Despite some of the dialog, the cast excels at filling every breath and line with all the emotional pathos that you'd find in similar everyday occurrences. Each character takes turns throughout the movie hurting and being hurt by one another as only those in tangled sexual relationships know how to do. Yes, the language is graphic, but anyone who's been cheated should understand that masochistic desire to know every detail of the other's infidelity.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is by far the standout in this film. Larry, though the most nasty and devious, is by contrast the most human and understanding of the world of relationships. He only hurts when he's been hurt and excels at doing so. While he knows that his relationship with Anna is ultimately unfulfilling for her, he also recognizes that she is incapable of such a relationship. His knowledge of human nature is clinical and raw, but does not lack heart, as he does seem to truly care for her. Law, by contrast shows the least amount of understanding of the same condition. He's ultimately the most childish, as is pointed out by Roberts withing the first five minutes of their meeting. He bounces from one woman to the other emotionally as it suits his need for a companion and it duly comes back to him in the end. While Law seems to be the more able at manipulation initially, he quickly proves unable to keep the lie alive. This is one of Law's better performances. He successfully undermines his wit and looks with the aforementioned immaturity, not something he pulled off very well in Alfie.<br/><br/>Both women put in good performances, but have less to work with than the men. Roberts seems woefully overshadowed by the rest of the cast. She holds her own and with a lesser cast would no doubt excel, but this is not that cast. However, I have to admit I've never really found her to be that engaging of an actress, so I could be a little biased. She's good at being an ice queen, but her characters lacks the warmth of a fully developed person. Portman, however, stands out in her role as Alice. As Larry comments, she has the ""moronic beauty of youth"" and she eloquently embodies that phrase. In her initial break-up scene with Law you can feel how hurt she is and how desperate she is for affection and love. What's more, you can also sense that, because of her age, she has no real concept of what that very thing is. She's a child playing adult games of the heart. Unlike Dan, she is saved by her character's youth and ability to still learn from such mistakes. Portman's only performance drawback is her inability to seem real, especially when she's not interacting directly with someone on camera.<br/><br/>Without a human to work off of, she seems emotionally lost to a point and tends to overact.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an excellent portrait of what it is to be human. Those who chastise the character's immorality as unlikeable don't understand that this trait lies dormant in everyone, especially in matters of the heart. Realistic people in realistic situations make for a fascinating character study of the more base side of human relationships."

I for one couldn't see why anyone would recommend this ""movie"" to anyone, a dullard's view of love and intimacy. Characters that are either paper cutouts posing as actual people or (in the case of Clive and Natalie) so damaged you could hardly stand to watch after a bit. That they hurt everyone they loved (as did Jude and Julia's characters) was actually boring by the end of the seemingly never-ending flick.<br/><br/>The play might be filmed outside, but it is still just a play, without the artifice of a play's staging it was confusing to tell what was happening and when. <br/><br/>The language was so insulting, trying to sound ""adult"" by describing in course and adolescent terms the basest of human physical interactions. I am not a prude, but I found the language demeaning for all involved.<br/><br/>Strange that I've been hearing ""buzz"" about this one, but as it is Julia's last potential Oscar-winning role for what is likely to be the rest of her life (she already looks more like a little old lady here than anyone her age has a right to). I think Cate Blanchet did her no favors leaving this complex role to Julia's two facial positions: anger and a sort of blank, wounded stare. She goes through some tough times. But I didn't care.<br/><br/>Law, who is violently over-exposed at this point, gets the short, and I mean short end of the stick. I know so little about his character by film's end that I can scarcely write about him. He is a man who uses other people over and over again. And who ultimately pays the highest price in the film. But I didn't care.<br/><br/>Portman's ""nude"" scene is a trick of the camera; she wears a beaded bikini with long tassels at one point which she removes off camera. You don't see so much as a nipple. I disliked her character, because she seemed to be more a plot point than a person. That nobody knew her or understood her was sad. But I didn't care.<br/><br/>Owen's character is such a sucking sound it is amazing they didn't just employ a vacuum cleaner and save the price of an actor. Manipulative, childish, vapid, dull, the gentleman playing him did a fine job making him look like the bully and jerk that his is. And I really didn't care.<br/><br/>Not even a bit.<br/><br/>This one will have you watching your watch, and if you paid for it you'll be wondering if you can get your money back. Because I doubt you'll care for these folks, or their movie."

","I got the pleasure of attending a screening tonight of the film and I might as well comment on it. Overall, I did enjoy the film. No, Natalie Portman doesn't get naked. The acting was great and I have never found Clive Owen so perfect. The lies and slime of the characters keep you watching with wide eyes. Sometimes the film tries a little too hard, ending up being overly dramatic. I don't think comedy was needed during heated arguments between the characters, but it definitely doesn't ruin the film. The most enjoyable thing is to see the characters set themselves up for downfall further down the road. Overall, this was a good film with great acting. 7/10"

","Today I got to see a sneak preview of the movie Closer. And boy was I blown away, this movie is not only good, but it is a masterpiece. Four greatest performances of the year, especially Julia Roberts. She explored her character with great range and depth, and I have never seen her in a movie this good since Erin Brockovich. This is her best performance to date and without a doubt an Oscar nomination will come her way. The three others give great performances as well, but this is the one that stands out most to me. Great directing and script also make this movie a masterpiece. By far this is the best picture of the year, this movie was made for enjoyment, not for Oscars, but it may as well have both."

","I looked forward to seeing this movie after I saw the TV commercials for it. I'm a big fan of Roberts, Portman and Law. I was expecting an intriguing story that would show the dark and painful side of betrayal.<br/><br/>Maybe it was, I didn't stick around to find out. <br/><br/>First, the beginning totally drags (you already feel depressed, thinking, why am I wasting valuable holiday shopping time sitting in a boring, depressed movie). The concept of time was murkey at best and you don't realize that a year or so has past between Jude Law & Natalie Portman's character's initial meeting and the next scene. But that's not why we walked out. <br/><br/>What really bothered me was the cyber sex scene that followed. Was it necessary to continue that scene on for so long? First, the scene was between two men (which may bother some viewers, even though one of the men was pretending to be a woman). The language was very, very crude. Think of every dirty, perverted and sick thing you can and imagine it being typed in a chat room, only you're watching it on the big screen. If I reproduced the conversation here, I would be banned from this site. The scene goes on forever. There are also graphic banner ads for pornography sites(hopefully fake). <br/><br/>My husband actually had his eyes closed, something you may not expect a 28-year-old man to do, but he felt very uncomfortable to watch this - as did I. After a few minutes of squirming through the scene we gathered our belongings and left. <br/><br/>Interesting, a couple in their mid-to-late 20s, a generation that many view as being totally open-minded and the cause for our crumbling morality leaves the theater while the seats remained packed with our baby boomer parents. Hmmmm."

"kbowes-23399","1","1","1","23 August 2018"," Just plain cringey
","I don't even know where to start. The characters resemble the tropes you normally see written by teenagers in sub par fanfiction: Law's character is the classic quirky writer, self-insert male lead, and Portman is his manic pixie wet dream. I will refer to the other two characters as the other two, because they exist solely to round off the awkward love square that the film is centred on, and have no other attributes to speak of. <br/><br/>Love at first sight is a very prevalent theme in this film. You will know the characters are in love when they caress each others faces on their first meeting. This happens often.<br/><br/>The writers are also very liberal with 'deep and intellectual' lines such as ""I love everything about you that hurts"", which are unorganically shoe-horned into scenes as often as humanly possible, and usually don't make sense. I say liberal because the dialogue consists of these profound words of wisom more than, you know, actual dialogue.<br/><br/>I see a lot of people describe this film as 'real' and 'raw', probably because it contains a lot of crude sexual language. Its not that I'm a prude, but for a scene to be sexy you have to establish some sort of chemistry between characters. Otherwise, crude language just comes off as a poor attempt to be edgy, like a kid discovering swear words for the first time and over-using them to sound cool. <br/><br/>It's not often I go out of my way to write a long review like this, but this film was really, truly abysmal. I'm actually not sure if the director has ever seen two real life humans interact before."
"baoneill-48383","3","1","1","23 October 2016"," A beautifully written screenplay about relationships ruined by cheap, unnecessary pornography
","Billed as a 'Romantic Drama' five minutes in I was intrigued. Beautifully observed, with intelligent, amusing dialogue  I poured myself a glass of wine, thinking, 'Yep, this is going to be good'. Sadly, after the initial scene with Jude Law and Julia Roberts (in fine form) it descended into a lame excuse for audiences (and actors) to be subjected to yet another screenplay from a foul-mouthed playwright living out his sexual fantasies on screen.<br/><br/>Why do it? I find myself dismayed by the amount of such films being released that appear to be a 'genre' in themselves. Sex and violence have become almost de rigueur in far too many new releases. Forget the MPAA rating, pornography by any other name is still pornography and it's time it got kicked out of mainstream cinema.<br/><br/>Scenes of a sexual nature should not only be significant, they should produce an emotion that is not akin to throwing up in a bucket. Anyone can talk dirty or thrash around in a bed showing parts of their anatomy that we'd rather not see (all too often ageing actors, think Michael Douglas, actually where's that bucket?), but any actor worthy of the name can produce such a scene (with the help of a good cinematographer and director) with a look, a hand, the curve of a naked back which is often far more stirring  but Clive Owen feigning an orgasm while reading a stream of filth on his computer screen  doesn't actually do it for me . I'm giving it a '3' rating for the dialogue (sans porn) alone."
"axel-koch","4","1","1","19 April 2014"," Depicting romance astoundingly accurate, but boring its audience close to death most of the time
","Though lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off, as Natalie Portman's character informs the audience in one of the most brilliant quotes in recent film history in Closer, I intend not to do either of those things in my review for the 2004 drama, so let me be straightforward:<br/><br/>Besides all its impressing screenplay merits, the story about four realistically unlikable people constantly upsetting each other with the people they choose to bed, is quite the antonym of gripping entertainment. The absurdly long scenes screenwriter Patrick Marber has to fill with enough casual dialogue exposition to answer plot questions arising from some of the one-year-spanning time jumps that occur every now and then in Closer are difficult to pay attention to and even more difficult to enjoy. Parts of his storytelling and the main actors' performances are excellent at portraying the twisted feelings love brings with it, but for most of the time, all I got from this film was boredom.<br/><br/>Due to that and some peculiar plot points closer (no pun intended) to the end, the picture can depict romance with all astounding accuracy it wants to, it can't really get good anymore."
"juliacher1987","5","1","1","28 March 2014"," Really shallow
","The first 15 minutes are great and promising. Too bad the rest of it is nothing like what you expect. Stupid shallow text, awful characters. Such great actors with nothing to work with. Natalie Portman is great,but that is not enough. After seeing this I felt drained and as if someone took two hours of my life for no good reason. The whole story is based on lying and cheating. There is much talk about Love but there is none. The characters are confused and really shallow. How many times can you talk about sex and love in 5 minutes? It seemed there is all there is to it. I don't get it, how this movie got such a good score. forgive me for saying, but I think people who like this are as shallow as this movie is, and have no deep thoughts about a thing except sex and being totally screwed up. Just don't watch this. For your sake."
"edowzy","3","1","1","6 July 2012"," I can't believe this was nominated for an Oscar
","This film was one of the most poorly written plots I've ever experienced. I had no qualms with the film itself; the directing was adequate (nothing out of the ordinary for this style of film), and the acting was great. However, what came out of the characters' mouths and the ""twists"" within the movie felt like they were written by an angsty teenager on the set of a soap opera. The two couples cheated on each other. That's the twist. Five times. The story was very cyclical and boring: someone is unhappy in a relationship, they cheat, the other finds out and gets very upset. This was repeated over and over. <br/><br/>I felt that none of the characters contained any real depth to them, and the motivations for the characters were hazy. Of all the characters, Larry (Clive Owen) knew what he wanted. He felt the most real in terms of his motivations for his actions. Jude Law (Dan) was all over the place. At first, he is painted as a young romantic who does not know what he wants in love, but by the end he is an angry, jealous, b*tch-slapping boy. There was no transition to this point, it just seemed to have happened in the last 5 minutes of the film. <br/><br/>""Alice"" was the most confusing character out of the whole film. She plays through the entire movie as if she is madly in love with Dan, but the one line of ""lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off"" throws that notion completely out the window. Was she actually in love with Dan? Was she just toying with his emotions? This action, as well as having sex with Clive Owen, does not jive with the way she is presented in her dialogue. Many people are two-sided like this in real life, I am aware of that, but it is confusing to the viewer as to what her goals actually were, and so my sympathy for her plight is gone.<br/><br/>I believe that this movie gets too much credit for being ""edgy"" or ""erotic"" in terms of its sexual tone. The film was made in 2004. There are plenty of movies up to this point that have been just as sexual or flat-out vulgar up to that point. For example, did the chat-room scene need to be THAT long? It could have been established in 2 minutes that Clive Owen was, in his own words, a ""caveman"" when it comes to sex, and for Dan to get him to meet Anna. Although romantic movies are not usually this graphic, it surely isn't breaking new ground. <br/><br/>All in all, the acting was great, the setting and directing were fine, but the plot and motivations of the characters were awful. For a movie less than two hours long, it felt like an eternity because I knew exactly where the plot was going, yet I didn't know how the poorly written characters would get there. The acting in the movie saved it from becoming a 1, but it didn't stop me from rolling my eyes every time someone cheated on another by the second half of the movie."
"giggle0001","10","1","1","27 April 2009"," something I want to say about the movie
","In this movie, complicated plot and psychological actions are more worthwhile to write about than the stars' acting or something else. Dan is a key character; almost everything is caused by him or his action, and it is his shortcomings that lead to misery. He is conservative, while he desires adventure; he wants to be loved ,but when he is loved he loses his head; women tolerate his shortcomings, fascinated by his pretty face, while he innocently thinks his lover has to be perfect. Compared with previous characters Jude Law rolled, Dan is more practical, more real. The scene Dan cries with humiliation in front of Larry, his romanticism and immaturity of love have been embodied completely.<br/><br/>Larry may be the most snobbish one among the four. The scene he chatters with Dan playing as Anna on line shows his indecency inside. He knows little about love except for sex and occupancy.<br/><br/>Alice is a little demon with an angel's face.At the beginning she says she's kind of gypsy,so no wonder in the end she walks in the crowd wildly, caring about men's erotic sights. It's hard for me to believe she truly falls in love with Dan. At last ,she lies in bed and suddenly tells Dan that she doesn't love him any more from that second. <br/><br/>Love is not a kind of redemption; it is simply a relationship.Both Alice and Dan are searching in the street ,waiting for the love at the first sight, and so are many people; while their results are often not good. It seems not so good to be a romanticist on love, for the romance on purpose will be disappointing. <br/><br/>In the end, the soft music is on again, ""I can't keep my eyes off youI can't keep my mind off you""Everyone has an ideal about his or her love, but reality is reality."
"Mr. D","8","1","1","20 October 2008"," Rough and bleak look at modern romance
","Closer is my kind of movie: smartly written, expertly acted, and riveting to watch even though not a single hint of action occurs.<br/><br/>Based off a stage play, the story revolves around two couples and the interactions between them. It all starts out fairly simple, with British Dan meeting American Alice in a park and causing American Anna and Larry the doctor to meet as well. They seem like cute and normal couples, but it doesn't take long for things to unravel. By the halfway point one character essentially hops to another bed and the remainder of the film starts it slow spiral into darkness. By the time the credits roll only one relationship is left standing, and even that is revealed to be one-sided and eventually doomed to fail. This journey is realized through some extremely sharp and frequently very profane language that bears more than a passing resemblance to David Mamet(don't believe the Parent's Guide if it mentions only 'mild profanity').<br/><br/>The acting is very well done, with Jude Law inhabiting his character with conviction. Natalie Portman finally proves that she can act, although she doesn't appear fully willing to 'inhabit' the role of a stripper (rumor has it she did film topless scenes, but they are not in the final cut so for all intents do not exist). Even Julia Roberts, the epitome of Hollywood celebrity, manages to be quite good. The real leader of this pack though is Clive Owen. His Larry is the only one that really shifts during the movie, and by the end of the film the good natured family doctor is revealed to be the most vicious and misanthropic of all the characters. His final confrontation with Dan is a perfect scene of ruthless verbal attacks, barely contained rage, and a final blow that proves he is in charge and will ""win"" at all costs.<br/><br/>Needless to say this is not a good date movie, and is something best viewed by yourself and followed by a cold shower. Spending almost 2 hours with these self centered and self destructive people will dim your view of love and humanity, but it's a ride worth taking."
"jzappa","9","1","1","5 August 2008"," A Filmed Play, But Alas a Well-Filmed, Very Moving Play
","Closer could have been a perfect movie had it not been so faithful to the theatrical chemistry between characters in Patrick Marber's original play. The dialogue is very very clever, and despite its unrealistic airs, it works. But because of its rhythm and pace, which is powerful nonetheless, it still seems like a play. One should not see a movie and be reminded of watching a play, because suddenly the fact that it's a movie becomes meaningless. The oneness of an individual creative medium, no matter how much it may have in common with another, is very important to maintain, because it is nothing without its continuous substantiation and comprehension in the world, and the enjoyment of it is so extremely beautiful and impactful because it is full of inherited memories and influences of the creation and development of it.<br/><br/>Despite this, Closer is a very moving story exploding with incredible acting from its petit cast, Mike Nichols again drawing out the very best from each of his actors. His main achievement in directing this film is his treatment of his actors, whose power and consumption in their roles are so unremittingly personal portrayals that the unmistakable theatricality hardly deters them at all, which is why it is not an indefensible flaw.<br/><br/>Marber's characters are so deeply realized that they have the prevailing effect of truly real people, whose sexual experience has given them a collective conscious which affects the mature and wise emotional atmosphere of the movie, physicalized by the staggering current that connects these four people. Likewise, this film is a very emotional experience that moves you and makes life clearer for you, however much experience with sex and relationships you may have."
"italia042002","8","1","1","7 July 2008"," Real, a bit painful
","Many people don't like this movie because of its sexual explicitness, and its making sex and love into a ""dirty hurtful thing"". Sex and love can be a dirty, hurtful thing, though...So many movies in Hollywood make love and relationships an ideal, wonderful thing, which it is if it's healthy...There are good and immature people who can get caught up in bad relationships with people who aren't good for them, and this movie explores that. Just because you have been so lucky as to have good relationships throughout your life doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't look at the other side of relationships that other people go through. Have some empathy. Do you want to end up like this? No. Should people be this way? Ideally, no. But there are many, many people around the world who have affairs, have been cheated on, who have cheated, who have been left and hurt, and that is what this movie is about, so don't expect anything else. That said, it has obviously stirred up many love/hate reactions and is powerful."
"lunchers42","8","1","1","24 July 2007"," Love and passion; the odds of it all
","I'll stipulate the following review by saying that many of mine fall into a simple category: humor intended to review the dark, ridiculously humorous side of human nature. However, I feel an obligation, possibly based on my own history, or the director's beautiful portrayal of such events, to give a far more honest approach to what I viewed. That given, perhaps, for once, people will find such a review helpful. I was moved, and I hope many of you experience this movie with a similar moving experience.<br/><br/>Closer defines the confusing times we deal with in terms of story-book romantic endings and the reality of how love comes to be. We all (optimistically) envision love that is true, immediate, and timeless. Yet, we get a glimpse of reality here; those who believe in love, at various moments in time, only to discover much of themselves consistently changing, both in terms of lovers, and how they define love. Love is clearly the topic of interest, but who's love? And which lovers? This question parallels a more common reality, one in which we may be less realistic about perceiving, yet still exists.<br/><br/>The consistent romantic interludes are superb, perhaps only trumpeted by the disturbing lack of romance by those engaged in such interludes. Our own safety in those we allow to get close to us being of key issue. I could continue, but I'd rather allow this to be a prelude to inspire those both questionable and hopeful of relationships to view the movie. Enjoy, both in terms of the characters, and the stories they tell. This is a movie both inspiring and dismaying, but worth seeing. The current state of your love life may determine your eventual perception. Regardless, I hope you find both this review and the movie a worthwhile event."

","It has been 41 years since Mike Nichols made his highly acclaimed relationship drama 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' At the time of its release, that film was considered scandalous for it use of foul language. Today, it still retains all of its power yet seems relatively tame.<br/><br/>This is not to say that Nichols has lost his touch for drama or conflicts within relationships. His newest film, 'Closer' is one of his best films to date (fairly impressive considering he made 'The Graduate') It tells the story of four singles living in London.<br/><br/>Anna (Julia Roberts) is a photographer who is recently divorced. Roberts gives a very strong performance, however it is hard to handle hearing America's sweetheart (A.K.A. ""Our Pretty Woman"") speak so freely about certain sexual activities. She is hired to take Dan's (Jude Law) photograph for a book jacket. Dan is a journalist by trade (He writes obituaries.) the photo however is for his book that has a chance at being published. The book was inspired by Dan's current flame Alice (Natalie Portman) a gal who never lets you get too close to the person inside. Dan is attracted to Anna, but is met with a flat rejection.<br/><br/>Posing as Anna in an online sex chatroom (good thing the little kids cannot read) Dan unknowingly sets up Anna with Dr. Larry (Clive Owen). The foursome form some sort of weird spiral whereby they are constantly changing their partners.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent without exception. Oddly enough, the best pair of performances do not belong to the two megastars in the cast (Roberts & Law), Portman strikes every note perfectly. We are not sure that we know enough about Alice and Portman performance suggests we never will. As for Clive Owen, he is absolutely merciless, as Larry we somehow come to fear him. He has a looming presence without even standing up. He holds your attention, it's a violent performance. Not in the physical sense, Larry uses words, sharp words, to get what he wants. Owen was without a doubt Oscar worthy, to bad they threw Morgan Freeman his well deserved bone.<br/><br/>The writing is pitch perfect ammunition for the cast to unload on the audience. The screenplay was written by Patrick Marber based on his play and it is some of the best writing for film in the last 10 years.<br/><br/>Nichols still has the chops and audacity to stay current and this film was as unsettling to me as 'Virginia Woolf' or 'Carnal Knoweledge' must have been back in the 60's and early 70's. Nichols can still bring the heat."

","The depiction of human depravity at its worse, this film affronts one with four characters, so horribly life-like, who continuously slip on an unromantic landslide. This film practically portrays what occurs when a group of individuals continue to pursue their own interests, defeating any form of social altruism whatsoever. One may be disgusted by the unveiled qualities of man and woman in this film, but in reality the movie is really just a illustration of humanity in pursuit of its most natural inclinations (the pursuit of the most 'apparent good' over and over again). What may disgust people isn't the choices these four characters make, but the reflection of some or all of the stories in the film within one's own life. Our attempt to shroud our past mistakes in the romantic scheme of things is shattered with 108 minutes of pure self-interest."

This gripping epic involves Clive Owen, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Natalie Portman all over each other over a long period of years during which they love, hate, cheat and make up (not particularly in that order). It's one of those films that makes you think long and hard about you life and the relationships you experience along the way. I also can't help but feel that the conversation I had with my Ex Girlfriend after watching this together led to our eventual break-up.

","Oscar Wilde was right when he said, ""There are two great tragedies in life. One is not getting what you want, and the other is getting it."" Mike Nichols' well crafted film highlights both tragedies with an unflinching eye. Nichols clearly knows a little something about both films and relationships, and he turns it loose here with a vengeance. This film seems to derail your expectations at every turn, yet he keeps it both believable and true. Desire and its consequences ramble through the lives of this foursome in modern London. Are we in control of our emotions and desires, or do they control us? Do we consider the consequences of our actions or blindly go after what we want? Where does happiness lie? And where is that line that past which you can never get back from once crossed?"

Natalie and Julia's performances were flawless, as with Jude and Clive's compelling dialogues -- rings true to life, as if one would have just said them, just days ago in normal everyday life, this film is by no means a happy film, but in essence it is the very search for happiness itself, or is it contentment?, once found, how one will sacrifice and compromise for it, and yet break from it, and the truth, although we plainly see it, will always hurt, when said."

","Natalie Portman is the reason God created women in the first place, and she's the main reason for seeing this talky but absorbing film. Although Julia Roberts and Jude Law receive top billing, Ms. Portman and Clive Owen give the strongest performances, highlighting the difference between a mere ""star"" and a true actor. ""Closer"" is basically a photographed stage play. Fans excited by the prospect of the Israeli cutie playing a stripper will be disappointed that she's never completely naked, but she gives a complex and moving performance as a needy, clinging waif whose constant demand for love and affection drives men away. The characters talk about sex but we never actually see any of it. One part of this film I disliked, and which is annoyingly frequent in films made in Britain today (including another Julia Roberts vehicle, ""Notting Hill,"" is the almost obligatory display of self-loathing by the main characters. Do middle-class Brits really hate themselves so much? Maybe the loss of the Empire has robbed Britain of her sense of purpose; the U.K. seems fated to become nothing more than a political and economic satellite of the U.S. (what George Orwell in ""1984"" called ""Airstrip One."")"

","I loved closer. It was different, realistic and confrontational. It was nice to see a movie with such big celebs that didn't have a happy ending. Like life, it turned out not as we expect it too. The actors were great, Natalie Portman is a star and even though the other three characters were unlikeable, i liked alice/jane. She wasn't willing to give all of her self to the Dan character, and for good reason. She is also gobsmackingly desirable. Julia Roberts was also good and even if her Anna character was a indecisive sad sack, that's what i liked about it, because there are actually people out there like that! Relationships hardly ever work out and its nice to see something not in the typical, happily ever after Hollywood genre. After reading a lot of other opinions on this site i felt compelled to say my bit about this standout flick. Kudos to the cast and crew on such a gritty flick."

","My wife and I watched this movie the other night. I thought she had taken it from the comedy section, so I was prepared for some light hearted romance and relationship dynamics between between the four characters, maybe something along the line of Notting Hill meets Alfie. Maybe.<br/><br/>So I settled in to my 'chick flick' mode. However, I was not prepared for the crass and vulgar mess cobbled together by blind mice that makes up this 'film'.<br/><br/>Boy meets girl. Boy meets another girl as well whom he pines for. Other girl seems uninterested. Other girl meets another boy after boy no. 1. inadvertently sets them up on a sex chat line. Girl no. 1 is a 'klingon'. Boy no. 1 still wants girl no 2, but is happy to have girl no. 1 for now. Boy no. 2 likes girl no. 1 when they meet at a party, while boy no. 1 spends the time at the party trying to get into the pants of girl no. 2. Time passes. Boy no. 1 breaks up with girl no. 1 because he has been sleeping with girl no. 2 who in turn had married boy no. 2. Girl no. 1 is fascinated by the infidelity and asks for all the gory details before running out and becoming a stripper again.<br/><br/>Girl no. 2 breaks up with boy no. 2 because she has been sleeping with boy no. 1 all the time, even before she got married to boy no. 2 (presumably after the party encounter). Boy no. 2 runs out in anger and goes to the nearest strip club where he encounters (surprise, surprise) girl no. 1, but not before he asks girl no. 2 for all the sordid details of her encounter with boy no. 1.<br/><br/>And then... and then... who cares? How the actors and actresses thought this was a good script is beyond me.<br/><br/>It is nothing but immoral pap, moving excruciatingly along from one scene to the next. I felt like slapping all the characters to make them catch a wake-up. In fact this movie was so bad that we switched the DVD off about halfway through. What really burns my bottom is the fact that the money I spent on this rot will somehow, somewhere trickle into the pockets of the filmmakers, who will feel justified in making more.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money, people."

","I was so excited to see this movie. It seemed like a great plot, with great actors, and great sex scenes. However it did not reach it's potential. Yes, Clive, Julia, Jude, and Natalie were excellent in the film. But it was the most mysterious plot. They kept on going back and forth between each other. Why was there no back stbabbing? It seemed like both couples never got over each other. I was hoping to see some fights, but there was nothing. It was filled with horrible language, but no interesting sexual scenes. What was the point of the movie? There was no morals or anything, it had to be one of the weirdest movie's I've ever seen. I can not believe it has such a high rating. I do not recommend this movie, because it is extremely boring."
"manoj-aryan","10","1","1","8 May 2006"," Closer
","Cynical. In one word Closer is cynical. It all deals with love and lust, the old equation but still it is unique. Mike Nichols' Closer is a complex dark motion picture where we watch vulnerable selfish dimensions of human beings are explored and presented nude.<br/><br/>Four main protagonists. Dan (Jude Law) writes obituaries in London. Alice (Natalie Portman) is a stripper who has flied there to get out of a relationship. They meet in the opening scene of the film when Alice got hit by a cab and Dan gets her to hospital. They start talking and end up loving together. Dan who has written a fiction novel now on his relationship with Alice shows at Anna's (Julia Roberts) studio to photograph for book-jacket. Anna has read it and impressed on the way he has accurately depicted sexÂ…love in his novel. They feel the attraction towards each other as conversation continues and they kiss. But she steps back when she come to know Dan lives with Alice. ""You are taken"" she says. But Dan continues to lurk around Anna's studio. Then we meet Dr. Larry (Clive Owen) chatting with Dan on an adult site where Dan pretends to be Anna. Dan invites Larry at an aquarium as practical joke to meet. Ironically Anna happens to be there. Larry and Anna are now dating each other while Dan didn't stop craving for Anna. What happens next is best to watch on screen.<br/><br/>There is an obvious sexual tension between these. In one of the best scenes, in Art Gallary, where Anna's photo exhibition is in session Dan and Alice show up. Alice and Larry start conversing about the exhibition, Alice says ""It's a lie. It's a bunch of sad strangers photographed beautifully, and... all the glittering assholes who appreciate art say it's beautiful 'cause that's what they wanna see. But the people in the photos are sad, and alone..."". Larry learns about her profession as a stripper. He finds her attractive. He even leans to kiss her, she doesn't move but Larry shuns temptation with a smile and says, ""I'll see you around"". Dan says to Alice, ""I am your stranger JUMP!!!!"".<br/><br/>They deceive each other. They love, hurt, talk in fierce manner. In the process innocence is broken and all turn cold and nasty. Exploiting opponent's weaknesses and while doing so they don't care or even sometimes seem to take pleasure of that control. In another best scene where Larry shows up at Alice's strip club after splitting with Anna. Alice is all hurt still presents her as icy while Larry is all stripped emotionally in front of her begging crying in agony. He asks her to talk with her real life she says, ""Lying's the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off - but it's better if you do"". He pours all his money to give him her real name but she insists as her name is Jones. He asks her to move in with him. She snaps him with ""I am not your revenge fcuk!""<br/><br/>Conveniently manipulate their selves as per their means is another major aspect told here. These characters just blindly serve their desires but make sure as if love with their partner. Dan says ""What's so great about the truth? Try lying for a change, it's the currency of the world"". Look for its dialogs- snappy and witty. These highly eloquent characters are given lines to tear hearts.<br/><br/>Actors are at their best here. I love Clive Owen most. I just couldn't stop raving about his scene during strip club with Portman. His best line for me is ""Everything is the version of something else"". His transitions from caring to nasty are most painful to watch. Natalie Portman probably gave her career best so far here. Her pain right from the scene when she asks Roberts to take her photo with tears rolling down her chick. As something is burnt in that moment and never come back later. Jude Law's Dan and Julia Robert's Anna are again no doubt fine.<br/><br/>At the very end when Dan is back with Alice. He leaves to get smoke, he calls for lift and as lift door opens he sees himself in mirror and something strikes him. He just picks some flowers and goes back to Alice where she tells her the truth that she doesn't love him anymore. She tells her truth about the strip joint night. This ends up Closer bleak.<br/><br/>Is there ever any love in Closer or all was just human desires presented pretended as Love by these protagonists? Can men n women be that dangerous to lie in so believable manner? Is human heart that soulless? How can we hurt someone we love so brutally? With surgical precision Mike Nichols gave us Closer and left me numb. Alice asks Dan ""No one will ever love you as much as I do. Why isn't love enough?"" Larry heartbreakingly asks Anna ""Did you ever love me?"" Anna asks to Dan, ""Why did you swear eternal love when all you wanted was excitement? Love bores you."" Dan responds, ""No, it disappoints me."" Closer asks all these questions and if you are watching you have got your answers."
"The_Sandheaver","9","1","1","21 April 2006"," Strangely Compelling Drama
","This interesting drama is clever in that it can draw you into the stories and relationships between the four main characters purely through some amazing dialogue, some intense sexual chemistry, and through an incredible cast. It is also very unpredictable in comparison to many other films in the romantic genre, and for this, Closer deserves more recognition than your average romance film.<br/><br/>The film focuses on four characters. Alice (Portman, in arguably her best role to date), Dan (Law), Anna (Roberts) and Larry (Owen). After a series of chance encounters, the two principle relationships are developed. These are between Alice and Dan, the other between Anna and Larry. However, this twisted tale of lust, betrayal, deception and second chances takes a violent turn when Dan embarks on an affair with Anna and breaks off his relationship with Alice, with some revealing consequences that become important as the film goes on.<br/><br/>Portman gives a stellar performance as the teasing, yet highly emotional Alice, and Owen gives an equally good performance as the tactically minded Larry, who will engage anyone in a battle of wits, with interesting results. But, this isn't to say that Law and Roberts' performances aren't good, they are just simply outperformed. The result is some incredibly intense sexual chemistry, which is just begging to be released. You decide which of these types of scenes you'll find as the most arousing.<br/><br/>Told through a succession of shifts in time, fused with flashbacks that develop the situations, perfectly reflects how life isn't always straightforward, but sometimes, if you blink, you will miss it. This can be described as a psychological drama in the way that the relationships heat up through the amazingly intense scenes, and how people's minds do tend to lose proportionality when placed into a situation that has never previously been dealt with or dreamt of. But, the most interesting thing about this film is how it can deal quite a lot of arousal, even though there isn't any truly graphic/visual depiction of sex in the entire film.<br/><br/>Whatever your views on romantic/sexual films, this should interest with how destructive inter-related lives can be, and how far off the path of morality it can take us, and for anybody who can see any part of themselves in any of the four characters, they can fully appreciate the sharp turns life has, and how accurately the consequences of this are conveyed in the tumultuous relationships this film depicts.<br/><br/>A wonderful film, but beaten at the Oscars by a Million Dollar Baby. 9/10"

","A small film about love and betrayal. Mostly betrayal. It is obviously made from a play, with four main characters, any two of which are on-screen at all times. The plot is pretty good, albeit with its fair share of contrivances and coincidences. But, if not for these things, what would there be to make movies about? The four main actors were all excellent, though none are very likable. Jude Law pays his role as weaselly and pathetic. Clive Owens' character is macho, controlling, and conniving. Julia Roberts is, as always, oddly beautiful, although she looks a bit older now. This may have been a deliberate decision, to better contrast her with Natalie Portman's character. Miss Portman, when it is called for, is achingly beautiful. When she bestows on us a wide smile, I thought my TV would melt. I don't believe I've seen her in anything before. (Not being a Star Wars geek) (OK, I've just looked at her page, and it seems she played the little girl in ""The Professional"". She was quite good, but I did not recognize her twelve years later.) The real star, however, was the script. They all have such wonderfully clever dialog. I would say check it out."

","Much has been said about this sensitive four-hander. To work with Mike Nichols must have a lot to do with it, but the courage shown by Portman and Owen in accepting very difficult roles will pay dividends. Great acting has much to do with taking on roles that will test and challenge. Both Portman and Owen have huge talents yet I have never seen either stretched this far. They both were brilliant. They will be better for this and it will give them courage to accept future, difficult roles like these, so totally against type. Law and Roberts were in more comfortable territory and obliged well. Roberts devours the lens with her great beauty. Actually, I find her to be so beautiful it really is huge distraction from what's going on! The great virtuoso performances of the past from actors such as Brando and Olivier have all been hugely difficult roles but the great actor has the guts to tale on the role and make it real and truthful. How long did Olivier think about how he was going to play Richard or Archie Rice? Both very difficult roles that many lesser lights would avoid because of the degree of difficulty involved. Portman and Owen are going to be bigtime if they keep it up. On a lighter note,Miss Portman's world class callypygean charm was pretty sensational."
"slseel","8","1","1","16 January 2006"," Dark and Wonderful
","The challenge of making a film from a theatrical play is staying true to the work created by the playwright. Too often, the result is a film ""based"" on the play, but adapted to make use of all the crutches on which the modern day filmmaker relies, such as digital animation, car chases, explosions, jittering cameras and other special effects. No other director of the modern age has successfully stayed true to the work of the playwright than Mike Nichols as exhibited in such powerful films as the Graduate, Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolfe, Heartburn and now Closer.<br/><br/>I saw Patrick Marber's award winning play Closer when it first opened in London and then many years later when it showed up in Houston. When I heard Nichols was making a film of Closer, I had high hopes and Nichols does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Closer has only four actors (Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen) a handful of simple sets and a few street scenes. The screen play, adapted by Marber himself, is dialogue heavy, darkly serious, brutally honest and sometimes disturbing. Closer is the tale of two American women in London and their accidental intertwining of relationships with two English men. During their pursuit of love, the four characters struggle to understand the role of the truth while they weave their nest of lies and deceit.<br/><br/>Roberts plays the role of Anna, and she delivers a wonderful performance in a different manner than we are accustomed to seeing from her. Not the usual fast moving, comical script or dynamic characterization with contrived accents or lavish costumes. But her wonderfully brooding facial expressions, unique sense of presence and powerfully delivered dialogue are a critical part to the success of this film. I first suspected that Roberts would carry the film as she normally does, but surprisingly the Oscar nominated performance of Portman stands out from the already strong cast. She continues to impress, showing that her acting abilities extend far beyond that exhibited in the Star Wars prequels and roles previous to that. Portman's performance as Alice captivates, warms and shocks. We love her, care for her and keep trying to better understand her. I wondered after seeing the film the first time, if, to some extent, we are watching a passing of the baton from Roberts to Portman. Only time will tell. <br/><br/>Neither of the male roles draws much sympathy from us. Law is well cast as Dan, a rather weak and soft character incapable of cherishing the relationship he has with Ann. To the other extreme is successful but brutish Larry, played by Owen, And although we like Larry the least, he seems to understand truth the most. Both Law and Owen are perfect for their parts and deliver strong performances.<br/><br/>If you like a dark and powerful drama, I expect you'll adore Closer. And for that treat we can thank the teamwork of Marber and Nichols. The dialogue and story line of Marber coupled with Nichols' ability to coax from his cast that special something that keeps us pulled in even in the absence gun shots and roaring dinosaurs. But be warned; it's dark film without a happy ending to rescue you.<br/><br/>recommended<br/><br/>7.9"

","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>Okay, let's get something straight right away. If you cheat on your partner, you do NOT tell. In fact, if you are asked about who you slept with in the past, you do not tell. Even in junior high school you learned, you do not kiss and tell.<br/><br/>Cheating is the big lie. This movie is about cheating and lying. People cheat. They get tempted. They want excitement. People are animals. But it is worse than adding insult to injury if you cheat and tell. Don't cheat. But if you do, don't tell.<br/><br/>This is a clever--although I wouldn't call it slick--film about how attractive people of a certain age and milieu are always hitting on and being hit upon. It is about the shallowness of love and the urgency of sex. It is about pretty people on the screen fulfilling fantasies. The dialogue is hip, sharp, although sometimes too cute and superficial.<br/><br/>It is stylish and ephemeral. It has the facade of realism. Note that none of the characters have children and none of them are trying to save the world. They are sexual and emotional hedonists, and maybe they are saying something about our times, in the big cities of the Western world at the dawn of the new millennium. On the other hand, they are urban professionals, skillfully navigating their way through the urban jungle toward a life of fulfillment and meaning... Well, maybe not.<br/><br/>But the emotions that the characters experience are very real. When you love someone and that someone sleeps with your rival, it is very painful. And when you love someone and you find that that someone doesn't love you, it is very painful. But the psychological pain that is visited upon us at such times is also ephemeral and will pass.<br/><br/>If you live on a farm in the middle of Nebraska, Jude Law is not going to kiss you and tempt you into cheating on your husband even if you are as pretty as Julia Roberts. If you really are a plain Jane without style or looks, Clive Owen is going to pass you by as you sit in the aquarium. He'll study the fish. So this is really about Hollywood itself (although set in London) and the usual musical beds. This is TV's ""Friends"" in the raw. This is Mike Nichols updating Carnal Knowledge, his very sixties-ish quadrangle film released in 1971 starring Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel, Ann-Margret and Candice Bergen. As in Carnal Knowledge--and, by the way, in Milan Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being (made into a film starring Juliette Binoche)--there are four attractive, sexually active people who can't keep their hands off of one another. If you liked triangles, you randy geometricians, you'll really love quads, seems to be the thinking here.<br/><br/>Well, I did kind of like this film. What's not to like about Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Clive Owen? They are attractive and they are talented. The script from Patrick Marber adapting his play of the same name (with some very real influence from Milan Kundera's novel: note that in both cases there is a doctor and one of the women is in the sexual professions and the other is either a photographer or a painter) is witty and, yes, sexy. The direction by Mike Nichols (now in his seventies) is a little uneven and sometimes cryptic, especially as regards the ending and the beginning. (Never mind. I would like to discuss the ending, but, alas, that might spoil the film for somebody. As for the ""Boy Meets Girl, Cute"" beginning...well, it was VERY familiar.) But the film is crisply edited and there are no dead spots. You will be entertained, even if you later feel that you got seduced yourself and feel like you just ate a whole box of sugary bon-bons.<br/><br/>Irony: while Natalie Portman plays the lower-class stripper, in real life she is (or was) working toward a medical degree at Harvard.<br/><br/>And yes, Alice always lies and Larry always tells the truth...well, almost. Alice's character is very complex, but not entirely realized in the film. We are too much distracted by the sexcapades and the other personalities to see her as clearly as we might. Portman does a good job in a challenging role. There is something almost pathological about Alice that Portman conveys with modulated swings in mood and expression. Larry, the doc, is, as he tells us, the caveman, while Dan is the emotional pretty boy. And Anna...well, Anna is smart and has a deeper appreciation than the other characters of who she is and what she wants. And she does manage to get what she wants.<br/><br/>See this for Mike Nichols whose credits include Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966), The Graduate (1967), Silkwood (1983), Postcards from the Edge (1990), and a number of other very successful films. In Closer, he shows once again that he still knows what interests the current generation."

"imbluzclooby","4","1","1","18 December 2005"," A sickening look at needy and depraved people
","""Closer' is a four way love story that involves the characters of Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. This is was unusual in the sense that it focused much more on infidelities than it did on the relationships themselves. Nonetheless, it is rather fascinating. I don't think that in real life men are so openly grieving and express their heartache so clumsily. Being an American, I'm used to men shrugging off their feelings when they are hurt or disappointed in their women's behavior. Maybe it's an English thing? Maybe I'm different? But I found the dialog and relationships to be enthralling. Jude Law lacks perspicacity in dealing with women, but still has what it takes to earn their love. He's manipulative, but not a predator. He's just a selfish metro male who feels he can have his cake and eat it too. In the end he proves that he is weak and cannot face the consequences of his choices. Clive Owen is gruesome, sensitive, boorish and intimidating. He professes strong love to Natalie Portman after Julia Roberts leaves and rejects him. The scene in the strip parlor is a bit forced on emotion from Clive. As he expresses his pain to her, she simply plays it cool and executes her moves and routine with keen wit and style. He is like a slobbering oaf as he yearns and burns for her affection. This scene was painful to watch and I find it implausible when I heard of the outcome later, which I will not divulge or spoil for the reader. Julia Roberts has an interesting power over men by being passive. Her character was the most real. She knows she is no longer a spring chicken and willfully admits that she doesn't compare to Natalie's super petite and angelic beauty. Julia looked less glamorous here than in her usual roles. By comparison she looks like a big giraffe next to the tiny and very pretty young Portman. We know that Julia's character wasn't spiteful. If she was, she could have decked Portman with one punch. Portman's character (Alice) seems to be a focal point in everyone's fate. And the three children she saved were Jude, Julia and Clive. Whatever it was, maybe it was from themselves? From the downside of love? That final scene didn't much grab me, but rather confused me. This is involving and interesting drama for the generation x crowd. Especially, for young romantics who want to learn or study relationships from a bird's eye. I do feel that ""Closer"" lacked on the essence of the relationships and what the couples had consummated together. But it does focus on how people tick when it comes to infidelity and people's needs for love, affection and self esteem. I, like many of the commentators, felt depressed and sick after watching this, without knowing why. This movie will try to make you believe that relationships are hopeless, love doesn't really exist, women are conniving sluts, and men are lustful pigs incapable of any inner strength."
"zhmaqot","7","1","1","4 December 2005"," Another entry in the adult's mature school of film-making.
","Mike Nichols brings us an exercise in love and poses some complex - some pretentious - questions about the nature of humans. The motif that generally brackets each scene as repetition of the last with different variables could be taken as a statement that we are all the same as humans, that it needn't matter if it's Natalie Portman and Jude Law arguing or Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. That love is as material as those advertising it. Or it could be that it shouldn't be taken that far, and it is actually a simple examination of our nature as lovers: to love; to quarrel.<br/><br/>But whatever the film's repetitive structure is supposed to pertain, the film is ultimately a purposely complicated result of pseudo-maturity. The relentlessly ornamental dialogue is beautiful, and sounds like post-modern Chandler in a romance-drama setting. And for all its tricky one-line-ruminations, it gives the film a scent of Nouvelle Vague surrealism that would be - and IS - stale in any other modern movie. Nichols' direction is as stagely as the dialogue - not to say that it's theatrical - and gives the film a sense of refreshment. The London mist and grey-white streets, accompanied by Goldblatt's bare cinematography and the sparely tragic Damien Rice soundtrack all seat quietly next to one another to finish off the film's hush and lull sensibility. <br/><br/>The actors, too, are superb, and each withhold their characters with reassuring strength. The real darling of it all, however, is the overall feeling of conception about it. In the same way music can be conceptualised into a purposeful evocation of any theme, Closer is a document of love, and how it affects us, though not on such a large scale: it is a document of love affecting four people, and how they affect us. <br/><br/>This film is, for those who like to analyse-beyond-the-artist's- intentions, uncharted territory. But for shallower viewers, and viewers with more insight than either alike, Mike Nichols' 2004 outing is one that will be most enjoyed by those who believe maturity means being angry and upset."
"masterjk2","6","1","1","27 November 2005"," Slick Shtick
","Mike Nichols has taken a work of dubious value and turned it into something that shimmers at times with brilliance. But the brilliance comes from the directing and the acting. Not the writing. There is the shtick of fast forwarding everything so that we progress through 4 years of time, effortlessly and without the entanglements of life, only their conflicts. There is the shtick of using Cosi Fan Tutti in the background, reminding us that such parlor room farces have been popular for centuries. And there is the shtick of 4 card pick up at every re-entering of the ""now."" Each time we have to sort out who is with whom this time, as those cards had merely been tossed into the air and fell down this way or that. The dialog is witty, a few times. Verbose always. Animated always. And comes in short staccato bursts, like machine gun fire--- or more like the lob of a tennis ball over a net of neutrality. Larry: So Anna tell me your bloke wrote a book. Any good? (lob) Alice: Of course. (return) Larry: It's about you isn't it? (lob) Alice: Some of me. (return) Larry: Oh? What did he leave out? (lob) Alice: The truth. (return) I don't believe that mature, intelligent people talk this way. They may if they see enough movies like this one where life once again imitates art. It's cute. It's meant to be funny. It's e/mail talk. The most worrisome aspect of this movie is that many people seem to relate to it. That's not a compliment to the movie- it's a sad comment upon our society. These people bounce from one another like balls in a pin ball machine, being hit by a paddle of emotion which inexorably forces them into the arms of another. I have no doubt that many people live such lives, but it's sad. Each professes love for the other, at some point, but has no concept of what loving someone means. Part of having a loving relationship is devoting so much time and energy to that relationship it becomes the most important thing in your life. These people are all so wrapped up in themselves they really don't have the ability to love. There is nothing wrong with writing a screenplay about such people as long as the audience understands that you are not displaying it as a model for life, but rather offering a moral that this lifestyle is only self destructive. This movie doesn't do that. We are left with one relationship which is broken but the other seems to survive through pure inertia. The final shtick of Dan's discovery that Alice Ayers is not really Alice Ayers, thus denoting that their whole relationship had been a lie from the beginning, is an amusing, if not silly twist. How could someone from the USA get jobs and live in the UK and never divulge her real name? They've lived together for almost 4 years, off and on. It's more pleasing when plots make sense."
"ddmaingot","8","1","1","21 November 2005"," What a movie
","I saw Closer on the day it was released and following that day I summoned as many people as I could to see this film. The film relies heavily on its four characters whom as actors all have great strength in the film. Clive Owen gives a fantastic and seemingly effortless performance and proved to the American market that he is an actor that we should all be taking note of. Julia Roberts stunned me. It was wonderful to see her in a role with zero likability and to watch her go head on into it fearlessly. I heard Cate Blanchett was to play the role of Anna which I would love to have seen. I think she could have taken it somewhere Julia Roberts just isn't capable of. Ironically Cate Blanchett beat Natalie Portman for her performance in this film. Jude Law is phenomenal and repulsive all at once. There isn't a single character that we can feel bad for, which I think was a weak point, but that may have been the point. Natalir Portman hands down steals the show in what is her most grown up and involved role to date. All of the performances are great but what Natalie Portman brings to the character, the screen, and the film is AMAZING. Her losing at Oscar time was rather disappointing to me. I think this is a movie that deserves to be seen. Not everyone will like it, but there is brutal honesty. I would concur that the honesty is dramatized for the screen and hearing these people talk we may think ""people in relationships don't talk like that."" Though we may not, at least in Closer the characters will say what we think and want to say."

","This was a great movie, i just watched it for the 2nd time. Hauntingly romantic, but at the same time it is pure lust. Major themes in this movie are lies and truth, cowardice, guilt, etc. While watching this, at times i feel like love is all that matters and then at other times it's about compromise and adapting to one person. Not sure really what to say, you hafta go see the movie for yourself. Performance-wise, it was great. Personally i've never been able to identify female acting talent, but Natalie Portman proves me wrong. She gives the greatest female performance ever given, in my eyes. Idk who smited her at the Oscars, but whoever it was didn't deserve it, she did. Jude Law & Roberts were good, but Clive Owen was much better. He perfected his part. Basically, if you like feeling and like being moved and touched by films, go see this. It makes you think about life and makes you want to explore it."
"jk8n","7","1","1","18 October 2005"," A play within a film by Mike Nichols
","I have neither read nor seen the play this film is based on, but Mike Nichols does not attempt to take ""Closer"" outside the parameters of a filmed play. I don't mind that technique, Nichols has filmed many a play and he is so very good at it. Any problem the film may have is likely a reflection of the play itself. I'm guessing that Mike Nichols did more with this play than any other stage director could. I happen to really like plays about relationships between men and women, but I had the sense that the dialog was a bit too influenced by David Mamet. While the play's ideas and narrative were fine and thoughtful, I think it would have been a better play if it wasn't so derivative of Mamet. Only Mamet should do Mamet, and this playwright would have been better off using his own voice. ""Closer"" is an example of how a great director and great performances can elevate a play that is good enough, but maybe not as good as these players' skill at interpreting it."
"ally_marie17","10","1","1","10 October 2005"," A great and truthful film....
","This movie holds a heart for every kind of lover in the world: the cheater, the victim, the detached, the naive, the obsessed, the aloof, the romantic, the strong. Natalie Portman is absolutely sweetly intoxicating as Alice, while Jude Law's character, Dan, provokes everything deliciously selfish and romantic within us, the viewers. Julia Roberts delivers an amazing, and unusual, performance as an emotionally cool and detached Anna Cameron. And the icing on this lovely lopsided cake is Clive Owens who is stunning in his role with witty and thought provoking lines perfectly delivered. All of the characters move and transverse in their roles throughout the film. They emerge to us as one thing, but quickly change to another. The closest I've personally ever seen to actual human beings in any film; these characters suck all of the drama out of our own lives, or at least allow us to forget it, as they deal with their own self-manufactured messes. It's comforting to see the worst in all of us reflected in such interesting and gorgeous characters who continually strive for a perfect ending and fail beautifully throughout. And yet, above all, this film is for the betrayed and the betrayer in any relationship. It feeds compassion in the soul for the lover you still hate for hurting you so. It begs you to forgive yourself and see the wreckage you caused when you slept with a forbidden other. If you ever wanted to know what betrayal looked like from all aspects, this is the movie for you. Love is no longer a Shakespearean sonnet or dew misted rose; it is a prism, gleaning different shades of emotion from every angle, sharply drawing blood every time you touch it. This movie leaves you staring stunned and your chest bursting with questions only you can answer. In ""Closer"" there are no guilty parties, no bad guys, no heroes. There is only an accurate reflection of each one of us, at one time or another in this crazy life."

","This film depicts self-centered, immature people who seem to spend no time with any friends or family... no time on their nominal jobs... but an inordinate amount of time screwing the other 3 characters--either literally or figuratively--and promoting Philip Morris products.<br/><br/>I was completely unconvinced by the sexual choices Julia Roberts makes--when she talked about whom she was involved with and why, it just sounded like she was reading a script.<br/><br/>I don't get why this picture is for ""mature audiences""--it depicts behavior one sees in adolescents who turn to using sex for power, drinking, and smoking because they are neglected at home.<br/><br/>This movie is an egregious example of cigarette advertising. In fact, smoking seems to be more desirable than sex in this film--since tobacco usage is depicted almost constantly and actual sex is only talked about.<br/><br/>A Philip Morris cigarette brand has been prominently placed... right along with the Sony laptops.<br/><br/>Occasionally a character halfheartedly states that he or she has quit--but that is meaningless. The image left in one's mind is of the character smoking. Smoking is portrayed as deeply pleasurable, sexy, comforting, and oh-so-naughty.(If you doubt that this film encourages people to smoke, read some of the things viewers have posted on the message board.) <br/><br/>Dr. ""Stubble,"" the dermatologist--would you trust him to treat your acne?--seems unconcerned that smoking causes people's skin to thin, wrinkle, and sag by the time they turn 35.

Nope, he's too busy getting' busy with other screwed-up people."
"viggoslayer","9","1","1","25 September 2005"," The thing of it is...
","I'm not sure what I expected from this movie. I've always been a fan of Julia Roberts but never because I thought that she was a great actress. I simply trusted her to be likable and deliver a watchable, cookie-cutter performance. I think Natalie Portman is a timeless beauty, a formidable actress who reminds me more and more of Audrey Hepburn. She is an old soul with a childlike quality that draws you into her. Clive Owen is perfect. He is handsome, rugged, masculine, and a wonderful actor. Jude Law I have never liked. The first movie that I saw him in, The Talented Mr. Ripley, solidified my critical opinion of him. And yes, I have seen his other movies, I ""heart"" Huckabee, etc. He was OK in them, tolerable, but nothing more than that.<br/><br/>This movie changes my opinion of all of them. It forces all of these actors to deliver performances that every other actor should be jealous of. They reached someplace very deep, dark and real and in turn we are left emotion so raw that it feels like you are watching a stage play. They make demands of themselves and on each other that makes me believe that they truly understand. Often I am left empty after watching these beautiful Hollywood personas ""act"" a role that I know they cannot relate to. The writing in this movie/play is so good that no matter your station in life or lack of experience with the drama and passion that unfolds on the screen before you, you cannot help but believe that they get it. All four of them understand the essential theme of the movie and use their character to portray that understanding."

","The usual antics for romantic dramas are stripped off from this movie.Personally, I think it takes real experience with the dynamics of relationship and affairs to really appreciate the plot and characters.It is quaint, honest and anyone can relate at some point to the characters. I highly commend Natalie and Owen for their brilliant performance. I believe it was a great display of Portman's maturity on the silver screen. She certainly now has the edge to make it to greater lead roles. If you watched this film and got confused in the midst of their bickering, i strongly advise that you watch it again, open your mind and let it just sink.It'll be one of the best dramas you'll ever see.."
"jhsteel","7","1","1","12 September 2005"," Disturbing and pessimistic
","I found this movie difficult to watch because of its content. It was based on a play and even though I didn't know that before I saw it, I realised immediately because of the quality of the dialogue and the lack of reality in the situations. As in some plays, I felt that the author was experimenting with human relationships, to see how extreme he could make them. At the start, I felt I could understand what was happening in the relationships, but as the movie progressed, some of the things that happened were so implausible that I found it hard to remain interested. Having studied relationships in real life, I wasn't shocked by the language or what the characters did, I just found it unbelievable.<br/><br/>It works as a study in how people can behave and interact, but not as a reflection of a reality that I have experienced. There was no sense of real love or genuine caring there, the partner switching happened too quickly, none of the characters won my sympathy and in the end, I didn't care what happened to them. The best thing I can say about it is that at the end, I felt really glad to be me, because my life is so much better than theirs (whatever I might feel about it the rest of the time). However, the performances were great, especially Natalie Portman and Clive Owen."
"rixxxhbk","10","1","1","22 August 2005"," Great Study of Relationships and Truth
","I saw Closer in a theater with my girlfriend. We did not know what to expect. Within five minutes, I realized this was a mistake. Not because the film was bad, but because the film reveals a great truth about trust within relationships. As soon as my girlfriend and I made it past the exit doors of the cinema, I could systematically count down her next words: 5...4...3...2...1 ""Have you ever cheated on me?"" Mike Nichols and Patrick Marber show you the selfishness of love...and for some it can be a hard pill to swallow. Most critics of the film state that they do not relate to the story or these anti-hero characters. I would argue that selfishness and deceit are part of this culture and that we are finally beginning to admit it. Other works have dealt with the subject recently (Sideways, Television Commercials that portray infidelity, Eyes Wide Shut) and it is the hardest emotion to battle: The thought of the person you love being emotionally and physically attached to someone else. The four main characters do not have to justify their actions since their deceit is not rational. We do not learn why Dan leaves Ruth for Alice nor do we learn why Larry and Anna reconcile. Why not? Think about previous relationships and the others around you. Have they based their relationship decisions on one single act (such as other Hollywood films would argue) ? No, reasons for our actions are selfish, awkward, spontaneous and/or sometimes, repressed. Closer is a true study of 'civilization' and its collective unconscious.<br/><br/>Besides the deep subject matter lies the no-nonsense approach of Patrick Marber's writing. The audience is spared the simpleness of subtitles stating the progress of time. In fact, Nichols and Marber seem to purposely let the story progress without interruptions. The end result is a raw display of emotions and a quick-witted situation for all four characters. Subject matter and form collide as the characters are drawn together within the same circle of deceit and self-interest.<br/><br/>Clive Owen and Natalie Portman give performances of a lifetime and Nichols gives everyone another reason to love him as a great Director. The soundtrack also provides a great emotion for the film that flows through you like a dream and a nightmare simultaneously."
"missjr","9","1","1","11 August 2005"," Intense
","Wonderfully acted and intensely psychological, this is the type of film that is meant to be viewed more than once. The film proves to be the most realistic depiction of adult relationships that I have ever seen on the screen. There is no simple explanation for their problems and emotions, the characters and the plot are both extremely complex. Closer's presentation of realistic and highly conflicted characters reminds me a lot of those in Tennessee Williams's Streetcar Name Desire. If you are in the mood for a film that really makes you think and gives you something to reflect back on later then I would highly recommend this film to you."

","An intelligent and difficult film 'Closer' asks questions, and the audience chooses whether to investigate what is presented.<br/><br/>There are no easy answers and none are offered.<br/><br/>My guess is that most people would rather dismiss the film than dwell on the very uncomfortable issues presented; after all reflection is very hard work and we are mostly not used to it.<br/><br/>Will total honesty always destroy relationships<br/><br/>Will sexual jealousy always destroy relationships<br/><br/>What stops us acting on our impulsive desires; is it our 'moral rectitude' or our fear of the consequences<br/><br/>How can we live a compromise and still be true to ourselves<br/><br/>What would a win-win compromise look like in the context of a relationship<br/><br/>If we have lied can we still trust that someone else is telling us the truth<br/><br/>Are we stuck in a relationship because our fear of the unknown is greater than our present unhappiness<br/><br/>How great is our need for control in a relationship or do we need another to control us<br/><br/>I noticed that it was the men who needed to know every detail of the so-called 'truth'. Maybe it is the case that women can live with a deal more uncertainty and compromise than men.

"openeyes","Null","1","1","3 June 2005"," A boring, predictable throwback
","Two couples, Jude Law and Natalie Portman and Clive Owen and Julia Roberts, play mixed-doubles in this supposedly honest and adult drama. After a long summer of teenage-fare at the movies, I, like many others, start to get a hunger for adult fare and themes. This should have been just what the doctor ordered. But it wasn't. Although I was impressed by both Natalie Portman and Clive Owen, I found myself groaning inwardly throughout this entire film. I didn't believe it for a second. For a film that was supposedly challenging and startling, I found it utterly predictable. I found myself saying the lines before the characters. (Granted, there was an occasional insightful turn of a phrase, but, overall, I was under whelmed by the script.) Now predictability isn't necessarily a bad thing. I knew how ""Downfall"" was going to end but I was at the edge of my seat anyway. My problem is that I didn't buy the characters and the way they talked to each other. All I saw was the artifice, and not the artifice the characters presented to shield themselves, but instead the artifice of the actors themselves and the writer. Despite some forceful performances, it struck me as phony. This film is little more than a throwback to the ""deep"" relationship films of the late-60s and early-70s. Had this film been released instead of ""Carnal Knowledge"" or ""Bob & Carol and Ted & Alice,"" even I'd probably be calling it a masterpiece. That's part of the problem. It seemed to speak to that society, not ours. The obvious comparison is with Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut."" It covers some of the same emotional territory, and was also a product of past sensibilities, but I found that film challenging. Why? Mainly because the narrative took me places I didn't expect to go. The central themes about fidelity and trust were, frankly speaking, trite. However, that film's vivid characters and suddenly turn to mystery and the macabre kept me on my toes. I predicted every plot turn on this film and got bored waiting for the characters to catch up to me. I wish I could have shared the rapture many of the reviewers here felt when they saw this film, but it just didn't work for me."
"itamarscomix","8","1","1","24 May 2005"," Very Good
","Once again, Mike Nichols shows us just how clever he is. I don't agree that this is his best film in years - let's not forget Primary Colors, Birdcage, and the heavenly brilliant Angels in America (ignore Wolf and What Planet Are You From), but it certainly is a return to his roots, and definitely his most serious and straightforward film in many years, probably since Carnal Knowledge. It shares, in fact, many of the themes and qualities of Carnal Knowledge (as well as other early classics like the Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf) - Like that film, its scale is very small in place and very large in time, following a small group of characters over long time gaps; likewise, we only catch glimpses of their lives, and get most of the information on important events from the characters themselves. Like Carnal Knowledge, Closer focuses on inter-relations between the four main characters, betrayal, mistrust and insincerity. Closer is bleaker, though. It's probably the bleakest thing Nichols had done. It's a downer that doesn't seem extremely special and original as you watch it, but it sticks with you. After all, that's an important mark of a good film.<br/><br/>As for the acting, now: despite my patriotic support of Natalie Portman (her being originally from Israel) and my undying love for her ever since I saw her as a child in Leon, she didn't really impress me in Closer. She tries to be sexy and mysterious, but she's still just a sweet girl, and she doesn't truly convince. Julia Roberts had always gotten on my nerves, and Closer is no exception. The male actors are the ones who really outdo themselves here; Jude Law and Clive Owen are both fantastic, obnoxious and pathetic at the same time as only a real man can be. You despise them and you pity them and you understand them. You are them. These are two great young actors who have a bright future ahead of them.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, Mike Nichols never did write his own texts. All of his films were written by other people, and like Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf and Angels in America, Closer is also an adapted play. Yet he has a fascinating way of making the texts his own. The dialogues in Closer are well-written, no doubt; but just like in his previous films, it's his brilliant dialogue directing with which Nichols leaves his distinct mark and which makes it convincing, amusing and unnerving all at once. Nichols may not have a vision like Kubrick, Coppola or Scorsese, but he does what he does the best anyone could.<br/><br/>Closer is not an essential, and it's not one of the best films of the year. It's well worth a watch though, especially if you're a Mike Nichols fan or if you enjoy human relations melodramas. Not great, but very good."

","From the very first notes of the horrible opening music, I knew I was up for a pretentious pile of garbage. By the time it ends with the same crap song you'll wish it'd been just an annoying dream you had while napping to that track, but the sad news is these 2 hours will really have passed and you gained nothing out of it. Unless you got there just to see the Natalie Portman's campy strip-dance that makes Elizabeth Berkley in ""Showgirls"" look like Rita Moreno.<br/><br/>I can imagine Hollywood suits brainstorming about an original romance to make - original ideas still get audience, so there's a market demand for them - but as everyone knows, they're not really good at it, so they just take an average romcom and reverse everything. Instead of sympathetic characters we get a bunch of shallow creeps. Feelings are replaced by instincts, morality by lack of it, and relationships are formed in sole purpose of breaking them later on. The ending is of course, sad, as opposed to sugary epilogues of formulatic romances, and the cars drive on left, because most of the action takes place in England. Long story short, it's just as worthless, clichéd, stupid and tasteless as most of Hollywood romances, the only difference being it's depressive. I figure it's because it's not aimed at teens-who-believe-in-the-love-for-life, but at their cretinous parents-divorced-multiple-times who believe that having 3 broken marriages makes them emotionally mature and experienced in the subject of love. No wonder it gets Hollywood critics off - finally a movie with characters they can identify with.<br/><br/>I'd recommend about a random french romance to see theme of unfaithfulness tackled in a way that won't insult your intelligence. ""Closer"" is to be avoided unless you're looking for a movie to take your partner to and dump him/her afterwards."

""It's the only way to leave,"" says Alice (Natalie Portman) Ayres. Director Mike Nichols deserved more than mere nominations for the big screen adaptation of the award winning play, even though he shot it chronologicallyfor the most partrather than Tarantino style. Nichols also forgot caption to capture transition in his rendition. Now, the audience must pay close attention to the dialogueGod forbid. So far, Patrick (playwright-turned-screenwriter) Marber's accurate portrayal of Love's uncertainty does not disappoint either. One should consult the original text for further insight regarding a masterpiece. Films leave out some of the best lines sometimes: Anna (Depressive) says, ""Love bores you."" ""No, it disappoints me,"" replies Daniel Woolf (in Sheep's Clothing). Then again, the somewhat-unrealistic dialogue improves when Alice (the Wonderland) bursts out ""what a FLOOZY"" instead of ""what a sl*t"" to a stranger in public. ""If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking,"" according to the ""Closer"" tag line. Luckily, love at first sight tops the rare encounters chart. Infatuation serves as one of two reasons why true believers ""never stop looking."" The worst thing a person can do is get to know someone. The process dismisses a great deal ofif not allideals. Remember, there is no such thing as ""perfect."" The second boils down to lust at first sight. Both mistake it for love until burning passion consumes all other aspects of their relationship.

Of course, not all of us look quite as beautiful as this cast, but the long for love and the reality of human frailty is as true for regular folk as it is for the Julia Roberts of the world.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around four people and their relationships with one another. The story unfolds in a relatively small number of scenes that jump thru time, often giving just enough clues at the beginning of each scene to fill in the gaps concerning events that took place since the last scene. In this way the movie allows the viewer to skip the day to day routine of their lives and focus instead on the intense emotional moments.<br/><br/>Although the characters are very human they are not very nice, which is what made it disturbing for me to recognize elements of them in myself. Still, the performances are all spot on and so intense that I actually found myself holding my breath at several points during the film. For Portman especially, this feels like a break out film that changes her image from girl to woman. Clive Owen also turns in an amazing performance that never quite lets you sympathize with or completely hate his character.<br/><br/>Finally, be warned that the subject matter and language of the film are very adult and that the film is essentially all talk talk talk.

Unfortunately, I was not happy with the way it ended. It seemed like a rather simple and uneventful ending for characters so complex. Yet, the acting is of a superior order. The characters are a lot more realistic than most that I see in movies. Furthermore, my rather disturbing sense of identification with the character of Larry (played by Clive Owen) definitely contributed to the appeal of the movie. Larry is a man who has been hurt. He is obsessive and dwells on the inconsequential. This movie is definitely not ""lite fare"". In a sense, it caters exclusively to those that have been in relationships that are far from normal."

","This movie is based on a play. Though i have not seen this play, i am strongly convinced that it is a wonderful play. And the author must be very talented to create such an amazing piece of art! <br/><br/>4 characters are crazy in love, that what they think. In fact, they are all wrong. They mistake love with something else, something passionate with kiss and sex but that something is definitely not love. Their mistakes depress all the four. People never be satisfied with what they have. People are greedy, never stop looking for more. That is so true with Dan and Anna. Dan has Alice, Anna has Larry. However, when being attracted to each other, Dan and Anna give up their respective lovers without any hesitation! They are selfish. I never like Julia Roberts, and i'm not interested in Anne. She is such a coward.<br/><br/>Seemingly, the film is dominated by two supporting actor  Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. They are just wonderful. Their talent in this movie earned each of them 1 golden globe and an academy award nomination. I think they more than deserve the awards.<br/><br/>Larry (played by Clive Owen) is called a bastard but nobody could contempt him. He is kind of sex-obsessed but he is very forward. I think that Larry and Anne make such a couple.<br/><br/>Alice (played by Natalie Portman) has a very complicated characteristic. She has the face of an angel, i quite agree with that! Nat did a great job. She always tries to escape, to disappear. She is weak and strong at the same time. She is something very near, very lively but at the mean time, she is so far away, so far that nobody really be able to catch her or understand her. I love Alice! <br/><br/>The Damien Rice's song ""blowers Daughter"" is beautiful. Whenever i hear that song,i kind of cry. The lyric is simple but touching. The rhythm is so lilting that i don't think i'm able to describe it in words.<br/><br/>""If you believe in love at first sight, You never stop looking"" is true <br/><br/>9 out of 10!"
"Kandarpactor","8","1","1","27 March 2005"," Strong story of vulnerable Characters
","CLOSER is a strong story of 'weak' characters, an honest tale of dishonesty, a fiction of 'almost-real' characters. Sounds paradoxical but its a fact. Movie revolves around four characters Dan - A writer/journalist (Jude Law), Anna - A photographer divorceé (Julia Roberts), Larry - A dermatologists (Cliver Owen) and Alice - A Stripper (Natalie Portman). The movie is all about passions, love, lust, sex, obsession, infidelity and life. Well, it seems that you wonder whether this is a Mike Nicholas-movie or Zalaman King-movie? Well, don't worry. This is an absolutely beautiful movie of soft human emotions and their vulnerability.<br/><br/>The movie is an example of directorial excellence. It is well-paced, well-written and brilliantly-executed. There are only four characters and surprisingly all four have equal space to grow and get noticed. The script (Patrick Marber) is the strongest aspect of the movie. Probably because it is based on a play by the same writer. The movie proceeds in a fast but enjoyable rhythm. The movie sets an example for all youngsters who aspire to take up movie direction as their passion of life. ( For example, Jude Law is seen crying with same facial expressions and intensity in Alfie also, but his tears look much more convincing in this movie).<br/><br/>So far as performances are concerned, Jude Law and Julia Roberts are wonderful. Especially Julia Roberts has done an excellent underplayed character, which only an actress of her maturity can do. However, their lesser known counterparts, Owen and Portman, walk away with louder applause. Owen is simply superb as a simple but overreacting and obsessed husband. Natalie Portman portrays her difficult character with an astonishing ease. She has all it would take to dominate the silver screen for the next decade.<br/><br/>The movie reaches near perfection, in terms of performances, stories and dialogues. However, it depends heavily on dialogues (probably because it is based on a play). Hence, it involves the viewer mentally in the process of development of the storyline. The characters and story are so dangerously close to reality that it is difficult not to get provoked and engulfed in thoughts. So, if you are a university student, and want to watch it with a view to getting some relaxation after exams, don't watch closer. For that we have 'Hitch'........"
"christian123","7","1","1","26 March 2005"," A nearly flawless film that holds your attention
","Closer is one of the best films of the year and was defiantly snubbed from the Oscars. Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen play four strangers in London who fall in love, and then betray their partners with each other in Patrick Marber's adaptation of his own award-winning 1997 play. I had heard of the play before and it sounded really good so I saw this film. In one word this film is amazing, The acting, writing everything is top-notch and this is a must see for any movie fan. Its a thoughtful look on adult relationships and the result it pretty good. I thought the best actor in the cast was Natalie Portman, her performance is so good and its probably better then you would expect it to be since she's so young. Julia Roberts is the worst out of the four but that doesn't mean her performance was bad. I usually don't like her that much but she certainly surprised me. Jude Law is a good actor and gives a great performance as well. Last but not least is Clive Owen, I haven't really heard much about him but after this film I will defiantly be checking out his other work. Mike Nichols does a great job of directing and he was certainly snubbed from the Oscars. The dialog is great with a lot of sharp lines that may have turned some people off. The film is somewhat depressing and its hard to feel sorry for the characters but the film doesn't expect you to. The movie is only 104 minutes long and its not hard to follow the story either. The film is not completely realistic though, like I had some trouble believing some stuff but I wouldn't look too much into them. Rating 9/10 a very fine film and one that's worth checking out."
"bigfoot6161","8","1","1","24 March 2005"," Solid, Emotionally Intense Film
","This movie was, in my opinion, one of the year's best films. The acting was incredible and completely engrossing. I am partial to Natalie Portman and Clive Owen, but I really dislike Julia Roberts, so I figure it balances out. The editing did exactly what it needed to, no more and no less. It was nothing to get excited about but it aided in the film's pace which is exactly what it should have done. The directing made it easy to see that this film was a stage production first. It was translated well onto celluloid, more than likely due to the fact that Mike Nichols directed both incarnations of the story. It is disheartening that the academy all but forgot about this film (despite the Supporting actor/actress categories). There is no doubt that it deserved Best Picture, Editing, and Director nominations that Ray got. The only negatives I found with this film was that it dragged in some places and fell victim to the overly emotional virus in one or two scenes. If you aren't opposed to either of these things, do yourself a favor and see this film."
"Spanky Ward","10","1","1","20 March 2005"," To Far Away
","I am a writer. I finished my newest creation today, a 121 page (Which is short for me so I'm quite proud of myself) light drama. I printed out and hefted my new creation, basking in that glory only a writer can feel, or maybe a parent with a newborn child. I rewarded myself with a midnight screening of this film. I went into it both excited, because I'm a huge Portman fan, (Based my first screenplay on her)and scared, because the weather's been pretty bad, and I need new tires. Sorry, that had nothing to do with the film. Anyway, needless to say, I was not let down. So few films throw me for a loop. I, as a writer, and I'm sure many others as well, attempt to anticipate, or predict the next move of the film. The characters dialogue, the action, the ending. I was helpless in this film. I thought I knew both how it ended, and how it should end, and I was wrong on both accounts. The dialog was great, and when mixed with the talent of these fine wielder's of the written word, I began to feel extremely terrible. I thought about my newborn, at home, sleeping peacefully on my desk. My thoughts became that of a father with a new child. Those questions began to arise, the ones everyone pretends not to have. What will it grow up to be? Will it be any good or bad? Will people love or hate it? But most importantly, will I love it? Suddenly I felt ashamed of my newborn, comparing my dialogue to that of the films. I had a sudden urge to run back home and start a new script, ""maybe this child will turn out better, I've failed with the last one"" Let me mention at this point that I have no kids, so I most likely have no idea what the hell I'm talking about. It is 2:30 am, after all and I just wanted to write something without actually having to start a new script tonight. OK, enough of the rambling, I loved this movie, I loved Natalie Portman's work, I knew she was talented, but I had no idea to what degree. Clive Owen, man, he would be the best big brother man...I don't have a clue what that means...anyway, Julia is good, she didn't have that big of part, and man, I never feel sorry for guys that are better looking then me, but I felt bad for Jude Law, even though he deserved it, I mean, come on, what person in their right mind would cheat on Natalie. (The only unrealistic part of the film by the way!) Any way, bravo, you entertained me and made me feel like hell, way to go! Until next time."

","I find it kind of difficult to tell friends what this movie is about. I generally say it's about a few people who screw each other over. To me this movie seems to suggest that good-looking people all just want to seduce each other. I wonder what this movie would be like with the same script but ugly actors? Anyway, I found this movie interesting throughout, with excellent performances and some riveting scenes, but I also found all the people unlikeable and felt less like I was involved in the personal lives of the characters and more like I was watching them under a microscope. I didn't really care about any of these people. Maybe Portman's character a little, since she was the most naive, but really, they aren't likable or sympathetic in the least. But I'd say it's worth seeing, and for what it's worth, my girlfriend seemed to love it."
"canadude","6","1","1","18 March 2005"," ""Closer"" may be an adaptation, but it feels like a contrived play
","""Closer"" is based on a play which analyzes modern relationships. It's set in London and it features two Americans (played by Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman) and two Brits (Jude Law and Clive Owen). I don't know if the insistence on this particular gender and national divide possesses any significance to the overall story, but the overall story seems to be unsure of its own purpose - so in the end the question itself is questionable.<br/><br/>""Closer"" reminds me of ""Lantana,"" the Australian film with Barbara Hershey and Geoffrey Rush, which I think is a much better film (also based on a play, might I add). Both films deal with relationships, but while ""Lantana"" focuses on trust being the key to a relatively successful relationship, ""Closer"" takes a much more misanthropic view underlining that sometimes honesty can compromise love as well.<br/><br/>And even that statement is not an entirely accurate assessment of the film's purpose because ""Closer"" makes many jumps. Whether they be logical, psychological or temporal - I don't think the story rings as true as it was intended to. Now Mike Nichols is a phenomenal director with great films under his belt, and some great play adaptations (among them ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and the recent ""Angels in America""), but ""Closer"" is far from his best. It's actually beautifully directed, shot and, let me tell you, full of impressive performances. Jude Law shines as always, as does his antagonist, Clive Owen who gives a particularly good performance as an honest brute. Julia Roberts surprised me as the woman for whom both Jude Law and Clive Owen's characters fall. Natalie Portman seemed miscast to me - she was incredible in ""Garden State"" and she has great range and talent, but in ""Closer"" it feels like she can't find her place.<br/><br/>The story is fairly simple, when it really boils down to it. Guy 1 falls for Girl 1. Then, Guy 1 falls for Girl 2, and accidentally sets up Guy 2 with Girl 2. Girl 2 and Guy 2 fall for each other, get married and Guy 1 gets jealous and leaves Girl 1, for Girl 2. Girl 2 leaves Guy 2 for Guy 1 and wackiness ensues.<br/><br/>The problem with all this is how profoundly contrived the entire story, the betrayals, lies, truths and the reactions to them seem. They are not realistic and rather serve to motivate the developments in the story rather than compliment them . Aside from the lack of realism (and I mean, we've all had some bad relationships - but some of the scenes in this film just don't seem to reflect what people behave like at all), it is not quite clear as to what the film tries to say. I know it suggests that by abusing people's trust we jeopardize the relationships we share with them. On the other hand, it also suggests the opposite by showing scenes where characters honestly admit to perfidies committed ending relationships as well. In ""Closer"" no matter what you do, your relationship is essentially doomed. The concept of ""love"" or ""a decent relationship"" (i.e. one that may still need work, like most relationships in life, but a decent one) is simply nonexistent.<br/><br/>Furthermore - it seems like the contrivances of the story serve to support this theme rather than reflect reality. There is a scene where a character re-enters a relationship with another character that is simply inexplicable. And the idea that the entire story revolves around only four people is far too convenient for me to accept - this isn't the story of Stevie Nicks and her shenanigans with the members of Fleetwood Mac - this is a story that purports to speak about modern relationships which, last time I heard it, sounded general, not specific.<br/><br/>""Closer,"" despite great performances and confident direction, is a play at heart, and a contrived one at that, like many plays are. It doesn't go for brutal realism (except maybe in its verbal frankness - and some of the dialogues are indeed exquisite), but for forced point-making. We're not getting the privilege to view these characters' lives for a few years - they appear before us and act out a man's idea of what relationships are like. We're not observers as much as recipients of symbolic scenes whose meaning is forced.<br/><br/>However, don't get me wrong. ""Closer"" has moments of uncanny insight and all in all holds your attention entirely for its two hour span. The problem, though, is that at the end you feel as if you've been tricked and manipulated. The film tries to conform you to its subject matter, rather than honestly portray it so that you can reflect on it."
"samuelding85","7","1","1","4 March 2005"," So close...that it's world apart
","The tag line of Closer states When you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking. It lives to the tag line, but not everyone has the equal opportunity to showcase their talents in Mike Nicolas's latest drama.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman steals the limelight in Closer from Julia Roberts. She has grown up from her previous role in Star Wars, where she was better known as Queen Amidala and Mathilda from Leon: The Profession. She takes the challenge of playing a woman looking for love in London, where she worked as a waitress and a stripper. Her role of a woman looking for love becomes the main attraction, where audience would focus on her over Roberts, who plays a photographer passing through the post-divorce phase. Robert's performance is plain, without giving more scenes to explore her talents further. Her role also explains why Portman over shines her.<br/><br/>Jude Law is still the main focus in the film, even though Clive Owen is catching up. Playing a reporter and a doctor respectively, both are connected to Roberts in certain ways: Robert's was Law's photographer for his upcoming book, Owen is the victim of a prank by Law, where he was arranged to meet Roberts. In any case, the trio (Roberts, Portman and Owen) are related to Law, but the trio may not necessarily be close to each other. This results in a complex relationship the 4 involves, and bears the consequences they would never forget.<br/><br/>Mike Nicolas brings the British drama play onto the big screen with confusion. The relationship itself is confusing, let alone the presentation itself. Flashbacks were inserted directly into the film, without any elaboration before the appearance of the flashback. In fact, certain issues were not mentioned, and it just happens. However, the plot has saved the movie from failing. The gripping performances of Portman and Owen has not only gained themselves an Golden Globe award each, but also makes the audience wants to go for more.<br/><br/>The choice of using Damien Rice's The Blower's Daughter as the theme song is another factor why Closer deserves my 7/10 grades. 'I can't take my eyes for you'has sold the idea of the movie to the audience who is not too sure of the plot. The arrangement of the song at the end of the film also gives the movie a full round-up of the film."
"Rotfish","Null","1","1","24 February 2005"," Finally a mature script for a mature audience
","My first Mike Nichols experience and what a relief and pleasure to see a screenplay written for adults. Like the froth on a good latte, this was a joy to behold. But although the coffee may be good, it's not necessarily sweet  unless of course you add your own sugar.<br/><br/>Centred around the intertwining of two couples, this is about love, deception, honesty, the nature of feelings and the illogical human trait of desiring that which is forbidden. While one half of each relationship knows exactly what they want, their other halves can't decide whether they want them or each other. It confirms that sometimes we just don't know what we want, but whatever happens is good for us somehow.<br/><br/>Closer occasionally treads the fine line between relateability and the seemingly absurd, but how often this happens depends on your own life experience. However, despite the few instances I couldn't personally relate to, the film had me convinced of the integrity of the script to the extraordinary point of putting my faith in the writer that it was real  something I've never consciously done before. Generally, if I don't understand something I'll either accept it as fantasy or dismiss it as ludicrous. But the film managed to win my trust, despite myself.<br/><br/>All performances were convincing and I'm thrilled the four main players took on roles we're not used to seeing them in; namely flawed but deeply human characters. It was great to see Clive Owen in a role that allowed him some decent expression.<br/><br/>Closer is definitely an adult drama that not all will relate to, but for those who aren't afraid of a dose of reality, this is a rich and rewarding experience."

","Closer is possibly the most accurate and realistic depiction of modern love. The notion and true value of love in today's context is lost among a sea of infidelity, deception, lust, betrayal, jealously, cynicism, technology and vindication.<br/><br/>Despite being set in slightly surreal environments such as a photo exhibition and strip clubs, the writers and actors have successfully conveyed the emotions that run through typically dysfunctional relationships. In the end, the people involved in the web are either very certain of their own feelings finally or are so overwhelmed with rage that they become vindictive. The movie also explores the line between truth and lie; the difference each makes to a relationship and the consequence one has to bear for his/her actions.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts hasn't got much for her role to begin with, but she shows a certain delicateness, straddling between guilt and liberty with her role that makes a performance that is sufficiently pleasurable. Natalie Portman is stunning with middling traces of girlish vulnerability and womanly salacity. Jude Law packs both a cold yet emotive performance as a cheating boyfriend and later a desperate man stuck nowhere in both relationships. A performance good enough to warrant for an Oscar nod (but none sadly). The most powerful performance must come from Clive Owen who starred in the original play. He's the one who's drawn into a destructive relationship with Roberts and turns sinister when trying to win her back through a series of confrontations and psychological manoeuvers. All in all, a stellar cast and choice performances. (PS: Do check out the cybersex chat between Owen and Law) So, is love lost really lost? Is the sudden change of hearts actually beyond one's reasonable control? Find out in Closer, then again you might never actually."

I left the theater simply hating Roberts and Law and I respect them more for it. Clive Owen and Natalie Portman, on the other hand, were extraordinary.Even when their characters failed to be likable in the traditional sense, they won my heart with their complexity,sincerity, and wit. Clive Owen's performance is a treat for audiences who have long been awaiting something that adequately displays his talent. I've always been under the impression that Natalie Portman was over-rated (esp. after she was dubbed by some as the next Audrey Hepburn) while I still think that she is no Hepburn, I am willing to admit that she has talent. Sure the screenplay was often over the top and unrealistic, but Closer is entertaining and well worth seeing despite its faults.

"TheOtherFool","5","1","1","10 February 2005"," Striking performances, but little to enjoy
","'Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf', Nichols' classic debut on the big screen is one of the few movies I *haven't* seen yet of that brilliant list we call the IMDb top 250, but after watching 'Closer', the director latest film, you won't see me rushing to the nearest videostore to get it. And here's why.<br/><br/>'Closer', which adapts the play of Patrick Marber, is about 4 people and their ever-changing (or are they) relationships to one another. In the beginning of the movie, we meet Alice (Natalie Portman), a young and mysterious New Yorker, who bumps into (in a way) Dan (Jude Law), a journalist-later-turned writer.<br/><br/>After that first scene, which was quite impressive, Nichols plays a little trick. In the following scene we meet Anna (Julia Roberts), who's taking photo's of Dan to print on his book. At first I thought it was the next day, or even a flashback, but it turns out the story progressed a couple of months, to the point where Alice and Dan live together. In this scene, Dan falls for the more matured Anna, who finds him fascinating as well. And the misery starts.<br/><br/>The fourth player in this drama is Larry (Clive Owen), a doctor who, partly accidental partly 'weird Dan scheme', meets up with Anna. The two get along, and a scene (which, in 'Closer', is a year) later are living together. But Anna can't quite forget Dan. Nor can he forget her.<br/><br/>That's basically the plot line there for 'Closer'. In a movie like this, as in any adapted play, the acting comes first. Of the four performances, Portman's portrayal of Alice is by far the best. She's as innocent as sexy and as much a girl as she is a woman. She can play one scene in which she's a fragile, young girl, while the next moment she's stripping and saying quite nasty things to Larry.<br/><br/>As for Julia Roberts: she once again proves she's not much of an actress. She has chosen some wise projects over the years (Notting Hill and Erin Brockovich in particular), otherwise she would have been long forgotten. Her portrayal as Anna is boring and annoying, by far she's the least shining of them all.<br/><br/>As for the men: Clive Owen beats Jude Law on points. Both actors get their job done, but Law's 'puppy faced mean guy' routine starts to irritate in the second half of the movie, while Owen's performance is sharp and well-delivered, in quite a difficult role.<br/><br/>So, why didn't Closer do much for me then? Well, for one, I was surprised in how little depth the characters (other than Alice) had throughout the film. The characters seem to be lacking emotions, and wander around like machines. They looked made up, not so much real or confronting. Furthermore, I couldn't relate to any of the characters, I didn't feel anything for them. It was almost like the more misery they had, the more I enjoyed myself.<br/><br/>As a whole, 'Closer' has some good performances, and Owen and particularly Portman are allowed to actually win their Academy Awards, but as for story or character development, there is no way I could give 'Closer' the familiar two thumbs up.<br/><br/>5/10."

Scenes from the film will likely become audition pieces for aspiring actors. However, the film seems to be simply a vehicle for the sharp dialogue and a series of powerful, emotional scenes. The characters' motivations were unclear with the most obvious explanation for actions being, ""well they were just a little messed up."" A great movie/story need more clarification than that. I have not seen the play from which the material is adapted. I imagine that the story/script would work better as a play.

They advertise that critics (like Rolling Stone Magazine) states - why can't there be a hundred films like it? What the heck do we need that for? Then I realized what they possibly could mean. If you peel back the deceptive layers of Closer, you realize that the writing, acting and the way the relationships were handled - makes for brilliant story telling. The reason I mention this here, (as I have copied to the Sight for Sore Eyes comments) is that there are films out there that are honest and pure of relationships and not buried under special effects, five kids locked in a cabin as they are slashed one-by-one or films just buried in some slick studio marketing scheme of selling action figures and party favors to children.

There really is not so much to see in this movie, as much as there is to hear. The performances were excellent; still I had difficulty hearing Julia Roberts talk and be spoken to in such a way. More than once I had to remind myself that she is an actor and that playing fictional roles is what she does. 'Closer' is a film that pushes the line of censorship that little bit further and really drives the brutally honest and the corrupt side of the heart straight into the vigilant mouth of the critic with a 'cop this' attitude. Sometimes it's hard to know whether to turn your head in loathing, or tip your hat in respect. Bravo to the film's courage, congratulations to the cast and crew, and here's to reality.

Disclaimer: this is not a romantic comedy! Not even close! The film focuses on the verbal savagism lovers can say to one another. In more simplistic terms: it is not sometimes the lies that we do want to hear, but is the truths we do not want to hear. This Nichols' film reminds me much of his sexually orientated classic ""Carnal Knowledge"". I guess mike got back into his carnivorous ways and brought us back some ""carne con bollo"". Unfortunately in ""Closer"", Director Mike did not show us Julia & Natalie's aforementioned body part. ""Closer"" was written by Patrick Marber, who also scripted the play that is based on. Do you know the name of it? Yes, you are close! It's also called ""Closer""! Marber did a ""marberlous"" job in adapting his own play with a calenture-type dialogue. Roberts & Law were grand as Dan & Anna. But I must say that as close as ""Closer"" gets to acting supremacy does not come from our superstars Jude & Julia. That illustrious honor would go to the robust works of Owen & Portman as Larry & Alice. Natalie was an ""Alice in Acting Wonderland"" and Clive's Larry was one of the most stalwart movie pervs of all-time. Owen's acting was a masterpiece of pervection, I mean perfection. ""Closer"" does carry a few unnecessary elements into the film, but it is a realistic film that can reflect your life in ways that are closer than you think. **** Good"
"NoArrow","8","1","1","24 January 2005"," One of the year's best, a must-see, entertaining and harrowing
","""Closer"" is a character study looking closely  like through a magnifying glass  at the dishonesty of human nature. Its only four characters are real. These are people. Adjectives like ""convincing"" or ""believable"" aren't applicable here because they are irrelevant...whether these are actors or not, ""Closer"" is a look at a few years in the lives of four very real people. They are four fierce, empathy-less, angry, sad, charming, and sometimes even sick people, but they are still people, and not mere characters in a movie. When the film ends their problems are not solved, their lives will still continue the way it does through the film, because it is a film on life, and life doesn't end until death, and this isn't about the people's deaths.<br/><br/>Dan (Jude Law) is a pretty bad-boy wannabe English writer who goes through his days pretending to have a dark side. Anna (Julia Roberts) is a classy photographer who takes seemingly artistic photos of strangers that look personal but only hide the fact that they are, indeed, strangers. Alice (Natalie Portman) is a dark free spirit who is both cynical and naive. Larry (Clive Owen) is a dermatologist who fuses an innocent boyish charm with fierce anger and hatred for other human beings. All four can be nasty, or lovable. They have traits. People.<br/><br/>Dan meets Alice on the street. They engage in a flirtation, speaking about themselves, attracted. They become partners, live together for a year or so, Dan writes a book based on her. They appear to be in love, but really it is about how they each meet the other's required needs.<br/><br/>Then Dan finds someone who will meet his needs more sufficiently. Anna, the photographer, taking his picture for the jacket of his book. Anna likes him, but doesn't want to be a ""thief"". Still, she gives in and can't help but kiss him. She thinks to remain strong, though, and rejects him.<br/><br/>Retaliating to the rejection, Dan signs onto a dirty internet chat room, posing as Anna, and sets up a meeting with Larry. Larry comes to the London aquarium Anna so often visits, and finds the real Anna there. He sits down beside her and immediately sets off a bunch of piggish, chauvinistic sexual comments. She's put off by him, but not as much as she should be, and when they both realize his dilemma she instantly forgives him. They go for a walk. Larry's gears switch instantly from obnoxious pervert to boyish charmer, and we, along with Anna, start to like him.<br/><br/>And so the movie is set up, and things happen from here on in, not as predictable as you might think. The four characters interact, sometimes one-on-one, sometimes in threesomes, never all four at once. The movie has that 'play feel'. Sometimes that feel doesn't work (""Mister Roberts"" for example) but sometimes it works perfectly. The latter applies here. We feel like we have stepped into the peoples' lives, the same feeling we usually get from a good play.<br/><br/>The screenplay was adapted by Patrick Marber from his own play, and it is directed by Mike Nichols. These two really know how to set up a movie. An Oscar for both of them would be an understatement. All of the aspects  mostly acting and writing  piece together to make the perfect tone for the film. Everything justfits. The film editing is commendable too, like a scene where both couples are breaking up, and it inter-cuts between them. Another brilliant move was to save Jude Law and Clive Owen's meeting until a climactic later scene, because these two are the driving chauvinist males of the movie, and anything less significant wouldn't do them justice.<br/><br/>This is an ensemble piece. Not in the usual ""ensemble piece"" way  meaning that there are many famous faces jammed in the same shot  but meaning that all of the cast (which here is only four) play off each other perfectly. There is romantic, angry, sexual, sad, charming and sympathetic chemistry firing between them at all times; the actors have developed an actual relationship with each other that sort of resonates in the film.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is magical in this movie. She delivers one of the best female performances of the year, playing a beautiful, spunky character that ambiguously has the odds on her side. We don't often her side of things, but when we do, it's a shocker. She deserved the Golden Globe she won and would deserve the Oscar (I place only Virginia Madsen before her).<br/><br/>Clive Owen proves his talent here, and proves that he is one of the most intriguing actors working today. He is stunningly able to shift from nasty to charming to perverted without seeming to be over (or under) acting, out of character or incapable. He is very capable. He grabs a hold of the audience in his scenes and doesn't let go until he's off-screen.<br/><br/>It is because of the amazing talent and presence of Portman and Owen that we sort of lose focus on Jude Law and Julia Roberts, who both do terrific jobs. Jude Law raises the specter on versatility here; I suggest you watch this with ""Cold Mountain"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" to drink in what this guy can do. Roberts is movie-star, and being one, subtlety is usually not present in her performances, but here it blooms. She uses it to suggest that her character is giving way to her desires, letting go of any morals or ethics. It's a touching, tragic performance. Possibly her best.<br/><br/>Now, the unabashed sexual dialogue may put off a few, but this is not a movie that glorifies sex, not by far. So watch it, no matter if you're a conservative or liberal, and study the values of empathy, honesty and the wisdom to not make the same mistakes twice.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","When i first went to the cinema with my cousin on 15th January we had planned to see million dollar baby. When the found we would have to wait four damn hours we decided to see closer. Closer is, in my opinion a great film. The humour is not stupid, does not rely on fart jokes, but instead is adult comedy at it's very best. I can tell you in two words why it is so good: Julia Roberts! Particularly in one scene where she and Clive Owen are arguing over her having sex with Jude Law(his character)in there apartment. The vivid descriptions of what she did are shocking and it takes a lot of stomach to say things such as ""he f****d me and I came twice"". Another element of the film which deserves credit is the beautiful sound track especially from Damien Rice which is depressing, but beautifully effective. In fact I was surprised that the UK censors only rated it a fifteen, rather than eighteen because this film is beautiful is heartbreaking, beautiful and extremely rude. One of the best contemporary dramas is recent years along with lost in translation and one of my personal favourites, Donnie Darko. Oh yeah and the it's good to see Julia Roberts back in the UK after noting hill."

","Many people have complained about the graphic nature of this film. While i will admit, the language is vulgar and obscene, the movie ratings system warns of it. Coming from a very conservative area i would recommend if you are easily offended by language and conversations that are very sexually graphic, you should stay home.<br/><br/>That said, the film was extremely well made, with terrific performances by the whole cast. Natalie Portman really proves herself to be a terrific actress in this film, and combined with last year's Garden State she has really grown into a very mature, very talented actress, and i don't think the next Star Wars will be able to ruin that. Julia Roberts also delivers a strong performance, as a very un-Julia character. Normally i do not like her work because she doesn't seem to play different characters, but in this film she definitely broke my expectations. On to the men, Jude law and Clive Owen. Both delivered amazing performances. I have seen a lot of both men's films and i truly think this one may be the highlight of both's careers thus far. Mike Nichols follows up Angels in America with another well made film. In the slew of films about adultery that have come out beginning in the end of 2004, with We don't live here Anymore, Closer proves to be the best yet"
"antony-1","6","1","1","15 January 2005"," A bit pretentious, but an enjoyable flick none the less
","Closer was an interesting, and entertaining film. This certainly wasn't a film that bored me. But it then equally so, it wasn't that great a film.<br/><br/>It struck me very much pretentious film, that with its forward dialog and troubled character we'd all admire its brilliance. But the characters never, for me, went beyond being puppets for the writer or director's amusement. The never felt real or understandable. The dialog felt very much like a stage production (so I wasn't surprised to then see it was based on a play) and much of the dialog was what a lot of us would think in many of these situation, but not say. So this gave it an almost unreal quality at times.<br/><br/>The film also had these time jumps, which are totally unclear at first. This caused me confusion, and again just struck me as another chance for them to try and be different, but rather pointlessly so.<br/><br/>Some plots ""twists"" are also thrown in, but they may just leave you asking ""Why?"" in confusion instead of ""Why?"" in contemplation.<br/><br/>There are some points of particular merit. Clive Owen steals the show with his performance, and puts Julia Roberts (who is typically Julia Roberts) and Jude Law (who is typical Jude Law) in the shade. Natalie Portman was also wonderful, so I found the main scenes between Clive and Natalie were the best of the film.<br/><br/>As I said, I enjoyed the film. It's not a bad film. But it's not particularly fathomable. It does things which try to be clever, but ultimately aren't. You know a clever film because it doesn't try to be clever. It tells its story and lets the viewer come to a conclusion, rather than a contrived direction which it wants you to walk down.<br/><br/>If you want a film about the flaws of people, and how they destroy themselves and lives around them, then I recommend The Rules of Attraction instead."
"ingwio_vanhaecke","9","1","1","15 January 2005"," Clive Owen and Natalie Portman
","Clive Owen is truly brilliant in this movie. He really carries the movie together with Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts also does a great job, but she's not brilliant. Jude Law was the only reason why I did'not give the movie a 10. He really ruins it with his baby face and his silliness. He just can't act. But back to Clive Owen, he's the one ho is not so famous and yet he manages to be the best actor in this whole movie. In King Arthur, you could already see what a great actor he really is. But the plot of that movie wasn't nearly as good as this one. He brings humor in the movie, his one-liners, everything he says and expresses is perfect. Off course you also gotta love Natalie Portman, she's so cute, and just perfect to play this role. I hear a lot of people say that she can't act. But I think she has proved herself in the recent garden state and in this movie. I already loved her in Léon and now I even adore her more. But enough about the actors, let's talk about the movie. Very well acted as stated above. But also the script was very good. Sometimes it looked a little like a theater, this was very well done, it supported the movie. Maybe it was good that Jude Law played this role, because he's very pathetic and he doesn't even realize it, just like in real life. Farther the movie is brilliant. You can laugh, you can cry, it's a mix of emotions. I would also recommend Garden State for the one's who liked this movie. Also with a brilliant Natalie Portman :p"
"adrongardner","6","1","1","6 January 2005"," Its OK
","I write this review on the sole basis of the movie. I have not seen the play, I don't want to see the play, I don't like plays. There I said it.<br/><br/>Closer is a movie that as a whole has a good message and a lot to say, but when looked at from scene to scene, little adds up. Before I tear into this one, I will focus on the positive.<br/><br/>Again, I did get the message and I could relate to what the film had to say. On that basis I have to give Closer a positive recommendation. The acting is decent all around, but any dramatic believability the film carries is due primarily to Clive Owen. He plays the honest character and also gives a more honest performance. Jude Law is good, but he seems stuck to the rhythmic stage dialog. Owen does more with his lines than anyone else. Natalie Portman is cutesy, but, and I mean this, she isn't a very good actress. Julia Roberts struggles to convince not only with her lines, but playing a photographer, you need to at least know how to hold a camera convincingly. How hard is that to learn? <br/><br/>The movie's massive fallibility is in its stage roots. Closer is not very cinematic and because of that, not very convincing. There is too much ""play"" between the actors with their wordy rhythmic exchanges. NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT! Again this comes from my distaste for the stage, and I have even more distaste for filmed plays. <br/><br/>In the end, Closer succeeds in holding your interest thanks to some good humor and the ever honest Clive Owen."
"cynsk8","8","1","1","23 December 2004"," A Great Surprise
","I expected a mediocre picture and instead was pleasantly surprised. I was also amazed that upon leaving the theatre, audience members were commenting that it was the worst movie they'd ever seen. Hummm, there is no accounting for taste, audience members at the same theatre walked out last month on Finding Neverland. For anyone with an appreciation of good storytelling, witty dialog and great acting, this is the movie to see. Although one felt strangely about laughing at so serious a story, there was the inevitable confrontation scene between Larry and Dan and one could not help but be amused. Clive Owen was wonderful and the dialog in this scene was some of the best this year. Please see this movie and hope that it wins many Oscars for some truly great performances."
"sjmcollins-1","7","1","1","20 December 2004"," Good performances from Law & Owen overcome unlikeable characters, story gaps
","A good performance from Jude Law and a great performance from Clive Owen help elevate Mike Nichols' flawed Closer. The story centers around four rather unsavory (but attractive) characters who use and abuse each other unmercifully, but attempt to let each other down as gently as possible. The movie covers about 18 months of this story, but we primarily get the break-up scenes after the relationships of Dan (Law) and Alice (Natalie Portman), and Larry (Owen) and Anna (Julia Roberts) are established. These scenes are pretty intense, and contain language that will probably shake up a good deal of Roberts' loyal audience. These are the scenes that Owen shines in, as he shifts from wounded animal to drunken anger to conniving weasel effortlessly. It wouldn't be out of line to suggest a nomination of some kind for his work here. I had a few cosmetic problems with the film. Portman wears the same hair-do that she had for The Professional, and as a result looks like she's about 16, tops. Her performance is good enough, but I think someone with a few more miles on them, not quite as angelic-looking, could have given the film a little more punch. The half-year gaps in the story didn't help, either, as the attraction Dan & Larry had for Anna was never sufficiently fleshed out for my tastes. Let's be honest, these two don't exactly look like they would have much trouble finding women, and why they chose to fight so vigorously over a cold fish like Anna was a little perplexing. Roberts has the most difficult role to play in the film, as she is basically the prize that Larry and Dan are fighting over, and she serves as sort of a verbal punching bag for Law and Owen to spar with. She does an admirable job, but the two male leads, especially Owen, carry the film."
"kellidee","10","1","1","20 December 2004"," Eye-opening
","Lies and deceit are a common occurrence among not only couples, but married couples. Anna proves this, having had the affair with Dan since before the marriage began. She's the wife trying to do the right thing and finally realizing that she can't, simply because she loves someone else too much. <br/><br/>I have to hand it to Clive Owen. No, I've never seen King Arthur, I've never seen anything of his, but he is by far one of the most convincing, believable actors I've ever watched. I enjoyed his performance immensely...it's hard to believe that he played Dan in the play production, instead of Larry, because he fits the part so well!<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's angel face was perfect for her role as a tempting seductress disguised as innocent. I loved her the most at the very end of the movie, but I'm not going to ruin it for those who haven't seen this. <br/><br/>And I can relate to Jude Law's character, Dan. I felt a strong connection to his pain, to his boredom, to his innocence. He kept saying he's the adult one taking care of the younger one, but in truth he's the innocent in the world of love. <br/><br/>And Julia Roberts, well, I hated her character. Simply because she's so fickle, she's with one guy in one moment, then over to another guy the next, then going back to one guy. Reminds me of this fickle person I know...I'm going to stop before I enter in on my personal life. <br/><br/>All in all, I applaud this movie, I'm giving it 11 stars out of 10 and I'm saying to watch it and realize that this, people...this is what the world of ""LOVE"" is truly like. <br/><br/>Very well done."

It's all up to you to decide if you like it! However, I would recommend definitely going to watch it! It is something different, whether you believe that is good or bad! The acting isn't something that should decide your opinion. I had never seen any movie with Natalie Portman until now, but I thought she did a terrific job with this role. As for Julia Roberts, she played a character that I would have never imagined her playing. But, isn't that part of acting? She did a terrific job as well."

","Why do I dislike this movie? Hmmmm. Perhaps because someone forgot to tell the screenwriters and director that sexually frank language do not a good movie make. Perhaps because there is not one sympathetic character among the four: I could accept three of them being horrid, but the audience needs something or someone to identify with in every movie, and this movie offered up nothing in that department. But more than anything, it is this ""rawness"" about which everyone keeps prattling on about that bothered me the most. I do not go to movies to be reminded of how bad life can be. If I wanted to hear people screaming vulgarities at each other and being utterly wretched, I'd put my parents in a room for a few hours and just listen. Granted, many movies (a la Schindler's List) show us that the world can be a dark and dreadful place, but in every movie I have ever seen that takes that approach, there are still nuggets of sunshine, some goodness that comes through. Once the humorous I'm conversation is over, this movie seemingly forgets that there can be anything good or funny in life, or that anyone would be interested in seeing something other than people being totally wretched to each other. I have never walked out of any other movie hating all the characters: this one is unique in that regard. While the acting and cinematography are certainly proficient, this movie manages to remain cold, uncaring, and overzealously brutal. I have no idea what alternate reality this movie took place in, but I've never been there and I never want to go."

","I looked forward to seeing this movie after I saw the TV commercials for it. I'm a big fan of Roberts, Portman and Law. I was expecting an intriguing story that would show the dark and painful side of betrayal.<br/><br/>Maybe it was, I didn't stick around to find out. <br/><br/>First, the beginning totally drags (you already feel depressed, thinking, why am I wasting valuable holiday shopping time sitting in a boring, depressed movie). The concept of time was murkey at best and you don't realize that a year or so has past between Jude Law & Natalie Portman's character's initial meeting and the next scene. But that's not why we walked out. <br/><br/>What really bothered me was the cyber sex scene that followed. Was it necessary to continue that scene on for so long? First, the scene was between two men (which may bother some viewers, even though one of the men was pretending to be a woman). The language was very, very crude. Think of every dirty, perverted and sick thing you can and imagine it being typed in a chat room, only you're watching it on the big screen. If I reproduced the conversation here, I would be banned from this site. The scene goes on forever. There are also graphic banner ads for pornography sites(hopefully fake). <br/><br/>My husband actually had his eyes closed, something you may not expect a 28-year-old man to do, but he felt very uncomfortable to watch this - as did I.

That's the thing here: multiply this by 10 (the number of sequences here because they are quite long during about 9 minutes each) and you got the full story. I hoped to take a tour in London but with this movie, you stay indoor.<br/><br/>Beyond this poor visual, the substance is painfully lacking: it's A who is in love with B but who prefers finally C that likes D. For sure, B and D meet ""by accident"" (no kidding, in a city big as London) while A and C cheats together. Then, all of them split to rejoice as if nothing ever happened! Wow: that's interesting: for the amateur, you have the usual ""I love you"", ""It will be hard but I love her"", ""Was it better"", ""I really love you"" (after the come-back), bla-bla and bla-bla... If you like that, fine for you but it's not my case. As it's a play, maybe some will find the lines and the psychological studies of characters interesting, but in my opinion, if you catch your partner cheating, it's broken and it's time to leave: in other words, there's nothing to say about it.<br/><br/>The only good thing here is Natalie (as always) who tries to be more assertive with her intimate life with her character that seems to be Mathilda (from ""Léon"") a few later.<br/><br/>In conclusion, how can it be that the sex stories of swingers and cheaters make always disastrous movies whereas romantic, pure, sincere love stories make classics?"

","I haven't read all the reviews of this film - life is too short - but I find the general chorus of approval frightening. Personally I felt that Closer was one of the most revolting films I have seen recently. I abhorred the technicalities of the script - the dialogue was way too smart; people just do not string together two disparate faux-incisive comments back-to-back in the way the film constantly did. It was nearly as grating as the constant rhyming of ""boy"" and ""joy"" in Miss Saigon. I did not so much mind the language as the cruelty which all the characters ladled out, especially the men to the women. Unfortunately this does seem to mirror a coarsening of at least UK society. My objection is that the film appeared to approve of such cruelty in the service of honesty. Ever since Thatcher said there was no such thing as society and thereby permitted people to sate their appetite for self British civility, in daily life and culture, has been in decline. This film gives it a helping shove. I heard someone on Radio Four say recently that German Nazism did not come out of a clear blue sky. Its roots were in the ""coarsening"" of German society in the 20s and 30s. See ""Closer"" if you want to see what is happening to us. I am disappointed that most of your reviewers were blind to it."

Moreover, the actors, whose work I usually admire and enjoy, delivered their lines with the same emotional intensity one might invest in a new pair of socks.<br/><br/>Closer's grand themes revolve around commitment and violation of trust, which presuppose an emotional investment on our part if the story is to hit its mark. But how are we to feel any involvement with the film when its protagonists are wholly unlikeable predators with a penchant for cruelty?<br/><br/>If your wife or girlfriend is pressing you to see Closer, resist.

","Lets cut to the chase. Here is a movie about a bunch of characters that lack the ability to have a healthy relationship and seem perfectly happy to play partner swap between themselves. Hmmm.... how could a story so perfect for late night on cine-max be so royally ruined? Bad script, bad editing and bad acting.<br/><br/>First warning any movie patron should note is that plays rarely translate into good movies. Face it, plays are filled with pompous preachy diatribes that stage actor seem to love and some people seem willing to watch. But I want a movie where the words from the character have meaning and seem real, here they are too often over extended speeches that push the realm of reality. In most any scene you start to wonder why one of the characters doesn't just walk away. You get the feeling they all just want to yammer on and on for the sake of hearing themselves whine and moan.<br/><br/>Editing: I'm sorry but if you want to jump around in time, give me a clue that you are going forward three years or back one year or whatever. Don't make me listen so closely to what they are saying to figure it out. I don't have a copy of the playbill from the original play so I don't have the advantage of a written guide to what scene I'm watching.<br/><br/>Acting: Okay, I can accept Clive Owens acting... Even Julia was acceptable.... BUT, Jude Law seemed to be do the same character he did in the last two movies he was in, only now he talk on and on about nothing. And lest I forget Portman, GOOD GOD was this a mistake. Yeah she seems believable for a while but when you get to the part of the movie where she goes back to being a stripper.... I'm sorry but if you want to play a stripper and be believable take your clothes off. I could only laugh as she is up their as a strip among other actors that are actually bare breasted and she is wearing more than you would see on a beach. If you take a job acting as a stripper get naked, otherwise you come across as a joke. You start thinking, ""Oh, she wanted to get away from being the nice queen of Star Wars... Ooops did she read that script the first time? guess not and so you no longer believe her portrayal...<br/><br/>I could rant on but suffice it to say the movie sucked... maybe it was a good play, but as a movie it ain't even worth the time on cable."

Characters were not only unsympathetic - they had little or no personality whatsover. Direction was ponderous and slow in a way that was obviously supposed to be 'a bit like a French art house movie like what Kieslowski used to do' yet without the good bits of Kieslowski like engaging characters and whimsy. The sets all had this Elle Homes and gardens look of stale and mediocre tastefulness. And the music was either forgettable or Damien Rice moaning like a wet ex-boyfriend from hell drunkenly singing and sobbing at 4am ""why did my girlfwiend leeeeve meeeeee"". <br/><br/>And the dialogue - not profound but w*nky. W*nky middle-class navel gazing maxims mostly: ""Telling the truth is what separates us from the animals."" Yeah, those animals are always making fibs up, aren't they? I seem to recall it was a mongoose who wrote The Aeneid. Utter tosh!!!<br/><br/>Julia Roberts was the most dull boring self-absorbed woman in the world and we were supposed to believe she attracted these men into falling deliriously in love with her. She looked constipated all the time too. Natalie Portman was equally one dimensional and shallow - she was 'wacky' though cos she had dyed red hair and wore a skanky Boho Sienna miller coat. She had more potential but even so was given nothing to work with. But she cried once or twice and stripped so therefore she is a 'character'.

Clive Owen was the only one who came across as being an actual person but even so, was forced to say the most trite lines, it nearly made me do a little bit of sick.

","Please do me and yourself a favor, if you have yet to have seen this film please do not. I REPEAT DO NOT RENT, BUY, OR SEE THIS FILM. THe morals and values of the film overall are simply appalling. I am fairly young but I have beliefs in the traditional values of what a relationship and more importantly a MARRIAGE is based upon. For those who have ever been cheated on or even those who have committed such acts are no doubt aware of the evident feeling of wrong doing. Whether you be a Christian who follows the ten commandments decree on adultery or an atheist who catches there girl/boy friend cheating on them. It is wrong. About the only redeeming factor of this film is that they are honest about their disgraceful behavior. I frown upon the playwright Patrick Marber for creating such an immoral and genuinely horrid film."

","After writhing through Jude Law's absolutely awful Alfie several weeks ago, my wife and I thought we'd give Jude Law another chance...what a mistake.<br/><br/>If only ""Closer"" were JUST salacious and tawdry...the ""Closer"" I get to it, the more it stinks. There is nothing in this film! Nothing! All right, the shots of London. Yes, Portman has a nice smile...Roberts' great misty looks...and Law is sooooo handsome (gag). But that, really, is it.<br/><br/>One has to wonder why Nichols chose this...ah...flotsam of a film. After a glorious rich early career that features films like ""Silkwood"", ""The Graduate"" and ""Carnal Knowledge"", Nichols seems to have lost his olfactory sense.<br/><br/>Can't you hear the come on, though? ""Here's what we do, Mikey: Put a couple of headliners in London, lots of classical music, scenery, (one time) world-class director, sprinkle it with dirty language and sex...You have the newbie starlet Natalie Portman--(who has the acting depth of a kiddie pool)--you got a (fading) star Julia Roberts (with her Bambi-esquire doe-eyes masquerading as grand pathos). You got Jude Law...You got a smash hit! Almost an Art Film! Like Ocean's 11 the Remake! Happening! Cool! Yeah, Baby!"" <br/><br/>Jude Law. O Handsome Leading Actor and so full of himself on screen, Jude, you make Richard Burton seem like a shrinking violet.<br/><br/>Jude hasn't done a creditable job in anything since Artificial Intelligence. Perhaps his choice of films is the culprit. I haven't seen Sky Captain (cringe I), and I got through all of 10 minutes of Cold MoleHill, but I'm thinking I don't have the stomach to watch this guy's work.<br/><br/>I'm really, really beginning to wonder if Jude Law himself knows what a good film project is. I know, I know, they are trying to make money, and they go where the money is. But I don't see these absolutely wooden performances (there's a pun in there) as landing anywhere in the top 250 films of all time list that I keep.<br/><br/>Jude, really, check out the filmography of British Film Giants like Cary Grant, Michael Caine, Peter Sellers, David Niven, Rex Harrison, Alec Guiness to name but a few. It wasn't all great, Jude, but you are on a clinker streak that those actors never saw.<br/><br/>And brother and sister viewers, how how how could you give this...film sewage...anything as high as an 8? 6? 4?

","If you enjoyed Eyes Wide Shut, if you are entertained by long-winded, talky movies about whiny pretty people who can't commit and have no idea what they want, then Closer is your cup of tea. Go see it and love the overwrought cheesy sentimentality out of it.<br/><br/>Closer is about four people, two sets of couples, whose lives fall apart when two of them begin an affair with each other. Dan (Jude Law) helps Alice (Natalie Portman) when she's struck by a cab. The two quickly fall for each other, of course. Not long after, Dan - an aspiring writer - has his picture professionally taken for the book jacket of his novel. The photographer is Anna (Julie Roberts); unsurprisingly, Dan falls for her as well, and vice versa. And then somehow Larry (Clive Owen) tumbles into the mix; he's tricked by Dan into meeting Anna, who falls for him, but then he falls for Alice, and... Oh, what's the use? Those of you who love romantic dramas will likely get into this, and those who do not, won't.<br/><br/>But here's the thing, okay? It's a talky, slow movie that relies very heavily on a rather turgid, melodramatic script - not to mention the charms of the four very good-looking leads. At times, the dialog really clicks with some subtle, clever twists of the word, but most of the movie is filled with dopey, unrealistic, stilted verbalizations. It's not that the movie doesn't make any sense; on the contrary, it's fairly simple to follow. So simple, in fact, that you can easily tell what's coming next. There are no surprises in Closer.<br/><br/>The tone is set very early, with an inexorable opening song that seems to merely repeat its refrain ad infinitum. Much like the movie, which repeats its theme in the same grueling, amateurish manner, only with different characters. Look! Now she's dumping him! Now he's with her and dumping the other one! Woohoo! Go, you wacky lovers, go! The casting is pretty good, though. Julie Roberts can really act, you know, and she's quite effective here. Law isn't bad, but he's been much better - he actually overacts late in the film, going against the grain of understated quiet. They do make a cute couple, though. Which leads me to Portman, who's the lightweight of the bunch. She turns in a fairly good performance, although there were a couple scenes in which she just didn't feel right for the role. Owen's character is the crass bastard of the lot, and the actor is up the task. But damn, Colin! You couldn't shave for the role? You look like you should be hiding in bushes, waiting to flash little old ladies. But then again, that was part of his character's appeal.<br/><br/>As interesting as the circuitry in a pocket calculator, as engrossing as a 1975 auto-repair manual, and as excruciating as a long morning in a dentist's chair, Closer is a dream come true for folks who like sitting in a catatonic state, drool seeping out of the corner of their mouths."

My main problem with the movie was Julie Roberts. Why would one man obsess about her, let alone 2? It was a mystery.

Julia Robert's cynical marketing casting is an affront to every credible actress who would've have borough credence and depth and genuine emotion to a role that she barely make tolerable. Clive Owen gruffs up his demeanor to deliver a few choice lines with admirable venom - though a yob doctor is hardly believable - and Natalie Portman strives hard to inject emotional realism to her damaged character.<br/><br/>Everything this film tries to be, it isn't.

The writer has published a novel based on the stripper's life story, and is being photographed for the publicity tour by yet another interesting character. We never learn the details of the stripper's life that warranted a book; in fact, we never learn much about these characters (or a comparatively dull fourth, who ultimately appears to fill things out).

A well managed production with a good cast and good direction which fails in writing, ""Closer"" is a very forgettable waste of time when compared with the panoply of better ensemble dramas to be had. The shallow characters behave only as do characters in shallow films as they try to suck emotion from the most feeble foibles leaving the audience feeling much like one who has just been had by Hollywood again.

I thought Julia Roberts was a poor choice for Anna. My opinion of Jude Law has suffered a bit as well. He was a little too wimpy for me.

"postglock","2","3","6","15 March 2005"," Pretentious fare
","Having had a quick scan over some comments posted for this movie, I think that I'd agree that this movie could accurately be summarised in the quote: ""Have you ever seen a human heart? It looks like a fist covered in blood.""<br/><br/>Depending on opinion, this quote either encompasses the entire quantity of human pathos, or makes you cringe with disbelief. In the context of the film, by the time this line was uttered, I found myself in the unenviable position of holding in waves of mirth so as not to disturb my fellow patrons (that had coughed up on the cheap $5 night).<br/><br/>I must say that it was only after viewing Closer that I realised that the movie was based on a play, which goes some way to clarifying the situation, but, nevertheless, the movie suffers from an awful screenplay. Perhaps it was more a result of the execution (read: direction), but Patrick Marber's script comes off like a second-rate attempt to emulate some of the greater names in smart, snappy dialogue. Except it isn't smart. Think Stoppard without the irony. Or Tarantino without the wit. In the opinion of this author, it just comes across amateurish and banal.<br/><br/>The directing is mostly lacklustre, with enough telegraphed cleverness to impress even the most cynical of art students. There are contained some awful moments, such as the heavy use of symbolism throughout. Sure, symbolism is an important tool in a director's arsenal, but when over half of an entire scene is shot in a twisted and unnatural manner so as to include certain items in frame, the natural effect of the symbolism is lost. The characterisation is almost non-existent; the four main actors do the job, but it's not pleasant. In reality, their role is almost academic, because they are getting no help whatsoever from the script. Most lines fall between the obvious and clichÃ©d to the absurd, and the quick repartee of dialogue only helps in discombobulating the audience. There is no sympathy. The characters are simply caricatures vacillating between every movie line uttered before, and bizarre non sequiturs, that rather than interest seem to detract from the continuity essential to character building.<br/><br/>As far as the much touted sexual explicitness is concerned, there is little of any extreme activity except what is contained in the language. There is little nudity and (to my memory) no sex scenes at all. More broadly, I found that the subject matter, although ostensibly sexual and relationship oriented, had not much to say that had not been mentioned previously, and did not phrase it in any way interesting to this viewer. The storyline was somewhat convoluted, yes, but not so much in a Lynchian or Finchereque manner, but more in the reliable and predictable Hollywood oeuvre. When it occasionally did step outside this realm, the heavy handed direction and script only seemed to emphasise the lack of character building rather than foil the predictability."

","Don't get me wrong. i have nothing against the actors. They aren't bad on their own--in separate films. in fact, except for Star Wars and Alfie, i'd say that they all have a record for choosing pretty good (meaningful) scripts. HOWEVER, Closer is one hell of a disappointment. it's not that i cant see past the sex, bawdy language, or sheer vulgarity of the show. i just cant see how seeing beyond that even makes it even a passable movie. Closer does indeed reflect the sinister and morbid aspect of human relations and love (after seriously closing your eyes to many of its MANY flaws) but where it fails is in its ability (or lack of) to incorporate ANY form of chemistry between actors in the show. By the end of the show, viewers don't know whether they prefer the husband that 'won' back his wife, the lover that lost both his women, the woman who needs to be taken care of or the woman who is depressed. And viewers cannot make up their minds for the simple reason that we just never really got the chance to warm up to ANYBODY. it is a failure of a script, a tasteless attempt to translate a stage performance unto a movie screen. the actors just do not have the chemistry with each other to pull off a show like this AND the cinematography is messed up. I cannot believe i allowed myself to waste good money on a lousy production like this when truly artistic films like A Very Long Engagement were showing as well! but of course you don't have to agree with me. in fact, i insist you go watch it yourself and then join my school of critics. Sadly, it seems to me that we form a minority - which does not speak highly of the people who actually watched the show and applauded it. Honestly, if i could vote a zero instead of one..(which is the lowest grade that the IMDb management would let me)..i would."

Don't know anybody who's real life relationships and breakups mimic these guys and feel a bit sorry for anybody who can relate to them.

The play is fine - I've seen it..... The movie is not fine - it's a play! There was the earnestness and overacting required to get across to an audience, which doesn't work well in close-up. The PC chat scene was, for me, the best part of the movie, as the monitor had real pathos! This was an honourable effort to bring a great story to more people, but some things simply do not transfer to the big screen. Bottom line, it fell between to many genre requirements, and left me not caring whilst praying for the credits, and, when they came, hoping there wasn't anything tagged on."

His is the weakest link here, too; I simply don't find him attractive enough to be as convincing as he needs to be to pull this one off. Clive Owen is astounding. Julia shows that she needs not the glitchy girly charms we've come to expect from her, and how refreshing to realize she has true skill backing up those addictive looks. Natalie Portman is, well, hot, but a stripper she's not. She did her best, but east coast genius isn't really what should come peering out of that character. Still: the women are painted real.

I very much agree and it is for those reasons that I will say I was very impressed. <br/><br/>There are very few films in the world of cinema that actually depict the world of life in terms of potentiality, and this film very much chronicled the lives of four very miserable people who had no idea what they wanted. They were so wrapped up in their own convoluted minds that they virtually destroyed themselves. ""Know thyself"" and ""nothing in excess"" are perfect words to keep in mind while watching this movie, for this film reaches into some of the deepest areas of the human psyche and maps the territory of existential crisis.<br/><br/>Sophocles dealt with themes of self destruction and utter blindness to others in his works in the Theban trilogy as did Shakespeare with ""Hamlet."" I am not going to say that this film comes even close to the work of the men I just mentioned, but this film does indeed provide a look into the side of life that most people do not want to acknowledge. Most people want to go to a movie where they will be thrust into the middle of a horrible situation, only to be taken to the light at the end of the tunnel. The cold hard truth of the matter is that many people in this world are not so lucky as to experience that light by simply going to a movie theater. Many people in this world are as cold and desolate as the characters in this film and I believe that is where the gold rests in this project. It is not one for the ages, but I am thankful that it was created if for no other reason to represent the side of life that most people choose to ignore. There was indeed a great deal of payoff in this film. Many people just don't want to believe that a story like this could mean something in the end. There is no light without darkness, and perhaps this film will serve the purpose of adjusting eyes accustomed to artificial light to take a walk in the darkness that exists in reality."

I was a little tired of seeing so much crap make its way into multiplexes and to the top of the box office charts. I suppose I was a tad disillusioned with the landscape of movies and I needed a superbly written script to jog me back in to the ranks of enthusiastic moviegoer. Well, that script lies at the heart of Mike Nichols' new film ""Closer"".<br/><br/>Unlike many other critics, I am not typically pessimistic about the current state of modern film-making.

It is the kind of film that could put an end to my temporary burn-out and have me once again excited about the possibilities that this magnificent art form has to offer.<br/><br/>Alice (Portman) meets Dan (Law) and Anna (Roberts) meets Larry (Owen).

Listening to them speak, one can't help but be impressed with their ability to communicate. The script in this film is absolutely fabulous, filled with innuendo and double-entendres, wit and intelligence.<br/><br/>The couples, Alice and Dan, Anna and Larry, are linked by Anna's photography. She does portraiture and is preparing for an exhibition. She is hired by Dan to shoot a portrait that will hopefully find it's way to the inside cover of his soon-to-be published novel. He is currently an obituaries writer.<br/><br/>Larry is a dermatologist who spends some of his spare time chatting to horny ""women"" on the internet. He is a says-what-he-thinks smart-ass who somehow manages to overcome a tremendously awkward first meeting with Anna. They are soon married.<br/><br/>Alice is the mystery guest in this equation. She used to be a stripper in New York, but escaped a bad relationship by fleeing to London. Her rough first meeting with Dan leads to a seemingly loving relationship despite a ten-year age difference.<br/><br/>Soon, the couples discover that they are not as happy as they appear. Cracks emerge and the situation leads to a switch of sorts. Anna divorces Larry to be with Dan. Dan leaves Anna to fend for herself, and soon she finds herself stripping again, giving table dances to lonely men... like Larry.<br/><br/>The screenplay is vicious. The couples switch and switch back again as they lacerate each other with dialogue meant to inflict heartfelt pain. Some might think these are four horrible people. Some might claim that these are good people driven to cruelty by circumstance and heartache. I think there may be a middle ground in there somewhere.<br/><br/>The performances are all genuinely Oscar worthy. Although it is possible that none of them can be considered a legitimate lead character... and by that logic none are supporting characters either. The Academy will have a tough time choosing and it may split the vote. I am sure the cast will get mention for 'Best Ensemble' at award shows that feature that category.<br/><br/>The two who stand out for me are Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. Both turn in spectacular roles filled with the gamut of emotions. Couple this outing with hers in ""Garden State"" and Natalie Portman has appeared in the two best films I've seen all year. She will probably be my 'Entertainer of the Year'. 2004 has seen her develop into a superb young actress who has a legendary career ahead of her if she keeps picking roles like these.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is a sleek and powerful actor who is able to deliver lines like they are being shot out of a cannon. When you hear him spew some of the hateful things he says to Julia Roberts' Anna, your own feelings will be hurt. He also has some rather sly moments of wit and he is able to craft them in ways reminiscent of Sean Connery, always with a knowing glint and a hidden smirk waiting to reveal itself.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" delivers dialogue for intelligent adults who are clamoring for something substantially less banal than can be found in most Christmas fare in 2004. It will take a few viewings to fully grasp the complexity and layers of infidelity and betrayal in this film. ""Closer"" studies the human tendency toward self-preservation in the face of gross deception. It is at once a condemnation of human nature and an acceptance of it. I highly recommend the film to all literary adults who are fascinated by the enormous gray areas of love, seduction, trust, infidelity and deception. It will appeal to fans of Neil LaBute's ""In the Company of Men"", ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and to Stanley Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut""."

","Fantastic cast - great performances from all 4, but wonder how different it would have been had Cate Blanchette played Anna's role, as was originally intended (I think she has a wider range than Julia - don't get me wrong, I like Julia but I just wonder how different the film would feel had she been in it)... anyway, still, the movie was so intriguing because you wonder who ends up w/ whom and how love can make people do some crazy things. As shocking as the premise may be, it is hauntingly realistic (which is scary because I'm a romantic)- people do fall in and out of love so easily and are willing to fulfill their own desires and needs while hurting a loved one ... but isn't that what life is all about?: being happy? But in the end, who is truly happy? I love the humor and dialogue in the film ... fabulous all around."

The lines were expressed exactly as they would if it were being performed as a play. This would be fine were it on the stage, but it wasn't and any sense of natural dialogue was lost. <br/><br/>Furthermore, there wasn't enough preparation to distinguish flashbacks from present-time. <br/><br/>The occasional white fades were awful and every Mike Nichols 'touch' (tight zooms, quick jump shots) were lost in this film.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman was the only redeeming character, but she didn't really redeem at all.

There is no plot other than these nitwits falling in and out of love faster than Charlie Sheen's life. Not once did I believe any of these characters were ever in love. I also never believed that they ever could fall in love with each other. Why does stuffy Jude Law falls for a stripper? Because she got hit by a car and smiled at him before she got hit. Why does big mouthed Julia Roberts fall for this English guy? Because he bought her a balloon at an aquarium. This is it folks! Lots of action here! Move over Die Hard, here comes Closer! Oh and get ready for some of the most vile, over the top graphic dialog ever in a film. The swearing would make Andrew Dice Clay, Peter North, Howard Stern, and Scott Estes wince. Not to mention when people speak, the other responds so quickly you can tell this is written and we are watching a movie. Why does Jude Law act like a woman in a chat room? How did Natalie Portman know that Jude Law was cheating with Julia Roberts? Why does the Virgin Mary pop up at the end holding an issue of Redbook, wearing a t-shirt that says, ""Make mine Marvel""?

","Somehow this film feels cold as one watches it unfold on the screen. Since this is not a story told in a linear manner, it confuses a lot of viewers, as the action switches back and forth. Mike Nichols is a director that has contributed a lot to the movies. He has an eye for what works and what doesn't. One suspects the problem with the film not being so accessible to everybody, lies in Patrick Marber's adaptation of his play. If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading here.<br/><br/>When ""Closer"" played on Broadway, it had a stellar cast. Perhaps, the weakest link in the film is Anna. As played by Julia Roberts, this is a woman who is an enigma, at best. One is never sure where she stands at any given moment. Anna, is a successful photographer, but her life is a mess. She is divided between Dan, the obituary writer that wants to be a novelist, and Larry, the doctor who falls in love with her, but who has a streak of sadism within him. Anna is ultimately her own victim for staying in a marriage that will destroy her in the long run. <br/><br/>Then there is Alice. When we first see her at the beginning of the film, she is walking in a crowded London street. Dan, the writer, is walking in the opposite direction, also surrounded by a lot of people. We know right away these two are going to meet, not realizing yet, they really don't know one another. Alice is hit by a taxi when she, obviously confused by the London traffic, has looked in the opposite direction in order to cross the street. Dan comes to help her. He ends up falling in love with her.<br/><br/>At the end of the film we also watch Alice, this time in New York. She is walking among a crowd in Manhattan and men keep ogling at her. What happens next, no one can see in the film, but it seems that Alice is going to try to walk as though she is still living in London. A fatal mistake!<br/><br/>Larry, the man in love with Anna, is also a troubled soul. He loves to chat with unknown persons in the internet. In fact, that's how he meets Anna, when he is misdirected to a date at the Acquarium. Larry is a sensual man whose desires are not satisfied by Anna. He must look for excitement wherever he can get it. That's why when he meets Alice, who is now on her own working as an exotic dancer in a stripper's club, Larry's wants to have sex with her, but the young woman proves to be a tease who will not go to bed with him. Larry confesses to Anna his indiscretions and how he had sex in New York on a business trip. Larry is the only one that achieves some sort of normalcy with Anna.<br/><br/>Dan is also a man that having found happiness with Alice, courts disaster in going for Anna. He betrays Alice in such a shameful way that makes us questions us his motives. He is a man who doesn't know what he wants. He had happiness, but let it go from his fingers in pursuit of Anna, who at the end, rejects him. When Dan questions Alice about her life in the States, she tells him she is just a plain nobody named Jane Jones, but in Dan's mind, she is lying. The truth comes out as she passes the customs area on her return to New York.<br/><br/>The film has a terrific star turn by Clive Owen. He is the one that comes out the best of all four actors because even though he plays the worst possible character, he makes a splash of it, in sharp contrast to the rest of the cast, with the only exception of Natalie Portman. Ms. Portman shows a vulnerable side to her Alice. Jude Law is not likable in his role and he is running the risk of overexposure in films. Julia Roberts is good in light comedy, but in a serious drama like this, shows a disadvantage that is notable.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols has created the right atmosphere for the movie. His choice of music is excellent as well, but one wonders if this is one of the best films of the year, why does it feel shallow in the final analysis."

","An utterly fascinating look at four gorgeous young people in London and their interrelationships over the course of several years. The two men played brilliantly by Clive Owen and Jude Law are driven by libido and are emotionally incapable of commitment. They truly represent modern man consumed with the need for conquest and gratification. The two women, even more dazzlingly acted by Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman understand and collaborate in the emotionally dead relationships that conflate exccellent sex with love and commitment. Altogether a serious but comic look at modern romance. The use, briefly of music from Cosi Fan Tutte suggests that perhaps these romantic entanglements really are not all that new."
"lawprof","10","3","7","10 December 2004"," Summary: Dazzlingly Brilliant: Nichols Takes the Relationship Flick to a New Level of Raw Honesty
","Director Mike Nichols took playwright and scriptwriter Patrick Marber's dissection of romantic entanglements affecting and forever altering the lives of two couples to a deep dimension of compelling complexity. Taking as a theme the devastating role jealously and lies play in peoples' love lives, Nichols crafted a drama that asks many questions including one most lovers face at one point or another - how much does a man or woman really want to know about a partner? And...can the price of forcing disclosure bring unwanted and uncontrollable relationship immolation? This is a four-character film as befits its origin in the theater. Set in London, it starts with a happenstance that by itself might augur a fairly ordinary, predictable plot. Alice (Natalie Portman) arrives from New York without so much as a carry-on bag. Unaware of the direction in which traffic move, she steps off a curb and is knocked down by a cab, fortunately receiving only minor injuries.<br/><br/>Rushing to her rescue is Dan (the so very-ubiquitous-on-screen-these-days Jude Law). Dan is an aspiring novelist whose first book will soon be out. To pay for tea and crumpets he pens obituaries for a newspaper. Off-handedly gallant, he takes the young woman, formerly a Big Apple stripper she later announces, to a very crowded casualty ward (as they call the E.R. in Old Blighty). Alice tells him she's left her previous boyfriend with just a few simple words, ""I don't love you anymore."" Her appearance reflects youth, her words suggest a lot of experience.<br/><br/>For the jacket of his book and publicity Dan needs his picture taken and Anna (Julia Roberts) is the society shutterbug with whom he falls instantly and deeply in lust in her studio. Never mind that Alice, now his live-in lover, will soon arrive at the studio after washing up from her waitress job.<br/><br/>Dan plays an asinine, juvenile prank on dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen, who played the same part on stage) to bring the doctor and the photographer together at an aquarium. It's the sort of stupid and also thoughtless ""joke"" now made easier and anonymous by the weapon of choice of many - the Internet. It's probably not even clear to Dan why he does this. A lot of things aren't clear to Dan.<br/><br/>What follows is complex interaction between the four as affections and genitals exchange places. Not casual lover swapping but rather emotion-laden experimentation with unpredictable outcomes. Very sharp cinematography and quick closeups do much to heighten tension and insure momentum. Momentum to what? This very adult, very affecting drama coheres largely because of the splendid acting of the outstanding quartet. Julia Roberts gives the most psychologically deep portrayal of her career. With a contract always short-stopping any nude scenes, Ms. Roberts' Anna is rawly naked emotionally. Dismissed by one lover as a ""depressive,"" her divorced Anna is more uncertain about what she wants than she is clinically depressed. She's successful and yet her face mirrors the too common fear of attractive, successful women that at heart they are frauds on the verge of being unveiled as such.<br/><br/>Engagingly quirky and fun as the photographer in ""Road to Perdition"" and more recently as the amoral, predatory Alfie in the re-make of the Michael Caine classic, Jude Law's Dan is a man who doesn't know when to stop asking the wrong questions, demanding answers he shouldn't seek. Sly and seductive at times, consumed by jealousy at other points, both too sure and very unsure, Law spins Dan to near chaotic life. Perhaps he's a cad, maybe he's simply in too deep with precious little introspection - Nichols and Law give Dan a flawed character who is viewed as a curiosity but without censure.<br/><br/>Larry, as projected by Clive Owen, is capable of psychological cruelty, a mask for his own needs. His relationship with the other three characters resembles a well-driven car that at unexpected moments threatens to career off the road because of the driver's lapse of control.<br/><br/>And that leaves the truly remarkable Natalie Portman who, intentionally or not, is the central character. Ms. Portman showed the depth of her acting range in a short scene in ""Cold Mountain"" which signaled she was ready for major roles in other than near sitcom flicks. Her breadth of emotions in ""Closer"" is powerful and gripping. From ingÃ©nue in London without apparently a change of clothes to a woman grappling with love won and possibly lost, she's alternately achingly vulnerable and surprisingly - almost brutally - steely. This is an Oscar worthy performance by a young actress who will be around, impressively so, for a long time.<br/><br/>What makes Closer"" so much more than the average relationship story is the questions Nichols poses but declines to answer. Trust, jealousy, commitment, lust, expectations, betrayal - all are interwoven in the four characters' interaction. And the unifying mystery is the question of questions. How much should any lover ask his/her partner about past relationships and even present moral if not legal infidelities? Not since the powerful Indie flick, ""Chasing Amy,"" has that very real and often destructive but sometimes uncontrollable need to know about a lover's past been so transparently pursued.<br/><br/>Reactions, including comments on this board, to ""Closer"" are highly polarized. There isn't much of a middle ground unlike for another recent superlative relationship movie, ""Sideways,"" where consensus seems to clump together at the high end. I suspect one reason why some viewers have hated this movie, including a few very vocal folks at the close of the screening in Manhattan today, is that Nichols makes a number of moviegoers genuinely uncomfortable seeing what so many of us, at one time or another, have endured in the quest for love. In a way, people who have never felt the heartbreak played out here, the unstoppable collision with the future, have missed something important albeit terribly hard.<br/><br/>Absolutely Mick Nichols's finest film but he couldn't have done it with a less gifted cast.<br/><br/>Fine cinematography and the score, ranging from pop to Mozart and Rossini, subtly but effectively supports the story line.<br/><br/>10/10"
"overcast22","10","3","7","7 December 2004"," Brilliant
","I heard about this movie a few weeks before it came out. When I saw the commercial I saw no action, and no obvious villain, just couples talking a lot. So I expected nothing. I had no idea the movie would be this good. I am so accustomed to being able to tell what will happen in the next scene of a movie before the scene happens, so I find most movies boring. In this movie I could not predict what would happen and was on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>At first you feel that Jude Law is just the ultimate pimp, every woman wants him and he hardly tries. You also feel sorry for Clive Owen because it seems that he is brilliant and good looking but his life is just going down the toilet. That is where the movie gets you. Later you discover that Clive Owen is a genius when it comes to understanding the human thought process and by the end of the movie he has basically stripped away all respect we hold for Jude Law and Owens shows us what he has known all along. He does this with all the main characters in the movie. We see what he has known all along, that Jude Law is a baby,that Julia Roberts enjoys destroying herself, and that Natalie Portman is a strong girl who is not mature enough yet to know how to deal with adult situations. <br/><br/>I think it is funny that people are saying that this movie is not happy and that it will not make you feel good about relationships, and that none of the characters are likable. I think what bothers people is that the movie does not sugar coat anything, what you see is what you get.<br/><br/>And in this movie, Clive Owen is a freakin God. His acting is incredible, the scene with him and Portman in the strip club was insanely good, and the way he plays with Jude Laws emotions is so genius and devious that you must admire him for it. Some of the stuff that comes out of Clive Owens mouth is so unexpected and shocking that you might as well assume his character has turrets syndrome.<br/><br/>the movie is very good. and if you do not like it because it is not a happy film, then go watch the incredibles or some other Disney movie.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie. 10/10"
"lfca1","10","3","7","4 December 2004"," ....Then Farther Apart
","I have been waiting for this film since I first started seeing previews at least 3 months ago. Reason 1: The stellar cast- Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman, and the seemingly omnipresent Jude Law. Reason 2: Mike Nichols. I've been a fan since The Graduate. and 3. The haunting song teaser they played in the previews, and now on the televised previews. This raspy, thready, ""I can't take my eyyyeesssss off you....."" - It positively obsessed me to find out the name and singer, which alone has been my unrealized mission for 3 months. I am being sidetracked, but bear with me. It will all become evident why I talk of the song so much. Okay, so on Thursday our local newspaper reviewer, who gave it an ""A-"", by the way, mentioned the song as being sung by Damien Rice. This Irishman has SOUL. Now about the movie. The song made me doubly interested in the movie, though I already knew I wanted to see it. Truth be told, had they not played that song in the preview, I wouldn't have been at the first showing the day it opened.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't disappoint, and does. This is NOT ""warm, fuzzy, holiday fare"". If you want that, stay home and watch Jimmy Stewart movies. What it IS is a finely tuned foray into relationships, specifically what we do to each other in relationships in quest for the ""perfect love"".<br/><br/>Excellent performances all around. The luminous Natalie Portman has gone to the top of my list, even surpassing the engaging Julia Roberts, who, incidentally, is not the sweet innocent she usually plays. Jude Law is so good, and thankfully made me forget Alfie. Clive Owen has the most expressive eyes. He gave a wonderful performance. It may be a bit difficult to adjust initially to each scene. The passage of time in between quickly becomes evident, however, and you'll find yourself in rhythm. Clive Owen gave an interview on our local TV station yesterday and prepared me, however, for the ending. I was really glad he did, because, although he didn't give anything away, he forewarned that you won't leave feeling all warm and fuzzy. Great effort from all involved. But leaves you feeling .......just leaves you ""feeling""......"

","A note to all thinking about watching this: All the negative reviews are failing to consider the perspective this film should be watched from. All of the dialog being said between the 4 main characters should be interpreted as what they are actually thinking but not saying. The actions and consequences play out on the screen as if we are saying all the ""normal"" things people say in these situations. Things that are often filled with mind games, false pleasantries, and deception with an end goal in mind, but not as raw or bluntly honest as the movie portrays. The title is Closer and alludes to what things look like between people when we are ""Closer"" to the honest thoughts and ambitions in their head.<br/><br/>My only complaint Is ""Alices"" story line and what happens with her at the end isn't really built up or explained well outside outside a handful of sentences. This makes her ending seem a little lacking."

Although if there's still something remotely resembling a message in this film is that no events are good or bad on their own and the beauty of this world is that even becoming a victim of a nasty prank might be a way to finding true happiness in your life.<br/><br/>Nobody knows what will happen to them and to those they love the next moment.

Larry and Anna are the victims of a practical joke, a potentially illicit encounter becoming acute public embarrassment. But Larry's rough charm wins through and Anna is won over. Or is she?<br/><br/>Patrick Marber's screenplay of his own play wears its stage origins on its sleeve. Scenes take place in one room, with little or no inter-cutting between locations. People talk a lot. But it works, because the emotions seem authentic, and the observations acute. <br/><br/>The main device is not to lead up to and reveal major decisions, but to join the action when the characters are dealing with the consequences of that decision. You have to pay attention as often you find yourself playing catch-up with the characters.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts is as impressive as she has ever been as depressive Anna. Larry figures out she can only be happy by making herself unhappy, and that is the key to his victory. It is the antagonism between the two males that drives the drama. ""I could take him in a scrap"" says Larry, and his confidence is not misplaced. Natalie Portman as Alice is woman with a past, one she is forced to re-visit when Dan's cruelty reaches its zenith. She has her own battle with misanthropic Dan to sort out. <br/><br/>You can see why the actors were attracted to this - Marber's script calls on them to act and react, to the petty and stupendous cruelties that all of us recognise from our own lives. They do the material ample justice.

","Some things never change. Nearly forty years after Mike Nichols explored a quartet of adult relationships in the over-hyped, drab and limp Carnel Knowledge comes Closer an over-hyped drab and limp exploration of love and betrayal dealing with another foursome of vapid, transparent characters. Little has changed over the period with the males still insecure sex obsessed boys and the women restrained adults swimming in melancholy, victimized by the eternal child.<br/><br/>Newspaper obit writer Dan (Jude Law) rushes to the aid of waitress / stripper Alice (Natalie Portman) who is bumped over by a taxi. The two become romantic and move in together. With her as muse he writes a promising book but falls for Anna (Julia Roberts) the photographer doing his jacket cover portrait. During a chat room exchange Dan let's his negative capability get the best of him, posing as female for horny surgeon Larry ( Clive Owen) that leads Lar to Anna. Anna marries Larry but Dan leaves Alice for Anna who leaves Larry for Dan causing Larry to stop shaving and straightening his tie and pay a visit to Alice at the strip club where his bestial desires heightened by sequins and colorful neon demand great restraint. Sensitive Dan in the meantime, with his ""addiction to the truth"" grows petulant and weepy after a couple of epiphanies while looking into mirrors. <br/><br/>Nichols characters are like the letters on a compass; demarcated by type. Sensitive male, brute male, young beautiful free spirit female, mature beautiful cautious female. They also interact in the same way since they don't seem to be listening to one another. The cast never seems to jell as Nichols disjointed narrative leaps to and fro without establishing relationships or maintaining mood from one scene to the next. Chemistry between the actors is non- existent as they try to stay within their insecure types. Jude Law's Dan is a spoiled unlikable child while Owen is a caveman infant terrible. Julia Roberts shows little enthusiasm for either male but has a whirlwind marriage with one while falling passionately in love with the other all in a year's time. Leave it to the world wise precocious stripper, effectively done by Portman to be the most level headed as she deals out sage advice while lying spread eagle before lustful Larry at the club.<br/><br/>Closer is a sober, solemn bore that whimpers along from start to finish. It's attempt to rise above its torpor with updated dirty talk and considerable exposure of Ms. Portman's (it's partially successful here) hot bod results in tepid titillation all around with this Carnal Redux by Nichols breaking no new ground two generations later. Relying on wide eyed pursed lipped close-ups of good looking movie stars to get at the heart of the matter never even scratches the surface of what makes their characters tick. Keep your distance."

He also seems to love Anna (Julia Roberts) but she ends up with Larry (Clive Owen).<br/><br/>A lot of people seem to hate this film a lot...probably because it's way too realistic. It's grim and has no comedy or light moments at all. The entire cast consists of those four actors--there's no small supporting roles at all. It was (pretty obviously) based on a play and sometimes sounds like a play. Some of the characters make speeches instead of talking to each other. Still I love this film. It's beautifully directed and has some very sharp but truthful observations about love, life and relationships. Almost the entire cast is excellent. Owen and Portman are easily the best actors here. Every line they say rings true. They also share a VERY sexually explicit (in terms of dialogue) sequence that is painful to watch but necessary for the film. Law is just OK in his role. He's not bad but he's not up to Owen and Portman. Roberts unfortunately is pretty terrible. She always has this blank look on her face and is unemotional to a ridiculous degree. Still, her aside, I recommend this film and find it one of the most truthful films I've ever seen on relationships. However be warned--it has VERY sexually graphic dialogue and is not a fun film to watch."

","When I watch a film, I hope to get one of the following out of the experience: a) be entertained, b) learn something, or c) benefit somehow spiritually. If the film provides me with two or even all three of these, all the better.<br/><br/>""Closer"" did not provide me with any substance from any of these aforementioned areas. As far as being entertained, aside from enjoying the sight of Natalie Portman seductively writhing in lingerie, this film scored ""B"" for boredom. Perhaps the only thing that kept me going was the hope of more scenes of Portman scantily clad. I learned nothing I did not already know from the film. When someone cheats on their significant other, it causes irreparable pain, and is very selfish and cruel. Duh! The only spiritual benefit I received from the film was the reassurance that I wasn't as shallow. weak-willed, and depressed as the characters on the screen. OK, so maybe there was a lil' positive influence.<br/><br/>But seriously folks... there just was nothing intriguing or even remotely interesting about this film. Portman, Clive Owen, Julia Roberts, and Jude Law all gave fantastic performances. Unfortunately, it was talent completely wasted on a nowhere story."

","I felt I wasted an evening watching this movie. The characters, all behave like stupid adolescents (the cast's calibre shows in the fact that they manage to carry their roles straight faced) - two relationships, each with potential but they both get screwed up, in each case they eventually realise they screwed up and try and reconcile, one relationship survives, one doesn't - end of story<br/><br/>The fact that the two relationships are intertwined adds a twist I guess, but the eventual 'message' is unchanged - if you act like a spoilt child and play around with your relationship like its a toy, it may or may not survive. Wow! That's really deep!"

","Closer is a movie chamaeleonic in time. The movie changes from viewing to viewing.<br/><br/>And that's all. Love it eventually. Love everything eventually.<br/><br/>The emotional starkness of the film is ravaging in two different ways. When the scenes are being played poorly it is enough to make one literally and audibly wince. When the scenes are being played well the movie is sad enough to bring tears.<br/><br/>The performances are easy to examine because the cast is only four strong. Jude Law is middling. When he is with Clive Owen he is good; the rest of the time he is poor. Natalie Portman is shocking in her compromised delivery of dialogue. It is almost as though she is entirely without emotional empathy at a biological level. Julia Roberts plays a photographer. Whenever she holds a camera it looks like the first time she has ever done so in her life. Her scenes with Natalie Portman are bleak. Clive Owen is awe-inspiring. Whether he is facing off against the absent Portman, struggling Roberts or competent Law, he always seems to be his character and totally immersed in the moment at hand.<br/><br/>There is lots of humour in this film. Some of it comes from the movie being good (mostly scenes with Clive Owen). Most of the humour comes from the agog awfulness with which the other actors handle their roles.<br/><br/>Anyone living anything less than a contented life full of love, preferably also an exciting and cosmopolitan life, will find this movie challenging and uncomfortable and unsettling and polarizing. It will leave you numb from how bad it can be and numb from how good it can be. It will make you laugh in mocking and laugh from being caught up in the moment with the characters. It is melancholy both in its nihilistic view of human existence and in the realist way it was compromised in casting to be brought to the screen. This movie is a sublime contradiction. It is undeniable. Every time one watches this movie there is more to love. It is so bubbling with confusing hot electric energy that one's emotions and thoughts are enlivened like bare skin in a chilly breeze. This movie can get inside your bloodstream. Like all addictive things, it is poisonous and at first your mind will try to reject it. If you can forget this initial unpleasantness, it will be a movie to love."

","Closer opens to a silent attraction between two people; a lustful desire for sure. Natalie Portman is very alluring in the film and saves it from falling into the unknown reels of forgetful films. The problem, right from the start with this lustful attraction, is that it fails to convince. Mike Nichols direction does not work on this 21st century (turn of the century)generation x an y drama.<br/><br/>The actors seem lost in their roles especially Roberts. She is such a powerful figure in film and should play such characters. In Closer, Roberts is given limited ability and also contradictions to her professional life. It seems unlikely that this woman of such stature would be involved with such goofiness. Not buying it.<br/><br/>Jude Law and Clive Owen seem bored as if they are two men on a merry go round of sexual wanderings and games. However, Portman's presence is most rewarding as she seduces them all including the audience.<br/><br/>Don't get too close with this film."

","this is a terrible film about terrible people doing terrible things to each other. the only arcs in character come when a character is at the end of his rope due to his or her own lack of integrity. while desperation can be an intriguing motivation, i prefer it to be brought on by outside circumstances, not a characters own selfishness and absolute disregard for those affected so deeply by his or her actions. i can't imagine why anyone would root for any of the four characters. while watching i simply kept hoping that all of the main characters would end in ruin. the attempt at making natalie portman's character the innocent victim of this mess is ruined by her obvious arousal during the exhibition scene, when larry caresses her face. if it weren't for the competent acting and, at times, compelling dialogue i would have given this film 1 star."

","When a work is focused on few characters, the writer had better make sure they are of interest. If they are unlikable, they should be fascinating so, with the kind of dialog that keeps the viewer's attention riveted.<br/><br/>""Closer"" is very much an ""in your face"" kind of movie. What makes it so unpalatable is that the characters thrust at you are ultimately an irritating bunch, whose petulant infantile behavior is something that you really need not bother yourself with. Interestingly enough, many here comment about the ""adult"" nature of the film. These are not adults. They are ageing adolescents whose lives are dominated by sex. Worse, its sex for as a means for manipulation and domination.<br/><br/>The paper thin story line is riddled with self conscious, at times laughable dialog. Marber's chief failure is in creating characters with virtually no depth to them at all. There's a ring of untruth to each one of them and hence their interactions, making it hard to take ""Closer"" anywhere nearly as seriously as is presents itself.<br/><br/>Actors have almost always flourished under the direction of Mike Nichols. Nichols' choices though as a movie director have often led him to material inferior to his talents. The performances in ""Closer"" as good as they are, (particularly Clive Owen) do not compensate for this unpleasant, incredible and overtly pretentious film."

Though their individual dependence on one another brings them closer, their insecurity breaks them apart. Anna (Julia Roberts), Alice (Natalie Portman), Dan (Jude Law), and Larry (Clive Owen) each lust for strangers, thus having jobs that usually brings strangers 'closer.' To borrow a tag-line from the movie, ""If you believe in love... Take a closer look,"" this film sucks you into a non-existing world that so closely both reflects and fictionalizes our society. Though some may say it lacks any realism, anyone who's lived in a large city on their own knows that the film pays homage and respect to their experience.<br/><br/>Brilliantly captured by one of the best directors of all time, Mike Nichols, it presents true messages and themes of passion, anger, jealousy, and of course love.<br/><br/>If you have never seen this movie I suggest you pick up a copy immediately.

Reading those comments dint help me ""understand"" anything. I realise now that there are many like that. All I can say is that this is a movie that is somewhat like an Oil Painting where thigs are painted on a canvas not to represent a photographic reproduction of a scenery but a rather rich illustration of the characteristics of what is being pained. Please read the comment written by user ""aimless"" below. As it is the most apt comment I have read for this movie. I am quite certain that this movie wont connect with people who are not into relationships or have not participated in the Darwinian dating/relationship game. Also many have mentioned about Julia Roberts being understated in this movie. BUT THAT IS HER ROLE!!! She playes the character of a clinically depressed person. who cant look straight into anyones eyes for long. She wants to escape as is the philosophical position taken by many married women. Clive actually words it. Clive is actually a victim of his own loyalty and desire to procreate!! Other characters are victims of a quest to find various truths. Julia is more controlling with the ""position"" of a vulnerable defensive person pretending to be trapped. The role of Julia Roberts is very subtle. And very powerful.<br/><br/>If you are a bloke, blokey bloke or a woman or a young girl... this movie is thoroughly engrossing. This movie will be mentioned in film schools in the future!

"gelman@attglobal.net","8","2","4","9 July 2005"," Don't Go for the Love Story: Possible Spoiler
","""Closer"" has been called ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"" with sex added, and that's not far off the mark. The Albee play is more about the exchange of devastating insults between the four principals, the Marber play (and movie) more about sexual interplay and treachery. In ""Closer,"" the race among the characters to be the least attractive human being is won at the wire by Jude Law's character. In contrast to the writer (Law), professional photographer (Julia Roberts), and physician (Clive Owen), it is the stripper (Natalie Portman)who actually turns out to be the nicest of the lot, even the least promiscuous. Mike Nichols is an excellent director, and ""Closer"" bears his distinctive touch. Like the Albee play, ""Closer"" requires four matched actors, and that's ALMOST achieved here. Julia Roberts does a superb job. Clive Owen is convincingly smarmy and disagreeable. Natalie Portman proves here that, in addition to being gorgeous, she really CAN act (a proposition thrown into considerable doubt by her performance in ""Star Wars 3). I'm of two minds about Jude Law. He is okay as the seducer but much less satisfactory as the loser in the game of love (okay, sex). His acting range seems incredibly narrow. Be warned: This film is about love affairs -- not about love. The viewer is asked to believe that there's love somewhere in the background of the changing relationships. But it all takes place off-screen. What's on the screen is sexual obsession -- and to hell with the human cost."

"KnightLander","8","2","4","22 June 2005"," Closer to perfection than any romantic-drama has ever come ...
","Let me begin by saying that ""Closer"" is the kind of film that you've gotta see for yourself to decide if you like it. Half the time I see reviews by people who loved the film, and half the time I see reviews by people who absolutely despised it. I, myself, loved it.<br/><br/>""Closer"" is the story of four individuals: obituary writer and struggling author Dan (Jude Law), waitress and ex-stripper Alice (Natalie Portman), popular photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) and dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen). Dan and Alice meet in London after Alice is hit by a car. A few months later, Dan is being photographed for his novel by Anna, and the two fall in love - but only Dan will admit it. Trying to get back at Anna, he pretends to be her on an Internet sex chat and tells Larry to meet her at an aquarium for sex. By chance, the real Anna is at the aquarium; she meets Larry and the two fall in love.<br/><br/>Eventually, Alice leaves Dan and Anna leaves Larry. By the end of the film, each man has had sex with each woman and vice versa; they seem to love whomever they're with, but in reality they only love their original partner.<br/><br/>I'd heard good things about this film before watching it, but after watching it the first time I was disappointed. While it was no doubt a fine film, there was more sexual dialog than I could have ever imagined! Now I can tolerate sexuality in a movie just as much as the next guy, but when the film becomes unrealistically sexual than I become fed up with it. And ""Closer"" seemed to be just that. But now, having watched the movie numerous more times, I realize that the film is abnormally sexual, but not necessarily overly sexual. Would it have been better without so much sexuality? Yes. But the rest of the film makes up for it. Oh yes, does it ever.<br/><br/>Patrick Marber's script is adapted from Marber's popular, award-winning play. The script is witty, intelligent and original. There are some great lines, which come from characters who seem very real.<br/><br/>The acting is one of the film's high points. Jude Law is terrific as Dan, who tries to be mean but just can't pull it off. He makes the character a target for sympathy from the audience. Natalie Portman is, as always, very good, as Alice. Julia Roberts, while good, doesn't give the best performance of her career; it feels like she's not putting in a huge amount of effort. Clive Owen is outstanding as always; Owen's performance has made Larry my favorite character in the film. He really brings out the bad side of Larry, but he's likable at the same time. There's a certain air of mysticism around Larry, like you never know what he's going to do next. Interestingly, Owen played Law's part in the original stage play.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols proves that his directorial talent hasn't faded one bit since he made the 1967 classic ""The Graduate"" - in fact, Nichols seems better than ever. He gives the film a cold, hard feeling, but at times he seems to loosen up - much like the characters themselves. He really captures the darkness of Patrick Marber's script.<br/><br/>The few songs on the soundtrack are excellent, but the one that really stands out is ""The Blower's Daughter"" by Damien Rice. It's used for the film's theme, and there isn't another song in the world that is so perfect for this movie as ""Blower's Daughter"". The song is absolutely beautiful; the sad, determined strength found in the lyrics matches the film well.<br/><br/>""Closer"" is closer to perfection than any romantic-drama has ever come. If you're looking for a soft romance like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or ""Notting Hill"", then this is probably not the movie for you. This is a mature, dark, grim look at romance, and I love it. ""Closer"" has become one of my favorite films. If you feel like watching the film and deciding for yourself how you feel, and you keep an open mind, then I applaud you."
"ininotores","3","2","4","16 June 2005"," Silly, unrealistic, and bad character development.
","This film is all about its main characters getting themselves confused between sexual attraction and love. Love in such relationships obviously involves sexual attraction, but what this film doesn't do well is to portray these characters as human beings who can, for one day, just understand love without having to talk about sex at *all* times. Everything they do and talk about in this movie about sex. That's not a bad thing in itself, but this movie addresses boy-girl relationships in a very narrow way. These characters just can't wait to jump each other, and then later torment each other with endless interrogation made up of repetitive boring unrealistic questions about what they experienced during their sex acts while cheating on each other. I say the word ""unrealistic"" here a lot, because half the time I was amazed (in a bad way) at how silly the way these characters talk to each other. I mean, come on. Who talks and asks each other such endless repetitive boring meaningless questions day in, day out anyway? I say ""meaningless"" because these questions are often in the form of ""Did you cum?"", ""Was he a good f***?"", ""Now that you've f**ked him/her, who do you love more??"" LOVE?? Since when did real love have to be judged on the basis of one's sexual performance during a romping session?? I don't know. It just seems like a pretty shallow movie to me. Perhaps that's what the director wanted to portray : shallow human beings who dominate our current world, where good looks and a cunning ability to manipulate and control other people makes all the difference between a ""loser"" and a ""winner"". However, the poor character development fails to redeem this movie. The juxtaposition of time in this movie doesn't help either. Basically every other element in the movie helps reduce these main characters to mere pretty but bland creatures with a very one-dimensional quality to their personas. We are not told anything more about what these characters do outside of their bedroom affairs and their non-stop meaningless chitchat about their sexual preferences. BORING. Considering they have quite a strong cast in this movie, the director could have made more use out of them by tweaking the movie script a little, focusing on more things in life and not simply the one-dimensional focus on sex and chitchat about sexual preference. Its simply not realistic at all. Okay, movies are allowed to be fantasies, they are allowed to be non-realistic, and they can still be good (Look at ""Amelie"", for example!) But this show is NOT fantasy at all. It can be real, if you live in such a narrow world where you spend all your time manipulating 2 different girl/boyfriends, jilting one for the other periodically, and then getting angry when they do the same to you, and then endlessly bombarding them with boring repetitive questions like a pseudo-psychiatrist. But I don't live in such a world. So I can't empathise.<br/><br/>Not only that, people who want to see this movie thinking its a sexy film with pretty nude bodies may be disappointed to realise after watching this, that the closest thing to sexiness in this movie is seeing Natalie Portman prance around as a stripper in the strip club towards the end (and don't get your hopes too high either. She never really strips, not even reveal her bosom, LOL!) Basically just a really pointless silly movie. After I watched it, I felt disappointed. Yet because I remembered seeing so many glowing reviews everywhere raving about this movie, I thought I must have missed out something great about the movie, so I tried to rehash the movie in my head, trying to see some hidden great meaning, some hidden gem of a great truth that I failed to see whilst watching the movie. Yet hours have passed by, and nope. I still fail to see what's so good, ""intelligent"", or ""real"" about the movie.<br/><br/>I will give this movie 3 points out of 10. One point for Natalie Portman's performance. She can easily be touted the best actress in this whole movie, especially considering how young she is, her performance is spectacular. One more point, this time for the somewhat unpredictable ending. I like unpredictable endings in movies. Unfortunately this is probably the only thing that kept me watching this movie all the way through, because the movie simply sucks in most other respects. One more point, this time for the great soundtrack. You know, there's not one single song I heard in the movie that I disliked. In fact, most every song I heard, I wanted to hear it a second time, a third time, etc... In fact, I think the soundtrack for this movie is so good, it actually helps (alongside the unpredictable ending) to pull the whole movie together, to make the movie more tolerable.<br/><br/>If I want a dose of reality, I take a walk outside of my house and interact with people. Depressive as reality may sometimes seem, its still nothing as bleak as the reality which this movie portrays and would have us believe. People sleep around, yeah but not to the extent of living like the sick unlikeable people that this movie is all about. Overall, a movie which is not that likable, yet not that unlikeable, but I tend a bit more towards it being unlikeable."

","Whether he turns out to be the new Bond or not, or whether or not Morgan Freeman steals his Oscar this month, one thing remains utterly sure: Clive Owen's performance in this film is one of the best, most brutal, most honest, most fearless and most captivating male performances in recent Hollywood history. This man DESERVES the Oscar, although going up against Morgan Freeman isn't going to be easy, since Freeman never won an Oscar before, and they want to give him one while they can (although his performance in the brilliant Million Dollar Baby isn't his best and most showy work to date).<br/><br/>Clive Owen is the superstar of this film, and every longing woman that goes to see this to get yet another glimpse of their dream man (Jude Law), will forget all about him instantly and fall under the Owen spell. He received a Golden Globe for this role, and if justice truly exists he will get an Oscar as well the 27th. Natalie Portman comes off twice as good as Julia Roberts in an amazing performance as well, showing that she might be one of the biggest actresses yet (as she began to reveal in Cold Mountain). So forget about her wooden Star Wars escapades, alongside Owen she makes one of the decade's most powerful star-making performances. But still, Owen is the real star here. And he's even funny as well! You haven't experienced anything, till you've seen what Mr. Owen can do with the right material!"
"regjer","8","2","4","30 January 2005"," It is as if Nichols is taking vengeance against the typical saccharine Hollywood love story.
","Director: Mike Nichols Closer is a mean-spirited, vicious, and ugly love story. Love story? It is as if Mike Nichols has taken the sunny fantasy that is the typical movie love story and turn it inside out, exposing all that is loathsome and sordid in human relationships.<br/><br/>Conversely, the cinematography is stunning and beautiful, and mirrors the claustrophobic boundaries of the plot. It feels as if the camera's landscape is almost exclusively tight-framed shots of the four character's faces. In the way Hitchcock would work within sever, self-imposed restricted landscapes (a lifeboat (Lifeboat), a courtyard (Rear Window)) Nichols self-imposed limitation is his casts' expressions, never venturing far from each face. And it works spectacularly. His cinematic method is mirrored by Julie Roberts' character, Anna's, photographic portrait style. Anna creates tight framed, large-scale portraits of faces in various expressions of pain. And in Closer it seems if you stopped the film from rolling each minute you could extract another gorgeous still portrait from the frame to hang along side Anna's work.<br/><br/>As far as the story, it is a script with boundaries as tight as the cinematography. I cannot think of a line spoken in the film by anyone but the 4 characters involved in these ugly, criss-crossing relationships. It is hard to recall even another human entering a frame of this film. Closer is a nasty, claustrophobic, four-way character study, with each character given equal weight. The four characters, who all meet in various ways and all by chance, betray each other with the others over the course of the film. Jude Law's Dan ends up the most broken character by the film's end, having lost both women to Clive Owen's Larry. Larry, who refers to himself as a simplistic and caveman (both true), comes out on top of the power struggle. Larry is also the most reviled character having destroyed both Anna and Dan by the film's end with his vicious, vengeful control. Anna is the weakest character, referred to a number of times as a coward. Easily manipulated by Larry, Anna succumbs as Larry possession. She is deeply unhappy, but unable to fight against Larry's relentless will.<br/><br/>Portman's Alice is the least damaged by the events in the film, perhaps because of her youth. (Alice is 24 by the end of the film's 4-year time span.) Alice alone is able to escape. In the final scenes Alice frees herself of all emotional ties to Dan and physically escapes back to New York. The final scene showing Alice walking confidently down Time's Square is a powerful image of strength, and more importantly personal reinvention. New York, of course, is the symbol of personal freedom, the city to which countless people have fled to forget the past and emerge a self-invented new person. And if there was ever a situation someone would like to scrub herself clean from, it is the grime of this film. The fact that we find out in the next to last scene that she was living a lie in London under a made up name makes her rebirth in New York all the more complete, and the break from this past all the more clean. Conversely, the three characters that did not escape seem all the more trapped and destroyed.<br/><br/>Uniquely, Nichols has no main character, no sympathetic point of view to serve as a lens into the films. Additionally, the most despicable character, Larry, does not meet his dramatic justice, but instead has assumed power over Anna, and has left Dan damaged and alone. Neither devise is extraordinary in itself; however, such devises are more common in crime films, and Closer, if told traditionally, would be romantic comedy (here, a romantic comedy told with the sensibility of Reservoir Dogs). It is as if Nichols is getting his own vengeance against the typical saccharine, Hollywood love story, showing an amount of sordid darkness equal to the standard amount of romantic sunshine.<br/><br/>At this point I must put Closer to my test for disturbing stories: Is the film's importance, intelligence, artistry, acting (or some other feature) fine enough to justify the horrid subject matter? For my money the answer is yes, and I have surprised myself by the answer. The most compelling reason to see this film is the artistry. The claustrophobic limitations of the story (the four human characters) and cinemagraphic limitations of landscape (the four human faces), the stark, vulnerable performances, all are stunning and worthy of viewing.<br/><br/>Should you see it? Yes, but with the warning of the ugliness found within its fames."

","The movie is awesome. Indeed it's a more mileage viewer that can appreciate all the turns and follow them. But the film did make it. It was long enough to put me to sleep, like some movies used to, but I was alert and present till the final titles. Julia's had all my prejudices. A famous, rich actress, working out on her potential potency. She used to be young, fresh and charming, but now the time for the characteristic roles had come. I was wrong. Julia's the jewel, which never loses its light and magnetism. Her soft smiles, barely distinguishable changes in the sculpture of her face are amazing. While watching the film I had a notion that most of time she wouldn't have dared speak. Her presence was her language. And I must confess I was wrong about her acting powers and abilities. Sorry Julia. Ms. Portman I've already seen in, say a movie span. She's grown older now to her advantage and created some real beautiful moments. The moments came and passed and after I left the theatre behind me, I realized that there's much for her to reach for and attain. With all her beautiful face, charming and suggestive pronunciation, she needs time to lift us up where we belong. In the movie she somehow reached the peaks and all of a sudden got tuned down for reasons unknown. Jude was good but for my taste his acting was too soft...womanish-like. His counterpart has been great especially while typing on his laptop to an unknown adventurous girl. Whoa. That was an adventure. It's hard to get a clear message from the film, and it's good. Life doesn't offer clear messages. From the other hand I am not sure if leaving a viewer at large, with hints uncertain should be considered a proper thing. Well...at least we might discover another angle while watching our lives, cause the movie's definitely not another cliff-hanger to see us fall. The time will tell. The movie's my best for 2004."

","Not one person sitting around me in the cinema found this film enlightening or entertaining. The characters had no redeeming qualities and it was hard to stay put in your seat until the end of the film. People leaving the cinema were discussing the 15 certificate and queried if it had been given the correct classification. Most were saying it should have been an 18. Two parents who'd come along with their teenage daughter squirmed in their seats next to me during the internet sex exchanges. The daughter sank into her seat mortified.<br/><br/>There were a couple of snappy one-liners but generally the wordy screenplay made it difficult for the actors to breathe life into.

","I had very high hopes of this film. I watched the trailer a dozen times, I loved the Damien Rice song it featured (""Blower's Daughter""), and I'd heard a lot of buzz about Clive Owen.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, this was the first time I was ever compelled to walk out of a film. Parts of it were laughable, at best. If I am not mistaken, it was adapted from a play. I was not surprised to find this out, considering throughout the entire movie I was thinking, ""It sounds like they're reading right from the script."" It's also getting a lot of buzz for being ""raw"" which I think is overrated. Perhaps I'm the only one, but I wasn't particularly impressed that someone got America's sweethearts (Portman and Roberts) to say words like ""cunt"" and ""cum."" There are much more effective ways to make a movie unsettling than to use excessive profanity.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I nearly fell asleep during this film. When I wasn't slumped over in my chair, I was laughing (particularly when Portman half-heartedly spits in Jude Law's face) at this feeble attempt at a worthwhile film."

","While Julia Roberts is not known for choosing deep, dramatic projects, she gave an impressive performance here. Natalie Portman is not my favorite, either, but I adored her in this. Her charm read better in this film than in previous work. Jude Law and Clive Owen are personal favorites who did not disappoint. This was the most realistic, adult movie I've seen in some time. Some will be turned off by the talky, stage quality of the film, but as an actor I was engrossed by the intellectual nudity that was present in place of graphic sex scenes (with a couple scenes excepted). It's nice to finally hear some intelligent, realistic dialog with a plot to match. While terribly depressing, it reflects some of the more difficult, unexplored questions about love and doesn't attempt to give definite answers to them. A fine piece of theater."

","You look at the cast, and you'd think ""how can this film not be good?"" Graphic sexual language doesn't shock me all. What bothered me about this film was that everything in the movie was done for shock value. It didn't shock me. It was just a poor attempt at cheap thrills. This film reminded me of ""Mystic River,"" which got a ton of critical acclaim. Largely I feel because of the names cast in the picture. But if you drop in a bunch of unknown actors, it becomes a fringe film that might not even make it to wide release. I think this film is further proof that the names on the marquee are what drive ticket sales, not the quality of the script. The lone bright spot in the film for me was Clive Owen, who is able to play ""Larry"" as a complete and total mentally diseased person."

","The story did not flow; months would pass and the only evidence was when the characters said so. A horrid inversion of ""show not tell."" There is no character development, you end up hating them all for their inability to maintain honesty with themselves and others. The characters display no traits to make them likable only pitiable. There was graphic sexual dialogue, which did not bother me except that it added nothing to the story. It was difficult to decipher the message the viewer is supposed to come away with but I believe we are intended to believe that love is not having to know the truth about the another's actions. Yet all this film showed me is that if a character with no self-esteem is selfish and seeks happiness through sexual conquest, they will not end up happy, but I already knew that."

","Mike Nichols is one of my favorite directors, a multi-talented genius who has never been afraid to work on the edge (quite possibly he cannot work any other way), and when he delves into the intense Scorpionic waters of the savagery involved in the vast majority of one-on-one relationships, you know a profound experience is in store.<br/><br/>With Closer, he returns to the Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf format of 4 people brutally ravaging one another's psyches. Closer is different though, of course, because it takes place over a period of time rather than a consecutive amount of days, as Woolf did, and it's a much better film, I believe: over the years, Nichols has managed to hone his innate Scorpio talent of restraint, and Closer benefits from this magnificently. Like Virginia Woolf, it's based on a play, and it does feel stagy, but this works FOR the film - the framework of one scenario after the other in which time has passed (or regressed, as the case may be; the film is not entirely linear, which is another brilliant choice) creates the discipline - the illusion of civility - necessary to exhibit the brutal mind games and lethal, obsessive ego-driven powerplays that endlessly occur between the 4 characters.<br/><br/>I realized over dinner after seeing it last night (my last film of 2004!) that Closer is basically an s&m film, without one whip or chain ever appearing, and it's an unbelievably violent film, without one head rolling across the screen and without the male characters resorting to duking it out in the streets a la Bridget Jones. I also appreciated how ONLY the 4 characters have speaking parts in the movie, and how all 4 are very articulate and somewhat self-aware: they sort of know why they're doing what they're doing, they do understand themselves on some level, but they're still helpless to stop their behavior because their egos are involved, particularly with the 2 men.<br/><br/>What they don't understand - or want to understand - is the meaning of 'truth', which is essentially a 5th character in the movie: 'truth' is used as a blunt instrument by all 4 of the characters, and ironically, when one of them actually TELLS the truth in a non-hurtful way (it's Alice, who admits to Larry at one point that her real name is Jane) she is of course not believed. At the heart of this is the sad truth that most of the time, whenever anyone tries to get closer to anybody else, whether the attempt is sincere or otherwise, he or she eventually comes to understand that most people cannot deal with the truth, do not want to hear it and certainly not from someone they're intimately involved with, even if that person is sincere and not using 'truth' as a weapon, and so all relationships wind up being untruthful in one way or another.<br/><br/>Law's Daniel commits what I think is the most mean-spirited act in the film, by chatting with Owen's Larry in an internet sex room (in one of the edgiest scenes in the film or rather it's tied with the scene in the strip club between Larry and Natalie Portman's Alice aka Jane - too provocative to even begin to describe, where the power shifts back and forth like in an especially well-matched chess game). In the chat room scene, Dan poses as Anna (Julia Roberts, who has never looked more human or been presented more effectively as seen through fellow-Scorpio Nichols' probing lens), but then he takes the chat one step further by telling Larry to meet 'her' at the aquarium, where he knows Anna goes all the time. Larry goes and Anna's there and Larry makes a major fool of himself, and he doesn't forget it - he gets his revenge indirectly through Anna and then directly, in the film's most brutal verbal confrontation between him and Daniel, later on.<br/><br/>It also wasn't lost on this viewer how ironic the characters' professions in the film are: Anna is a photographer - she takes pictures of strangers, hoping to show their humanity but in reality she's using them because she doesn't really seem to be learning anything from her work. Alice is a stripper, which she digs because of the obvious power trip involved. Dan is a writer of obituaries by day and a fiction writer the rest of the time - he admits early on to Alice that his obits are all resplendent with euphemisms (i.e.: ""'he enjoyed his privacy' means he was a raving queen"", like that), and his fiction is apparently sex-driven accounts of his relationships; he's in essence using his partners as fodder for said fiction. Larry is a doctor, specifically a dermatologist: skin - superficial layers that get deeper as they are revealed. He has one of the best lines in the piece, which occurs during the final confrontation between the men, where Dan is whining about 'the heart' and Larry shoots back, ""have you ever seen a human heart? It looks like a fist covered in blood"", words to that effect - not the most subtle imagery, but in context it speaks volumes.<br/><br/>My IMDb rating: 10 (****)"

After you get past the whole, ""It's brutally honest"" B.S. what one is left with are beautiful performances and a pleasing end result. The subject material is slightly elevated in theme (sex and adultery), but, for the most part, adults will be able to relate in some way to one or more of the character. Speaking of whichÂ… We have Jude Law in what may accurately be labeled his best performance to date; he is both touching and detestable at the same time creating an enigma for the viewer - do I love him or hate him? Regardless of the decision, one must admit that his ability to create such mixed feelings only shows his strong-hold as an actor.<br/><br/>Julia, Julia, Julia, who, in their right mind, can say no to Julia Roberts dirty talking? Well, the truth is that she is the weakest character in the film, and that's saying a lot. HOWEVER, that is not to say that her acting is low-grade by any means. On the contrary, it is just that everyone else is so great and have much more interesting characters, not to mention that she actually has very less face-time in comparison. But when all is said and done, Roberts is as strong as ever, and she definitely gives her most vulnerable performance to date.<br/><br/>WARNING: Oscar alert! Mr. Clive Owen is so incredibly awesome in this movie! I have not really seen any more of his material, but I can already say that I am a fan. His acting is flawless, breathtaking, and so real that one cannot help but take notice. I hope to see much more from him in the future.<br/><br/>WARNING: Oscar alert!

","This movie tries something different.. nowadays more and more filmmakers are going for those ""out of the ordinary"" scripts, this movie is somewhat one of them. The true beauty that lies in this film is the fact that it is real, it focuses on how we fall in and out of love with others, and then you really can't be sure of how close you are to someone, or how well you think you know them. Starting Off With The Acting.. Clive Owen and Natalie Portman are the stars of the show.<br/><br/>Clive delivers at truly remarkable performance especially after coming off of King Arthur. He is strong, believable, and has an undeniable presence when his face is on the screen.<br/><br/>Natalie has finally shown what she is capable of in this movie, and just goes to show how truly talented she is. After being amazing in Garden State, she has grown a lot. She is amazing as Alice, the youngest, but strongest of the 4 leads. As the most complex characters, she delivers in the best way, possible.<br/><br/>Julia definitely has stepped it up. Now she's been stereotyped in some of her earlier movies, but this is her most real role to date. Julia truly makes the character of Anna unlikable, and even though she's Julia Roberts you still can't help but dislike this character. Good, but outshone by Natalie.<br/><br/>Jude Law has been quite a few good movies, and he is pretty good as Dan. His acting is fairly good, but again, he is outshone by Clive Owen. I'm not saying his performance is bad however, it was very good, and you can't ask for much more when your cast as a character like Dan.<br/><br/>The movie itself is near flawless... however it may be a little jumpy. Each character has a line that just gets you, and those lines are delivered with such force. Bravo Mike Nichols! The dialogue is extremely intricate.. however the overall plot could have been tweaked. In all honesty, I thought this movie would be incredible... leagues ahead of ESOTSM, because it did have the potential. But my actual feeling about it had to be toned down, while it's not the amazing legend I thought it might be, It is still easily one of the best movies of this year and all time<br/><br/>This movie will have it's haters but... don't forget you're not supposed to like these characters, and this movie is very sexual. But it's not claiming that it isn't very sexual, so don't criticize it for what it's trying to do.<br/><br/>On par with Eternal Sunshine and Before Sunset, and Finding Neverland.<br/><br/>*~10/10~*"

Just think of the political scene, both in America and Britain...The parallels of the movie's theme and the lies and betrayals in each of our countries is astonishing.<br/><br/>Art is always meant to be seen on more than one level...as is life itself...but too often we settle for what seems obvious and literal.

I think I'm in love with Clive Owens - but he was a spiteful S.O.B.<br/><br/>At the end of this movie, I was drained, and wondered what the point was that was (supposedly) being made?

It would be easy to judge these characters and hate them and the movie, but the truth is to the people on the insides of these involvements it always seems they're doing the best they can and really are being honest. Step out of the observers point of view, or think of somebody you've known who's like Anna, or Dan. <br/><br/>I also can't believe this film had me cheering (inwardly) for the unscrupulous fight Larry put up to win Anna back.

","Closer is witty, clever and compelling and there is great chemistry between Law, Roberts, Portman and Owen who leave their star status behind and really embody the characters. The themes of trust, honesty and jealousy are familiar but conveyed brilliantly and innovative by Nichols. It also contains some rather revealing scenes of Natalie Portman as a stripper for all the red-blooded males out there.<br/><br/>It is clear from the start that the material is adapted from a play - the above four are essentially the only characters in the whole film, it is entirely dialogue-based and there are temporal ellipses throughout. Whereas in the theatre the characters would leave the stage and the curtain would go down to mark each year or so gap, the cinema audience has to figure out the breaks for itself and it can occasionally be quite confusing.<br/><br/>But Closer is a treat - a Best Of compilation of relationships without the forgettable sugary bits in between."

","*Major League Spoilers - forget about it!*<br/><br/>First: taken as a whole, the movie is pointless. It opens with a shot of Jude Law and Natalie Portman walking towards each other. Ends with a shot of Nat just walking, with no cutting to Jude. This is a common technique that encourages people to think about the character and how he (or in this case, she) has changed, or at least what choices they made and what the consequences of those choices were. OR at the very, VERY least, we are meant to feel empathy for what the character has gone through. I felt none of these things. The movie has a few brutal moments, but never builds on them, instead it meanders through the characters' relationships, often in unmotivated ways, and occasionally in forced ways. It's a shame, because the few moments of brutality (I mean emotionally brutal, not physically brutal) are so promising, so compelling, so powerful, that you WANT the movie to draw you in and show you the awful things people are capable of doing when they are hurt. But instead, it teases us with a few of these moments, then abandons them in favor of long stretches of oh-so-clever dialogue, or arbitrary plot twists.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film was unsatisfying. It tried my patience several times and in the end did not deliver. Having said that I can report that the performances are fantastic. The film might be a commercial success on the basis of hints of profundity and the performances turned in by the four players. <br/><br/>Clive Owen caught my attention in King Arthur (a movie I disliked), and in this movie he takes it up a notch, exploding onto the screen. He delivers every moment he is on screen. The scene with Natalie in the club is brutal and true. In my opinion, this guy is a star, period.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is simply stunning. Every time I see her in a movie, she outdoes herself. Just when I think she's going to slip, just when I think she's going to bore me by repeating herself (in terms of repeating a performance from a past role), she reaches down deep and grabs a little bit more of my psyche, and makes me a fan all over again. She sets the bar higher every single time, then catapults over it, leaving me in awe. My high expectations - which I expect to be disappointed are instead surpassed.<br/><br/>I don't like Julia Roberts, but I didn't mind her in this role. I hope she grows up (now that she's a mommy) and starts bringing a serious emotional component to her work.<br/><br/>I don't like Jude Law. Maybe it's just me, but I don't see what the big deal is with this guy. I saw this movie with a friend and he told me Jude Law apparently prefers supporting/ensemble roles. OK, I'll bite.

It does get a bit complicated throughout and you'll still be thinking about on your way home as you try to sort out who slept with whom and who lied to whom. Julia Roberts is as beautiful and I'd be dishonest if I didn't say that Jude Law is a good-looking fellow. I think the perverts of the world may be somewhat disappointed as they scour the internet trying to find the nudity that was so much hyped before the movie came out. I think they're expecting more that was actually shown (and more than the story required). I thought it was tastefully done and really is a watershed moment in Natalie's career.

Who lives in this zany world? Egad, it was like a bad soap opera. I give it a 2. And that's for the 2 hours I want back."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Surprisingly little good to be said about the horrible film from highly acclaimed director Mike Nichols (""The Graduate"" HBO's ""Angels in America"", ""Working Girl""). Known for his ability to capture human nature, often with comic overtures, Nichols fails to deliver either in this psychotic, twisted film that watches like a play and conjures up memories of the unlikable folks from Nichols ""Carnal Knowledge"".<br/><br/>The topic is sex and love and the talk is more than frank ... it is presented to shock. This is not your normal Julia Roberts movie, which should be a good thing, but isn't. Jude Law plays a sniveling little wimp and Clive Owen (""King Arthur"") is a conniving 'cave man' (his character's words). The only actor who delivers any substance at all is Natalie Portman in her scene at the airport hotel towards the end. Trust me when I tell you, don't see this one with your mom or your kids ... and best to avoid it altogether."

","Although Julia Roberts and Jude Law would be considered the leading actress and actor of this film, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman are the ones who really stand out. In the film, Portman plays a young stripper/waitress, Alice, who falls in love and moves in with Law's Dan, who repeatedly cheats on her with Robert's Anna, who keeps seeing him even when she marries Owen's Larry. Alice is both innocent and nasty, being the first one hurt by Anna and Dan's affair and the second to seek revenge. She comes off as the wisest and least nasty of the four, but that doesn't mean she's clean. On the contrary, Larry is very nasty. His obsession with and devotion to Anna is very genuine, and when he finds out about the affair, he interrogates her in a way so crude and tough it would put any police interrogator to shame. He comes off as the cleverest, the one who knows how to pit one lover against the other and come out on top. Although Anna and Dan are the two that begin the battle of affections, Alice and Larry are the ones who play the game and end the war."

","This was one of the most emotionally raw films I have seen in a long time. And, I thought, one of the truest. For anyone who has ever been involved in an infidelity, it was quite true to form. It was very well written and directed. The actors, for the most part, did an excellent job. The least impressive was Julia Roberts (who spent the majority of the movie looking like she was trying to hide her body) though she didn't necessarily do a bad job. Natalie Portman was definitely the star of this film however. Her performance was really enjoyable to watch and she has shown herself to be an incredibly capable actress. While I enjoyed the movie, it's not going to be for everyone. Some would never be unable to get beyond the graphic nature of the dialog. For a movie where you never actually saw anyone having sex, it was a very sexually graphic film - if you see it, you'll understand what I mean.

Complications arise when Dan falls for photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) after the 2 meet when she takes his picture in order for Dan to promote his new book. Dan decides to pursue Anna and confesses his love to her; however further complications arise when Dan's involvement inadvertently brings Anna and dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen) together whom go on to become a married couple...<br/><br/>Despite not being particularly drawn by the initial premise of this film I decided to give it a try based on its fairly high IMDB rating and its strong cast of reliable actors. Whilst Closer is certainly not a bad film, for me, it isn't as good as it could have been either...<br/><br/>One thing you have to know going in to watching this film is that it is not a fun ride; all 4 characters at some point or another are deceitful and are all fairly unlikeable - although naturally how unlikeable they all are is variable from person to person. This very facet may prove to be a little off-putting to some, but I think what is worse than this is that you're in the company of several unlikeable people whom we don't really learn a great deal about.<br/><br/>The relationships all feel a bit shallow and seem to be built upon very little; to be perfectly honest I could see no real reason why anyone is drawn to anyone whether the couples are together or effectively 'swinging.' To me this is not a particularly insightful character piece as it only ever feels like the writers are scratching the surface with each of the relative personas. There are also quite a number of time-jumps (sometimes months or years at a time) which are a bit jarring considering nothing is really reflected on or explained through the various passages of time; it seems that the marriages and relationships fail as flimsily as they were set-up and despite my best efforts I just couldn't see this as being the brilliant 4 piece character study that others may have seen.<br/><br/>Still I have to admit that despite the characters feeling a bit thin and underwritten, director Mike Nichols punctuates the film with sharp dialogue and some really punchy scenes (the scene with Anna and Larry in the strip club is one such notable scene). Nichols also gets very good performances out of his talented cast; the 4 main players are all excellent and do their best to bring their characters to life as much as they can (despite none of them having as much depth as they perhaps should have had).<br/><br/>Closer is a decent enough film and is worth seeing, but I feel if the characters had a little more depth and if I was able to gain more of an understanding of them as people I may have found it a little more involving. Despite the obvious moral lesson, the film doesn't offer much that you wouldn't see in your everyday daytime 'soap opera' and I couldn't shake this notion that Closer wasn't much more than a bog-standard soapbox drama with a few bells and whistles thrown in."

","Patrick Marber adapted his own play about two not-so-loving couples in London who briefly exchange partners after romance sours at home: Julia Roberts is a photographer who marries dermatologist Clive Owen while flirting heavily with failed novelist Jude Law, who in turn is married to stripper/waitress Natalie Portman. Not even a superb director like Mike Nichols can get us over the implacable, impossible meet-cutes of the principals, nearly stalling the movie at the starting gate. However, the cast is smartly-attuned to their roles (if not wholly convincing), and the interwoven complications of these needling, guilty people are smoothly presented in an unobtrusively artistic manner (we are occasionally taken back and forth in time, yet Nichols steers the audience through the narrative like a master craftsman, without a hint of hesitancy). The dialogue is made up of unblinking and unblushing adult conversation, yet these immature characters (intentionally) do not behave like adults. They are helplessly selfish, rude and fickle, which sometimes shades the proceedings with a darkly comic grandeur that is unexpected and rewarding. **1/2 from ****"
"Tweekums","8","0","0","1 October 2015"," An anti-romance
","As this film opens one could be forgiven for thinking it was going to be a romantic comedy; we see a man, Dan, walking down a London street as he notices Alice, a beautiful girl with hair dyed as red as the London buses, approaching him; she turns to cross the street and is hit by a taxi. After accompanying her to the hospital they chat a bit and he reveals that he already has a girlfriend. In the next scene Dan is being photographed by another attractive woman, Anna, he kisses her than tells her that he is currently with a girl called Alice. The forth protagonist, Larry, is introduced when Dan goes to on online sex chat pretending to be a women called Anna; Dan suggests they meet at the Aquarium somewhere he knows Anna the photographer often goes. This leads to an awkward meeting between Larry and Anna which ultimately leads to a relationship then things start going wrong. There is infidelity, there is jealousy and there is hypocrisy as the relationships fracture and reform.<br/><br/>Anybody hoping for a happy romantic comedy is going to be in for quite a disappointment; once the introductions are over there is little more in the way of romance it is all bitterness and jealousy as the characters find out what their other halves have been up to. Dan and Larry are the most hypocritical; sleeping with other women then acting as if they have been wronged when their partners tell them they have been with somebody else. The cast does a fine job making their characters believable which makes them quite unlikable. While there is a lot of talk about sex this is deliberately crude and unsexy in a way that makes for uncomfortably viewing at times. Even the scene between Clive Owen's Larry and an almost naked Alice, played by Natalie Portman, is cold rather than erotic; in fact it is far more chaste scenes such as the first view of Alice that are sexier. For the most part the film felt uncomfortably believable but there were one or two moments that didn't seem real; most notably the online chat between Dan and Larry; the text-speak looked like something only a child would use; not a doctor and a writer! Overall though I'd say this was a sharply written and well-acted film but I'm not sure that I can say I really enjoyed it as the characters aren't that likable. I'd still say it is worth watching but only if you are an older viewer; the content is both unsuitable for younger viewers and unlikely to appeal to them."
"RavenGlamDVDCollector","6","0","0","28 September 2015"," Closer to Natalie you can't come
","For a movie that is so dearly loved and so highly recommended by its fans here on IMDb, this is such a cold fish. I have been struggling with what I was going to say, and that just popped out, and, yes, let me say it again, COLD FISH! Let me admit, I can't stand Jude Baby-Faced Law, and Clive Owen is thuggish, like the other reviewer said, so the male leads are off-putting to begin with. Julia Roberts gives a fine performance, a long way off from the Good Old Days of PRETTY WOMAN, but great. As for all those back-handed compliments she gets from a lot of the reviewers here, take it from me, she is great, no buts about that. Everything you'd expect from a star of her quality. I have taken note of Natalie Portman ever since LÉON THE PROFESSIONAL, but, no, I haven't gone for her sci-fi movie series yet, as I have too many other fish to fry, and I have yet to obtain BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, though I have at least seen that one on a pay channel back in February 1998. To get to the point, I rented this movie years ago for Natalie's sake, and it's been on the back-burner for a helluva long time, but I now at last have my store- bought addition to the RavenGlam collection, and there are of course wonderfully glamorous scenes in it - which you prissy lot out there don't go into, you hypocrites! - but the movie JUST ISN'T FUN TO WATCH! It is MOROSE!*<br/><br/>*in all fairness, be sure to read the addendum I posted a bit later at the end of the page<br/><br/>Natalie is, of course, absolutely great. I love her arty tearful shot, it would have been up against my wall too! She proves her acting abilities as a grown-up as well. (If you haven't seen her breakthrough movie already mentioned, I highly recommend that you obtain it immediately!)<br/><br/>As for the strip sequences, I like that the girls do not play to the lowest common denominator, i.e. (on-stage) they remain beautiful and classy, in their slinky pole-swirling perfection. Natalie is stunningly beautiful, love her upper body ratio (the length of her back compared to the length of her legs) and she is simply breathtaking at the start of that second strip sequence (Danny's visit). The thuggish old doctor, of course, has more hardcore tastes, and has her maneuvering into a less glamorous wide-legged pose, off-putting, but that's what crude guys are like. And, though it's strategically self-censored by Doc. Larry's head, it's really more explicit if you view it in slow motion a smidge further on, when she gets up. Almost full frontal for a fragment of a second. Or so it might seem. But not really. Sharon Stone's notorious scene, more than a decade before her, brought to mind. But just as near as dammit. Unfortunately, the pose it led up to, on all fours, is left (mostly) to the viewer's imagination, although she did already bent over for him during the 'flirting' stage of her performance. You'd never ever see Natalie like this anywhere else or ever again. Celebrity skin! And creamy-smooth! With the rear view virtually fully on display for us lowly mortals! Her nakedest film appearance! Of top-ranked actresses, a rarity! To quote her, ""Thank you!""<br/><br/>But aside from all that beauty, the movie is so dismal, that one is left feeling the need for something brighter, more cheerful, more worthy of one's attention. Granted, the movie deserves more than my score, but I subtract minus points for it being such a COLD FISH. <br/><br/>Addendum, later the same day. I've analyzed this after some repeated viewing. I've really damned this one for being so wretchedly confusing. We were supposed to instantly latch onto the script skipping a year or so ahead? The disjointed non-linear presentation alienated me instantly; I figured something was wrong, and while I was fumbling about, reacted negatively to the movie. It's like crucial scenes were deleted, we just got the highlights. I'm prepared to say that my initial comments here are quite unfair, that it really is a good movie, but SERIOUSLY FLAWED. A Luke-warm, half-baked fish, okay? :) Will Natalie now come home with me, please? Only with the high heels and G- string, please?"

A man and a woman meet in unusual circumstances and their lives will never be the same. What's more a woman whom neither of them will meet until a year later and a man who won't enter the picture until a further year later also will have their fates decided in this single moment. One day you're minding your own business and your life's path is determined because a young American woman you don't even know looks the wrong way when crossing a London street and is hit by a taxi. Funny how life works sometimes.<br/><br/>Alice, a 20-year old stripper who has just arrived in London, is the young woman who has the unfortunate meeting with the taxicab. She's not seriously hurt. Flesh wound really. But this moment changes everything. As she lies in the street she is attended to by Dan, a man she had spotted across the street and sort of flirted with in the moments before she stepped into the taxi's path. Inevitably they fall in love. But it will not necessarily be happily ever after. A year later we find that Dan, who writes newspaper obituaries, has written a novel based on Alice's life. As he is being photographed for publicity for the book he flirts with the American photographer, Anna, shares a kiss with her and ends up trying to talk her into having an affair. Alice discovers this and tells Anna, but not Dan, that she knows. And having asked Anna to take her portrait Alice has the moment that her heart breaks forever committed to film. Another year goes by, a year in which Dan stalks Anna without success. One night Dan enters a cybersex chat room where, while pretending to be Anna, he meets dermatologist Larry. Dan sets up a meeting between Larry and ""Anna"" but when Larry in fact does meet up with the real Anna a funny thing happens. Larry and Anna fall in love.<br/><br/>So now we've met our four players and the fun can begin. By fun I mean lying, cheating, backstabbing and generally reprehensible behavior. The four are all brought together when that photo Anna took of a tearful Alice is displayed in her photo exhibition. Dan and Alice are still a couple but Dan uses the occasion of the exhibition to pick up his pursuit of Anna and this time she relents. They carry on an affair for a year, even as Anna marries Larry in the meantime. Eventually Anna and Dan admit their indiscretions to their respective partners and leave those relationships for one another. But there are still plenty more twists and turns to come in this tale. Through it all the story is engaging. It's a smart, serious, adult drama which captivates throughout.<br/><br/>Much of the film's success can be attributed to the winning performances of the four lead performers who for all intents and purposes are really the only performers in the film. Julia Roberts, as Anna, probably has the least showy and thus least memorable of the four roles but her performance is certainly fine. The other three stars really shine. Natalie Portman as Alice, Jude Law as Dan and Clive Owen as Larry are all on top of their games. Each of the three have some truly powerful moments and they do so well in bringing some rather complex and conflicted characters to life. There's a lot of emotion in this story, sometimes bubbling under the surface and sometimes on full, raw display. And all four of the stars convey that emotion wonderfully. The characters they play may at times be hard for the viewer to embrace. These are people capable of some truly dastardly deeds so this certainly isn't an uplifting, feel-good kind of movie. It's a movie which if nothing else is honest, sometimes brutally so. You may not love these characters but you can't help but appreciate their story."
"yris2002","7","0","0","19 September 2009"," Emotionally harsh, but honest, very well performed
","""Closer"" is a quite interesting and well made transposition of a piece of drama: it is not easy to pass from the stage to the screen, but here Mike Nichols did a good job in keeping the theatrical quality throughout the movie: the four characters are deeply characterized, dialogues incisive, articulate, scenes are often evocative and never too explicit. <br/><br/>Four attractive and talented actors (even Julia Roberts, who does not often convince me in other movies) move on the stage of a quite unrecognizable modern London and play the game of love with uneasiness, too self-confidence, cynicism, but never reaching a true consciousness about love, exchanging it for desire, desiring the other when they are not with him/her, and then being incapable of staying with him/her, when it's time to prove with action the love they so easily profess with words. It is very harsh in the way people deceive, then repent, tell the truth, ask for forgiveness, deceive again in a never ending wheel of truth and deceit that in the end seems unbearable and we need Alice's going back to New York as the only interruption of this intolerable and pointless game. <br/><br/>In the end, we are unable to understand who loves who, and, of course we do not feel very comforted when we realize how this elusiveness of love adheres to real life, when we also have to, and sometimes cannot understand, if we are really in love, or we love the idea of love, or of being in love. What I appreciated is the honesty in portraying the mutability of true sentiment, in confused and complicated situations where both men and women show their best and worst, and cannot take a resolute step towards happiness, probably because, as it is said in the movie, people sometimes do not want to be happy, do not accept the stability of true affection, and prefer uncertainty to safety.<br/><br/>As I said before, all the four actors offer talented performances: Jude Law is superb, Clive Owen very good (although it is so difficult to sympathize with him), Natalie Portman as the the fragile girl and Julia Roberts as the cold always feeling guilty woman render the complexity of their emotional inner world in a very convincing way."

","When Closer was released a couple of years ago, I watched it because of its full star cast. It was a difficult one for me. Years later, I watched it for a second time. This time, I did not understand it any better than I did years ago.<br/><br/>Is Closer a deep movie that explores love and relationship or is it a piece of work that simply pretends to be deep? My answer is both. However, I doubt that I might be far away from being right since the work is either too profound or too good at pretending to be profound for me to understand.<br/><br/>Love is the eternal theme of art. Loving relationship mixing with betrayal, lies, sex, revenge and anger is beyond full exploration and pure analysis. Thus Closer as a piece of work that tries to reflect love in reality is undoubtedly a deep one, yet it is impossible to fully reflect the complicity of loving relationship in two hours, and thus it can only be pretending to be deep.<br/><br/>The four main characters depicted in the film come from different backgrounds and hold different understandings of love, yet I think they share one thing in common, which is that they are strangers to others. They might be close as lovers or wife and husband, yet they hardly know their partners and even themselves. Truth and lies intervene. Does love offer enough courage to face betrayals and enough support to defeat them? Probably not.<br/><br/>Larry loves in an almost crucially honest way. He confesses his adultery in New York and demands to know every dirty detail from his wife of her adultery with Dan. He seeks joy of revenge by crashing down Dan's dream of pure love with both Anna and Alice. On the other hand, Dan constantly falls in love at the first sight. He leaves Alice for Anna, he walks away on Anna then for her ""final"" sex with Larry, and he comes to Alice after all the buzz. He did all them because he thinks he was pursuing love. For me, he is the one who is truly pathetic. While he is busy chasing his dream as writer and his dream of perfect pure love, he can only be disappointed again and again. When he looks at the mirror in the hotel and steps outside the elevator to tell Alice he loves her despite her relationship with Larry, it is the moment of love. Ironically, it comes after his talk with Larry, and he comes to Larry, in the first place, to highlight his love for Anna and blame Larry for sabotage their romantic relationship.<br/><br/>Which one is closer, your loving partner whom you think you know or a stranger that you immediately fall in love at the first sight? I do not know. Perhaps you should watch it and tell me about it. However, you may find it not worthy of time."

","The movie excels at describing vividly about people's attitude towards sex and love, which are probably the most controversial topics in our daily life. Actually, I am not surprised at all about its way of presenting the crashes between love and sex. Mike Nichols sees through people's deepest minds and explodes the so-called dark-sides to us all. For example, Alice's (Natalie Portman) vulnerability in front of love, Anna's (Julia Roberts) hesitation in choosing between love and sex, Dan's (Jude Law) naiveness and 'inexperience' in dealing with what he thinks as the 'true love', Larry's (Clive Owen) complicity and his complicated handling of conflicts between love and sex. These four characters represent different attitudes on how we judge and make decisions in the matter of love and sex. Some people may complain about the explosive depiction of sex, even the abrasive and brutal dialogs on the issue of love, but without doubt, the movie digs out what we are afraid of admitting. We are too shy and self-inclusive towards love and sex, but we hold more expectations of being understood and accepted. So this is the charm of this film---expose the dark sides of love and sex, but to make people more yearning for them."

","This movie was in many ways not my type, as I prefer those romantic comedies. However, I found it to be a quite authentic and realistic view of what relationships can be. Forgiveness, compromise, mistakes and vulnerability were mingled in the four-angle relationship. perhaps to be hurt by the one you love. In the film are several moments that are so perfectly true and honest that they're painful to watch. Sometimes you are likely to be hurt by the one you love. It seemed like that everyone wanted to know the truth, which yet hurts most. When faced with the truth, people behaved in a totally different way as they promised before. In the end the film became a fight between the two men, showing off their masculine power and natural possessiveness. The direct and faithful way to describe sex and love seemed a little bit over to me, destroying my dream of love. It seemed that falling in love was quite an easy and random thing. The capriciousness of the characters' feelings except for Alice was unbelievable and more than I can understand. She was the only one who had true feelings for Dan while others seemed able to jump into bed with everyone else in a whim. This film cast great irony and sarcasm on modern life and society. A strong contrast was created between the two male characters, seemingly rude and strong Larry never hit Anna whereas gentle Dan slapped Alice at the end of the movie. People lost themselves under tremendous pressure in the materialistic society full of various temptations, with alienation form others and their mental demand failing to fulfill. This film exposed the deepest side of human beings behind their splendid appearances. Those who sell themselves and their souls are not necessarily the strippers, but might be a respectable artist or photographer who appears composed and presentable. And the title of this film 'Closer' also hinted that closer two strangers become; more problems are to come with. Maybe that's why many people now keep a safe distance with others."

","""Love is an accident waiting to happen. Desire is a stranger you think you know. Intimacy is a lie we tell ourselves. Truth is a game you play to win. If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking.""<br/><br/>(From the trailer of the movie)<br/><br/>Do you believe in love at first sight? It seems that the four main characters in the film do. As a result, Alice and Dan came together; Anna and Larry married; Anna and Dan had an affair. They met; they fell in love; and then came deception, betrayal and abandoning. It's the same old story happening every day in our life. Yet the film manages to capture something delicate, something we have been reluctant to admit. That is, the vulnerable and deceptive nature of love.<br/><br/>Love is an accident waiting to happen. Everything is so beautiful at the very beginning: in the gray damp city of London where 7.5 million people dwell, the eyes of two strangers met in the hustling crowd. ""Hello, stranger"" is the first word the girl said to the man. Then they fell in love just like the opening of every romantic story. <br/><br/>Desire is a stranger you think you know. Sometimes an intruder can also be quite innocent, just like Anna.This time two strangers again. But the romance came alongside with guilt and deception. Is it desire that connects two wandering souls? Nobody knows exactly. <br/><br/>Intimacy is a lie we tell ourselves. When the initial flush of love evaporates, what is left is a pond of still water, something we call intimacy. But intimacy didn't triumphs over guilty desire. So Dan and Anna have an affair. When the feelings are gone and the heart grows cold, who's to blame? Dan and Anna, or the vulnerability of love itself? <br/><br/>Truth is a game you play to win. Sometimes truth can also be hurtful. When jealousy and suspicion arise, mistrust takes over. Dan loses two most important women in his life. Larry took a successful revenge in the end and won back his wife. But for him, maybe it's only the winning that really matters.<br/><br/>If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking. Life continues anyway. Just like what's implied in the end, when Alice, or maybe we should call her Jane, walked down the road, looking straight ahead, we know at that very moment everything is in the past. Life goes on easily most of the time, only in retrospect we pick up those painful memories and smile. The next stranger is around the corner."

","This is a story between two men and two women, a story about love and betray, gentle lie and hurting truth, stranger and lover. When Alice is saying ""I'm waiting for you to leave me."", or "" I don't love you anymore since now"" I can't help thinking that this is the real situation of ""love"", so hard to hold, and so easy to come and go. May be I'm a pessimist abut love. In my opinion, love is a lie, and the promise like ""I will love you forever"" is the biggest one. Biology divides the experience of love into three stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust exposes people to others while romantic attraction encourages human beings to focus their energy on mating. And both of them involve the release of chemicals and both cannot last for long. So only a few can move forward to attachment. The regular form of love is like situations in the film, we easily fall in love with someone because their attractive appearances or after an interesting dialog. Then we keep dating them until we find someone else more attractive. In relationship between two people, if we are the one who loves more, we will be the one ""waiting"", waiting for the being betrayed, while the other one will be the one ""searching"", searching for the next lover and start a new circle. Under such circumstance, it is hard to trust as well as to be trusted, so we need lies to cover and it makes us feel safe. During the process that the chemicals released by the brain become less and less, we begin to lie about love until we finally choose to unveil the hurting truth. We are strangers at the very beginning and then lovers, but finally strangers again. Or even, from the begging to the end, we are totally strangers. I still remember at the end of the movie, Alice's real name is indeed Jane Rachel Jones and that she had lied about her name for the duration of her four-year relationship with Dan. So,lovers? Or we all are strangers, all the time."

","Closer is an outstanding movie with complicated love stories. I was at first attracted by the splendid cast rather than the plot. The fetching performances of the four well-known stars starring in it do make what is good still better. In Closer, the four tragic characters play a game called romance and the winner will get true love. But in the end, there is no winner and none of them wins true love. The all lose the game because they thought they can win true love through lies and revenges. In this society, true love is a rarity. So is the movie. It stands out among others of its kind in two aspects. On the one hand, explicit dialogues and vicious statements are frequently presented in Closer. Through the dialogues, we can learn more about the plot, the personalities and emotions of four characters and the secrets below the surface. On the other hand, Closer deals with a distinctive theme – love and sex. It won't be an enjoyment for people who have just begun new relationships or have recently fallen in love. The movie sheds light on the cruel and nasty side of the so-called romance, which is filled with lies, betrayal, revenges and insatiable desires. It may challenge some people's beliefs in true love and provoke them to examine their relationships and souls.<br/><br/>All the four characters have secrets and tell lies in the movie. Dan is in constant pursuit of love at first sight, even though he claims he fancies Alice. The quotation from the movie preview that if you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking will explain the reason. Alice is a mysterious young woman with sweet and deceptive appearance but a callous heart. She seems to love Dan more than he loves her, but she never reveals her real name to Dan. Anna marries Larry in hope of forgetting Dan, but fails to do so and has secret affairs with him behind Larry's back. Larry coaxes Anna to sleep with him for the last time in exchange for signing the divorce paper, but what he really wants is to get his revenge on Dan for taking Anna away. <br/><br/>I like the scene at Anna's exhibition best. It is the first time and the only time when the four characters show up at the same occasion. Although everyone shakes hands, chats and smiles as he or she is supposed to, I can still feel the tense atmosphere surrounding them. From that moment on, their lives are intertwined in ways they never could have imagined. <br/><br/>It requires much life experience to fully understand the movie. If you just want to get yourself relaxed by watching movies on weekends, Closer won't be a good choice. But it is worth watching and provokes people to ponder over real life."

","Contrary to the title, ""Closer"" shows human beings are incapable of getting too close to each other. Beyond a certain point, any attempt to be closer seems futile or even counterproductive.<br/><br/>Like a strip show, the film reveals how unreliable first impressions are, how time takes off people's protecting armor bit by bit and let them prey on each other. The beginning of love is always excitingly beautiful, but as soon as freshness is gone, love is over, its remains fossilizing into hateful fetters. Even before realizing it, people stop getting closer and have more sex only to aggravate the stalemate. It is illusive that two people become one while making love. Judging from the film, their hearts might be a thousand miles apart when their bodies huddle closely. The first crack in Anna and Larry's love appears when Larry spots Anna talk to Dan in her exhibition. Apologizing for sneering at his jealousy, Anna wraps her arms around Larry's shoulders and hugs him tightly, but the hug is devoid of meaning and affection as they are secretly doubting each other's honesty. Many times in the film hugs only bring cold hollowness.<br/><br/>The movie reminds me of love affairs in my surroundings. For over a year a friend of mine loves a man who doesn't love her, gives up, finds a boyfriend adoring her, and falls in love with her boyfriend's friend in a short while. Another friend seems happy with her boyfriend, only to find later that he considers a pretty woman a ""goddess"", and the lovers turn enemies. As the movie suggests, perhaps love only consists of a short encounter and painful betrayal, which a friend who is deeply in love disagrees, or maybe the film is too real to be true.<br/><br/>In the end all four characters are unhappy. Dan remains a loser; Larry confines Anna to his side, with another round of mutual destruction waiting to happen. Alice, the most innocent compared with the other three, buries her past and begins a new life with a new name in her home country. In the last scene, she strides proudly in a street, smiling as sweetly as in the beginning and attracting nasty men drooling over her. Probably history will repeat itself. After all, human beings are social animals that are incurably tempted by the possibility of getting closer."

","When I first saw the movie, I couldn't help thinking ""what the hell is this?"" But when I saw it again, I found the movie hurts. It seems that it shows the reality of modern relationship, and the truth of love, which really hurts. What is love on earth? People say it all the time, yet they forget to think over what is under the four simple letters. Love itself is simple and sweet, yet when people are involved, it becomes complicated and painful. In the movie, the four characters gain love, get betrayed by love, and then lose love. Their love is full of brutal deception. They are selfish and coward. They say ""I love you therefore nothing matters"", but actually everything matters. They ask you to trust them, yet they themselves don't trust you and always can't stop testing you. And when love goes away, what to do? Beg her to come back? Turn away and leave with a broken heart? Or end up with a man she doesn't love at all? Maybe the unbelievable and indescribable pain is both the pleasure and the greatest torture of love, and the high price you have to pay when love disappear. Of all the four characters, I love Alice most. She has the face of an angel and the character of a devil. Yet under the pure angelic face and the strong appearance is a fragile heart. Her pure and desperate eyes and the drop of tear on her face tell everyone how love hurts. And when she is betrayed, who can answer her heart-breaking questions? ""Why won't you let me love you?"" ""I amuse you, but I bore you?"" ""Why isn't love enough?"" ""Where is this love? I can't see it. I can't touch it. I can't feel it. I can hear it. I can hear some words. But I can't do anything with your easy words."" It's true that she lives in a world full of lies yet she loves Dan with a whole heart even when Dan betrayed her. When love is over, she goes back to America with nothing but a broken heart, walking on the street alone, just like five years ago when she was in London. And so it is. What's waiting for her on the next corner, love? Who knows."

","The Movie is named as ""Closer"", meaning the story took place in a weird situation between ""Close"" and ""Closest"". ""Closer"", then raises questions of ""binary"" -- some relative concepts: ""soul"" and ""lust"", ""frankness"" and ""suspicion"", ""jealousy"" and ""forgiveness"" all of which come down to the deep relation between ""closeness"" and ""strangeness"". The focus of the movie is the seemly antagonistic, but in fact indistinguishable binary concepts.<br/><br/>1. Soul and Lust ""Sex"" and ""love"", ""body"" and ""soul"", ""beast"" and ""human"" these three groups of opposing concepts can be best shown through the contrast between Larry and Dan. Larry, the self-proclaimed ""Sultan"", is most in need of physical and sexual satisfaction. He needs to be absolutely frank, just like naked animals. Anna describes him as rough, direct and high-handed. Larry also considers ""sex"" the most important element in a marriage. On the other hand, Dan is a cupid. Dan's sensitivity, whole-hearted love, and pursuit of perfection make him sick of Anna and Larry's parting sex. Although he thinks he can forgive Alice and Larry for their sexual relation, but in the end he slapped Alice. We can see that the director does not want to criticize Dan's sorrow and favors Larry's odious behavior, instead, he points out that under no circumstances can ""soul"" and ""lust"" separable.<br/><br/>2. Frankness and Deception Compared to their male counterparts, the portrayals of women are more focus on the ""love"" level. Anna and Alice tell lies, but for the men they loved. Nevertheless, we found that however frank the characters are, it will all return to ""suspicion"". As in the case Larry urged Alice to tell her real name, even if Alice frankly says her name is Jones, Larry still does not believe her. It can boil down to the fact that, suspicion breeds out of distrust, and distrust result from having been deceived before. Therefore, ""honest"" is the nickname of ""deceit"".<br/><br/>3. Jealousy and Forgiveness The relation of ""jealousy and forgiveness"" is hidden beneath the surface of ""sex"" and ""love"". Larry's attitude towards Alice is out of revenge; similarly Larry wants Dan to know that he and Anna have sex before divorce is also a kind of revenge. In the movie, two pairs of men and women whisper with each other is a ""demonstration of jealousy."" Dan believes that he can forgive Anna which turns out not; Similarly Alice can not forgive Dan, so she no longer cried but indifferently says ""I do not love you"". In contrast, Anna and Larry's situation appears different, under the surface of the victory does not mean that Larry has no jealousy and forgiveness. Therefore, in the love world, jealousy and forgiveness is not a binary opposition, they coexist.<br/><br/>4. Closeness and Strangeness--fuzzy The movie can be concluded in the guarding theme of ""intimate"" and ""strange"", from the stranger's love at first sight at the beginning of the movie to Anna's career of photographing strangers to the seemly closeness between Anna and Larry at the end of the movie. The movie does not completely separate the concept of ""close"" and ""strange"". Take Dan and Alice for example, they obviously do not know each other but fall in love at first sight; then they gain better understandings of each other but in the end, Dan finds that Alice has been using a fake name. How to define ""close"" and ""strange""? In the movie, Dan recalls the time when he first met Alice, as if it was the most intimate time between them. So there is no boundary between ""closeness"" and ""strangeness"". The movie, I think, is rather vague. The ambiguity of it is also where the attraction lies.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie displays the ambiguity of love and life, which is the true nature of them and the true beauty of them."

","Love is so complicated especially it involves four people. Though I am not sure whether the relationship among them could be called LOVE!<br/><br/>My preconceived idea about LOVE is that it is not just about possession, it is also about tolerance. From this perspective I think Alice is my favorite character. In the photography-room she learns that Dan has feelings for Anna, but she can continue her life with him regardless of that. Compared with Alice, the two male characters are totally selfish and irresponsible. First when Larry knows that Anna had sex with Dan, he was almost freak out and asks every detail about their sex. Oh, this makes me sick! He just wants to stand at a moral height and make Anna feel guilty about her betrayal by recalling those details. Then he meets a stripper who is actually Alice. The fire of revenge in his heart begins to burn. When Dan learns that Anna gets her liberty by having sex with her husband, he could not bear. Maybe Larry knows man like Dan, is just selfish as him, so he knows how things will work out.<br/><br/>The name of the movie is called Closer. What's the deep meaning of the name? Maybe the director tries to tell us that love looks beautiful, but when you get closer, everything collapse. Love is only about biting, brutal and much more about sexual urges.This may pollute our idealistic expectation about love, but this is more Closer to the essence of love. After all, love is not as great as most people think it might be!"

","The movie is a direct reflection of the real society in which we are living, a society full of people with spiritual void. They are all seeking for love, or seeking for being loved rather, because they don't know what true love is, neither do the four characters in the movie. Their love is always combined with betrayals, lust, lies, etc.<br/><br/>Dan, the character I dislike most in this movie, has no conception of what love is. To him, love is occupation. He can't accept Anna and Alice's having sex with Larry because he considers them as his own possessions, which can't be shared with someone else. So that means he doesn't allow betrayal in love? No, absolutely no. When he seduces Anna when being taken photos, it disgusts me. How can a man be in love with a woman, and kiss another? He's just a selfish child in the kingdom of love, always wants to get, but never wants to give.<br/><br/>Larry, I think most people view him as a mean guy. His world is filled with lust and sex. To him, Love is sex. At the beginning when he chats online with fake Anna, he wants sex; after he goes to sees Alice at the exhibition, he wants sex; at last before he signs the divorce agreement, he still wants sex. He seems to be always expecting someone to have sex with, rather than someone to love.<br/><br/>Alice, or Jane, it is a big surprise when her real name is shown at last. I don't know why she uses a fake name and why she insists that she can't tell the truth. I tend to like her and have pity on her because she devotes herself to Dan. However, at the ending she disappoints me a lot. Welcome back Miss Jones, and goodbye Alice. She lies to everyone. She loses the fundamental in love, that is, honesty.<br/><br/>Anna, seems to be a rational woman, so rational that she can separate love with sex. Maybe she just wants a quiet life, but things go out of her control. She tries to get Dan out of mind by marrying Larry, tries to have Larry sign the agreement by having sex with him, and tries to have Dan stayed by telling him the truth. Unfortunately, she fails in everything.<br/><br/>At last, nobody gets love, neither the separated nor the couple, because nobody knows what true love is."
"Tracy-xmu","9","0","0","26 April 2009"," Men and women are different in love.
","It has been such a long time since the first time I watched Closer. Honestly speaking, I had no idea what aspect of love it was about. First sight? Lust? Intimacy? Truth? Or all of them? Maybe the director has too much to convey and just mix it in this movie, which justifies its obscurity. Anyway, after my mind is cleared, what strikes me most is as follows. <br/><br/>Men can fall in love with any woman anytime anywhere, no matter whether he is already with someone or not. They are easily attracted to different kinds of women and wish to taste them all. Men are more selfish in love than women. They think love and sex are separate but they do not allow women to think like that. They can tell calmly, with or without sense of guilt, their once beloved that they do not love them any more, but when deserted or betrayed by women they simply can not act as cool as they desert women. <br/><br/>As to women, they easily fall in love with every man who shows them the least bit of attention. This explains why both Alice and Anna can not resist the passion of Dan, the handsome man who is attracted to both of them. Usually a woman begins to love a man after the man loves her, and once a woman loves a man, she sticks to their love. Here Alice is a perfect example. She is somewhat different from the other three main characters in the movie in that she never leaves the one she loves. Marriage, to a woman, does not necessarily mean living with the man she loves most, but means living with the man who loves her most, which is demonstrated by the case of Anna in the movie. Definitely she loves Dan rather than Larry, but she chooses Larry as her husband eventually. <br/><br/>All in all, I think this movie is thought-provoking and worth watching."

","Watching this movie is really torturing. I don't mean the movie itself, but the feeling it brings to me. I see no love and no trust between the characters; I see only desire, revenge, and declaration of occupation--something that will absolutely distort the feeling of love. They name it love, but I don't think so. They think they are lovers, but I don't see that. They are perfect strangers, living in their own worlds, saying loving whisperings to benumb each other, to create a vision that they are in love. The fact is, they love merely themselves. They make use of one or the other of the opposite sex to satisfy their secret, untold and mean lust, seeking salvation in each other's arms. However, sometimes when they become too involved and concentrated, they unconsciously begin to declare their ownership of someone. They kind of believe that someone is meant for them, ignoring the truth that they can never be part of the world of a stranger. The results inevitably turn out to be a tragedy, with fights and distrusts, and broken hearts. But none of them cares about that. They only care about how to be the winner in the war of love, especially the two male characters.<br/><br/>I have been shown a pictorial illustration of human nature. The truest person of the four is no doubt Alice, as she is less hypocritical than the other three. At last she discovered that she loved no one, which has always been the truth for them all. None of them dare admit it except Alice. General speaking, this movie has brought me a weird sensation, but I really cannot deny its authenticity. People sometimes just act as the four in the film. Who dares to believe in love anymore?"

But totally different from my expectation of one or two romantic stories with a happy ending, the movie renders me contemplation: is love complicated or simple, beautiful or ugly? <br/><br/>To Larry, love is absolutely selfish. He loves Anna, so he is outrageous and goes out of mind when knowing that Anna has cheated on him and falls in love with Dan. But instead of letting her go and perfecting that romance, he does anything to get Anna back and bind her firmly, including taking advantage of her guilt for him, even knowing that Anna will be living in pain. To Dan, love is possessive. No matter who he is with, Alice or Anna, he needs the woman to be one hundred percent loyal to him, both physically and mentally. When he knows that Anna has sex with Larry, as a compensation for the divorce, he feels betrayed, reluctant to cross the line. I figure whether he desires Anna because it seems beyond reach and when he can really be with Anna, he finds it no longer appealing to him. To Alice, a pretty stripper, love is pure, with nothing else involved. When she finally finds herself disappointed with Dan, she leaves without hesitation. To Anna, love is a luxury. She thinks that she doesn't deserve love, so she prefers to live with Larry, tortured by guilt and pain, rather than pursuing happiness. In sum, the movie is thought-provoking, well-done!"

","""Closer"" tells a romance that is not romantic at all. The opening of the film is kind of deceptive. When Alice(by Natalie Portman) opens her eyes to see the handsome Dan(by Jude Law), I expect a romantic love story that is not quite practical but beautiful. And my expectation continues all the way through these two's trip around London until the scene in the studio of the photographer Anna(by Julia Roberts) comes up, and all the following part turns out that the film is about the pain, twistedness and ugliness of love and sex. Dan has a crush on Anna, and regardless of his relationship with Alice, he tries to seduce Anna(without avail at first). A greedy man who sees two kinds of beauty in women and wants to have them both--not so uncommon; but he really disgusts me when he, posing as Anna, engages in an online sex chat with Larry(by Clive Owen), and even arranges a date for them. Here I see a man letting out his desire for a woman in a real perverted way. To add more to my shock, the date turns out to be working for Larry and Anna! Anna somehow gives me the impression of an intelligent and mature woman, and why she gets herself involved in a relationship with Larry, who seems to be driven much more by sexual urges than love, still remains a puzzle to me. Dan and Larry are the two most contemptible heroes I have ever seen in a film. Their loves for Alice and Anna are entangled with obscenity and suspicion, even to a hysterical extent; on the other hand, the two heroines seem to be calm and rational, but somewhat weak and vulnerable to the men's brutal love. In the end, Larry manages to get back Anna, Alice seems to be free from all the mess, and Dan, although the busiest struggling in his love for two women, is left with nothing, not even the real name of the one who may once loved him the most. All in all, the story is ridiculous and makes no sense; well, maybe that is what the film is about: Love can be ridiculous and make no sense."

","Of the four protagonists in Closer, Clive Owen's Larry is perhaps the most direct...he likens his being with Julia Roberts' Anna as ""the princess with the toad"". Told that it is a frog, not a toad, he insists ""toad"". And as the movie continues, we realize that he was correctly describing himself right from the first, warts and all.<br/><br/>Two other people - Jude Law as the aptly named Dan Wolf - and Nathalie Portman as Alice, make up the rest of the quartet of characters who fall in and out of lust/love with each other over a period of years.<br/><br/>What bothers me most about many of the reviews here, is that people complain that people in Closer are unlikeable. Well, so what? Considering how many of us lie and cheat in love - often as much to ourselves as to others - how many of us are really all that attractive? The opening words of this film are from a song by Damien Rice, where he intones ""And so it is..."" He is singing about infatuation verging on obsession, which is what Closer is really about - the way we obsess about each other to the point of destroying both the love and ourselves; the closer we try to get, the further apart we become. We may insist on the truth, but how will we recognize it if it is not what we want so desperately to hear? Polished performances of a slickly intelligent and often witty script are searingly directed to perfection by Mike Nichols, who has been in this territory before with ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"". The main difference is that in that earlier film, George and Martha KNEW the difference between surface and reality, whereas the four lost souls of Closer wander myopically through the landscape of their lives looking for signposts. At the end of Virginia Woolf, they at least had each other. At the end of Closer, no-one seems to have anything left at all. Perhaps the main point of Closer is that our images of ourselves can only remain beautiful from a distance; the closer we get, the blurrier it all becomes. This is a sad film in the end, but it is also one of the most adult films ever to be made. After all, stories of princesses and frogs are really for children, aren't they?"

","Mike Nichols' 2004 cinematic comeback ""Closer"" seems to be really poignant at first. The cast is great, the score suits the scenes fine and the dialog is sharp and witty. The problem is, after a while ""Closer"" becomes obviously far removed from reality. Characters start to act real quick-witted and theatrical dialog when in real life they would just walk away from each other in anger. Couples split and then get together for no convincing reason. And if that wasn't enough one character at one point exclaims that she's just fallen out of love in one instant. Just like that. As if anyone would ever say that.<br/><br/>The reason why I'm so critical about this lack of total realism is that ""Closer"" seems so much to try to make an universally true statement about love or male-female relationships. In that aspect it doesn't quite deliver and the lines aren't as poignant as the writer wished they'd be.<br/><br/>That's more of a fault of the original play, though. The movie, as an adaption of that play, is fine. The cast, as I've said, is consistently great and the scene, in which Clive Owen is fooled into thinking he's having an erotic chat with a girl is one of the funniest and truest things about modern society ever put on screen. ""Closer"" is worth seeing for that alone. Oh, and if you happen to be a heterosexual guy, the chance of seeing Natalie Portman with very, very little on might also be an inducement for watching this movie."

","Prior of seeing this movie I had heard every review and adjective possible about Closer. Erotic, realistic, challenging, smart, dumb, boring, exhilarating (however you spell it...), masterful or just plain beautiful. I watched the movie deciding to judge for myself, not knowing what to expect.<br/><br/>Closer is one of those many movies when after it has only just begun you think ""not another classic love story."" Sure enough there's the awaited love-at-first-sight sequence, between to beautiful people in the middle of a great big city full of strangers. But thankfully, it stops there, because we might accuse Closer of being many things, but it's neither unoriginal or boring.<br/><br/>I had only seen Primary Colors (excellent, especially Travolta) and Working Girl (not so excellent) from Mike Nichols before, and it was a surprise to see such an excellent photography, camera movement and just visual pleasure with so much simplicity. Continuing on the technical success, the actors are brilliant,I didn't imagine Natalie Portman this mature, and Clive Owen is a very pleasant surprise...<br/><br/>But that's it, nothing else to see here, because the interesting bit is over, the movie is well made, but there's nothing inside. I've seen people leave after 30 minutes, because apart from the occasional laugh (Owen especially), or the rare quote that speaks the real truth, the actors aren't enough to make us forget that this story is just plain ridiculous.<br/><br/>It's a romance for people who have it all wrong, guys who need to go out more, or just sex freaks. Because as much as I like sex, I don't believe perverts like these resemble the true animals inside of us. No, women don't like to be called whores, and facial ejaculation isn't common in every sexual intercourse like Roberts' character claims.<br/><br/>The directing is pretentious, it wants to make a glorified ""art"" film from he silliest screenplay ever (Hey guys, lets make an internet sex scene that goes on for 10 minutes). This is intellectual masturbation at it's finest. The screenwriter probably needs to stop dating crazy cum guzzling freaks, because that's the only thing portrayed in this ""romance"", love and sex are mixed in confusion, and we get to see breakups and cheating confessions. And then some more.<br/><br/>People claim that this movie is ""so very real"", to those, you either need to finally be in your first relationship, or just stop thinking sex is all that matters in one.<br/><br/>To those who like to watch movies just for the acting (like me), this is an interesting one, but please don't expect an ounce of emotion from the story. 7 out of 10 for those who fit in that category, 9 for the ones who need to understand a thing or two about their lives, and 5 for the rest.

"aimless-46","8","0","0","2 January 2006"," Extreme Characterizations
","""Closer"" is a film about four people and the role that truth (or different kinds of truth) plays in their relationships as they try to get closer to themselves and to each other. The mixed reaction from viewers is because while ""Closer"" is a nicely packaged film and a fast-paced intelligent screenplay; the four main characters are ""extremes"" or at least extreme examples of the behaviors at the allegorical core of the film. These ""expressionistically"" drawn characters offend and disappoint the viewer segment expecting realistic and sympathetic portrayals (insert ""characters with whom they can identify"" here).<br/><br/>But they are extreme because they are intended to illustrate (in obvious ways) certain subtle elements of our romantic relationships. The two male characters, Dan (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen), are products of and participants in the most fundamental Darwinian courtship process. Despite making a pretense of having evolved from the competitive courtship of male primates, they are still driven more by the need to win and secure a trophy than by a quest to love. Likewise Anna, the older female (Julia Roberts), is attracted by the male demonstrations of dominance, both the physical bluster of strength and the mental head games intended to manipulate her emotions. Accordingly her behavior encourages these demonstrations by the males.<br/><br/>Contrasted with these three is the younger female (Natalie Portman) who seeks a man who can transcend primitive drives, loving her and allowing her to love him.<br/><br/>Into this mix writer Patrick Marber inserts the truth factor in an ironic way. Portman's character places little value on words, adopting a false name at the beginning of the film. That she is superficially living a lie is ironic because she is the only one of the four who does not lie about their true feelings or engage in self-deception. Her transparency and detached self-awareness is symbolized by her job as a stripper.<br/><br/>The other three torture themselves and each other with superficial truths while engaging in compulsive deception about their actions and actual feelings, to each other and to themselves. Their duplicity is symbolized by their occupations. Dan is an obit writer, skilled in the use of euphemisms to disguise the unflattering characteristics of the deceased. Anna is a photographer, skilled in freezing a single moment in time uncharacteristic of the actual subject she is representing. Larry is a dermatologist focused on the superficial surface that one publicly presents.<br/><br/>The key exchange occurs early in the film as Alice and Dan discuss how essential euphemisms are in his job: Alice: What would my euphemism be? Dan: She was... disarming. Alice: That's not a euphemism. Dan: Yes, it is.<br/><br/>Alice's up-front and open behavior causes him to let down his guard and feel a higher level of emotion, but his need to make new conquests and to test his attractiveness soon reasserts itself. She is willing to forgive this until finally convinced that he cannot transcend something so much a part of his basic nature. With that realization she falls out of love.<br/><br/>""Closer"" is much like ""XX/XY"" in its exploration of the mysteries of male discontent although it is philosophically deeper and much better written. Coles (Mark Ruffalo) plays the Dan character in that film, but Law's portrayal is more convincing because he does not have to alternate between rebel and wimp, something that Ruffalo could not quite pull off.<br/><br/>All four performances are solid although Roberts is given very little with which to work. Portman is especially good. The problem with ""Closer"" is that its symbolic message is not getting through to most viewers (at least it would appear so from the many clueless reviews and comments) who try to relate to it on a literal level. But if you like abstract tales deceptively showcased in a realistic package you should really enjoy this fine film.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","I think the history is not very well built and results too much absurd. Despite that, actors work is really good, and, from my point of view, that saves the quality of the film. The story advances in a strange way, with changes in time that are not shown to us until some time later, so usually,it is difficult to understand WHEN it's happening after the end of the scene. In addition, the characters claim to believe in love and loyalty, but they don't think in nothing more than sex, sex and sex. The director has not done a good work, nor the writer, on the other hand, actors made a great part, (specially both men, including one nomination to the Oscar's), actor's work is, by far, the best part of the film, if they were not so good, film would be too much bad. It is not strange that is well marked by kids, because they only catch the sex part so they are pleased, but it is usual that they don't catch the complicated personality of the characters and why they do those things, so it is not strange, also, that older people, more used to think about it, think that is a worse film. a 6, it's not bad, neither good."

The play indeed plays well in the movie. I was particularly entertained by the unusual nature of parts played by Natalie Portman and Jude Law. She uncharacteristically plays a sex worker of sorts. He uncharacteristically plays a neurotic underachiever. Their chemistry and dissonance is well done. And who doesn't like to watch Julia Roberts and/or Clive Owen being sexually tortured and/or torturing? Something for everyone there.

For shame...hunt the guy up, buy him a beer and thank him. Jude Law played the role perfectly. It also demonstrates that we men are NOT the only ones unable at times to make up our minds on what it is we want. The Julia Roberts character flitted back and forth from bed to bed during the entire movie...and in her final scene, as she settles under the covers at night, you see it in her eyes...she still has regrets. Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman, through the forced explanations of the details of their lovemaking by their less secure male partners, become much more human and desirable because of it. This movie demonstrates perfectly that NONE of these characters are ready for a long term relationship, let alone a marriage.

","I love films that haunt, and this one certainly does. We have the writer, the dermatologist, the photographer and the ex-stripper (now coffee house server), four characters who are entwined in each others lives by couplings that are traditional and not so traditional.<br/><br/>There isn't too much of a plot but there doesn't need to be; it's all about some very honest dialog and emotions. It puts you in a ""What would you do in this situation mode"", forcing you to react and think as these people.

","Jane to me is the most compelling character...I probably had more ideas on her after seeing the movie but I haven't seen it in about a month, so I'll try to go with my memory...At the beginning,Jane looks very young-like a rebellious child. The only person who seemed to notice her in the crowd was Dan. She did not really know what love was-she was searching. Before and after she was with Dan, she was a stripper. But while she was with him, she was not..she worked as a waitress. She had made the comment in the movie, ""lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off"". This is interesting because it almost implies when she is not a stripper, she lies. And when she is with Dan, she is not a stripper... Coincidence? Perhaps...Because later when she is a stripper again, she is truthful about her own identity...almost like her stripping of her clothes is symbolic of her also stripping herself of the lies. She is a different person with Dan, but perhaps it is easier that way, because she can experiment with love from a different perspective, so she could keep a cool head. It seems like she has done this with every relationship in her life, because in the book Dan wrote about her, she tells Larry that it is about her but leaves out the truth. When she fell in love with Dan, she became needy, something that wouldn't fly with him because he was so needy himself. He needed someone to take care of him, not someone who needed taken care of. This taught Jane a very important lesson-not to lose yourself in love. However, she needed Dan to do something to make her not regret leaving him, so she got him angry to the point he hit her, and it let her know that the love was a farce and allowed her to move on with her life. At the end of the movie, she appears to be so self confident and sure of herself and her feelings, so different than at th beginning, and this shows because instead of one man who is constantly seeking love noticing her, every man is almost mesmerized by her. She had completedher journey."

","When I watched this movie , the opening scene seemed to indicate a silly romantic movie, but actually it has interesting features and attempts to discuss human love relationships.<br/><br/>The underlying theme seemed to want to show that to sell yourself does not necessarily mean you have to be a stripper or someone who exhibits themselves as such, but might be a respectable artist/photographer who appears composed and presentable. <br/><br/>Some parts were unbelievable like falling in love with some you take to the hospital?!?!?! Another unbelievable aspect was the capriciousness of the characters feelings except for Alice. She seems to be the only one who had true feelings for Dan whereas everybody else seemed to be able to jump into bed with everyone else at a whim. That I think downgraded my score for this movie.<br/><br/>What I did find extremely interesting and probably strikes a note with most men is when both male characters have confrontations with the female characters and incessantly and destructively prise out information about whether they had sex with the other party. The interesting thing was were both female characters willingly volunteer that they enjoyed the sex and both indicate that by saying "" I came.."" . This was a damning admission to both male characters and I think is probably indicative of male possessiveness which is only natural. The female characters ended up being the battleground for the two male protagonists. What I don't know is if the female characters were just being honest or taunting the other party. Their reactions are interesting where Alice just leaves and Anna returns to Larry.

","I found ""Closer"" to be a fine, thought-provoking film. It seems to be about theprimarily--men's obsession with talking about sex and finding new partners and their willingness to have sex behind their partner's backs, while revealing their (unfair) fury and voyeurism when they think the object of their desires, their female partners, might be doing the same. The movie resonated with what I know about a certain type of male insecurity: the I-must-conquer-every-attractive-woman-I meet syndrome, not matter how loving and strong my current relationship is, but don't let my partner have a screw behind my back because I will become jealous, voyeuristic, and rageful. The men appeared to be constantly testing their partners, another reflection not only of the men's insecurities but also their nervous projection onto the women of what the men themselves were doing or plotting to do. Making this all happen via the careful plot twists and turns between the four people was very effective and suspenseful. Ultimately, I wondered why all four didn't get together as a quadruple, since one could make the case that they found each other all very attractive. While overtly each character appears very heterosexual, I felt strong homosexual attractions going on. The title is perfect. All the many ways each couple in turn tried to create close, loving relationships, but because of their insecurities and betrayals, they never could stay faithful long enough to pull it off. Nor did the voyeuristic and verbal assaults the men made on their partners over suspicions concerning their other love lives do anything to improve the closeness of any relationship, far from it."

","Synopsis: This is the story of four individual who cross paths, cross lovers, and ultimately screw themselves (and let me tell you: that is totally Nichol's element). It begins with Dan (Law) and Alice's (Portman) chance meeting, and soon enough they fall in love. Of course this does not last long because a photographer, Anna (Roberts), catches the eye of Dan and thus they have an affair. Shortly after this Daniel decides to tell Alice of the affair and he does it with such dry emotion that one cannot help but think he is the scum of the earth. However, he is not alone, Anna decides to tell her husband, Larry (Owen), that she has been having the affair as well. This scene is even more gut-wrenching. The betrayal and deception that occurs between these people is so incredible hurtful that it even grazes the viewer. Anyway, Alice decides to revert back to her old ways and join a strip club again. As fate would have it the distraught Larry shows up at this very strip club. Alice and Larry decide that perhaps it would be beneficial if they had a ""go"" at it, and not too mention it would definitely hurt their ex-lovers. And that is what this whole film is about: lovers turning into haters (I know that sounds ghetto but it's true). Almost everyone knows what it is like to be betrayed by a close loved one and the feelings of revenge that go with it. The only difference between us and the people in this film is that that these people decide to actually extract this vengeance. Well, oddly enough Anna leaves Dan and goes back to Larry, but Alice remains at the strip club. As one can imagine, Daniel is completely broken by this and so he confronts Larry about Anna: he wants her back. It is here that Larry tells him to go back to Alice, and so he tells Daniel where he can find her. Dan is overjoyed by Larry's display of compassion and thanks him for disclosing Alice's location. It is here where I found to be one of the cruelest things throughout the whole movie. Just before Dan leaves, Larry stops him and tells him with pride that he slept with Alice; Dan is devastated. The viewer suddenly feels the deception that Dan felt: Larry appeared to be so forgiving and so nice, and like Dan we forgive him, but when he utters this, we want to cry with Dan. Why on earth would Larry tell Dan this?! Simple: he wants revenge, and it is this revenge that shows us how cruel humans can be. At any rate Dan and Alice never really do get back together (although they do try), and Anna and Larry remain married. And that is the end of the movie. So what do we have to take away from it? Well, many things but what I took away was that love hurts and if we are not careful we can ruin the blessings that are bestowed upon us. These characters will never be the same again (even though Anna and Larry salvaged their marriage one can tell that the love they used to have is gone), and yet at one time they had everything they could have wanted. So why did these people do these things to each other? Well, it was a combination of: lust, jealousy, and rage. Those three little words ruined the lives of four people, and we as the viewer should always remember this. Because if there is anything a great movie like ""Closer"" can do, it is to have us take a second look at what we have and either try to change it or be thankful for it. In my opinion this film does the latter, and I couldn't be happier for the reminder. I really enjoyed this cathartic experience and therefore I will give ""Closer"": 4 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic"

","Not the greatest movie I've ever seen, but oddly, something makes me want to watch it again. I don't really even know why - it's not too believable, the way the characters fall in and out of love at the drop of a hat, and it's not all that well written, either. The movie does make you think, though: What really is THE TRUTH, and IF there is such a thing to a relationship, and IF it is in fact knowable, WOULD you or DO you really want to know it?<br/><br/>Perhaps questions such as these are at the core of what is haunting about this film. Natalie Portman gives a really good performance, Jude Law a bit less so, but still manages to keep you engaged with his character. Frankly, they could have substituted just about anyone for Julia Roberts and had just as good a product.<br/><br/>Damien Rice's song, ""The Blower's Daughter"" provides a brilliant punctuation to the beginning and end - they should have used even more of his work."

","Can you like a movie where all four lead characters are unlikable? The characters played by Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owens, and Natalie Portman are all selfish and unpleasant. All four actors are very good in their respective roles. However, there is a sense of detachment from these characters. For example, do you really care if Jude Law ends up with Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman (I should have such problems)? The ending is predictably dark, as you would expect it to be. It is easy to see why this well was critically acclaimed, but did not do well at the box office. Clive Owens and Natalie Portman deserved their Oscar nominations for their roles.

One of my friends said she nearly wanted to kill herself, another said she would never again watch it, that it was extremely difficult to watch. Had they seen the first half and walked out for some reason they'd go home with the warm happy feeling that all things will turn out and we'll get the cinema romance we paid to watch. Don't get me wrong, it is definitely worth seeing but the twists midway through this movie make this stand out as very Very different from a lot of other movies.<br/><br/>Its controversial, daring, and very different from a lot of other romance movies ever made. Cruel Intentions also has similar characters but none well-defined as the ones in Closer. The movie is definitely for adults and it worth seeing as a date movie. Very different, but also very good."

"iain_connell","6","0","0","3 February 2005"," Not quite up to the script
","It's so rare that we get to see a film made by adults for adults, that it's a pity to report that Mike Nichols's Closer doesn't quite come up to the very high standards that Patrick Marber sets for it. Marber's screenplay, adapted from his own stage version, is full of verbal sparrings which invite over-playing, and I think Nichols's deliberate attempt to under-emphasise the carnality of what takes place, letting the words work for the actors, so to speak, is what lets the film down. For once, I think that the script could do with more opening up from its theatrical origins, taking the action out of rooms, apartments, studios. The music is also spartan (which I would normally welcome), leaving the dialogue with much to do. The camera work is mostly static and head and shoulder, allowing for the very remorseless examination of the characters' reactions and motives which the script demands, but making for a one-dimensional experience.<br/><br/>For such a distraction-free approach to work to succeed in the cinema (the closeups may be softened by smaller screens), performances need to be of the highest order. In this case, though none of the A-list actors by any means let themselves down, their characters' duplicity and self-deception does not transfer from dialogue to action. The only clear motive that we see expressed is for Natalie Portman's character to leave (having had an unambiguous slap from Clive Owen); but earlier, we are asked to believe that Clive will have the hots for Natalie (because he suddenly strokes her face), and that the Julia Roberts character will deceive Clive for Jude Law because they stop talking and start kissing during a photographic session. Oh, and Julia and Clive will get married, but their initial meeting (contrived by Jude, or accidental ?) intimated no such thing.<br/><br/>The result, as many people have commented, is that we find it hard to care very much about these four people and their love and sex lives, to the point where the one (love) and the other (sex) become inter-changeable. Tellingly, though the characters repeatedly ask each other to be truthful, demanding not so much faithfulness as full reporting, it's hardly surprising that neither they nor we understand what has happened. Rather than the intended dissection of relationships, we get an intimate but unrewarding closeup of four characters doing things that come of as much a surprise to them as it is to us.<br/><br/>It's a pity that four such able actors have been reined in to such an extent. For what might be tantrums and breakdowns we get a series of tautly scripted two- and three-handers, with never so much a spilt glass of wine to break the rhythm. Julia Roberts's performance is better than she usually is allowed to be (how she must long for parts such as this), and Natalie Portman shows just how much potential she has for the more fully developed roles to come. Jude Law is good in a bookish sort of way, but is once more not allowed to (or maybe can't) work over much against his looks. He also needs to stop walking like that (the first time I have noticed how ungainly he is). Clive Owen is a bit of a disappointment, perhaps because his anger and spite, not to mention lust, bangs so hard against the other three.<br/><br/>I was not shocked or disgusted by what these fickle four get up to, or say to each other. But I was disappointed that so worthy an attempt to give us a truthful depiction of adult relationships falls into the chasm between exposition and character. For example, did the stage play make use of the Alice/Jane name device, or was this tacked on for the screen ? If so, what was it meant to explain about the Natalie Portman character ? It added nothing that I could see, but maybe I just didn't care enough."

","This movie is not that special, but I liked it. It's all about 4 people who at first have nothing to do with each other, but they all meet each other during the film. It's a bit confusing because the movie jumps in time a lot. From one scene to another, suddenly a year has passed. That wasn't a good idea for the film, I think. The actors played good and convincing, but I didn't care so much for some of the dialogs, because they were a bit exaggerated. But other dialogs were touching and made you think about it. The end was a bit surprising, when you hear Alice's real name which she said earlier in the movie. The film is rather depressing and I would recommend to people with pangs of love not to go and see it. So, my general vision of this movie is that it is good, but nothing more."

There was a distinct lack of any real soundtrack. It progressed through various time periods very quickly and often you were left wondering what was happening. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the film. I found it gripping and intense and I certainly wasn't bored at any point. I liked the fact that I had no idea how it was going to end this was certainly a plus point.

Them being the two main characters who arn't together, even when they love each other.<br/><br/>So anywayz, I see where they are coming from, and it scares me that we as people are like Dan, Anna, Larry and Alice too.

","This was way better than I had expected, based on what folks were saying. It was good to hear some things, though. The characters in this movie ARE odious. They are selfish and scheming and snotty and thoroughly unlikeable. Having said that, their self-centered actions DO represent an aspect of the darker side of all of us. Or, maybe, not so much the darker side, as the lower end of our potential. In other words, most of us have been one of those characters at one time or another. And watching this movie evoked the extreme of that. The movie kind of 'rubbed our noses in it', so to speak. It's more than a mere emetic, however. It was also grimly fascinating to watch. Something stirred inside me, not just recognizing the lower side of things, but my reaction to it all, which brought out the better part of me.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts was sensational. I must confess to never having liked her much before. She always struck me as a light-weight. But dang--- she was the co-best part of the movie, sharing that brilliance with the amazing Natalie Portman. The two of them proved themselves as actors of the highest caliber.<br/><br/>The boys--- Jude Law and Clive Owen--- I cannot say. Their characters were pretty scummy and unsavory. Maybe the male actors were so good that those nasty qualities naturally oozed out of the screen and onto their real-life personalities? That is to say, I didn't like them at all. But, perhaps the male actors were simply so artful and so convincing in their portrayals that my distaste was for the characters, and not the actors. Dunno... But I am made suspicious by the fact that so far in my movie going career as an audience member, Jude Law has played creeps almost every time (Enemies at the Gate notwithstanding).<br/><br/>I gave this a juicy 9 out of 10."
"Jenny Ho","7","0","0","22 January 2005"," Engaging performances by a powerhouse cast make for a very interesting film
","'Closer' plays as a sequence of incidents in the lives of four main characters with passage of differing lengths of time between each scene so that to a certain extent, the audience has to fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>The film opens with a shot on a busy street where Dan (Jude Law) and Alice (Natalie Portman) are walking towards each other to a soundtrack of Damien Rice's 'The Blower's Daughter' (I loved this track the instant I heard it and it suits the opening and end scenes so well). There is a spark as Dan and Alice catch each other's eye but before introductions are made, Alice is knocked down by a taxi and Dan accompanies her to the hospital. At this point in time, we learn that Dan is an obituary writer. Later, we find out that he has used Alice's life as the subject of his novel. He meets Anna (Julia Roberts) who photographs him and they end up kissing. As a result of a prank Dan plays when chatting to Larry (Clive Owen) on an Internet chat room, Larry meets Anna at the London Aquarium.<br/><br/>At times, the film protrudes the intensity of a theatre production which is little surprise as 'Closer' is an adaptation of a Patrick Marber play. All four leads play on the whole, unsympathetic characters but are no less interesting because of it. Natalie Portman even plays against type as a stripper. At times, the film is darkly funny and I would not recommend this film if explicit dialogue offends you.<br/><br/>This is a love story that is different from the norm and deals effectively with the issue of deception and how it impacts on the lives of the central characters."

Hopefully the film will convert some of the blockbuster junkies to take a look at a wider range of films.<br/><br/>The film focuses entirely on the relationships between the four characters played by Law, Owen, Roberts and Portman. I wasn't entirely convinced by the realism of the Dan and Anna characters played by Law and Roberts.

They do it anyway, AFTER signing the document, with no strings attached. But I'm running ahead here.<br/><br/>The way the story is moved forward in Closer is cryptic, probably because it is adapted from a play. There is little use of motion picture montage as the movie jumps from scene to scene in very much the same way it would do on stage, letting the dialogue explain the passage of time and occurrence of events.<br/><br/>The younger pair Alice (Natalie Portman) from New York and Dan (Jude Law) the local meet in London by accident (as a matter of fact, literally, in AN accident). The older pair's encounter is a little more complicated. Recently separated Anna (Julia Roberts) is Dan's photographer (portray for his book), and she meets Larry (Clive Owen) the dermatologist through a practical joke Dan plays on Larry, his sex ICQ encounter. After a few brisk scenes which I wouldn't belabour here, Larry and Anna's happy married life, as well as Alice and Dan's blissful cohabiting, are jeopardised when Dan and Anna start to have an affair. The double break-up is followed by a chance encounter between Larry and Alice at a strip joint, where she has resumed her former profession. This opens up opportunities for devious manoeuvres, double-crossing, betrayals as well as revelation of an array of human emotions on the dark side  jealousy, doubt, vindictiveness.<br/><br/>This film strives on slick, witty, snappy city-smart dialogue. It also seems to go to extraordinary length to depict one's reaction to the spouse having sex with another. This is a little puzzling, as the reaction would be painfully predictable.<br/><br/>Out or the four principals who carry equal billing, through some mysterious process, two (Owen and Portman) have been nominated for best supporting actor and actress respectively for the Golden Globe, and won. Owen displays a very watchable feat of transforming from a pitiable victim to a ruthless avenger. Law starts out demonstrating convincingly the wisdom of casting him for the remake of ""Alfie"", and later picks up the role Owen dropped, that of a victim. Portman is a simple and sweet irony, with innocence oozing from a superficially erotic and seductive persona. Roberts in this movie uncharacteristically does not seem to have found a comfortable niche that she usually has.<br/><br/>An interesting movie, I won't hesitate to say, but can't help leaving the cinema with a little bit of a much-ado-about-nothing feeling."

Anyway thanks to the director for not hanging it on.<br/><br/>There are 4 people getting themselves dirty in 4 relationships. They betray, and they hate lies. They seek for 100% truth, and they are 100% unfaithful. Closer starts and ends with this eternal paradox which could appear to be another modern love comedy. It works, however, with the brilliant-written lines.<br/><br/>One says, 'you ruin my life' and the other fights back 'you'll get over it'. So sad, and so true. How I wish Den (Jude Law) and Anna (Julia Roberts) would be together but the chemistry between them only sparks a little. Another example, Larry (Clive Owen, Anna's husband) raise his hand to hit Anna and his once-divorced-wife says, 'I've been hit before.' 'Not by me.' Larry says back without giving second thought. Why so brutal? Actually they take 'love' as the word of the day EVERYDAY and it just can't light up. To the four people, truth outweighs love, then? They made each other confessing their betrayal which only causes pain. Big dumb. The words which are so mean and cruel make the movie bloody violent, which terrifies me. It seems saying that lier and lover is a pair of twins, accept the fact or you're not qualified to go in and out of the game.<br/><br/>Last word, don't worry it's not a sad story.

Although the ""swapping"" around is a little far fetched (can Anna ever make her mind up ?!) it makes for some interesting scenes & friction between the ""only four people in the whole movie"" - you hardly notice do you ? <br/><br/>The four actors do a great job and the dialogue (for the most part :-)) is excellent. I think where this movie falls short of greatness (by some way) is the generalisations (that we all can relate to) mixed with some ""over the top"" stuff that I don't think many of us can (?). The movie comes up with some interesting points but it lets itself down by taking one character (particularly) to some fairly nasty extremes (clive owen). Would many of us really say & do those things ? ..to that extent ? ..not so sure. <br/><br/>It seems to me that the movie is about the fall/destruction of the people who got left/dumped (Clive Owen & Natalie Portman) and then their ultimate empowerment (these two end the movie ""in control"" having lost it completely earlier on). Jude Law (& to some extent Julia Roberts) are the opposite. Jude starts the movie slightly ""geeky"" then becomes empowered and ""in control"" (even starts smoking & wearing those cool dark blue suits!) but ultimately ends up (like Julia) looking and acting pretty pathetic. I guess this boils down to: WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND. (?)<br/><br/>It's definitely NOT a ""feel good"" movie! In fact much of it, particularly the 2nd half, is a pretty depressing take on quite how selfish, destructive and obsessive people can be when it comes to ""relationships"". Having said all that it does have some great scenes. The ""internet"" scene between Jude & Clive and how the movie sets up the relationships in the 1st half are probably the best stuff.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:<br/><br/>Actors great. Some scenes great. Most dialogue great. Let down by some ""extreme"" (and I don't mean that in a prudish way! :-)) characterisation.

I never believed that a movie could explain so well what real life is. We usually say talking about life that we're not in a movie, this time I said, we're not in real life. My friends said that this movie makes them feel sad, for me is a reconciliation with the world. Dostoevskij said that every crime has his punishment. And it's true.

","Vicous, mean-spirited movie about four people falling in and out of lust with each other, cheating on each other, and hurting each other. The characters throw cynical one-liners back and forth at each other throughout, but they never seem as if they're smart enough to speak this way. The only one who rises above this is Clive Owen who is the best thing in the film and steals every scene he's in. Very unlikable, but strangely addicting if only to find out what becomes of these bad people. No real insight, just a dirty, vulgar film that happens to be pretty pleasing to the eye.

","Closer is a pseudo artistic film with a superb cast that accomplished little more then jading an otherwise un-jaded idealistic person. The film was pessimistic is its view of the love struck individual and depicted a world of brute honesty clashing with deceiving dishonesty. The characters of Dan, Alice/Jane, Anna, and Larry illustrate the harsh realities of the falsification of identity and shame. The film included concepts and scenes with blatant symbolism that would make post modernists cringe. Anna's photography exhibition entitled Strangers was after school special-esquire cliché attempting to foreshadow the distance between Alice and her lover Dan, as well as the basic love principles for the film. Furthermore, the concept of using the black and white head shot imagery to symbolize the non linear path of love was beyond banality. The idea of Alice's real name being Jane is nothing more then falsely symbolic in reality, deceiving someone of a name is not exactly big deal...remember Shakespeare? The finale of the film, in which Alice has ""become"" Jane is nothing more then tying up the loose ends of her English experience. Alice told Larry early in the film that novel written about her is a lie and thus she is a walking lie which is portrayed by her name. The name change is also symbolic for it is so plain and boring, that it shows Alice/Jane is really no one special, reaffirming what she told Anna earlier in the film when she had her photo taken. The film attempted to be something it is not: complicated. It's nonlinear plot portrayed the overdone concept of love and lack of romance. It was agonizing for me to watch and left myself with a depressed feeling of resentment towards the pain of love. Lastly, any film with Julia Roberts in it lacks credibility, though I guess the remainder of the cast makes up for everything she lacks."

","What kind of move ignores its subject matter? Closer is a movie about sex or love. Your pick. However, neither makes an appearance. Mike Nicohls gives us a movie with lust and striping (implied, at that) but leaves out the juicy details. If people are accusing Kinsey of keeping its hands clean, they haven't see Closer yet.<br/><br/>Based on the stage play of the same name, this is a movie about four people that play musical bed partners for two hours. It doesn't have to end there. There is no reason for us to go home to a real idea of the world other than that people get impatient if something takes longer than they were expecting. That's a great way to explain Alexander's failure without having to bring up the topic of homosexuality. In the case of Closer, the film could have ended after the first half hour, the second half hour and so on. There is a break between each set of screaming matches between yet another different pairing of the only four people in the movie. This is a convenient time to get a refill on your caffeine. What my dad refers to as ""focusing agent"" should make a tidy sum with this film. They should market together. I mean, how else to you plan to stay focused (for lack of a better word) during this event? With such a popular subject, such as love, it is important to be original and to offer something that the guy next door couldn't. A movie should offer something more than depiction of life. Closer presents a very bleak look at love and to accompany that should be a reason. What did these characters do that brought them to this? Why do they settle for it? Each of the four characters is practically that same as their counter part. Of course, there are small differences. Anna is a successful photographer and Alice is a stripper but these things are not big enough to build a character study on and that, at times, is what Closer aims for. In its dissection of this view on love, the characters should be the catalysts but instead serve more as puppets to deliver the witty line that does not add to the over all picture.<br/><br/>If we wanted solely a portrait of life, we would watch a documentary. A film is a medium of art that will be bombarded by critics and pretentious moviegoers (myself included) trying to find symbolism. The sad truth here is that the symbols we seek are often not there and what is happens to be nothing more than a chuckling director who knows he has the audience on a string. Still, even when the symbolism is far fetched, there needs to be something to differentiate a movie from a home video. Just because a moment is caught on film does not make it art. Closer is obviously art, no disputing. The problem is that no one bothered to make it interesting art. If I want to watch a movie about love or a movie about sex my choices are endless. Why should I pick this one? Because Natalie Portman is finally a ""grown up""? Because Clive Own is the next big thing? Because Julia Robets ditched the Pretty Woman and $20 million pay check for this? <br/><br/>Maybe another day. ***/*****"

And don't think I am a prude. But it was totally gratuitous, unnecessary and unimaginative potty talk. It is impossible to feel anything but contempt for the characters (except for Alice/Jane/Portman). They are all shallow and lacking in character--except for A/J/P.

"wjfickling","9","0","0","23 December 2004"," Nearly flawless, marred by miscasting
","This film is that rarity of rarities in mainstream films: a film about intelligent, articulate adults that is emotionally honest. This can probably be credited primarily to Mike Nichols, who has never flinched from depicting lacerating emotional honesty in his films (""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,"" ""Carnal Knowledge""). The screenplay, adapted from a play by its author, is first rate, giving us dialogue that represents how urban adults actually talk to one another, and it can be forgiven the contrived way in which it depicts the meeting between the Law and Portman characters, unfortunately reminiscent of Jennifer Lopez in ""The Wedding Planner."" Fortunately, that happens in the very beginning of the film and as we get involved in the characters we can forget about it.<br/><br/>Much of the credit for the film's success can go to the actors, especially Owen, Law, and Portman. Owen, whom I have never seen before, is a dynamo and probably the nastiest character in the film. He seems to delight in spewing verbal invective. Yet, he is still able to display emotional vulnerability. Law plays down his sex symbol image and plays another rotter who enjoys playing nasty tricks on people. Portman is simply fantastic playing a seemingly emotionally vulnerable and needy young woman who is not as innocent as she seems.<br/><br/>The films principal, and only, serious flaw is the casting of Julia Roberts as Anna, perhaps the pivotal character in the film. I have read that Cate Blanchett was first cast in the part, but then withdrew. This is a pity; Roberts is totally miscast. Yes, she's beautiful, but she plays Anna with such emotional coldness that it's a mystery why two men like Law and Owen would become obsessed by her. They react to her as they might to a sexual dynamo, which she definitely isn't in this film. Perhaps if she brought a bit of the vulgarity she did to playing Erin Brockovitch to this role, their obsession might be understandable. It might be even more understandable with a different actress. But in spite of this flaw, it's a memorable film. 9/10"

","Those four words that begins the title song of Closer (""And so it is"") just about sum up the movie. Characters are finicky, agitating, agitated and each so flawed in his or her own way, and most conflicts end with abrupt, cut-and-dry decisions that still leaves everyone, including the decision maker, in curious confusion. As the players fall in and out of love (whatever ""love"" means, they themselves don't seem to know), we are able to sympathize and criticize at the same time. And it is all together acted out brilliantly, with what is by far the best ensemble performance of the year. Natalie Portman's Alice is the character of most intrigue, going from a full range of being lovable and detestable. The movie feels more like a play (as it was adapted from a stage production), and that has its definite merits. Closer doesn't pretend to provide the most realistic portrayal of love and betrayal, but rather a case-study of certain defined characters in their pain drudgery through sexual avarice."

","Before watching this film I was aware of the fact that ""Closer"" had been a supremely popular stage production in Britain which had inspired Nichols to bring it to film. So, naturally, I came into the theater expecting a complete disaster. I was happy to realize that this film was not a total loss -- if a loss at all.<br/><br/>Nichols's depiction of the four lovers (literally) was like a wildlife expert observing four animals during mating season. One of them was going to mess with the wrong female, and that one was going to end up a rotting carcass. But I have to say, Roberts played her role as an adulterous extremely well. All first-billed actors did exactly as they should've in this film, and more.<br/><br/>Audiences are much too used to attaching themselves to the protagonist, and allow themselves to be dragged in the dirt by the proverbial leash. Sorry to break this to you, folks, but NONE OF THESE CHARACTERS WERE Lovable. Not. One. Like others, I was prone to sympathize with 'Alice' for a great portion of the film, but of course that went out the window by the end of the first hour.<br/><br/>Dan was a desperate pervert. Larry was a perverted prick. Anna was a frigid bitch. Alice was a slut. And to top it all off, all four characters could have just as easily switched roles and screwed themselves over at the blink of an eye. This, of course, lead to their destruction, and in some cases, their resurrection.<br/><br/>I doubt many Americans, who have now receded into their conservative holes in the ground will appreciate this film as much as the overseas proprietors, but hey ... who cares? I loved this movie. It's one that will never grow old, never get wrinkles, and never get thrown into it the vault for losing its aesthetics.

What forces these men to obsessively cling to hopelessly frayed relationships is that they are then erotically bound to each other without ever touching. A brilliant idea brilliantly conceived by Patrick Marber. Mike Nichols, as in Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? and Carnal Knowledge, nails the irony of sex and love: men and women live in different Universes. And how about the small miracle of a sex-drenched movie without a single embarrassing, artsy scene of sweaty, writhing copulators? The early scene of cyber-sex between the two men reveals their shallowness and immaturity.

","I'm in two minds about ""Closer"". Is it an accurate portrayal of modern relationships? Or is merely a brilliant conceit, a filmed play with clever dialogue that bears no resemblance to reality? Whatever the case, the message of ""Closer"" seems to be that truth has very little to do with relationships. Truth is something you hear only the moment your relationship is about to end, not while the two of you are together. Truth doesn't bring you closer. It only drives you apart.<br/><br/>There's a scene in ""Closer"" that involves a very racy exchange between two unlikely individuals in an Internet chat room. One of the two people chatting is merely adopting an online persona. He is not at all who or what he claims to be. The other is at least true to his nature as a sexual animal -- in his own words, a ""caveman"". Perhaps there is a message there too: that we are truest when we are true to ourselves.<br/><br/>The caveman in question is Larry, played with raw energy and passion by Clive Owens. Of the four protagonists, Larry is the most real and true. Alice (Natalie Portman) is hiding behind an assumed identity, though she is ironically a stripper who lays herself bare to strangers. Dan (Jude Law) projects an image of macho bravado, but is actually a sniveling, weepy, whiny little boy lost. As for Anna (Julia Roberts), she is an ice-cold maiden who sees genuine human emotion only as fodder for her artwork as a photographer.<br/><br/>All of these characters confuse wanting to be loved with wanting to be needed -- or to dominate and control. And they all confuse wanting to hear the truth with their real desire to be lulled by lies.<br/><br/>This film could have explored modern relationships even more deeply. There were hints of sexual tension between Dan and Larry, and between Anna and Alice. The movie would be longer, but the end result would be the same. It seems that, whether you're gay or straight, when it comes to love, nothing could be farther from the truth."
"movieguy1021","8","2","5","5 December 2004"," Closer: 8/10
","From September to the end of the year, Jude Law will have been in six movies-I ? Huckabees, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Alfie, A Series of Unfortunate Events, The Aviator, and Closer. I'm sure most people are sick of him, but I think he's a good actor, and I like seeing him take on different types of roles. Certainly, Closer is a different type of role, and Law gets to use his natural British tongue here. Law also has some great support here: Natalie Portman (coming off of her role in Garden State), Clive Owen (now becoming more mainstream thanks to...King Arthur?), and Julia Roberts (who'd think she'd be GOOD in something?). And when you're being directed by Mike Nichols, how bad can you really be?<br/><br/>Alice (Portman) is hit by a car and is taken to the hospital by Dan (Law). They fall in love. Dan has his picture taken by Anna (Roberts) and falls in love with her. He plays a trick on Larry (Owen) by pretending to be Anna online. Anna and Larry meet. They fall in love. Things continually get switched around like that.<br/><br/>Closer is based on a play by Patrick Marber. There can't be more than 10 scenes, most of the story is relied on by dialogue, and there's a scarce number of characters. Now, I'm not sure if it's that fact or not, but it seemed like Mike Nichols did an outstanding job directing. This could just be me and my quirky film tastes, but I loved how there was absolutely no sense of time. You saw two people together for ten minutes, then a new scene, where something obviously must have happened, but what? That's where the dialogue comes in. That's how we find out what has happened in the time lapses. It's Nichols not condescending to the audience. He's trusting us enough to put together the pieces for the movie. In a way, this movie reminded me a lot of Godard's Contempt, in that scenes lasted for a long time. In Contempt about 45 minutes of the middle of the movie is one scene in a house, with two people talking. Closer obviously was influenced by that movie, and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>All four of the lead actors (in fact, basically the only four actors) are amazing-more than I thought possible for any of them. Roberts (known in the film community as ""that person who stole Ellen Burstyn's Oscar in 2000"") does a surprisingly good job-she seems to not have any ego here (now THAT is surprising), and that allows her to put in a realistic performance as one of those pretentious art-gallery types. Owen, who had been Dan in the original stage production, seemed to know what do to the most, and for that, was probably the best out of the four, closely rivaled by Portman. Shedding her goody-goody roles of the past, she plays a stripper who becomes entangled with everyone else. Garden State proved her acting talents, and Closer confirmed them. Law also proved that his six-films-a-year style doesn't faze him at all-he deserves all six, if not more.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like about Closer is the fact that it seemed to be rather long (reminded me of both Contempt and Solaris). It's less than 100 minutes, but seemed longer. However, the simple (yet complex) story is sustained for that runtime, making Closer a great, challenging film to watch-there's some explicitness in it that wasn't necessary, but if you can get through that, I think Closer will offer a complex night at the movies.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for sequences of graphic sexual dialogue, nudity/sexuality and language."

The opera is a comedy; this film is not.<br/><br/>""Closer"" is basically a filmed play. All the drama comes from the dialog.

If you are not comfortable peering into the dark side of human nature and the sadistic side of sexuality, you should not see this film. This is a film about people who are beautiful on the outside and ugly on the inside.<br/><br/>This is an art film. It uses an interesting device of skipping large amounts of time without telling the viewer. You find out in the dialog that the film has suddenly skipped ahead a year or more. This is a challenging film that requires the viewer actively think during the entire film and especially at the ending. If you go to movies in order to stop thinking, you will probably not like this film. Also, if you are offended by graphic sexual dialog, do not see this film. The dialog in this film makes ""Kinsey"" seem tame by comparison. If you have trouble figuring out the ending, remember that the names at the memorial were people who died saving children and ""truth is what separates us from the animals."" Afterwards, you can decide who was the most manipulative character in the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography and the dialog are some of the best I've seen in several years. We get so few adult oriented films these days; you should catch this one on the big screen while you have the chance. This is a rare opportunity to see some real literary emotional drama.

In closer, however these moments go beyond temptation, into lies, deceit, infidelity, misery, painful truths, abandonment, tears and suffering.

The soundtrack isn't great, but 'The Blower's Daughter' is a perfect opening and closing song and helps set the mood for the film. The honest portrayal of relationships, cheating, depression, and dissatisfaction are what make this movie, and they are difficult to watch. A great film. Also, the Natalie Portman striptease...

"tabuno","9","1","2","24 January 2019"," A Fascinating Look At Relationships
","30 December 2004. This relational drama offers up a continuing evolution of movies revealing a more cynical but valuable look into relationships. Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law, and Clive Owen all provide different personalities on screen and give the audience a rich experience into the levels of love and torment. This movie operates on a number of different levels and gives its audience both cynical omens for dispair as well as hopeful signs for optimism - a little for everyone. This movie avoids the typical, stereotypical ending and leaves the audience all the more educated and developed as a result. The universal male striving for love and sexual validation along with a female's desire for support and commitment are all on display in this version of intimate triangles and rectangles. Of deceit and honesty, of open communication and avoidance and secrecy, of impulse and spontaneity, of salvation and betrayal. All the emotions are on display in this movie and the audience is the better for it. Nine of out Ten Stars."
"wisneskilife","9","1","2","3 January 2019"," Absolutely Bonkers

"crystallogic","3","1","2","20 October 2018"," I knew it was doomed within the first thirty minutes
","You could say this isn't the sort of movie I should be reviewing, but I try to keep an open mind. Believe it or not, I don't sit around looking for things to hate so I can trash them on the internet and to friends. I'm willing to give most things due attention, and the benefit of the doubt. I don't care where a movie comes from or who's in it, if it seems like it might be partway interesting, I'll give it a shot if I happen to come across it. Such is the case for Closer, which promised, if not chills and thrills, then at least some intrigue and the possibility of an emotional ride.<br/><br/>I don't really know how to classify this thing, and that's not a mark against it. it's not romance, it's not comedy -- it's a relationship drama, I suppose. There was a chance this could have been a well done, charismatic story, but I felt something went terribly wrong from the start. It's one of those cases where I'd probably enjoy some of the behind-the-scenes machinations more than the movie itself. I wonder, even, if the film might have been somewhat sabotaged by its stars.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this whole story is a lack of chemistry on the part of all concerned. Throwing these people together was a mistake. The script also doesn't bother with subtlety, doesn't really give us a chance to know or care about these four people before we're whisked through another time jump of four months, or a year, and then we're told, ""oh it's like this now; he's with her and she's with the other guy"". While it's true that without these jumps forward in time that take place in the narrative, the story would probably have gotten bogged down in boring domestic details, the fact that these gaps are basically needed to keep the story vaguely alive-and-breathing should have set off alarms for everybody. I don't have to like any of these people, but I should at least be interested in them. Julia Roberts' Anna is basically a complete non-entity, who's snogging the unlikeable writer a mere two minutes after her first appearance in the story. Are we just supposed to figure this is the way it goes because she's played by Julia Roberts? That's almost how it seemed! I wonder how the story would have played out if they'd cast unknowns? I bet it would have been better than this, somehow.<br/><br/>There's no arresting style, no poignant words, just a Bizarre Love Square. yes, a Love Square. Who's sleeping with whom this time? Who cares. This is just an irredeemably bad movie. I could almost feel my will to continue being drained as the thing progressed, and I wonder if the screen-writers, the actors, or anybody directly involved felt the same. I kind of hope so."
"StephanieMMiller17","10","1","2","27 August 2017"," Raw and Unfiltered
","I love this film for the real, raw emotion of each character's relationship and interaction with each other as the dynamics morph and change over time. There is a continual cat and mouse game that always leaves you guessing as to how much another character knows of their lover. The unfiltered dialogue in how modern relationships play out in today's society I feel has rarely been shown in mainstream films prior to this movie's arrival and it is refreshing. I also love the psychology behind each of the characters, their past and how it interacts with each decision they make regarding their love interest (or desires) in the present. There is a dark melancholy humor throughout the movie which plays wonderfully with the mood shifts of each role, and the soundtrack is spot on with each adaptation as well. Brilliantly acted on all parts."

"videorama-759-859391","9","1","2","31 May 2017"," Look closer, and you have more than a movie
","This is one of those special films you come to respect, and really admire, because of it's truth. With tight performances, from Owen and Portman (especially Owen) these are reasons Closer really works. The film is about infidelity but what ""real love"" is, and it's own underhanded way, challenges us, through it's great screenplay and performances. Law's was one I really liked, as a nerdy, conserved type, who writes obituaries, where his contrast comes in the form of his best friend/doctor, Larry (Owen) the more open, in control, Studley type. Then he (Law) sees her, (Portman) in slow mo, heading towards him, through a bevy of walking New Yorkers. Their mutual attraction is unmistakable, while meanwhile Law is involved with someone else, photographer, Roberts, the least best performance out of the four, where our other three pull higher rank. I don't know, I just didn't like Roberts in this film. It wasn't her acting, but more so her character. Now she's involved in a relationship with Owen, who does Portman. Lucky dog. Confused? Now the movie runs on these four characters, all brought together to create high quality drama, about us as people, taking off the mask, and seeing who we really are. Portman's cruel, blunt honesty, near the end, really opens your eyes, and it's paining, but also, seeing the desperation in Law to save and keep her, where at the end, we find out, she really did need saving. Closer is not the most appealing film, and does have some pretty heavy, coarse language, here and there, but it's an important film. The scene in the strip club between Owen and Portman is gold, my fav, Owen's never been funnier, while Portman, scantily clad, donning a pink wig, has never been hotter. The song a slow sung track is haunting, as in how it painfully befits Law and Portman's short lived relationship, as if torturous too. Though in all, Closer, is a well, fine fashioned film, that must be praised for it's honesty."

","It seems there's love behind everything. Love shaped to resemble anything you can think of. And all too often, love made out to be the prize. I distrust anything and everything that makes love out to be immaculate and a source of endless joy. Subtle strokes of musical genius presented under the name ""The Blower's Daughter"" by Damien Rice, accompanied two versions of Natalie Portman walking in utter self-confidence towards the audience (just short of The Purple Rose of Cairo)"" Two versions of the same character, in fact, the person you don't know and the person you thought you knew. The story, or rather the vignettes sandwiched between those versions, and the metamorphosis that blended them close to seamlessly, were impressive all on their own. An uncompromising 'wake up and smell the (bitter) coffee and drink it down to the last sip while you're at it' sort of cinematic experience. <br/><br/>A movie that, while mainstream, manages to bypass every mainstream hint of restraint and shows it to you like it is. No air brushing. No sugar coating. Here. Love isn't always pretty. Love can come your way escorted by black sheep: jealousy, selfishness, possessiveness, pride, cruelty, inconsiderateness, shamelessness, corroding dissatisfaction.

"StevePulaski","9","1","2","11 February 2015"," The ugliness we don't want to want
","Mike Nichols' Closer is a rough blow to any soul who considers themselves a hopeless romantic or somebody who believes in unconditional, true love at first sight. Having recently been involved in an incredibly open, romantic friendship that had me caught under love's uncompromising spell only to be slammed down by hardened reality and poor circumstance, Nichols' film is just the kind of bitter but brutally honest work on the subject I needed. Here is a film that recognizes the human desire for truth and honesty, and the simultaneous closure and pain it can provide, whilst examining, paradoxically, how much pain and suffering true love can leave someone.<br/><br/>The film opens in London, with two strangers, Alice Ayres (Natalie Portman) and Dan Woolf (Jude Law), catching each others eyes on a crowded street before Alice is unexpectedly hit by a taxi in the crosswalk. Dan takes her to the hospital, where she remains stable and discharged soon after, and the two strike up a companionship obviously destined for some kind of romantic relationship along the line. She is an American woman who worked as a stripper before coming to live in London, and he's a failed British author who now writes obituaries for a London-based newspaper.<br/><br/>A year later, though Alice and Dan are in a relationship, Dan begins to minimize his loyalty by flirting and sharing a kiss with an American photographer named Anna Cameron (Julia Roberts), who is photographing him for his upcoming novel on Alice's life. When Anna comes over one day to photograph Alice, Dan secretly asks Anna to have an affair with him, to which she refuses. Alice overhears the conversation but pretends like she didn't, even as she notices Dan stalking Anna for the next year. One day, Dan posing as Anna in a cybersex chatroom manages to match her up with Larry Gray (Clive Owen), a British dermatologist, by convincing him to meet her at an aquarium, a place where Anna is known to go. The two meet, realize they were played, presume it was by Dan, and go on to lead a romantic relationship; Dan hopes this will deter his feelings for Anna and rekindle contentment with Alice, but alas, it only makes him more jealous of Anna.<br/><br/>Closer concerns the kind of deception and deceit that comes into play when the characters begin meeting and interacting with one another. Eventually, Larry meets Alice, and Dan meets Larry, resulting in several different relationships brewing on many different levels of hostility and contempt. The characters are only seen in the same room once, as Nichols and writer Patrick Marber, who penned the play the film is based on, allow each individual relationship to take on its own level of singularity rather than lumping the characters together in one gigantic scene.<br/><br/>Holding the film together are the performances of the actors at hand, each capitalizing off of a sole trait that makes them interesting and believably flawed. Alice, despite working as a stripper and willing to do pretty much anything for anyone, still radiates a childlike sense of whimsy and innocence, often playing like she doesn't know the entirety of what's occurring before her. Dan is restless, never settling down and always looking for something better, whilst, in the process, ruins the lives of the three other characters in the film. Anna has a neediness to her; a neediness to be loved and cared for, similar to Alice, that makes her not pitiable but relatable on a human level, mimicking our very desire to be appreciated and cherished. Finally, there's Larry, who replicates methods by using either blunt force, hungering for the truth in a more brash, vulgar manner than Dan, all while trying to remain civil even in the most unsavory circumstances.<br/><br/>Consider the scene where Larry demands to know what Anna sees in Dan, particularly their love-making and how it is different or similar to their own intimacy. At first, Anna refrains from graphic details, but soon plays Larry's game of brutal honest, dishing out the details that he simultaneously does and doesn't want to know. This part hits close to home for me; while I want to know the details of things, I often wish I hadn't and dwell upon them for a considerable amount of time. Nichols and Marber question of whether or not it's better to know and dwell, for at least you have the knowledge of the situation, or be blissfully ignorant of the acts of your significant other and operate with a comforting sense of tunnel vision.<br/><br/>At its core, however, this is an incredibly upsetting film, especially for those who like their films about love romantic and picturesque. Those who enjoy romance films treating love as a fallacy and akin to the kind of pretty pictures on post-cards shouldn't even bother picking this one up, unless they want to see any form of concrete reality. Closer may not be pretty, but it's brutally honest, and emphasizes the paradox of love's pleasure and pain, and works best if you know such feelings and what they can bring to a person. This is an incredibly underrated, compelling adult drama, cleanly executing character investment and motivations on top of etching in under-explored ideas about a topic that is heavily explored."

"Menelfea","Null","1","2","22 April 2013"," An Uncomfortably Honest Presentation
","It's interesting how polarizing this film seems to be. Some complain of the 'flatness' of the characters, others complain of the 'unrealism'.<br/><br/>To me, it was both very good and very unlikeable, in similar ways as American History X or The Life of David Gale. These films expose a gritty realism that few admit to have experienced first-hand, and one that most reject with a hardened shield of denial. Maybe these people have perfect relationships, or maybe they haven't tried hard enough to make things work when they didn't -- to see the facades crumble, to truly get to know someone for who they are instead of who they want you to think they are (or possibly worse, for who you want them to be.)<br/><br/>But I've known these people, and I've been there done that. I've listened to their stories and I have my own. I've watched the insecurity and distrust intermingle with the passion and the love, watched when the selfishness wins out, watched as one's grip on reality fall apart, watched people coming to terms with their own inner demons. Do they love this person, or do they love what this person does for them? When that stops, does their love stop too? What was love anyway to them? Do you tell the truth to protect someone, or do you lie to protect them? How much of it is really just about protecting yourself?<br/><br/>This film provides no answers. What it does is take black and white issues and exposes their grayness. It shows that things aren't what they seem; not because there's some hidden magic at work, but rather because we never really saw things for what they were in the first place. Nor can we. All we have are our guesses, our motives, our idealism/pessimism, and our strategies for dealing with uncertainty and insecurity.<br/><br/>And so it's pretty honest. The story is neither happy nor sad, it simply is. What you decide to take from it is up to you.<br/><br/>Some excellent insight with a different conclusion:<br/><br/>""Strippers, photographers who take pictures of strangers, cybersex - it's not enough. It's character development that makes stories like this compelling. We don't really know who they are. We see what they do. We don't know what they want, what drives them. They remain abstract and general."" - kalayaan48 from Philippines<br/><br/>And I would say that's the point. Better if you just flesh out these characters with your own experiences. And if they still fall flat, perhaps it's worth spending more time observing the world as it is and less time judging it."

Maybe I'm a bad person for thinking that, but as Larry said, ""it's because I'm a f*ck*ng pig!"" Really awful....the use of flashbacks to explain the multiple lies and infidelities of these weirdos was clichéd and boring....I like all of the actors in this film, but the writing was so god-awful I don't think there was any way to salvage this wreck. Jude Law's character was a super-creepy stalker type, and all of these characters seem to fall in and out of love at the drop of a hat. It was obvious as I was watching the movie that it was a poorly adapted novel or play because it was so awkward- (turns out it was a play., which hopefully was better than the cinematic adaptation) <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and skip this one.....I see a lot of reviewers are very passionately lauding this flick, but I am definitely on the side of the haters. My fiancé and I just finished it, and she said ""You get to pick the movie next time, this one was awful."" Why anyone would hook up with any of these characters is beyond me, and expecting viewers to believe they find each other attractive is too much.

","Closer is a romantic drama based on his award-winning play of the same title. It stars Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law and Clive Owen. The film, like the play on which it is based, has been seen by some as a modern and tragic version of Mozart's opera Così fan tutte, with references to that opera in both the plot and the soundtrack.It was written by Patrick Marber and directed by Mike Nichols.<br/><br/>Dan is a writer in London who wants to finish a novel, but in the meantime supports himself by writing obituaries. One day he chances upon Alice, a beautiful young American expatriate, working as a stripper, when he sees her get hit by a car. Alice immediately falls for Dan, and gives him her love without reservation. Dan is initially enchanted with Alice, and returns her affection, but while she inspires him to write his novel, her neediness begins to wear on him. Anna is a photographer who is hired to take a portrait of Dan for the dust jacket of his book; Dan is attracted to her easy confidence, and while the two of them flirt, Anna soon meets Larry, a dermatologist, and marries him. Dan can't get Anna out of his mind even though she's married, and the two become lovers, but Dan is frustrated by the fact that Anna is reluctant to leave Larry for him.Four extremely beautiful people do extremely horrible things to one another in Closer, Mike Nichols' pungent adaptation of Patrick Marber's play that easily marks the Oscar-winning director's best work in years.<br/><br/>Four extremely beautiful people do extremely horrible things to one another in Closer, Mike Nichols' pungent adaptation of Patrick Marber's play that easily marks the Oscar-winning director's best work in years. It's only until you're more than halfway through the movie that you'll have to ask yourself exactly why you are watching such a beautifully tragic tale, as it is basically the ickiest, grossest, most dysfunctional parts of all your past relationships strung together into one movie. Ultimately, it falls to the four actors to draw you deeper into the story; all succeed relatively, but it's Law and Owen whose characters will cut you to the quick. Law proves that yet again he's most adept at playing charming, amoral bastards with manipulative streaks, and Owen is nothing short of brilliant as the character most turned on by the energy inherent in destructive relationships."

In a stage production of Closer, Owen actually took on the role of Dan, which is hard to imagine after seeing how well he played Larry.<br/><br/>Patrick Marber's script is magnificently written. The whole film is a string of conversations made up of memorable quotes.

"tieman64","Null","1","2","26 June 2012"," Warning: Love in Progress
","Mike Nichols directs ""Closer"", arguably his best film since ""Silkwood"" and ""Carnal Knowledge"". Like many of Nichols' early works, the film is based on a stage-play, in this case a 1997 Patrick Marber play of the same name.<br/><br/>Like ""Carnal Knowledge"", the film revolves around two couples who repeatedly cheat on one another, attempt to scar one another and struggle to define their own criss-crossing relationships. In this regard, two characters, one a photographer and one a writer, attempt to keep other human beings at a comfortable distance, via either camera lenses, computers or pens. Another character prefers the anonymity of false identities (false names, accessories, fake stripper personas etc) and foreign countries. Each of these characters views love as a blank slate or attractive absence upon which they can project their own illusions and/or desires. Once the object of desire gets too close the attraction wears off. They are counterpointed to another character, played by Clive Owen, who is brutally honest (and hilariously vulgar) when it comes to his personal perversions, lusts and genuine affections. Owen's a doctor, a pragmatist, enamoured by a brutal corporeality, and seems initially to be the only character who seems capable of a healthy relationship. With time, though, we see that love for all four characters is largely an exercise in power, damage infliction and a game of rampant hormones. ""Without truth we're just animals,"" one character says, but truth is precisely what wrecks all the film's relationships. The film's title thus has a triple, somewhat paradoxical meaning, love strongest when we AREN'T CLOSE to the object of desire, impossible UNLESS one gets truly close, and often SABOTAGED by the discomfort of proximity.<br/><br/>While Marber's characters are as dysfunctional and hyper-sexualised as our own Western societies, they all seem to have their own very specific, individual faults. The two women, played by Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts, seem unable to love themselves, and so survive by creating idealised bodies to be ""loved through"", one creating photographs as a bulwark, the other turning her own body into protective art. When these shields are broken and their lovers get closer, they both deliberately sabotage their relationships. Much of the film contains characters vying for the complete possession of their lover, attempting to dig deeper and deeper in an attempt to gain some secret knowledge or deeply intimate space which may or may not exist; ""closeness"" here is likened to a kind of possession. And of course when this raw, uncompromising level is reached, the lovers recoil in shock; closeness seems traumatic.<br/><br/>Like most stage-play adaptations, ""Closer"" largely consists of talking heads, long conversations and simple camera set ups. Nichols is an old-hand at this, so he makes it work. The film is gripping, tense and flows well, but there is something overly sensational about its plot, Marber deliberately constructing his story as a tawdry car-wreck, audiences invited to peer, sleazily, at festering, mutilated corpses. Sadly, much of ""adult theatre"" has become this way, and an increasing number of play-writes turned directors - think early-Mamet and Neil LaBute – who once relied on a certain kind of high-brow sensationalism to sell tickets to dulled audiences, are starting to bring these same caustic plots over to film. It's not that play-writes aren't right to expose certain aspects of human nature, but that often these stories seem sneering or designed to shock.<br/><br/>Still, there's lots of good stuff here. The film's screenplay is interesting in the way it omits the parts of its plot that more formulaic films would have dwelt on, its cast is mostly good (the stilted dialogue may irk those unfamiliar with stage plays) and Nichols' direction is mostly fine, aside from a poor opening and closing. The film is predominantly vulgar and hopeless.<br/><br/>Incidentally, actors Natalie Portman and Jude Law played similar characters in Wong Kar-Wai's ""My Blueberry Nights"", a film somewhat similar to Nichols' ""Closer"". Portman's performances in both film were poor; she can't convey ""sexiness"". In both films the film-makers also strain heavily to make their young, female characters quirky and likable (lots of hair dye and hipster hats). See Antonioni's ""Beyond the Clouds"" for this material done about as good as it can be done.<br/><br/>8/10 - Worth one viewing. Makes a good companion-piece to ""Eccentricities of a Blond Haired Girl"", ""Vertigo"" and ""Shopgirl""."

Don't get me wrong, it did surprise me - but only by becoming more dull than initially anticipated. <br/><br/>They had a lot they could have worked with.

I know this is not the case for every one, so please do not take offence). This type of film -- the type about desire, sex, human fallibility and insecurity in adult relationships, etc -- is much better demonstrated by Woody Allen, for example, who cleverly and honestly presents these themes in an engaging way. Try watching Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanours, Husbands and Wives, Manhattan, Annie Hall, Alice, and Another Woman. Also try reading his three one-act plays. To name a few others NOT by Woody Allen, that are perhaps more ""in the style"" of Closer, try Last Night, Blue Valentine, and Like Crazy. Admittedly, I didn't love any of these, but I thought they all still had a few things which Closer does not. Generally, they were much more enjoyable and realistic. One of the only things I found realistic in Closer was the tea drinking. <br/><br/>Also, if you haven't already, watch American Beauty (which I did love) for the same reasons (realistic, engaging, enjoyable, but also clever and well thought through, like Allen's films).<br/><br/>If you watch any of these films I have suggested you will hopefully see what I mean by saying that Closer is no match and cannot deserve anything more than 5/10 only because it is ""honest"". Newsflash, a lot of films these days are honest...because they're allowed to be. It does not make them good. <br/><br/>Side note: Perhaps the play that inspired the film is better, but I am only speaking about my opinion of the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it is not anything to get excited about, and it should-- if not be avoided--be watched as a last resort on a rainy afternoon with a box of wine..."

","To say that none of the main characters in this movie is really likable is an understatement to me. Yet, I have watched this film, many times. It moves me and I don't know why. Is it because it confirms a conclusion I hold about love, about romance? Maybe. Well, maybe that is the reason I like the film so much - it confirms my innermost viewpoint.<br/><br/>No one seems to be setting out to be a liar, a cheat. Do these people wake up one morning and decide to be deceitful little buggers? Doubtful. Sure, Buster is kind of weak and weaselly, Larry is kind of crude and maybe something of a manipulative bully. Alice and Anna are less well defined, their characters seem to be foils or opposites, but really not. That reads as garbled, but is meant to read as enigmatic. Because they are. But accepting. Enigmatic, but accepting.<br/><br/>Somehow, the paths they choose, the decisions they make, just creates a mess. To paraphrase a review I read somewhere, beautiful people behaving badly."
"K-nightt","8","1","2","24 May 2011"," A fended-off desire for intimacy
","In this film, the overarching story is one of futile sexuality, a sexuality that is used in a counter-intuitively destructive manner. Consummation is procured not with the intention of creating life, but of harming another person. And, as much as animalistic allusions are referred to and this seemingly incessant drive to reach a state of primitive ecstasy is echoed time and again, whenever sexual acts are described, they are done so in a dehumanized, emotionless manner, as if to say that they can only exist as an abstraction. This is reinforced by the fact that the acts are never actually shown, only talked about. Julia Roberts portrays perhaps the most tragic character of all, as she becomes the ""sad stranger"" in an ever-changing partner merry-go-round, yet, as Larry put it, she does not want to be happy, and has to compromise in order to avoid being swallowed by uncertainty. As she kisses Dan at the beginning of the film, her camera goes off, and she immediately stops she makes sad strangers look beautiful in photographs, and when her picture is taken, she runs the risk of looking beautiful, a threat which proves too big. Equally living in a psychogenic vortex is Dan himself, who pines for his mother every night and tries to sublimate this by engaging in intercourse with unknown women, he cannot risk becoming dependent on someone who may ultimately leave him (as parents almost inexorably do). He desires Anna ""because she doesn't need"" him. When he's on the computer talking to Larry, he personifies his conflict well. He cannot have the desired object, thus he must become the object, and control her fate he pretends to have an orgasm as Anna, yet says it was not good, closing in the fantasy that he is the only man who can provide Anna with a pleasurable sexual experience, he controls her orgasmic thrill, as it was. The movie's title tantalizingly denotes how at so many different points in the film one character is longing for a holding, comforting ""other"", yet this other is never in the same place. Scene after scene we observe one person crying and begging for some sign of mirroring affection, but crying is reproached by the detached party, in a sick fourth-dimensional mockery of human relations, yet one that is very accurate in showing that when one succumbs to the desire of the other (showing vulnerability, devotion, commitment), desire is killed. They are all spheres in themselves who are too afraid to touch because they may fuse, so an intellectualized verbal experience of intimacy is all they can hope for."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","2","15 March 2011"," Intriguing
","Closer is a mostly intriguing film, although really unpredictable. I didn't know what to expect of the film, and now that it has ended, I do't really know what it was made for, in terms of themes. I however do know that it was a very good film. It is never dull, and while the script and direction are flawed, there is still some really great dialogue in bits and pieces in this film. This is an actors' film, and in that department it does not disappoint. All four are incredible, and all have distinctive personality traits. However, the best scenes lie with both Clive Owen and Natalie Portman in their first meeting, and in the infamous strip club scene. Portman is actually the one who one is still not really sure of what type of person she is. She is uncompromising and very effective. Overall, really good film with some great scenes mixed in between, but it is also not as emotionally-challenging as it maybe wished it was."

","Six years after the movie release of Closer and 850+ reviews to sift though...I don't know how mine will be noticed so this is mostly for my own gratification and to help me remember.<br/><br/>I instantly loved Closer. It's so wonderful to experience a film that goes back to the basics: characters, great writing, focusing on dialogue. It's unusual nowadays. The way the characters all played off each other, the wordplay, and the verbally jousting, it was all exceptionally entertaining. I think we've really lost that in movies. It's very unusual to hear fantastic dialogue and to hear intelligent people interacting. From the witty things they say while seducing each other to the brutally honest things that we all think but don't necessarily say - it's all here. There are so many great lines and so many great scenes. The theme song, The Blower's Daughter, is perfect and represents the movie in a nutshell. <br/><br/>Be warned that this isn't a movie to share with the kids and it isn't for the faint of heart or for those who want a more standard romance to watch. There will be those that will be shocked by or upset by this film and find it offensive or difficult to watch.<br/><br/>Closer is an adaption of a play written by Patrick Marber. Cliven Owen actually performed this play in the original London stage production although at that time he was playing the character of Dan instead of Larry! It's impressive to see how well he was able to totally change his perspective and act so convincingly as Larry. After seeing Closer I really couldn't envision him being anyone else. The great thing about a movie vs. a play is that you don't have to shout your lines and it can feel that much more real and intimate.<br/><br/>While there may only be four characters to work with you get a deep dive into each of them. In my opinion this is all four actor's best work ever."

"suntingting1986","Null","1","2","28 April 2009"," A Profoudn Movie about Modern Love
","I don't understand the movie very well until I have seen it three times. It is one of the most difficult movies I have ever seen. <br/><br/>The plot device that there are several months between almost every scene leaves the audience much imagination about the development of the relationships among the characters, but it confused me a little at the beginning, because things in it moves so fast and suddenly. <br/><br/>Another reason for my difficulty in understanding it is that there are hidden deep meanings about love behind all the scenes. I have to try to figure them out. <br/><br/>The name of the movie, 'Closer', has something deeper behind it. Through the movie we can see that as people have desires they get closer to each other and fall in love with each other, just like Dan and Alice, Dan and Anna, Anna and Larry do in the movie. And once they are in love, they want to be even closer to each other. They think they should know more about the one they are in love with, especially his or her very private things. They think that it is a kind of faithfulness. But what turns up is that the more they get closer, the more easily they will get hurt. 'Being closer' may mean making each other far from each other. Being closer brings them together, and at the same time they break up due to the 'closer' and become strangers to each other. Isn't it an irony about love? We may learn from the movie a little bit that distance is needed in love. Distance makes things seem good in appearance and will prevent people from being hurt by the true reality.<br/><br/>The movie to some extent shows the differences in men's and women's values on love. Physical love is more important to men while women believe more in spiritual love. To men a betrayal is far more physical than spiritual. In the movie, when Dan knew Anna had slept with Larry before she came to him, he got wildly angry and deserted her, whereas Anna did so only in order to be together with Dan. She thought spiritual love is more important. This movie is mainly about modern love itself. At the end, both men have sex with both women; occasionally as a round trip back to the woman they started with. There is no constancy in this crowd: When they're not with the one they love, they love the one they're with. Modern love seems to be more about sex than true love. Perhaps betrayal is becoming (or already has become) a custom in modern times. Maybe none of them are ever in love at all, although they are always saying they are. Love in the movie isn't like a warm fire, but just cold water. They are just what we need after we have read too many beautiful love tales. We can get ourselves something cruel and real about modern love through this movie. Maybe they all know they love each other, but this is just the reason why they get hurt from each other, so till the end they can't find out they are lovers or just strangers. Isn't it an irony when Dan finds he even doesn't know Alice's real name? Were they lovers or just strangers? In the name of 'Love', they all became liars and actors and actresses. What a pity! what love in Modern times it is!"

","In London, pretty stripper Natalie Portman (as Alice Ayres) is struck by a car. Injured, but not fatally, she opens her eyes to see an handsome stranger - he's business-suited obituary writer Jude Law (as Dan Woolf). The attractive twosome begin satisfying sexual urges. Ms. Portman helps inspire Mr. Law's sexy novel. Then, beautiful photographer Julia Roberts (as Anna Cameron) takes Law's picture for his book jacket. Soon, Ms. Roberts and Law are fighting off (temporarily) sexual urges. Next, during a moment alone, Law engages in a laptop sex chat with attractive dermatologist Clive Owen (as Larry Gray). Posing as ""Anna"", Law arranges a sex date for Mr. Owen and Roberts. Eventually, Owen hooks up with Portman.<br/><br/>A Mike Nichols-directed film version of Patrick Marber's sex play sure sounds promising. But, with the possible exception of the brief, and more modernly sensible Portman/Owens coupling, the relationships don't really work. The characters have very little understanding regarding love and sexual gratification, despite having a great deal of the latter. It's nearly impossible to care about what they feel. ""Closer"" is certainly well-performed, however. Owen wins the acting honors, by a hair; demonstrating great versatility, he starred in the original play, but in Law's role, as ""Dan"".<br/><br/>******* Closer (2004) Mike Nichols ~ Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen"

It's tragic yet brilliant and even though I can't see anything like that happening personally to someone the characters are so realistic and cruel that it's just incredible. I don't think it matters which actors did the best, Jude or Natalie, Clive or Julia? They are all superb,(and good looking) actors. I'm depressed whenever I watch it but felt I could relate to it at the same time. It's so worthwhile to watcht, if you don't mind graphic scenes and want a change from all the lovey dovey fake stuff that other films crap out, what are you waiting for? Rush down to Blockbuster.

","Closer is a brutal, uncompromising, sometimes quite witty but most importantly a very sober examination of relationships.<br/><br/>Expertly performed by a top notch cast, their characters feel real and authentic in their bravery and utmost cowardice. While the characters aren't fully fleshed out they seem very authentic and may even provoke viewers to examine their own personal lives. The dialog, while pretty rough at times, is also spot on.<br/><br/>You really don't know who to hate and who to sympathize with and that's the beauty of the film. The people are so flawed and most likely you're left pitying them instead of despising them. Seldom has a film about relationships left me so stunned and yet so speechless. I find it very hard to put into words why it moves me so. Watching these people rip the guts out of one another in this dry fashion is indeed very sobering.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film but, admittedly, you have to be in the mood for it."

","I am not maybe writing a useful comment for those who didn't see the movie. Its August 2008, the film has been released 4 years ago. I saw it in 2005- and enjoyed it, and I switched on the TV last night and was happy to sit and watch it, again, for the 3rd time actually. And not so many movies that you see again and again and even like them more, the more you watch and older you get.<br/><br/>A great film about relationships (love, sex, betrayal, etc). I think Closer, together with Eyes Wide Shut are among the very important and great movies that deal with relationships, in our time. One is set in NY, the other in London- well, last scene again in NY.<br/><br/>The acting is So strong and they all fit together. Little things that you appreciate more as you watch again and again. The scene where Alice and Dan are breaking up, after confessing his affair with Anna. This scene is just great. the lines here- and through out the whole movie are just great. Portman delivers a great performance. when she asks him if he brought her to their house, then she says ""you are a piece of sh!t"" she is amazing. then when she asks him if he still fancies her. Again the scene where Anna is telling her husband about her affair, where he is asking her how the sex was. so realistic, and so well done. when he asks her if they had sex at their place and where.. then she pauses, swallows, and say ""there.."" (and I am not a big fan of Roberts). Clive is great as well. Portman in the room at the strip club.. her lines and her performance. when she keeps saying Thank You. (and she is adorable as well) the whole cast just fit together and have great chemistry that you can't believe that they all actually didn't fall in love or had crushes on each other. The editing is great, the rhythm and pace of the film. Everything just makes you sit and enjoy, and feel respected by the makers of this film. In some weak(e r) movies, the lines are misleading or not making much sense that you don't buy it at the end of the movie. Here, you finish watching and start wondering about the characters real emotions, motives, if they really did this and that, if they meant so and so.. so much to analyze and think about. The characters are 3 dimensional. and complex.<br/><br/>The film starts with the Line ""Hello Stranger"" It closes with ""Welcome back Ms Jones""<br/><br/>The last scene with Portman- such a beauty- crossing 47th street in Manhattan, the lights are-again- red... it all might start over again..!? Perfection.<br/><br/>Thank you. Thank you for your honesty. Now f k off and die, you f k d up slag."

The love stories are complicated as real life is, and the language is strong and straight forward. It doesn't flower the subject, that's for sure.. and that's why the movie is so interesting.<br/><br/>The cast is amazing. I don't like Julia Roberts that much, but she gets her job done beautifully despite being outshone in every scene by the other actors. Jude Law is great. But Clive Owen and Natalie Portman are breath taking. Their characters are the most complicated, but they really captured their essence! Clive Owen as the rude Larry, who despite it's manners is the character I liked the best, because he's the most honest and human one. Natalie Portman is simply amazing. She plays a character so complex, that everyone sympathizes with her immediately.<br/><br/>So remember, this is not a pretty romance. It has no flowers or sunshines... Only emotions!

","From Golden Globe nominated director Mike Nichols (The Graduate, The Birdcage) this is one of the most interesting and open dramas I've seen in ages, all about relationships, and with only four big stars, no need for other supporting characters. Basically young writer Dan (Jude Law) saw a young woman (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Natalie Portman) walking the opposite direction, and not being used to cars driving the other direction she gets hit by a car. She wakes up, and after all the check ups for health, on a bus she introduces herself as Alice Ayres, and she reveals she is a stripper from New York City coming to London to leave a bad relationship. Before they say goodbye to each other, she asks if he has a girlfriend, and he says ""yes"". One year later, Dan is having his photo taken by American photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), Dan and Alice are living together, and Dan has written a romantic novel about his life with Alice (the photo is part of that). Anna mentions that she likes to go to the aquarium and possibly take photos of people, and she reveals to Dan she is separated from her husband. They do go into a kiss, but it ends when he mentions his girlfriend, and soon enough the doorbell rings, it's Alice, and she heard their conversation on the intercom, so instead of slapping Dan, she asks Anna to take her picture. Later, Dan is in his apartment on his computer, in a sex chat room, he's logged on as a woman for a joke, and he's met another man named Larry (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Clive Owen), after some pretty 'serious' flirting, dirty and sexy talk, Dan, or rather ""Anna"" tells Larry to meet him/her at the aquarium. Anna is there, but Larry is embarrassed to know that he has been duped. Four months later, Dan and Alice are going to Anna's art exhibition, and Dan's father has died, he is going to the funeral after the exhibition. Alice sees her own portrait, and there meets Larry, and she learns in their chat that him and Anna are dating, Dan though still has feelings for Anna, oh, and his book failed. Another year later, Dan admits to Alice he's having an affair with Anna, and the same time, Anna and Larry, now married, Larry admits to sleeping with a prostitute on his trip, and she tells of her affair with Dan. Six months later, Larry enters a strip club for a drink, and spots Alice as a stripper, so he arranges a private dance (no touching) and chat, he finds it very frustrating that with a camera watching them they cannot express feelings properly. Another few months later, Anna and Dan meet (late) at a music concert, and she and Lary have finalised their divorce, but she revealed that he only signed after she slept with him. Another few months later, Dan reveals to Larry in his office Anna has left him, and she is apparently back with Larry, and Larry tells Dan he slept with Alice. Alice wants to go back to New York, and after many denials Alice tells the truth about her and Larry sleeping together, and after a while it goes to New York where she is there by herself. Dan remained in London, and he sees a grave name on the wall 'Alice Ayres', and we see her real name as she hands over her passport, the name she repeated to Larry in the strip club when he asked her, Jane Jones, and it ends with her walking down the street again. Phew! All four stars have their moments, when I said it was an open film, I meant when they are talking their sexual stuff, e.g. the great sex talk chat on the computer, Roberts talking about having sex and Dan's cock taste (yikes). It is rare to see stars of their types talking dirty, and two Americans doing it in a British film is even better. It may not have been easy to keep up with the time periods, and the various relationships of the four characters can get complicated, but not a bad film. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Worth watching!"

The actors are more than great, their talent does not need any exaggeration to fit the role.

Julia Roberts particularly impresses in a complete subversion of her usual bright, breezy likable screen persona. Here is she anxiety-stricken, brittle, bitchy. It was some surprise to me that award-recognition was not forthcoming here. Doubtlessly, the difficult thematics of the film probably negated any potential commendation.<br/><br/>Marber seems to be making the point that in our technologically strong world it is we human beings who lose out. Struggling to find love in a barren century, our humanity is eroded, leaving only sin. Without love, we are nothing.<br/><br/>'Closer' is a very difficult film to watch. There are no likable characters and bleakness pervades this 21st century world. I could not watch it again. This film is not entertainment, more a blow to the thinking mind.

"johnnyboyz","5","1","2","5 November 2006"," As the film wears on, the script and plot wear off.
","This film was a huge disappointment. The cast was heavy with Hollywood stars and although I'm not really into following actors and actresses' lives and keeping in touch with what they're latest films are, I at least knew each of the four faces in the film. Funnily enough, though, this is actually one of the numerous things that contribute to Closer's downfall.<br/><br/>Although the beginning and most of the actual film is clean cut and very sharp, everything seems a little too fast; the dialogue, camera and characters snap back at one another before we've even got a chance to absorb what they've just said. This is a persistent annoyance with Closer. During some of the scenes you actually ask your self just what in the hell is actually going on. The film starts off fairly simply but launches itself into a barrage of double crosses, broken hearts and false promises the characters make between themselves. This got very confusing and the dialogue did start to falter here once it realised that it needed to string together some actual DIALOGUE rather than meaningless, romantic clap trap two people spout to one another. I had to ask myself 'If they weren't big-shot Hollywood actors, would I really give a hell!?' <br/><br/>When the film runs out of steam a little after about 30 and 70 minutes respectively, the character Dan (Law) seems to just suddenly, from absolutely nowhere, come out with a crazy revelation that turns the film completely on its head and starts it down another road. At one point, he admits to something to the person he supposedly loves and then that, itself, spawns another series of events that are completely random and just seem forced. This felt like a cheap get out clause in the script and I felt rather insulted that the film would use such an underhand, weak plot point to boost the film along. This is actually where the story falls apart and 'Closer', as I said, slowly contributes to its own downfall.<br/><br/>Like I said; if they weren't Hollywood big-shots, would we even care? What if they were nobody actors acting on a shoestring budget? This film would have disappeared the day after it was released.<br/><br/>As the film enters its home straight, I kind of lost count at the amount of times each character told each other that they loved them. The script seemed to be constructed around the principal of: 'I love you. Pardon? I love you. Pardon? I love you. Pardon? I love you. Pardon?' and I actually starting laughing out loud whenever Larry (Owen) or Anna (Roberts) said this phrase as it was utterly pathetic. Clearly, none of these characters love each other at all.<br/><br/>Although I would have loved to have given this film a lower rating, the actors do well with the worn script that they're given and I'm not going to grumble too much at a film that has a particularly long scene involving Natalie Portman scantly dressed as a stripper but Closer really doesn't deserve the plaudits its getting nor does it the ones that it's already received."

And as far as the romance, it's not clear why any of them would be interested in the other. They're all selfish and totally consumed by their own dysfunctions. Some critics have called them true-to-life characters in realistic relationships. I certainly hope not. If I ever came across any of these people in real-life, I wouldn't waste my time. And I recommend that you do the same with this movie. (Rating: 4/10)"

","This movie tries to do a lot. It tries to be thought provoking, it tries to be raw, it tries to be deep and it tries to be brutally honest. It was not truly any of things. The dialogue was forced and contrived, attempts to be profound merely come off as beautiful, spoilt people displaying their idiotic and warped notions of life, formularized to the last drop.<br/><br/>The film is so horribly self conscious it made me grimace to watch it, it was as though the only thought given to the film was that raw automatically equals artistic quality. I hate to say it, but it does not. A soulless and sterile movie that is void of any depth, despite far too obvious attempts to the contrary.<br/><br/>It is the Da Vinci Code of films; garbage that is made to appeal to the pseudo intellectuals."

","The basic story behind CLOSER could have been used as the premise for a romantic comedy or even a farce. There are four main characters: two men, a writer and a doctor, and two women, a photographer and a waitress/stripper. First the writer and the waitress/stripper are a couple, then the doctor and the photographer meet and eventually marry, and then over the years the characters migrate back and forth.<br/><br/>But this doesn't resolve itself with eternal fidelity in rose covered cottages. These characters are looking for something, and we don't know what it is because they don't.<br/><br/>The four leads are awesome, especially Julia Roberts. This screenplay and Mike Nichols's direction bring out qualities in her that have remained hidden until this film.<br/><br/>My only gripe was that it was hard to keep track of the passage of years as the story progressed. Maybe this was more concrete in the stage version. To a certain extent this could be measured by Natalie Portman's constantly changing styles and colors of hair.<br/><br/>But that may be a good thing because it makes the viewer work to keep up with things.<br/><br/>Some people have commented that the endless switching back and forth of mates would only take place in a big city: the film, except for a coda in New York, takes place in London. This implies that 'in our little town' relations aren't as complicated as this. If you say so, but my years of living tell me otherwise.<br/><br/>A nice grownup movie, rare these days. I saw SUPERMAN RETURNS this afternoon, then watched CLOSER on video tonight. In a few days the man of steel's adventures will have faded from my mind, but CLOSER gives the viewer a lot to think about even after it's over."

","The director Mike Nichols has managed to entertain us for years with nice romantic comedies and dramas (The Graduate, Working Girl). But now he has come to 21th century with mind blowing piece ""Closer"".<br/><br/>The story is a modern love-triangle but this time there is four attendants. Dan (gorgeous Jude Law) sees Alice (fresh and impressive Natalie Portman). They have a obstacle. After that they fall in love. Later Dan meets an attractive photographer Anna (Julia Roberts). There is some serious chemistry between them. As Dan cannot get Anna he makes a practical joke on the internet with Anna's expense. Joke starts to live its own life after Anna meets doctor Larry (charismatic Clive Owen). Time flies by and the four keeps running to each other. There is a lot of deceiving, infidelity, passion and regret. The ending is so mind blowing it'll haunt you a long time after seeing the film! The movie is like todays relationship pattern in a nutshell. Do you really know the person who you are with? Why there is always have to be other people involved. The great thing about ""Closer"" is that you get closer to the truth as time goes by. The movie is so intense and intimate. There isn't a lot of actors in this film but the buzz a hell of a lot more. Nichols' directing is straightforward and minimalistic. ""Closer"" is beautiful and it rejuvenates the genre of triangle romance.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman and Clive Owen make roles of their life's. Owen is seriously desperate and bloody brilliant. Portman is seductive and interesting. Julia Roberts and Jude Law do good job but I would have liked to see some other actress to play Anna. But Roberts is suitable because Anna is a bit impassioned and stiff. Roberts was far from stiff when she took the Oscar-winning part in Erin Brochovich! Haunting ending music ""The Blower's Daughter"" by Damien Rice makes you stay with ""Closer"" for days after watching the film. It is so breath-taking beautiful! ""If you believe the love at first sight, you never stop looking"""
"moonshield342","10","1","2","11 April 2006"," A masterpiece
","I saw Closer for the first time about 7 or 8 months ago. I was in a relationship at the time, and I admired the film for it's accuracy in depicting the lies we tell ourselves, and the ones we are closest to. That relationship ended a week before Christmas - I was dumped. I bought the DVD a few weeks later, and my view of this film was changed entirely.<br/><br/>I'm only 16, but every thought and feeling that transpired throughout my relationship (and it's end) was expressed in Closer. I had only been able to relate to certain scenes before, but after the breakup, the film gained new meaning as I individually connected with each character's thought's, feelings, emotions, and even their dirty schemes. However, the film's most important point is never stated, and I understood it the first time I watched it - it's not about love, but what we settle for when love has nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>The characters are shockingly deceptive and manipulative. Every relationship is self-effacing, in the respect that they only want the person they're with as long as they're satisfied with them. If true love had any place in this story, then the characters would have never had the desire to leave the person they're with for somebody else. Therefore, the illusion of love has to be kept, which leads to shameless deception and a painful outcome. The only character who might have actually been in love would be Alice, but her needy personality could easily project that illusion, even for me.<br/><br/>To call Closer a love story is a misjudgement, and I suspect Patrick Marber knew that when he was writing it. True love has no place in this film, as it doesn't with most relationships we're in, even when we say it does. We find emotional support and personal gratification when we're with somebody, but how often do we find ourselves with people we truly love? Don't we always say we do, even if we don't? The illusion of love will do for most of us, and that's what Closer is all about.<br/><br/>P.S. I am personally offended that Patrick Marber didn't receive a Best Adapted Screenplay nomination for this. Who did they nominate that year, anyway?"

","From the moment Natalie Portman emerged, pacing down a London street with supremacy, intention, attitude, I was hooked to Closer. Portman's 'look but don't touch' premise the essence of super nature, the vision of a passing figure, haunting.<br/><br/>Closer is the story of two couples, whose lives intersect when Dan (Law), boyfriend to Alice (Portman) has an affair with photographer Anna (Roberts), married to Larry (Owen).<br/><br/>Director Mike Nichols makes each insight into the couples' relationship seem like an intrusion, laced with an intense voyeurism absent in many current dramatisations. Nichols exploits the shadiness of the characters by hovering, harrowingly intent on flaunting their flaws until, by the end, we can't stand the sight of them. Although Closer tackles relationships not dissimilar from your average soap opera, it tackles the relationships in a fairly unique way. It isn't happy. It isn't melodramatic. It's dark, cold, and feels somewhat taboo in its graphic and direct representation. Everything is laid out on a plate, and fed to you in small but sharp doses.<br/><br/>The main difference in Closer's approach to issues of infidelity is in its socio-realist techniques, led by a hefty amount of swearing and shouting, much more than you would expect to see in a movie of this genre and subject matter. It's clear that this is supposed to give their relationships an authenticity, but for Closer to be realistic, it needs to have characters who can conceivably be regarded as real - it doesn't. All four seem more like robots, programmed to exchange intelligent dialogue that contradicts their personalities and actions. The truth is: nobody is this upfront, and nobody is this transparent.<br/><br/>Owen has the task of dishing out most of the aggression and most of the volume as a jealous and possessive husband. Of all the characters, his is the most showiest, and is used when Nichols particularly wants to hammer home a portion of severity. Owen is at his level best here, as the graphic interrogation he gives his wife seems genuinely emotive from the perspective of a sex-obsessed, power-driven ego. Roberts withstands this barrage, and though she deserves every bit of the tirade, succeeds in unsettling the viewer with her shocked glances, and horrific displeasure, reflecting his irrational tone.<br/><br/>Still, Closer's failure lies in the belief that Owen has any sexual magnetism whatsoever. He is the most blatant, the least attractive, and his character isn't even funny. Law and Roberts are just as sleazy, if a little more foolish. Thankfully, we can return to the incandescent Portman and her lingering prowess. Although her role appears as much of a fleeting visit as the film itself, she is the only one that has a consistent idea about love, allbeit a distinctly immature one.<br/><br/>The film beckons you closer, but it's actually extraordinarily shallow. There's nothing to see. The characters are so close that you can see straight through them. I can accept that life is shallow, what I can't accept is that life is this obvious and this clear-cut. The heart may be 'a fist wrapped in blood', but as much as love hurts, there is no love in Closer."
"kellydlt","2","1","2","9 April 2006"," What is it with Julia and Jude?
","The only saving grace in this movie is Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. I'm so sick of Julia and Jude. Why do they keep getting roles, especially her. Her pretty woman days are over. It's ironic that they choose one of Hollywood's most promiscuous female and male. Jude can't seem to keep his wood in his pants and Julia likes to make married men the object of her affection. Now that I think about, these people made their adulterous roles believable because this is what they exhibit in their everyday lives. It pisses me off that this movie is so twisted that everyone still gets what they want in the end, especially Julia. This movie sets the tone that cheating is OK, as long as you still want to be in the relationship. What a crock!"
"isabelle1955","Null","1","2","27 March 2006"," Tedious and self indulgent
","Closer disappointed me. It's one of those irritating movies about self obsessed, clever, cruel people who apparently never want for money and who have nothing better to do with their time than mess up their lives. Gosh, where did that come from? As Yoda might have said, ""Move me, it did not."" In truth, this movie did nothing for me except make me sigh with frustration. Because I think with some sharper editing and tauter writing it could have been a lot better. Still not great, but at least passable. I disliked all 4 of the major players, although Natalie Portman was certainly the least irritating of the group. And this movie managed to achieve the rare distinction of making me rather ashamed to be a Brit! Take it from me, not all British men are quite the immature, manipulative, dysfunctional w*&%^rs portrayed here by Clive Owen and Jude Law. Some but not all. I watched this on DVD at home, and almost switched off before the end, something I hate to do, as I take some kind of perverse pleasure in sticking it out, no matter how dire the movie. I guess it's the grown up movie-goer's equivalent of being told to clean your plate as a child. But I mean, who really gives a toss about any of this lot? Possibly the characters in the original play were more engaging, but I failed to engage with any of these.<br/><br/>The basic story has Julia Roberts playing Anna, a depressive (and depressing) photographer, who falls for Dan (Jude Law) but marries Larry (Clive Owen) while Portman plays the ex-stripper Alice / Jane who for some reason I never quite fathomed, adores Dan but may or may not have had a fling with Larry while working as a Pole Dancer. With me so far? Good. We see them split, come together, split again all in a totally humourless way, and by that time I just wanted to pick the lot of them up and bang their collective heads against a wall. If this is supposed to be a look at the love lives of post-ironic, ""smart"" people, all I can say is 'Thank God I'm Stupid"". I may have had relationships as bad as this, but at least I could enliven the proceedings with a good drunken row occasionally or a hearty bout of hysterical crying. These guys are trying to be so cool and mature, but end up simply being cold and passé. And doesn't anybody ever laugh at themselves in this super trendy, smart world of interconnected love lives? In short, this film is badly conceived rather than badly made, and should probably be avoided unless you are an uncritical obsessive fan of one of the leads. And although I like Natalie Portman and could be won over by Clive Owen (very good in Gosford Park and simply stunning in Inside Man), I remain puzzled as to the appeal of Law and Roberts. Especially here."

","I recently watched this movie again and was stunned that I'd forgotten how good it is. As I watched it, it occurred to me (without any prior knowledge of it) that this must have been adapted from a play. This is real acting and not just Hollywood magic. The characters are captivating and *human* - obsessive, insecure, vulnerable and yes, at times nasty. This is not a glossed-over, Disnified story of what love and relationships should be like.<br/><br/>It's funny, because this movie now rates among my top 5 favourite movies and yet my best friend said that she absolutely hated it because it portrays such a cynical view of love. Well, you know what? There are plenty of cynics out there. There are plenty of people who have asked their cheating lovers the dirty details of the affair, and just as many who obsess over their loves in the darkest manner.<br/><br/>On the other hand, my friend also listens to the ""Soft Hits and Love Songs"" radio station while I prefer the Smiths. I suppose in the end, this movie isn't for you if you refuse to look at the world without your rose coloured glasses."

","Closer is a story of four people, love and lust. First we meet Dan (Jude Law) and Alice (Natalie Portman) who accidentally run into each other in London. After a while we meet a photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) who becomes an obsession to Dan. Dan's obsession accidentally leads Anna to meet Larry (Clive Owen), who eventually get married. Love, lust and lies surround the lives of these four young people - but who in the end was the biggest liar? <br/><br/>Closer is a well-written story with professional and charismatic cast. The two above all else are Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. Their work in this movie is incredible. Clive Owen - such a nice and charming man in many of his other movies - releases his dark side and shows how disgusting men can really be. His portrayal of the Doctor Larry is brilliantly ugly.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman shows she can be something else than just Queen Amidala of Naboo (Star Wars Episodes 1-3). Her character is the youngest of the four, but she brings Alice the same kind of warmth, but toughness and also professional touch she showed as Mathilda in Leon.<br/><br/>Closer is an amazing movie, even though some parts are not pretty. It brings forward the dark side of people, the side that is usually kept hiding. As a story it is tough, but the revelation in the end lightened up the story a bit, making things something different than the viewer is made originally think.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie when you're depressed, or are having difficulties with your partner!"

It was just hard to comprehend the attraction of these people to each other... if that had come through better it would have made much more sense.... the plot would have come together better had someone besides Julia been cast... she just didn't come across as that desirable by either fellow... she seemed sullen and wronged through the whole movie...never a prize that both these men clamored for...it must have just been a marketing move by the movie execs because she seemed so depressed the whole movie and never desirable!"

","I was warned about 'Closer"" by my Best Friend, she told me the content was far too 'risque' for my pure ears. However, by accident, I switched on the TV, and caught the part when Alice was stripping for Larry, Alice being absolutely gorgeous!. I was curious as to the outcome and saw the end, it did not make much sense to me. A week later, on a Saturday morning, I caught the beginning, especially the chat on the internet - I have never heard anything like that before on TV, - or in real life. Again I only caught half of the film. Then, I managed to see it complete some 2 days later. When I realised the storyline, and pieced together all the actor's parts that they portrayed, I only then started to understand the complexities of the relationships. You have to watch it at least 3 times to start to understand the characters, and the way that they all mesh together, culminating in the tragic ending, after 4 years of loving someone, Dan didn't even know Alice's real name - plain Jane! It is absolutely fascinating the way the writer has interwoven the four characters. How Alice, really and truly is the most sincere, and yet comes across as the 'sleeziest'. How Larry says he can forgive, but totally ruins everybody's lives around him. Anna is so weak, that she cannot leave Larry and be happy with herself, and Dan just doesn't know where to go, or who to be with.<br/><br/>If ever there is film that makes me think about relationships, it is 'Closer'. I also have to say that the title song is especially haunting, I found myself singing it over and over again, until in the end I had to get the DVD, the best thing I could have done! Considering I don't have a DVD player, I shall just have to go around my friends, watch it with them, explain the storyline, for the thousandth time, and lose myself in the Closer characters. Unforgettable and Unbelievable, Thank You!."
"AZINDN","5","1","2","15 December 2005"," Love and Lust Among the Beautiful People
","Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" is a stage play that never looses the feeling of short stories strung together and edited in a somewhat displaced chronology of bits between stripper Alice (Natalie Portman), writer Dan (Jude Law), photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), and dermatologist, Larry (Clive Owen). That no one is less that stunning and beautiful in this film is a credit to the casting of four actors who have chops behind their chiseled jaws and perfect profiles. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives an eyeful of her adult regions for the screen in the easily most watchable section of the film. She has long outgrown the little girl of The Professional and her maturity as an actor is exceptional for those expecting a Star Wars ingenue. Equally outstanding is Clive Owen who played both the roles of Dan on stage and Larry for the film. His dark handsomeness and intensity over the disintegrating relationship with his wife (Julia Roberts) is both territorial and frantic. One can easily relate to his anguish and anger at his wife's straying.<br/><br/>Although given top billing, Julia Roberts plays the least likable character as a passive- aggressive photographer whose brief fling with Jude Law reflects the press attention to the actor's recent notorious behaviour. Law seem totally comfortable with the portrayal of cad, a role that has all too many associations with his real life drama that eeks its way into the performance.<br/><br/>Dialogues on fidelity, infidelity, love, and sex are the majority of conversations between characters that begins to sound preachy. Often cruel in its harshness, the relationships of these ""adults"" is vicious sparing between men too crude for Sex In The City, and too harsh for reality TV. As a slow moving storyline jumps between temporal frames, it barely moves the action forward in uneven pacing. Although the majority testosterone waving happens between revengeful Larry and Dan, a callous pretty boy who writes obituaries, the only scene between the two women early in the film is easily the choice confrontation of a wronged woman meeting the guilt- ridden slut.<br/><br/>Sometimes the truth is too much information in relationships and neither Larry or Dan have learned that fact to the detriment of their women swapping relationships. Dissatisfaction, unhappiness, and inability to trust seems to unravel these shallow relationships as well as bore the audience to tears. While some may label this film art, it is not exactly ""art"" as ""mature,"" and its adult storyline falls short of interest as none of the characters are worthy of audience attention for the entire duration of the film. If long and boring but attractive is substance, Nichols' ""Closer"" fills the bill."
"jpschapira","7","1","2","13 December 2005"," ""I can't take my eyes off you""
","The first minutes of ""Closer"", which involve two individuals staring at each other at the rhythm of a song that reminds me of the woman I love are so tender; so captivating, that they make you think you're going to watch the most romantic movie of your life. The thing is you're not.<br/><br/>It's beyond imagination where words go, or what words can do. If ""Closer"" knows about something, it's about words. About how to say them, when, and of course, inevitably, why. Patrick Marber's screenplay is brilliant, even when his words are far from spontaneity, because the only point is that they are spoken.<br/><br/>When Alice (Natalie Portman) talks to Dan (Jude Law) for the first time, she only speaks two words: ""Hello stranger"". This will be a trademark for the whole film and in other words, a reminder or a sign that actually every word counts. Later on, Alice asks Dan, a frustrated writer who writes obituaries that include euphemisms, to tell her what would her euphemism be: ""She was disarming"", he says.<br/><br/>The other two characters (there are only four characters in the film) are Anna (Julia Roberts) and Larry (Clive Owen), who meet accidentally on purpose and fall in love, then get married. On the other hand Alice and Dan live together, love each other; actions simply described that lie in the standards of life.<br/><br/>But ""Closer"" doesn't like simple, and explores each detail of these standards so profoundly, so intensely, in a way I've never experienced in a movie before. Yes, there are lot of movies of this type, but ""Closer"" was a play, therefore there's no sense of time in the movie, which makes it shameless.<br/><br/>And shamelessly, characters come and go whenever they please. Shamelessly they fall in love lots of times and they do it very fast; shamelessly they screw each other so constantly that they don't even notice it, and disgracefully speak at each other with words that touch even the silence that embraces them.<br/><br/>So I go back to my main argument, because this movie is about love, but no in the lovable way, because you can't love the characters because of their actions; there's not even one of them that seems to be doing things right. And you certainly can't love the film, that is good but leaves you unsatisfied and empty when it's over.<br/><br/>However, there are things you can love; like the performances. This is the kind of movie where actors get the chance of showing off, taking big risks and carrying their talents to the maximum level. Natalie Portman takes every chance, in what's her most skillful and complete portrayal. Julia Roberts is at the top of her game (like if we didn't know she's a superstar), Jude Law reminds us how moving an actor can be, while Clive Own creates, dedicatedly, the film's most sympathetic and concerned character.<br/><br/>You can also love Mike Nichols, because the credit is not all Patrick Marber's; and the German director, with 72 years at that time, directed his actors amazingly, in all these different places, these silences and musical moments, close-ups and still shots, maintaining his reputation of commitment with the work.<br/><br/>""And so it is, just like you said it would be, life goes easy on me, most of the time"". You will find the movie hard to follow, because it becomes tedious and repetitive in occasions. It's not great, but it's confident and sure, as you will be after watching it, at least about one thing: that love hurtsA lot."

","This film is the ""anti- romantic comedy/drama."" Not that it is without any type of love story. Closer is a contemporary, adult film about what we really see, feel, and go through in relationships.<br/><br/>Closer strikes a cord from the beginning. The weeping strings from the films lead song, ""The Blower's daughter"" by Damien Rice, should be playing in instrumental form throughout the entire film. But the song will only appear to be weeping at the films conclusion. (when you see the film, you will know what I mean.) For anyone that's ever loved and lost, (and we all have) if the feeling from that loss lingers, this film will cut like a knife. And the sincerity displayed by the wonderful Natalie Portman will break your heart time and time again.<br/><br/>Being that this film is more about the ""dark times"" we encounter while riding the relationship roller coaster, I don't know if this is something you see with your girlfriend/boyfriend. Or maybe I say that because I was without one when I saw the film. It was so good, I paid to see it twice in the theater. Closer will have something that just about everyone who has ever been in love can relate to."

As a four-hander, I couldn't even imagine how it could be translated into a film, let alone retain the impact of the original. It succeeded on every level.<br/><br/>Closer has the ability to take you on an intense and emotional journey with the characters whilst leaving you in the same place as you started.

After Dan helps Alice in an accident he uses her in a novel. A year later Dan is photographed by Anna. They share a kiss. Later, through an internet chat-site prank, Dan gets Alice together with Larry. In the following year they get married and Dan and Alice are together. Here on follows a series of intense break ups and confrontations.<br/><br/>Closer is a very black, intriguing comedy/drama. The performances in this movie a brilliant. Natalie Portman is stunning as Alice. Her character is beautiful, deceiving and very kind. Portman's portrayal is great.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts is very good as Alice, a very interesting character. She invests her role with such a haunted chill you can't imagine anyone wanting to be with her.<br/><br/>Jude Law is quite good as Dan. His character is restless and pathetic, sad and sadistic and is always a crushed romantic.<br/><br/>Finally, Clive Owen is pretty much flawless as Larry, a very mean, sadistic, heartless character.<br/><br/>This film has some very intense dialogue. There is a certain internet chat-site scene between Dan and Larry that is very comical but extremely crude. Some of confrontations scenes are very harsh. I have never heard the word cum used that much in any movie I have seen. This movie is very entertaining and is almost flawless.

","The beautiful thing about Closer is that you can either love it, or hate it. The people who loved it can relate to one or all of the characters, the story, the situation. The people who hate it still believe that all relationships are the way the romantic comedies portray them- as fluffy fairy tales. Its not a movie for everyone. The beauty in this movie is the dialogue, its gritty, honest, and bare bones. I think that its a honest look at the dark sides of people and what they do to each other in relationships. Its not meant to be funny, exciting, or happy. Its meant to be a no holds barred look at the language we use with each other, about sex, about love, lust, and how we look at ourselves. Each character has their own neuroses, their own glamour, their own mantras. For the people that recognize this movie for what it is, looks at it and can see parts of themselves in each character. We have been that young girl, acting grown up, trying to survive in a world that pays more to see our bodies than cherish our minds. We have been the person who is lost, never seeming to be happy, afraid of what our happiness might bring or the person who loves the hardest, and the person always looking for the next big affair, taking love for granted. Its supposed to make you uncomfortable, its supposed to make you reflect on your own life."

","In reading the other comments about this film, I see a lot of clichés being tossed about like 'adult', 'mature', 'riviting', 'provacative', 'real' and so on.<br/><br/>The subject matter and frankness about that subject matter was certainly not something you would want a child to see...but that does not necessarily translate into a 'mature' picture. In my estimation, it dealt with four morally flawed characters who acted like a bunch of over dramatic middle schoolers switching boyfriends/girlfriends, only with a lot of sex talk thrown in.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst thing about this movie was the presentation of the story was very disjointed. It's one thing when subtle clues are added to accentuate the story, but having to 'guess' or realize ""oh, it's a year later"" detracts from telling the story. Don't get me wrong, I don't need a musical montage with characters frolicking in the park, flying news papers or a crossed off calendar to tell me time has passed, but just flipping the scene and five minutes into it dropping its a year later doesn't do it either.<br/><br/>Even with 'subtle clues', if not for looking at the IMDb before the movie I would not have realized the character was lying about her name! And quite frankly, I would not have cared.<br/><br/>Had the movie been made better, I can say that I might have at least been entertained while watching it. But between trying to figure out what was going on in the story and trying to discern what the two guys were saying it was painful."

I think much of this movies power comes from the fact that most of us can relate to each and every character and have probably been in many of the same conversations in our lives. Love, Jealousy, Honesty, Infidelity, Sincerity, Sadness, Longing, are laid out in this film like an existential experience as if we are seeing how our own choices and emotions effect ours and our loves ones lives.<br/><br/>A really powerful flick without any bells and whistles due to the great acting, dialog, and directing."

"plaidoj","2","1","2","21 October 2005"," A shameless mockery of human suffering
","People who say that 'Closer' is an accurate depiction of love, guilt, and suffering have obviously never been anywhere near such things. The story is told through vignettes, which allow for a long period of time to pass (four years in this case) without bogging down the plot. However, such minimalism allows for almost no character development. I really don't care about any of the characters on the screen because they all seem to self-important to even see past their own noses, let alone see the other characters.<br/><br/>The characters offer no explanations for their actions. The scenes are cut before we can see the aftermath. What we get is a few months later, when they've had a chance to heal, a chance to forget, a chance to move on. There is no depth. There is no despair. There is only the quick release and clever dialog to avoid feeling anything.<br/><br/>If you want despair, watch Julianne Moore in 'The Hours,' crying in the bathroom while telling John C. Reilly that she's brushing her teeth. Natalie Portman saying, ""No one will ever love you as much as I do' does little to tug at my heart strings.<br/><br/>'Closer' has nothing to do with love and everything to do with sex. And ultimately, sex for what it is isn't that interesting, and love is never that simple."

The four main characters weave in and out of each other's lives.<br/><br/>I'm sure it's easy for a few out there to recognize themselves in this movie. Each character goes through the cycle from victim to aggressor in some form of another.<br/><br/>And for those who don't relate, they probably didn't enjoy the movie as much. The narrow viewer-ship and the simplicity of the script is the only notch I'm taking out for the rating of this movie.<br/><br/>If you can figure out that ultimately the movie is about lies, then everyone can relate to that. In the end, one of the characters takes you to the end of their journey, and you kind of feel like the movie lied to you - so you really get to relate. But if you're not into that kind of thing, perhaps the movie will have you feel a little raw.<br/><br/>Very good acting and a nice little movie - if you like the genre."

","I think the film is wonderful. I'm not a critic and I don't particularly care to play one and pontificate, but I will say Clive Owens is amazing. Horrifying, fascinating. OK, it may be a little cliché, at this point, for a modern Londoner to be that fixated on being ""working class."" Sure, it's not out of the question, but it's a little overdone at this point. It does give his character motivation, sure, anger and complexity...but it's so over-used.<br/><br/>However, the last scene, where Portman's character walks through Times Sq, with men looking at her left and right, and she looking straight ahead, is one of the most poignantly tragic, beautifully understated scenes I've ever seen. That scene alone. Wow. Although I'm still not sure what ""Blower's Daughter"" means..."

","Closer (2004) is the best postmodern art offering to hit the big screen in decades. The best since Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) and Ingmar Bergman's Scenes From A Marriage (1973). In fact the movie itself echo's the study of troubled marital relationships spoken of in both the art movie classics. It is hard to explain what the exact plot of this story is; crudely putting it, Closer deals with heterosexual relationships and swapping partners. It is an excellent study of adults, made by adults for an adult audience. For once we have a movie, which isn't called an adult movie just by the insert of sex and nudity, for there is none of that. The story is meant for more mature intelligent audiences, which neither would children be able to comprehend, and nor would they find it interesting. Not that it is slow moving, it actually moves quickly, and time passes by with a blink of an eye. It's always swift moving capturing the viewers attention, the dialogue is sleek and fast, not a single boring moment. The viewer's mind would never wander away, as he or she would be so involved with the unique story and it's extra unique characters. The superb cast consists of Jude law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. The film cannot be imagined with anyone else instead. If another replaced even one of these stars, it might have not been such great a movie. The cast is that perfect. In fact all four-cast members together won in the category for 'Best Acting Ensemble' at the 'Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards'. None of the characters are very nice people one would want to associate with, especially the men. Not that the women are any saints, but the two men portrayed in this movie are out right savage animals. Based on a play by Patrick Marber, Closer, was excellently adapted to the big screen by director Mike Nichols. Interesting Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), was Nichols directorial debut starring the two best character actors of modern art form of cinema, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Thus we see that both Mike Nichols' directorial debut and his latest offering are two best movies ever released in postmodern artistic cinema genre made in the English language. As most art cinema is affiliated to European ventures, with Sweden's Ingmar Bergman, France's Francois Truffant & Jean-Luc Goddard to Italian Federico Fellinini and many such great European directors. Closer would no doubt be remembered as one best ever made, and the best of the early twenty-first century. This superb piece of art, so believably realistic, will no doubt be taught to students of cinema, not just in film schools, but also as analysis of film literature. And Julia Roberts name is associated with this masterpiece. It is no use writing what the movie is about one must actually watch this. It is unique, and the best all four; Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen; would have ever appeared in."
"CapRising","6","1","2","11 September 2005"," Strangely moving, or movingly strange?
","For me, Clive Owen was the draw here. Without him, I think this film would have been unbearably boring. The centerpiece of the story was the rather hilarious online exchange between ""Dr Larry"" and the person he thinks is an insatiable nymph.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman held up her end of things rather well. Her character possessed an inner strength that most of the others (except Larry) failed to give her credit for. Their exchange in the strip club was fascinating and real -- an intense war of wills.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts really was lovely to look at, and her character had more dimension and nuance than much of her previous work.<br/><br/>Jude Law? His character was the self-sabotaging jerk who doesn't deserve to win anything.<br/><br/>Some viewers may find this film a tad confusing. The jumps in time usually move the story forward, but at times, flashbacks are put in without us knowing until much later. Some may argue that this is an artistic device. I reserve judgment.<br/><br/>Is this a love story? Only for some of the characters. In many cases, it's a ""need"" story. I think for the two who end up staying together, it is a love story, in terms of the maturity and growth that is needed to make love work and move beyond infatuation status.<br/><br/>If Mike Nichols had written this, I would have had to wonder ""What was he thinking?"" But the fact that he directed another writer's adaptation of a play gives him more credit. It's good to see that he's still active as a director."
"naillon-2","Null","1","2","6 September 2005"," Half the cast is excellent.
","As a rule, I avoid anything with the simpering, smirking, Barbie-doll Julia Roberts, who is one of the most awful excuses for an actress in Hollywood, and that's saying something.<br/><br/>However, I respect the acting talents of the rest of the cast, so I saw ""Closer"". Roberts gave exactly the non-performance that I expected of her; no surprises there. Who told her she could act, anyway? She is just as awful in this film as in every other role she's walked through, not even trying to emote. She's wooden, she's boring, she's ridiculous.<br/><br/>On the flip side, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman are excellent as Larry and Alice, two characters who don't know one another very well. Their only scene together is a marvel to watch. Owen blasts everyone but Portman right of the screen; in a party scene with the dullard Roberts, he's so magnetic that it's impossible NOT to look at him; Roberts might as well not even be in the frame. His line delivery is perfect, his emotions realistic.<br/><br/>Portman, in the strip-club scene, is coolly perfect as Owen's foil. He begs to hear the truth from her; she mocks him subtly. This casting was truly inspired.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in Jude Law's performance as the weak-willed Dan; he wasn't as effective as in other films.<br/><br/>With the exception of the dreadful Roberts, this one is riveting."
"Spectator_Consumer","10","1","2","18 August 2005"," In my Top 10 Films of All-Time
","I can't find anything wrong about this film. Because I'm not a Julia Roberts fan and usually don't go for the romantic-drama genre, I waited until the DVD release to view the film; I shouldn't have. Closer is wonderfully acted, employs dialog that rings true, and ultimately is able to achieve a powerful narrative rivaled by few other films to date. A masterpiece that will be studied and revered for decades to come. <br/><br/>The picture, centrally, deals with the emotions inherent in the modern relationship: trust, betrayal, and vulnerability. <br/><br/>Closer probably isn't a good date film, nor even a ""couples"" film, it isn't bubbly. It is, however, the director Nichols' best work to date, which is saying something, remember he was responsible for The Graduate. This movie isn't as culturally significant as The Graduate, but I prefer it nonetheless, as it seems to reflect a more mature and honest view of human relations.<br/><br/>And then there is the acting. Clive Owen deserved best actor, Portman gives another outstanding performance, and Jude Law shows, once again, why he's the new Johnny Depp (probably will never get the acclaim he deserves, like Depp, or Pitt for that matter, due to Hollywood hunk-marketing). By the end of the film, none of the characters walks away unblemished, and yet you empathize and identify with all of their faults, as if you can imagine yourself making similar mistakes. Nichols was wise enough to depict the youthful quartet as naive, stupid, cruel, narcissistic and selfish. I suspect this movie hits too close to the bone for some.<br/><br/>I have to reiterate, this isn't a happy consumer-land film. This is serious cinema revealing the failings many of us are prone to make while young and searching. I'm glad Hollywood can still make a movie like this. Life isn't a beer commercial and not all of us want trite escapism all the time. Cinema, at its best as in Closer, is capable of achieving so much more. I appreciate a silly genre movie as well as the next person, but sometimes a person wants something with more substance, a film working on a different plane. A film like a good novel, teaching you a little more about yourself and your fellow man.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to note the superb, and somewhat risky reliance the filmmakers made using Damien Rice's unforgettable song ""The Blower's Daughter"" to set the tone for the film. The choice was shrewd giving the film a melancholy, but humane, quality of romance."
"J_7","5","1","2","19 July 2005"," plot twist?
","I admit to being a Mike Nichols fan. There's been some great stuff. I loved ""Wit"" and ""The Graduate"" and even ""Primary Colors."" There's been some great filming and story-telling going on for just a little over 30 years from this guy, which leads me to the question: why this movie? Why ""Closer?"" I can't imagine wanting to spend time making a movie about a bunch of people who are unpleasant, deceptive, and just down right mean. Even though the bulk of his work is about people you wouldn't normally like, at least his past characters provide some kind of redemption for themselves. They're not just unpleasant, deceptive and mean to each other; they do this to themselves. For example, if you were Clive Owen's character and you were in love with your wife, would you have sex with a prostitute while you were away on vacation? And then would you expect her to stay after you've confessed? And even more, would you expect that you'd end up okay in the end? How 'bout Jude Law's character? Every time he meets a woman that's newer, younger, and more out of his reach, he goes for her...even if he's seeing someone else. When he meets Alice, he's living with Ruby. When he meets Anna, he's living with Alice. He's not just unhappy with these women that he spends years with, but he is apparently unhappy with himself. Oh, and how ""ironic"" that he happens to write obituaries. A bit cliché for my taste. He was boring, unsettling, and worthless as a character.<br/><br/>Then there's Anna. I imagine that Julia Roberts didn't have to do too much prep work for this role because she was already used to stealing people's beaus in real life. This one came naturally to her which begs the question how come she was such a bad actress in this film? I'm glad Cate Blanchett backed out and left this crummy role to a crummy over-rated actress. The best thing she can do is smile that ""epic"" smile and look goofier as the years go by. Her character is not just boring, mean, and deceptive but also disgusting. Although Clive Owen's character was a total jerk, he had it right at the end when he said that total depressives keep looking for depression. Of course, that only raises the question why he would want her back if she will inevitably leave him again for something less happy? Or is that the point? Either way, I would have dumped her, screwed her, and left her at the end. Not dump her, screw her, and then take her back. Wouldn't the best reward for her be to leave her if that's what she really wants? It sure would save you a lot of trouble if you just got rid of her before she did it to you. At least you could go out on a good note and not be the one who gets dumped.<br/><br/>And finally, how about Alice? Or Jane. Or whoever. If this movie was supposed to make me think chameleon or changeling, it didn't. It made me think that this is a highly commercialized movie that is trying to program the audience to believe that failure and deception is acceptable. This whole movie is an Aaron Spelling plot from 90210 because everyone sleeps with each other, hates each other, and despises themselves after all is said and done. I admit to reading a summary on IMDb half way through the movie that made me want to finish it. It said something along the lines of ""wait until you see the end; you'll never see that coming."" So I watched and watched and watched and when the credits rolled, I was still waiting for this magnificent ending. So what? So she goes back to New York, a failure from London who was a failure already from New York, grows long hair, looks a little prettier, maybe a little wiser, and walks down the street like a supermodel. I guess we're supposed to think she is like a well-weathered sage, a been-there-done-that kinda gal who is really self confident and has been hurt so-don't-mess-with-me-if-you're-gonna-play-mind-games. I mean, really.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave this movie a 5 because of Clive Owen. He's fresh enough in the market so that you haven't (yet) seen this character and meaner than everyone else in a very subversive way that makes you hope you never meet someone like him. Other than that, you can skip the rest."
"mmaapp","9","1","2","7 July 2005"," theater on the big screen
","Closer is a really strange case for me. I was told it was great, ""just don't see it if you have a boyfriend"". To be honest, I didn't like it the first time I watched it. Well, it was more than that; basically it was absolutely nothing that I expected it to be. The dialogue, though sharp, was, well, crude. I don't care about that at all mind you. But it wasn't what I was expecting. I had no idea how to deal with the movie so I moved on after seeing it. I thought it would be forgettable.<br/><br/>And then, I realized little pieces of it kept coming back to me. I would remember a scene and ponder it almost out of nowhere. So, about three months after I first saw it, I rented it again last night. And now I think I might just need to buy it.<br/><br/>Closer is truly theater. I read how it was based off a play, and now it is all the more evident. I was so perplexed by the love quadrangle of the film the first time that I never even noticed, no one else is in the film AT ALL except the four main actors. Sure there are background people but no other characters. Every scene accomplishes so much they are little movies or dramas in themselves. They reveal the good and the sinister in these people. They deal with universal feelings about relationships, love, and betrayal. But they do so in a way that is harsh & honest, as opposed to sappy. This is no romantic tearjerker by any means.<br/><br/>It really didn't dawn on me the first time. I thought the point was that people are so selfish that they are capable of doing the cruelest things, even to the ones they love. But thats not it at all. The point, I think, is that real love is truly rare. Each character comes off as a devious sex hungry person who can't stay faithful or happy. But each character truly is complex and different, and this is what really hit me the second time seeing it. Anna (Roberts) is depressed and doesn't think she DESERVES real love. Dan (Law) isn't capable of real love. Larry (Owen) truly loves Anna, and Alice (Portman) truly loves Dan. Larry and Alice are easily my favorite characters. Both AMAZING actors in this movie and both rich and convincing characters - you find yourself rooting for them to somehow be happy the whole time. Larry is pretty crude himself, but for some reason comes across as a likable character. Jude Law always seems to play a tool in every film he does, and masters it in Dan as well. In other comments I've read, Julia Roberts comes off as dull, and I'll agree - but the more I think about it, I think the character calls for it.<br/><br/>This film is simple in the sense you've got four characters and a fairly straightforward plot of their deceptions. But I truly believe there are more layers to this film. I can't wait to watch it again and see what else I can get out of it. To those who hated it, give it another chance if you can. To those who have yet to see it, try to get past the film at face value and really examine the four characters. If nothing else, watch it for the spectacular acting. I really do think this is a perfect portrayal of theater in the form of film. 9/10"
"Itsinthewater","8","1","2","19 June 2005"," Powerful film,, unlikeable characters but true to heart
","Mike Nichols has done it again.He has created an emotional, unpredictable and heart-numbing portrayal of 4 people; two of whom decide to be with someone else. The film is filled with very sexual and adult-oriented dialogue. This is not a film for Mom and Pops . I thought Jude Law and Clive Owen were great, and Natalie Portman certainly followed suit. I was a little surprised to see her playing a stripper since she really didn't look like one- a retail worker or another profession of some sort would of been more believable. However, I thought Julia Roberts was horribly miscast for the role of Anna. She did not have the sex appeal nor image the role required. I tend to be a little prejudiced towards Ms. Roberts since I rarely see her in a role that fits her; this role would of been better filled by Naomi Watts or a ""real"" blonde with sex appeal. I don't understand why two American actresses were casted rather than two British actresses since the film takes place in London. I just thought characters would of been better pieced together had they all been British. Handsome Clive Owen has made his mark after this role and I hope to see more good work from him in the future."
"WindWoman3","9","1","2","19 June 2005"," Stripped Down
","I didn't make an effort to see this film in the theatre, and I think now that wasn't such a bad thing. I watched it in the intimacy of my own bedroom, on the closed space of my PC, paying rapt attention to the dialogue coming from my small speakers.<br/><br/>This film is a contained universe about a handful of experiences and emotions that connect directly to the heart - which is, in the words of one character, ""A fist wrapped in blood."" There is plenty of verbal blood let here, trust me.<br/><br/>The four characters (essentially the entire cast) play a round-robin game of desire, but not a desire born of tenderness. This desire is a battle of power, with it's participants using sex as their favorite weapon. They want to love, but find themselves unable to meet it's stringent requirements. Instead, they settle for sex as a curdled substitute.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is visceral, cutting, bestial, and oh-SO-smart. He's a gladiator who wins more often than he loses. He may be cruel - but he's a WINNER - and his enemies will never be allowed to forget that.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts is perfectly adequate as a chilly photographer who casually takes, destroys, and doesn't seem to care much about the fall-out. She almost seems to play with men out of profound boredom. If any of these characters can be called amoral, it would be her.<br/><br/>Jude Law comes across as an overly sensitive and boneless jerk who can't decide if he loves anyone more than himself. His character behaves like a petulant child, thus in a key scene with Clive Owen's raging animal, one can practically see Law shrink both physically and emotionally. Indeed, he seems almost grateful for the clarity than Owens provides. Law's performance has been criticized, but frankly he plays a diminished character and I suspect that's not the easiest trick for someone as elegant and beautiful him. He deserves credit.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is no longer a little girl. She is heartbreakingly beautiful and articulate, yet her character can't be pinned. In the beginning she begs to be loved, but as her character evolves over the course of the film she learns how to use what the Lord gave her - but perhaps not for good. She is excruciatingly aware of how she affects men. I'm not sure she truly enjoys that power. By the time she is betrayed for the final time, the coquettishness is gone - replaced by a woman who despises the men who desire her.<br/><br/>Portman is an actress to contend with. She has a long and bright future ahead of her - and I predict that she will join Roberts as an Oscar winner some day.<br/><br/>The final scene of the film, which focuses solely on Portman's character, left me in tears. Of course, those cellos in the beautiful, haunting, and anguished 'theme' song by Damien Rice went a long way toward turning on my waterworks, too.<br/><br/>This is a humanist movie. Okay, so it's not a movie that's going to make you feel GOOD about the human condition - but it is one that is truthful about the darker meanings of sex, love, and power.<br/><br/>""Closer"" is a MUST-SEE for anyone who cherishes a meaty drama."

I think perhaps the people who leave the room or bang their head against the wall while watching this film are probably not seasoned movie watchers, or perhaps too seasoned.

","I went into this movie expecting the clichés of adultery and heartbreak. I expected one of the characters to emerge as most sympathetic, and the others to rank in order of unkind to detestable. I thought there would be some semblance of closure by the end. I expected a careful re-tooling of cinematic stand-bys.<br/><br/>For better or for worse, ""Closer"" offered none of that.<br/><br/>People are often comparing this to Nichols' first feature film, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" a brilliant four-character drama full of dark humor and human cruelty. I found the greatest similarity to be the study of the way people play games, and how the games can go on, twisting and turning. While in ""Virginia Woolf,"" they are intentional games (""Get the Guests,"" ""Hump the Hostess"") and go on for a series of hours, the games in this film are subtler, more quietly calculated, and go on for years.<br/><br/>While I think ""Virginia Woolf"" is a near-flawless film, ""Closer"" is worth a first and definitely second look. This is an easily unlikable film, at times a miserable experience. Very shortly into the movie, it is clear that these four people are doomed to an unhappy ending. Just in the way that Dan meets Alice and Anna meets Larry, and then how Anna and Dan meet, and then how Alice and Larry meet. The connections are foreshadowing of the relationships that stem from them.<br/><br/>Alas, despite all of this, it's an intriguing, original experience. We don't seen this kind of bravery in mainstream cinema very often. These are complex characters who earn our sympathy and then break our trust as viewers. I don't want to give too much away; I had very little idea of what would happen when I went into this, and I think that enhances the experience.<br/><br/>The acting may be the best thing to focus on. All four main characters are played brilliantly. Natalie Portman has received well-earned recognition for her performance, which is sad and funny and heartbreaking all at the same time. There is one very telling scene between Alice and Dan, where he delivers some terrible news, and she goes through a spectrum of reactions, each handled and transitioned into beautifully. She is the emotional heart of the story.<br/><br/>Jude Law gives the kind of performance I think people expect of him. He's charming at times, weak-hearted at others. Desperate, yearning, detached, completely incapable of true intimacy. Like Portman, he hits all of these notes seamlessly. Danny is the kind of man you sigh and shake your head at a lot, thinking both, ""Why is he doing this?"" and ""Why am I forgiving him?"" He has this affect on everyone in the film.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is simply amazing as the most tortured of the foursome. He's brutish misery has such presence; his eyes say so much. There is a fantastic confrontation between Larry and Anna which displays all of this so well. He's the kind of character you find yourself fearing and pitying. He's reminiscent of Richard Burton in ""Virginia Woolf,"" an obviously very weak man at heart who, still, is capable of the cruelest acts.<br/><br/>I feel like Julia Roberts gets sort of overshadowed in this movie, but I have to say, considering the roles she usually plays, this was the bravest she's ever been. In the scene mentioned above with Larry, she reaches an emotional height at the climax of their argument which I feel we've never seen from her before. She is like an animal finally lashing out. And her final shot in this movie is quite heartbreaking. A fine choice of actress--a woman who appears to be a force to be reckoned with, playing a woman who is so absolutely feeble at heart. To return to ""Virginia Woolf,"" seeing Roberts in a role like this was like seeing Elizabeth Taylor in a role like Martha. Certainly it is less dramatic (and traumatic) a transformation, but just as intriguing.<br/><br/>If anything, see this film because it's not what you think it is. But don't see it on a first date. It is often-repeated advice in regards to this movie, but I must agree here. This is a bitter film, faithless about love and humanity. Not very positive omens for a burgeoning relationship."

","In Mike Nichols' dreary film adapted from Patrick Marber's play, we start far away from the four main characters and never move any closer toward understanding them.<br/><br/>The boy-meets-girl (and screws her over) plot is simple, but missing details and lack of character development complicate the film. We know it isn't a feel-good tale right off the bat: Daniel (Jude Law) and Alice (Natalie Portman) are engaged in a casual game of ""you're-hot-wow-I-must-look-again"" coquettishness on a busy London sidewalk when she is hit by a taxi. ""Meeting cute"" this isn't. Thus begins a torturous relationship that takes place largely off-screen; we only witness a few minutes of pleasant calm, and maybe only seconds of what would appear to be happiness. What we do witness is hostility, turmoil and betrayal channeled through stilted, stage-crafted dialogue.<br/><br/>The same applies for the other half of the film's cast. Julia Roberts is Anna, an accomplished photographer who fraternizes with her subjects  with Daniel, anyway; their random lip-locking is the catalyst of the plot. It throws his relationship with Alice to the sex-club dogs (her previous line of work), and messes with Anna's head. She will soon meet hard-edged Larry (Clive Owen), and must decide which one she loves after sleeping with them both.<br/><br/>The couples split and reform in different iterations, and split and reform again in their original states near the end of the film. Much rough sex is had (all off-screen), and many tears are shed, but the four souls remain wrapped in mystery. The final scene punctuates this distance.<br/><br/>Portman and Owen's performances are commendable. Law and Roberts, however, deliver distant and (intentionally?) detached portrayals of their characters. If eye-candy is your interest, you may be surprised  Portman glows intermittently, but there's nothing very beautiful in this film."

","This movie is incredible! I love it I just rented it and fell in love! It is so incredibly true. Mike Nichols is a genius! For one Jude Law is amazing he plays his character as if it was really him and that makes him so much more sexy and handsome as he ever was before. Natalie Portman ooh my God! She was a child in the star war movies and now its like she bloomed into an incredible, beautiful, sexy, seducing young woman. She played the part! Clive Owen was also amazing he played a sick pervert but at the same time he wad desirable expectally the fact that he can love! Lastly Julia Roberts as always is incredible but what made her stand out so differently is the way she spoke and selfishly carried herself like this character would I've never seen Julia like this and thats why I am captivated by her performance! Bravo bravo to the actors and the Director Mike Nichols! Great movie! I could watch it over and over and over!"

"bbbl67","3","1","2","20 April 2005"," There's only 4 characters and you hate all of them!
","Where do I begin? Yes this is a clever movie, lots of clever touches. Like for example the constant time shifting that they do in it, one scene could be set a year after the previous scene, and it's upto you to guess how much time has passed between each scene and all of the events that have taken place in between. Then there was that scene in the strip club where Larry (Owen) is badgering Alice (Portman) into admitting her real name, which he already knows is Alice, but she keeps telling him her stripper name, Jane Jones; and then at the end of the movie we find out that Jane Jones was her real name all along (fast-forward or reverse controls to look at her passport), not Alice Ayers.<br/><br/>Yes, all of this was very clever indeed. But a clever movie is not necessarily a good movie. The most ironic thing about this movie is that for a character-driven movie, there's no character development! Not one of the characters in this movie was likable, again ironic considering there were only 4 characters in the entire movie. All of the characters were mind-numbing flakes. You want to slap them all at one point or another. Take a pass on this movie, a much better movie was ""Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind"" with Jim Carry and Kate Winslet."

","I've got to say, Closer is one of the best films I've seen in a long while. The film stars Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen and is a deeply insightful, touching and absorbing story of the characters love lives. I think for me the quality of this film was in the acting - some incredibly believable facial expressions and depth of character - especially Clive Owen and even from Julia Roberts; and also in the writing. Anyone who's ever been in love or been through a painful break up can't help but recognise the words, behaviours, feelings and actions of the characters. It is an incredibly accurate representation of modern day relationships, and most impressively it does not to stoop to Hollywood simplicity of ""good"" and ""bad"". It makes no moral judgement on the actions of the characters, and ends the story in a realistic way, not a cheesy happy ending. I can't recommend it enough! Much better than a lot of the American processed crap we've been force-fed lately!"

","I didn't see this film in the theater thank God!! I probably would have spent a ridiculous amount of money seeing it over and over again! Yes, this film is that good! I have rented this film and have watched it a total of five times in succession! ""Closer"" is hypnotic from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman (Alice) sizzles on screen and commands presence. Julia Roberts (Anna) is equally capable, but had a little less 'umph' in this film than in other previous roles. However, she manages her character's indescisive and confused nature very well. Clive Owen (Larry) is stunning and gives a perfect, yet seemingly effortless performance as the confident doctor. Jude Law (Dan) operates at maximum capacity in this film as the immature, novel romantic with great boyish charm and sentiment.<br/><br/>The only other films that are similar to ""Closer"" is ""We Don't Live Here Anymore"" and ""Damage"" which tackles similar subject matter. However, ""Closer"" manages a better job at being clever, yet more psychologically brutal and emotionally revealing. I have never seen a film where all the characters cried like babies as their hearts were ripped from their chests. This film gives an accurate stance on the human cataclysm that ensues when we participate in promiscuous abandon.<br/><br/>A powerful film, ""Closer"" takes a good look at two couples and their relationships. Through the brilliant scope of acting from the quartet of leading actors, an absorbing and mesmerizing film that will have you looking closely is brought to life."
"evo8mr","10","1","2","16 April 2005"," Hands down, the best love story you will see for a while
","This movie is not for everybody. It has a high level of intelligence, wit, and sexuality. In Closer, Jude Law plays Dan, a writer of obituaries and aspiring novelist. Julia Roberts plays Anna, a photographer who takes Jude Law's picture for a book jacket. Natalie Portman plays Alice, a stripper (or a darker variation of the character she played in Garden State). When I had first walked in to see this movie, I walked in with an open mind. I was up for anything that was going to be delivered to me. About two hours later, I walked out blown away by how extremely good this movie is. You could buy it now on DVD for about $20, a price well worth for the movie that you get. This movie is the most mature love story I have EVER seen. If you're expecting something like The Notebook (another good movie), then don't see it. This movie is VERY mesmerizing."

","""Closer"" is quite a powerful movie. But I couldn't help but walk out of the movie theater feeling sick to my stomach.<br/><br/>Without knowing Nicols' intent, I can only assume that the movie was titled out of irony. As the movie goes on, these 4 characters become more and more alienated and self absorbed; ultimately as a means of emotional self-preservation.<br/><br/>But rather than dissect the entire movie, I would prefer to focus on a very captivating sequence between Clive Owens' and Julia Roberts' characters. Roberts reveals that she has recently fallen back into the arms of Jude Law's character, although she and Owens are living together. The banter that ensues is graphic to the point of being disgusting. But there is an undeniable link to an internet ""dirty chat"" between Owens and Law from earlier in the movie. In one setting, this dirty talk was considered provocative, yet an hour later in the movie similar words and phrases were downright degrading.<br/><br/>Many facets of adult relationships are examined in ""Closer"". Nichols does a masterful job of showing the duality of sexuality and emotional closeness."
"song-exe","9","1","2","16 April 2005"," Great Movie
","Although originally written as a play, Closer has transferred itself to the screen very nicely. Patrick Marber does an excellent job with adapting the script, and Mark Nichols does an excellent job at directing this work.<br/><br/>The movie's plot was something that you'd expect from a normal drama/romance movie. There were no long-winded sappy breakups, and the standard bedroom scenes were short and sparsely used throughout the movie. Everything in this movie is about the trauma between two couples, Portman (Alice) and Law (Dan) against Roberts (Anna) and Owen (Larry). All the characters in this movie have some emotional instability of some sort; Portman is very much a pushover, Law a very unforgiving stuck-up, Roberts' character isn't faithful to either of the men, and Owen is a pervert who trolls around Internet chartrooms looking for women. However, all of these different faults somehow add to the plot line, making for a very interesting movie. After finishing the movie, you feel the need to question yourself and examine your ""inner self"". Though I wasn't the biggest fan of Julia Roberts in this movie, Natalie Portman did a great job executing her part as a half-girlfriend half-stripper. Both Jude Law and Clive Owen fit their respective parts nicely in the movie.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a sappy love movie or a girl-meets-guy chick flick, you should probably stay away from this movie. You'll just end up coming out disappointed, taking in nothing from the movie. However, if you want to see a good movie which will leave you thinking, Closer is for you.<br/><br/>+: Good plot; Natalie Portman's a great actress in this movie <br/><br/>-: May not be for everyone; Untraditional drama/romance may make some people feel lost in the movie"

Even though in the film you really won't like the characters, the character development sure puts you in the mood, watching these characters fall apart over each other.

Director Mike Nichols gets good performances by everyone involved and the storyline about different aspects in relationships, emotions, sex, and people is what keeps people intrigued. Very surprised by Julia Roberts performance, it was a revelation to me. But the star of the movie was Natalie Portman and her characters wide range of emotion and actions.

Similar to Gus Van Sant's incompetent film ""Elephant"", ""Closer"" embodies two of the worst qualities a film can possess- it was both boring and pretentious. It was boring because every single character had no emotional, physical, or psychological development, no sense of ""character"", whether it is good character or bad character, and absolutely no consistency in any regard; pretentious because the characters in this film acted like no human being I have ever met. They acted like characters written by snooty drama students who thought they were bringing ""real"" relationships and ""real"" drama to the screen, but were too snooty to ever know what a ""real"" relationship or a ""real"" drama might be. Even worse, they acted like characters written by VIRGIN, snooty drama students, who thought they were bringing ""real"" sex to the screen. But who in fact knew nothing about sex or relationships or love or humanity, and whose own heavy-handed effort to understand such a complicated, wonderful and sometimes indecipherable thing were further illustrated by such a sloppy, poorly written script. Were it not for the fact that I thought I was going to get to see Natalie Portman naked I would have turned the movie off after the first ten minutes.<br/><br/>Oh.<br/><br/>Oh! And let us not forget the time-line. Holy Hell! As if this movie weren't bad enough. As if this screenplay wasn't dreadfully written. As if the direction wasn't shoddy, the acting sub par, and the premise utterly laughable. There is the time-line. Just to make a bad movie worse, this director, Mike Nichols, goes off and messes with the time-line as if he wanted the entire film to be totally incomprehensible and entirely ludicrous. I mean, one minute Alice is with Dan and life is good. The next minute we've jumped a year ahead and Dan has dumped Alice for Anna and Larry is copulating with Anna. The next minute it's four years ahead: Alice and Dan are back together, and have been for four years (albeit they're having a discussion they should have and would have had, were they not robots pretending to be humans, the first year they got back together), and Larry is back with Alice. Wheew! This goes on through the entire movie. Every ten minutes or so, Nichols, would randomly jump ahead in the characters lives a year or two, even four, therein completely obliterating any respectable amount of coherency he may have had if he had simply stuck to a tight, cohesive time-line. Reminded me of the movie ""49 Grams""; another film that looked as if it had been edited by an insensitive butcher.<br/><br/>Do not see this film. It is not worth your time. Instead, see something like ""Love Actually"", which is ""actually"" rather good. For more rants and reviews and writings, visit www.kevacho.com"
"MichaelMargetis","8","1","2","6 April 2005"," Not Your Average Love Story
","'Closer', the new sensual talkative drama from veteran filmmaker Mike Nichols, is adapted from the U.K. originated stage production written by Patrick Marber (who provided the film version with it's screenplay.) You could tell this by not even knowing since the film only has four characters; they are Dan, Alice, Anna and Larry, four seemingly ordinary people caught up in a love rectangle (there's no same sex attraction between them though, just boy-girl stuff). It starts out with Dan (Jude Law), a novelist, who meets a mystery girl, an American teenager, Alice (Natalie Portman) living in London. They hit off, but Dan starts to get bored with Alice and goes for someone his own age, Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer hired to snap shots for Dan's book cover -- this doesn't sit well with Anna's husband Larry (King Arthur, urrhh, I mean, Clive Owen) who is a wealthy dermatologist. <br/><br/>Pretty much the whole film is carried by the characters and their dialogue. The acting is actually something to notice. Jude Law really doesn't stand out like he usually does, and Julia Roberts really chews up the scenery (not in a good way). The two standouts are Natalie Portman and Clive Owen (the two lesser known actors of the bunch). Natalie Portman provides a carefully layered and exquisite performance that rightfully earned her her very first Oscar nomination. But the best performance of the picture is far and away Clive Owen. I never really appreciated how much of an outstanding performer he truly was until this. Clive Owen steals scenes from which ever of the three other characters he's around and he does a dazzling job making us believe how emotionally scarred, complex and scary the character of Larry really is. <br/><br/>In 'Closer' the acting is spot-on, and so is the writing for the most part. The dialogue flows smoothly in 'Closer', but some scenes are so graphically laced with outrageously obscene sexual dialogue it will make you think they put it in the film not to help the story but just for the shock value. Mike Nichols does another fine job directing (nothing to hand an Oscar out for), but the film's ending is kind of unclear. I don't want to spoil it for you so I won't mention it. <br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Closer' is kind of like the anti-love story. Chances are if you take a first or second date to it they'll slap you in the face. 'Closer' is probably best for people who appreciate the craft of acting, or people who are performers themselves. 'Closer' is definitely worth renting if your not easily offended by vulgar sexual insults. It made my Top 25 list of 2004 at number 25. Grade: B+"
"mrwinch","10","1","2","3 April 2005"," I loved this film - it is haunting
","I read some average reviews of this film in New Zealand, where I reside, mostly mentioning how it made the reviewer feel ""uncomfortable"" etc., They made me feel lukewarm about seeing this film, but I am so glad I ignored them and went to the cinema. I think perhaps these reviewers were under the age of 35, and it shows.<br/><br/>This film gives me not only hope, but definite knowledge, that people are still making films for the right reason.<br/><br/>The topic of infidelity doesn't make me feel uncomfortable, but I think any serious indulger of this activity would perhaps feel extremely uncomfortable. Who knows - maybe not . . .<br/><br/>This film illustrated clearly the no man's land of the line between love and sex, proximity and fate. <br/><br/>Thank God - this is not ""movie sex or love""- there is no romance to be found. Desire is not romance - it is simply an appetite to be sated - with consequence. Who can seriously pull sexuality and love apart, they are surely one and the same - whether anyone likes it or not. <br/><br/>This was a film like no other film because, it's portrayal of love and sex was honest. There was not a cliché to be found in this movie. How wonderful, and so like life. <br/><br/>I thought this was an interesting and absorbing film, such a necessary film in its overview of the dynamics of relationships. And, although I thoroughly marvelled at the film at the time, on top of that - I found I couldn't stop thinking about it . . . .<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's character, a stripper, ironically, possessed the most integrity. All characters were beautiful, physically, at the very least. It's easy to see why Natalie Portman was nominated for the Oscar in 2005.<br/><br/>The R16 on this film I think applies to the brutality of emotion - there was very little actual nudity and no actual sex scenes - but the words were explicit, yes, bad language, but so succinct.<br/><br/>The complexities of the pivotal arguments between the main characters (there were just four characters) were superb, alternating between the sexual, possessional, moral and poetic, perfectly. At no point was the audience insulted.<br/><br/>What can I say. Previously I have always voted a 9 on films I loved, to allow for some superior movie to come along, but on this topic I can't think of a better expose, so I go to the maximum praise. Maybe I'm crazy, but does anyone else out there this was some amazing piece of cinema?"

","Julia, I love you, but this is NOT your type of flick. We needed a deeper actress for this; but not Nicole Kidman because she already did the similar colored Eyes Wide Shut. When I say ""deeper actress"" I mean someone who has not been typecast in so many lighthearted roles. You were really good as Erin B, but this role in Closer is a more somber aura and you are too vibrant a woman for it. Cate Blanchett would have been perfect if not for her pregnancy making her decline the part. I think Kate Winslet would have been good too. <br/><br/>Clive Owen is awesome as is Natalie Portman. Jude Law is not my favorite actor but he did satisfactory in this part. It feels like it's a filmed play and that's not a bad thing, or is it? I guess that makes sense as the original is a play."
"brent_armour","10","1","2","27 March 2005"," Mind Blowing Masterpiece
","Before the credits rolled, I had already begun to rank this as one of my favorite movies. There was a little bit of suspicion in the realm of type-casting. I immediately asked myself how many more romantic roles I could see Julia Roberts in before finally getting tired of it and begging for a Brokavich sequel. However, she fit so superbly well as this character that, typecast or not, I forgot all about 'Runaway Bride' by the first intense scene. And there are quite a few of those in this one. Not having seen Jude Law do any intense acting, I was gladly impressed to discover that he really is a talented actor and not just some boy toy being thrown into practically ever film these days. There actually IS a reason for it. The other Eurpoean sensation in this movie, Clive Owen, also did a smashing job justifying all of the attention suddenly being thrown his way. Men with his attractive features really can be found en masse, but an actor that can control his facial expressions as if they were an etch a sketch for his emotions as he can, really is a rare bird. But my biggest surprise was Natalie Portman. Having never seen Garden State, my only taste of her has been the newer Star Wars movies. So, I thought she was a horrible actress. This movie turned my opinion over her on its head and left me wondering why I hadn't seen this star shine before. In addition to her acting, there's also something else about her that keeps you on edge. It could have just been her character in this particular flick. As the writing was so masterfully crafted, I wouldn't be surprised. The emotional intensity has a lot to do with the acting, but without the right words to deliver, it gets lost. This movie had scenes that left me wanting to slap someone, the were that effective at tugging you into the plot. I was constantly reminded of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", and a guarantee you that closer will one day be just as much a classic."
"dromasca","6","1","2","19 March 2005"," great acting, but such a boring story
","It's really intriguing for me to see such an amazing pool of actors gathering to do a film based on such a booooooooring story. As I understand, the script is based on one of these London or New York theater plays dealing with modern relationships. The traditional triangle is here a square and the four characters located in modern London are playing for the about 100 minutes a game of true and deceived love and treason. The problem is that all the atmosphere is so dry and detached from reality. What may be working on stage is not transformed at all into good cinema. I could not get rid of the feeling of filmed theater for the duration of the whole movie, and I have different expectations from a theater play than from a cinema piece of art. What a pity to see the splendid acts of Clive Owen and Natalie Portman spoiled on such thin premises. Jude Law and Julia Roberrts are also quite good, but this film is yet another proof that great acting alone does not make a great movie. 6 out of 10 on my personal scale."
"striker8844","10","1","2","14 March 2005"," Absolutely amazing movie
","This is an amazing adaptation of Patrick Marber's play by the same name, and it should be considering he wrote the screenplay as well. I was absolutely blown away by the performances in the film, especially Natalie Portman's. The way she delivers her lines perfectly captures the internal anguish and confusion she faces throughout the movie while trying to cover it up and act like a ""grown woman"". Amazing. I must admit that I was a little surprised that Marber left out two major plot points that were present in the play, both dealing with Portman's character. First, he eliminated the cutting scene shown in the play right after Dan tells her that he's been cheating on her. She cuts a question mark into her arm, and there's a reference to it that curiously remains in the film, when Dan tells Alice in the hotel room that she's a question mark. Second, he allows Alice (now Jane) to live at the end of the film. In the play, Alice gets hit by a car and Dan finds out this way that she is really Jane Jones. I suppose that this is because Marber wanted to end the film on a more positive note. When I saw the play, I very much felt that the focus was on Dan's development, but the movie seems to focus more on Alice's development. Thus, I can sort of understand why he would go for the redemptive ending for the movie version, but I'm very curious to know why he cut the cutting scene. As for the performances, they were all absolutely amazing. Jude Law perfectly captured the role of Dan and he delivered the somewhat heavy dialogue almost naturally (which is pretty difficult to do... try saying ""You should try lying for a change, it's the currency of the world"" without sounding like a complete buffoon). Clive Owen was absolutely incredible as Larry... I still don't understand how he took such a sleazy character and made him almost lovable, especially after his last scene with Dan. He's such an asshole, but you still sympathize with him. As I already said, Natalie Portman was incredible, and she is quickly becoming one of my absolute FAVORITE actresses after seeing her in this and in Garden State. Finally, Julia Roberts did an amazing job considering that she didn't have much to work with. This isn't because of Marber, but just because her character is really only there for Dan and Larry to develop as characters. But her scene with Owen in their house was incredible. She delivers the lines with such force and vigor that you cannot help but be blown away by her raw energy. I honestly think that her line ""It tastes like yours but sweeter"" is one of the best lines ever in cinema history. Closer was an incredible movie, and I definitely rank it among my top twenty five films of all time. Marber is a genius."
"johnnyx-2","7","1","2","14 March 2005"," Emotional Rubbernecking
","If you walk in expecting a traditional romantic comedy (I, for one, was thinking 'Love, Actually'), you'll be pleasantly surprised. Especially as a guy... It doesn't give away anything to say that the movie is an emotional roller-coaster, which makes it ridiculously tough to describe without 'spoilers'.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts' Only Character (played by Julia Roberts) and Jude Law's Only Character (also excellent portrayed by Jude Law) play somewhat deranged self-obsessed good-looking people. 'Julia Roberts' is a successful, self-reliant woman who only answers to men when they speak REALLY LOUDLY. 'Jude Law' is a charming-yet-dark young man who you 'really really want to believe can change'. All in all, Julia Roberts and Jude Law do a very good job on these roles. Unsurprisingly.<br/><br/>Clive Owen and Natalie Portman clearly steal the show. They're sexy (in the case of Clive Owen, far surpassing his much-lauded male co-star; in the case of Natalie Portman, only to be expected), flawed, lovable, understandable, confusing and have all of those other wonderful idiosyncrasies that come with actually being able to act. Were these two replaced with lesser talents, this movie would be pedestrian, as it is, I can now understand all the well-deserved hype.<br/><br/>The somewhat episodic nature of the movie helps it substantially, as it gives the many, many emotional plot twists the plausibility they need ('oh, OK, that's happened because it's been months, see....). Furthermore, it allows you to pick up all the 'little things' that couple manage to change about one another with time ('Jude Law's' glasses, for example, come and go depending on his self-esteem...) Also, and on a distinctly masculine note, the dominant romantic emotion throughout the movie is anger (although, as I write this, that's possibly due to the the on-screen dominance of Clive Owen). My movie companion, who is normally a very accurate emotional barometer, didn't shed a tear - but loved the movie regardless. Just something to keep in mind.<br/><br/>Clever without being pretentious. Realistic, but not painstakingly so. Surprisingly enjoyable. Guys, it ain't a great date movie, but you'll be OK if you're trapped on a plane with it."

Everyone was torn between their love and selfishness. People were being agonize by their love and lust. Julia Roberts still played her goddess role. Jude Law was the tragedy. Though I expected something from Portman but apparently she could not deliver more in this movie. Clive Owen was the best among the actors and definitely deserved a nomination.

Life is not filled with people that always do the right thing that meet a girl get married and have children. The truth is this doesn't happen most of the time and this film shows it to perfection. Julia Roberts who i usually don't like is especially good in this film because she is amazing at supporting the scenes she is in. I hope she chooses to do more movies like this in the future. Jude Law is his usual self charming and kind with a sense of mystery about him that makes you not able to take your eyes off him. BUT MOST OF ALL, the performances of Natalie Portman and Clive Owen are especially well done because they make the film go from great to incredible. Portman gives a performance that mixes the right tone of ""who is she"" and ""But i want her"" while the break out performance that had it been done poorly the film would have been a bust is by Clive Owen. He is a great actor and needs to be used more by the movie making world. These great performances combined with masterful dialog the type you wish you could write if you are a writer but at the same time I often wished i talked this way. All around not to be missed.<br/><br/>Mike"

"harry55t","9","1","2","14 February 2005"," Listen to the Dialogue
","This is a film about four people. Well, there are hardly any other character in the whole film except for bystanders. If you watch this on the big screen, you really would have to pay attention as you would not have the benefit of a re-wind button. Most films use flashbacks. This film uses flash forwards. And it jumps from one time frame to another without the benefit of subtitles or any form of announcement or indication. You just have to listen to the dialogues very carefully. For example, the film begins with the meeting of Natalie Portman and Jude Law. The scene 'ends' with Natalie Portman saying ""My name is Alice"". The next scene 'starts' with Jude Law telling Julia Roberts that he has been living with Natalie Portman for a year. Just one sentence and if you miss that, you would get the whole story absolutely mixed up. This happens throughout the film, in that the scenes are fast forwarded and they usually begin with a sentence from one of the characters. But it is very beautifully done and I enjoy it.<br/><br/>Profanity? I do not see the profanity because it is not profanity when the words used are to tell the story. It is not **** for the sake of using the word ****. The graphic use of 'sex' words are to describe incidents or actions. And they have to be used. For example, an angry man who finds out that his girlfriend has slept with another is not going to say ""oh, you made love to him"" but screams ""you ****ed him!"".<br/><br/>The only personal comment I would make is that Jude Law tries to justify everything under the sun. As a man, I would probably do the same in his situation but at the same time, it leaves such a bad taste in the mouth that I want to scream ""You hypocritical bastard"" and smash his face in. And in doing so, probably look at myself in the mirror and smash the mirror in... but perhaps my face against the mirror, for being a hypocritical piece of useless claim to manhood when it comes to playing with the feelings of Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts, and along the way, messes up Clive Owen.<br/><br/>I recommend this film. But watch it on the DVD so that you may need to re-wind to re-catch certain scenes."

It's unfortunate Mike Nichols failed to land an Oscar nomination. Or, Patrick Marber overlooked for best adapted Screenplay. Best acted, written and directed film of the year.

"Robert_duder","6","1","2","4 February 2005"," Academy Award MUST!! (of course because it's typical)
","This is the prime example of all things artsy with Mike Nichols' Closer. This seems like the mould for Academy films and the artsy crowd. No that doesn't make it a bad film, it just makes it exclusively enjoyed by a minority of film goers.<br/><br/>Closer is about...well it's hard to tell what it's about...it's pretty mish mashed and out there which is a usual characteristic of artsy type films. But basically Closer is about four people of different walks of life, a doctor, a photographer, a stripper, and a writer. Together their lives and love lives and unique personalities become entwined over a long period of time.<br/><br/>The period of time is quite unknown because the film moves at a silent pace...meaning they don't make it clear when they are jumping ahead a month, 3 months, 4 years...whatever they happen to be doing. You do follow the plot fairly easily and they try to let you know where they are in the timeline but if you don't know ahead of time that the film will not all take place during one time frame, you'll be initially confused. The cast is stellar, amazing in fact. Natalie Portman proves her acting chops which is long overdue and Jude Law is his usual portrayal which happens to work well here. Julia Roberts supports everyone else as the quiet link between them all. And nominee Clive Owen is brilliantly emotional and firey and he makes the film worth watching.<br/><br/>Patrick Marber who wrote the play and script tries to capture human condition when it comes to love and sex and honesty. There definitely is something here worth researching because all four people have this view on these subjects that effect those around them. They are all self involved and self concerned. The dialogue is very quick witted and most of the conversation between any two of the characters if a firing of constant questions which leaves you feeling muddled and perplexed which I think is what it is supposed to do, they want you to feel like you're in their situation. I also think in my opinion that the film is aiming to show a total cycle of different relationships but on a fast track over the course of 4 years. Basically they are showing human relationships on fast forward, but that's just my opinion. If you want an artsy film with Hollywood stars this is one of the better ones. I'm sure it will take some award, somewhere.<br/><br/>6/10"
"armando_mariani","9","1","2","1 February 2005"," A punch in the stomach but...I loved it!
","Watching ""Closer"" was, in a way, like receiving a punch in the stomach. That's what I felt after viewing this amazingly almost perfect movie. I'm really glad I did! Why do I say ""almost perfect""? Simply because I think that, even in its screen version, ""Closer"" remains a ""stage-play"" (which I regret not having had a chance to see), cleverly translated to the screen by the same author Patrick Marber, with the help of a recognized ""specialist"" like Mike Nichols. Both ensured the required fidelity to the spirit of the original. Rough, controversial, unpleasant, cruel, at times uneasy to watch and almost agonizing, but painfully honest and coherent with real life. Definitely not a commercial product and, consequently, not the movie for everyone. If you just want to be entertained and are too lazy to put your brain to work, ""The Aviator"" or ""Ray"", for example, could be your cup of tea. By the way, both are excellent movies, don't get me wrong. If you don't mind using your head or, just plain, are not afraid and love the challenge and don't need a happy ending then, please, watch the exquisite film ""Closer"". You won't regret it. All the above explains the very contrasting reactions from the audience. I'm sure, many spectators really felt cheated and asked for their money back... The essence: four interesting and very complex characters, a wonderfully written dialogue (as harsh and realistic as it can be) and four amazing young actors to bring to life this compelling today's story about love and sex. The subject matter: truth, lies, love, hate, sorrow, regret, manipulation, sex, sex and more sex.... Real today's life situations involving the relationship of two couples, which are unable to avoid screwing (in the broad sense of the word) each others up. And all end up loosing. The acting: what can I say? Seldom have we had the luck of having four fine actors, which chemistry worked so well, reunited in the same movie. Moreover they all are very good looking, which doesn't hurt. My darling, (still very young) Natalie Portman is absolutely incredible in the role of ""Alice"". She ""is"" at least four different kind of woman at the same time. Her different personalities are brought up, one by one, while she is interacting with the other characters. She is a helpless fragile child, a sexy shameless vixen, a sweet and caring lover, a selfish and arrogant bitch and, perhaps, something more. She manages this not easy acting task, showing the same astounding skills of a ""seasoned stage-chameleon"" but still, she makes it appear so natural and easy. I must confess, she managed to reach several times deep down in my ""emotion-reservoir"" and made me tremble....and also, she is sooooo pretty! I would rate her performance here at the same level of her unforgettable performance as ""Mathilda""in ""Léon"" (unbelievable, she was only twelve at that time...) I feel comfortable we'll see a lot more good from Natalie for many years to come. Clive Owen is amazing. He can be a repulsive, sex manipulative, egoistic and egotistic bastard and, minutes later, a fragile, confused and somehow lost soul. His scene with Jud Law, in his doctors' practice, is one of the best for both actors. I only hope he will not be too attracted by the lures of Hollywood and will keep choosing his new projects with intelligence. Jud Law is strong and convincing, as he has already accustomed us in previous movies. Julia Roberts passes with flying colors in, probably, one of the most difficult and challenging role of her career. Her best scene (to me) is when Clive/Larry is confronting her and wants to know if she slept with Jud/Dan in their apartment. First she warns him: ""...please...don't do this..."", but when he increases the pressure, she suddenly drops all moral barriers and starts throwing in his face the truth, with plenty of graphic details, which have the same impact of a sharp blade plunged frantically in his flesh, in a paroxysms of verbal sadism and self destructive humiliation... WOW! I give it a 9 out of 10."

","Closer is a brutal tale, with excellent performances from all involved, a musical score that fits like a glove, and photography that beautifully enhances the experience.<br/><br/>Still, I can't help but miss the strong realism of creations such as the superb Lost In Translation, where everything combines to make a perfect whole. Closer has many great sides, but there are flaws, such as the feeling that the story attempted to be told is much richer than what we see on screen. There are the missing pieces, the jumps in time, that might have been a good technique had it not left me feeling that the story was chopped up to make it fit a certain time slot.<br/><br/>As a whole, Closer was a fresh experience, both with the daring story and the surprisingly strong performances of some of the cast, therefore I gave it:<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"
"Andres24","3","1","2","27 January 2005"," Sex chit chat.
","This movie is an exercise of talking about sex in a hard way. But is only that: dialogue. If these four characters (Dan and Larry, both English; Alice & Anna, American) really talk ¨dirty¨ why the talking is not translated into action. Sex, sex.. Yes I wanted to see sex. With no action, it is all bla, bla, bla and it becomes boring after 60 or 65 minutes. That was when I realized the modus operandi of the director. I am referring to the how the movie is edited. Goes from a scene with one couple, then to the other couple, with the same dialogue. So it is repetitive and what is worst, the scenes are very long, hard to tolerate. But performances are very good. Clive Owen is better than the others. Good music, great view of London. My rating: 3 out of 10. Andres."
"cleo30","10","1","2","26 January 2005"," It was all about the sound track
","I was taken, in the first place, by the sound track. I did not care anymore what that movie was all about, just by watching them and listening to the music, which was all over the room. I was watching, carefully. But at that moment, even if I did not enjoy the story, the music had already taken me to the state of mind where I was supposed to be. So, this is what happened: I was taken and driven for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I just wondered, during the entire exhibition, I was somewhere else, somewhere really close to real life, where men and women behave in a truth way. The movie was real, concerning either men or women. Most of the times I felt like Natalie's character, crying to keep the one she knew she loved; sometimes I felt like Julia, a developed woman who knows what she wants, and who knows how to get there. But no one did really, getting there, except for the skin doctor, the only who worked with rationality as his background.<br/><br/>If the movie doesn't leave a final moral message, that is because life is not like that either. Life does not leave a final message. We have to read it in between. We act, we react, and that is all life is all about.<br/><br/>I was just in doubt about the fact ""Alice"" lies about her name the whole movie. She just reveals it to the doctor. I couldn't get the signs. Just thought that, sometimes, the mystery is what takes a man interested. So much that he only realizes things were not in his hands as he thought they were at the moment he knew she was not so much under his power. Men versus women. And a wonderful soundtrack."
"Santanico_Pandemonium","10","1","2","26 January 2005"," The Best Film I've Seen In A Long Time...
","Closer tells the story of four people - Dan, an obituary writer and failed novelist played by Jude Law, Larry, a dermatologist played by Clive Owen, Alice, a drifter and stripper played by Natalie Portman and Anna, a photographer played by Julia Roberts - whose love lives are all in someway connected. Dan is dating Alice but is 'in love' with Anna who is dating Larry after meeting him in an aquarium as a result of a joke Dan played. The story follows their relationships over four years, through deceptions, marriage, affairs and more deceptions.<br/><br/>After seeing the trailer for this film in September last year, I've had very high hopes for it. I can say quite happily that I was not disappointed . Closer is a modern classic, brilliantly acted by a very capable cast and wonderfully scripted. The film moves seamlessly from one tragedy to another. It's a brave movie in many ways, never afraid to be blunt about the characters sex lives, therefore it's not for everyone. The language is very graphic with at least 5 uses of the C word (and I don't mean clean). It's true what the professional reviews/cast have said, you do find your allegiance switching throughout the film and by the end of it you find yourself wondering if any of them deserved your sympathy at all.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing. The cast work brilliantly together. If Clive Owen doesn't win the Oscar then someone needs shooting. His performance was the strongest out of an incredibly strong cast. Julia Roberts was excellent as the woman torn between two men. Natalie Portman was as per usual wonderful and very convincing. Jude Law was back on top form after a string of crowd-pleasing but not critic pleasing films. He was completely believable as Dan and this film should silence those who think he's lost his touch.<br/><br/>As the end credits rolled and the hauntingly beautiful Blowers Daughter was played, I found myself realizing I'd just watched the best film I'd seen in a hell of a long time. It was worth everything I had to do to see it and I will definitely be buying the DVD! 5/5"

","Have just got back from seeing this film, which i was very excited about because of clive owen... i have to say that this film is very deceiving... do not be fooled by the terribly hatable characters and a script which gets more and more cliché as the film descends into chaos. you should instead delve a little deeper if it has left you a bit cold and annoyed as my main feeling after seeing this film is that i marvel at the wonderful clever ironic satire it provides on modern relationships and our constant search for happiness when we don't really know what we're looking for anyway. the questions raised on intimacy, eroticism, and how to get 'closer' to people are wonderfully refreshing and the whole thing is beautifully acted and somehow nicholls has retained the feeling that this is a play - a play being a work of it's moment, satire, centered on humanity, something personal. i wouldn't say i 'love' it, but i certainly got something out of it. there are scenes of complete originality and spine tingling accuracy also - the realistic fight between roberts and owen and their coarse commentary of sex, portman and owen in the strip club, and portman at the end - there don't think i ruined the plot there did i??"
"silverocelot2001","Null","1","2","21 January 2005"," One of the most relevant films of 2004
","Closer is brilliant because it challenges people to question the current state of love and fidelity in the world.<br/><br/>Many people will be shocked and perhaps disgusted at how liberal this film is but Nichol's ""open dialogue"" has been one of his best qualities for many years, in my opinion. He could have very easily resorted to Natalie Portman ultimately using solely her physical appearance to seduce Clive Owen's Larry and the audience but instead, she is granted dialogue, which captures her character, Owen's character and the key interplay between the two perfectly. In fact, the scene in the night-club may be the most skilfully realised scene of the entire film. It is a very ""sordid"" scene in comparison to the majority of the others in the film. Nichols could have used her ""stripper career"" as a backdrop for the study of the futility or supposed futility of relationships and true love but instead he stages most of the film in apartments, allowing the actors to act, which they do so superbly.<br/><br/>Yes, I am an huge Portman fan but all four actors were great. Still, I believe that her and Owen upstaged Law and Roberts and were very deserving of their Golden Globes. Also, note that Owen had starred in a stage version of the film prior to doing the film, thus he was able really to understand his character and Jude Law's (Dan), seeing that he was Dan in the stage production. The nuances of his portrayal in this film are exceptional as are Portman's, Law's and Roberts'. The use of a camera (Roberts' character is a photographer) is also a clever move by Nichols/ the scriptwriter as he ""captures"" each character but only for a second with each shot, much like how long ""true love"" lasts when it does in the film but, at least that's my interpretation of this theme of the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent; often decadent in order to portray how love or at least security through love is a drug or aspiration for the characters; another one of my interpretations.<br/><br/>The script is not faultless. It does drag in places but the characters keep the viewer interested. Also, the ending may leave a sick taste in your mouth, depending on who your favourite characters are. That Damien Rice track is beautiful and haunting like much of his music.<br/><br/>As I have said, the direction of Nichols is masterful , as always, but, for me, Owen and Portman make this film-Expect them to take two Oscars later this year. Yes, the film is perhaps not totally clear in its answers but it does force the viewers to assess their positions on real love.<br/><br/>Lastly, make a point of seeing Owen in ""Greenfingers,"" a cute Brit film about gardening criminals and the ""Hire"" BMW commercials, where his intelligence as an actor shines through in the company of some of the best action directors of recent years. Oh, and don't forget ""V for Vendetta"" with Miss Portman. It has to be a winner. She's really going from strength to strength.<br/><br/>My rating for ""Closer"": 9/10"
"writers_reign","7","1","2","21 January 2005"," Nearer, My God! To Thee
","I actually saw the play twice - once in preview and once when it opened - at the National Theatre in London when Clive Owen played the obit writer that Jude Law attempts here. Alas, he falls a little short, about from here to Mindaneo short, but luckily Natalie Portman is on hand to light up the screen. There's a curious imbalance in the film with Portman and Owen completely dominating Law and Roberts so that the overall effect is like a game of mixed doubles with McEnroe and Navratilova playing Henman and Barker. The dialogue is as coruscating as it was in the play and although the 'opening out' dilutes the intensity it's still effective. Not necessarily one that will stand up to a repeat viewing, unlike say, Million Dollar Baby, but certainly one to see."

"CALawyer","2","1","2","18 January 2005"," I want my 90 minutes back
","I have to admit up front that I saw this film ONLY because of the recent awards. I read some reviews first, and knew a little of what the story would include. But halfway through the movie I found myself looking at my watch wondering when the story will actually begin. Everything was prelude, and pretty boring prelude at that.<br/><br/>While some reviewers seem to find the dialog distracting, I did not. Nor did I find the story, as a whole, unreasonable for a movie; the story was told in a ""thinking man's"" format. Time moves forward, sometimes by months or years, simply because of a fade. The actors did a great job, as did the director. The problem is, this is simply a boring story about boring characters.<br/><br/>I will not dispute that each of the actors provides outstanding performances. Julia Roberts is cast against type, and this is one of the few movies I actually thought she acted. Natalie Portman has grown up from Mars Attacks and Star Wars, but is still cast as a one-dimensional ""girl"" taking the path of least resistance through life. This is clearly a character-driven movie, but none of the characters grows/changes/learns from their sometimes monumental mistakes. If one definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result each time, then these people are all crazy.<br/><br/>What could have been a great discourse on love versus sex is, instead, a lost opportunity. These characters have no sense of morality (or ethics, depending on how you define terms) as they live their lives with one partner, while sleeping with another from time to time, and never emotionally open up to anyone. Their arguments are all witty comebacks, with little true emotion. Portman cries, and Owen erupts, but the circumstances simply don't give them credibility. What happens when the smartest people in the world have to show us their emotion? They use fast, sharp dialog.<br/><br/>The most repeated adjective in all the favorable reviews I read was ""honest,"" as in ""this film is an honest portrayal of modern relationships."" Only if the rest of the world is totally dysfunctional and amoral. Having been through ""my share"" of relationships, some of which ended badly and others simply ending, and being married (my first and only) for many years now, and also having been employed in a field where others' relationships are opened up to me regularly, I found nothing ""honest,"" or ""true to life,"" or even ""remotely reasonable"" about the characters in this movie. While they bemoan the lack of love in their lives, they do nothing to look for it, or even to earn it.<br/><br/>These characters are all ""honest,"" in the sense that they don't actually lie when confronted with their ""dishonest"" conduct, but they are also all dishonest with themselves, in that they are all seeking sex while believing they are getting love. These are spoiled children, with enough education to engage in the sharp argument, but no wisdom to learn from their mistakes.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols, again, pulls a rabbit out of his hat. A truly talented director with a gift for seeing what is going to be on the screen, he and Roberts are the only shining stars of this movie. The rest is raw and, when all is said and done, a waste of time. (It's not that I mind raw, or even gratuitously raw. A character-driven movie should, at least, have interesting characters.) I can't say that I didn't like the movie -- I'm sure I wasn't supposed to ""like"" it -- it's that the story and characters were just plain boring."
"jack_malvern","10","1","2","18 January 2005"," An exceptional script, wonderfully acted
","Closer, whilst containing romance and comedy, is the antidote to Hollywood romcoms. The premise is simple: four characters with differing philosophies on how love relates to truth and happiness are thrown together. The plot, by contrast, is a maelstrom of emotional friction that is fiendishly complicated but never confusing.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have looked down on the film for failing to live up to the standards of the stage version. Frankly, they are fools. Even if this pales in comparison to its live predecessor, it is still an electrifying film.<br/><br/>Jude Law, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman are sublime, and Julia Roberts gives the performance of her career. Patrick Marber's script not only contains the perfect balance of drama and wit, but zips along so that every time you think you know how the plot will develop, it cuts to the next confrontation.<br/><br/>There is one dramatic turn that I found hard to swallow, but it is barely a wrinkle.

Natalie Portman in particular acted to a degree i suspected she was capable of but never thought I might see. Truly standout, if she doesn't get an Oscar for this role i'll be severely disappointed. The emotion and edge she gave to her character in ""Garden State"", amongst other films, showed us her talent, but ""Closer"", in my humble opinion, showed her's to be a rare and exciting thing. I am really looking forwards to seeing her continue to this standard in the future.<br/><br/>Portman's skills do not detract or overshadow the rest of the cast in any way. Law is as excellent as we have come to expect, taking a truly despicable character who reminds us all a little bit uncomfortably of ourselves (or was it just me?), and leaving us feeling pity for him all the same. He takes a complete bastard and still gives him an emotional side that we can empathise with. Here is a man that has selfishly tried to have it all and has instead lost everything. He is what we have the capacity to be and indeed sometimes are. He is without emotional restraint, a slave to his ever-changing emotions. He truly is a fool in love, or a loving fool...<br/><br/>Owen is so much better than I thought he would be. Ashamedly I can only use his work in ""King Arthur"" as a basis for comparison (if I have seen him in something else I can't remember it). That particular ""movie"" was a huge disappointment to me ad Owen didn't do much to further its case. However, a ridiculous script may be more to blame for that particular fiasco than he. However, i freely admit I was most definitely wrong about this actor. His performance in ""Closer"" is a powerhouse of bare emotion and realism which left me heartened that good old Brittannia can still produce actors of this quality. I look forwards with huge enthusiasm to his next offering.<br/><br/>It says something about this film that Julia Robert's performance was the worst thing I can pin on it. Her turn, whilst not incredible, is very good. It is definitely what we have come to expect from an actress of her caliber. She acquits herself admirably, showing qualities that are considerably varied from her usual hard-ass or rom-com roles... She doesn't disappoint with a role that simultaneously delivers tones of gritty realism and emotional pain.<br/><br/>""Closer"" definitely rates as the best film I have seen from 2004. Outstanding concept, writing, direction and some hugely impressive acting turns from the entire cast will hopefully propel this film to the commercial and critical success that it merits. I urge those who haven't yet seen it to go directly to their nearest cinema and buy a ticket. To those who disliked it or don't understand it, I respect your opinions, but I hope if you give it a second chance that you'll see the genius I see.<br/><br/>10/10. The best film I have seen in a long, long time. Thought-provoking, realistic and just thoroughly enjoyable. Bravo!"

","Closer<br/><br/>Award Worthiness: Best Picture Best Actor-Jude Law Best Actress-Julia Roberts Best Supporting Actor-Clive Owen Best Supporting Actress-Natalie Portman Best Adapted Screenplay Best Director-Mike Nichols Best Film Editing<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>Closer was my most anticipated film of the year, even more than ""The Passion of the Christ."" When watching it I really had no idea what to expect. I heard a lot about the dialogue but that was it. Wow, was I blown away. The film is the most insightful, thought provoking film of the year. If it were up to me this would definitely be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. Nichols has directed each actor to supreme perfection. I could not imagine no one else playing each character better than the ones at hand. The performances were top notch. Let start with Mr. Jude Law. I think he gave the weakest out of the bunch but still turned in an excellent performance. Even though you grow to hate his character with a passion he made you hate ""Dan."" Law gave great emotion and is definitely at the top of his game. Ms. Julia Roberts gave us a very different Julia Roberts. Her character is very selfish and Roberts portrays that with excellence. She was definitely one to watch and was quite enjoyable. She lifts her character to new dimensions. Even though Cate Blanchett was set to take that role I couldn't imagine Cate doing a better job than Julia. (No offense Cate, I still love ya) Natalie Portman has definitely made her transition from child star to adult star and with great ease. After watching her last year in Cold Mountain I knew there was great potential in her and I was proved right. Her sleek, sexy, and gut wrenching performance makes her a lock for a nomination come January. If she keeps going at this rate she will be a regular at awards ceremonies. And the last but certainly not least is the man of the hour, Clive Owen. He gives an amazing performance as Larry. He played Dan in the original London stage of this and made a drastic turn as a man with a little too much in his vocabulary. Owen delivers the best performance of the ensemble and will definitely be a force to be reckoned with in February. This movie was completely enjoyable and even though I wouldn't recommend bringing your Grandmother to see this, I will recommend it to the mature movie watcher. Best film of the year.<br/><br/>10/10"
"cs100","7","1","2","12 January 2005"," Truth, love, and art in the 21st century
","My rating: 7/10.<br/><br/>Closer, which portrays a love quadrangle between four London urban sophisticates (actually three, plus Natalie Portman's stripper character), explores a variety of challenging questions. What is it that separates humans from animals  is it our capacity for forgiveness, or for adhering to the truth? To what extent should a person lie to protect the happiness of others? What is the nature of love in modern-day urban society? What is happiness, and can we even recognize a happy person? When is one being taken advantage of, and when is one properly protecting one's self? It is quite obvious that Closer was originally a play. There is little action, only a few sets, and a huge amount of dialogue. Fortunately, the four lead actors are all up to the challenge. Julia Robert's thoughtful and engaging performance will surprise some people, but I felt that Clive Owen turned in the most outstanding performance, in the complex role of the manipulative Larry. The scene in which Larry reveals to Dan the results of his scheming, reducing Dan to a whimpering shred of a human being, is a masterpiece of power and control, and Clive Owen carries it off brilliantly, with perfect timing, delivery and body language.<br/><br/>My primary complaint about Closer is that the storyline is overly complex. By the time the final breakup scene rolls around, after so many other breakups and reconciliations, it seems a bit too much. The very end of the film, when Dan visits the park, does provide an answer for the final breakup, but still, I had tired of the back-and-forth by the end of the film. Closer also does a better job at raising questions that answering them. Viewers looking for principles or even for consistency of behavior among the main characters will be sorely disappointed, as hypocrisy and contradictions abound, but this apparent fact of modern-day life may indeed be one of the messages the film is communicating. If so, it's more than a bit depressing."
"TaylorWCE14","7","1","2","10 January 2005"," Deeply Depressing
","The characters in Closer could never be truly happy unless they were miserable. All of the relationships which we see as love are about passion. Intimacy is a lie. With these four good looking but deeply troubled characters brought together by some cruel fate, it was impossible to get close to someone else without hurting them. Superbly acted especially on the part of Clive Owen in his big breakout as the grief-stricken husband and dermatologist Larry. All of the actors were in their element and made this movie beautiful in a gloomy sort of way. Kudos to Patrick Marber for an excellent screenplay and a beautiful way of depicting hopelessness and angst. This movie can make people think and examine the honesty in their own relationships."

","One word to describe this movie: Relatable This is an intense, dark yet subdued and honest movie.<br/><br/>Basically what I learned from it is that even if the mind knows better, one can never compete with the human heart's appetite for affection and acceptance at all the wrong places at all the wrong times even if its at the expense of hurting someone or and ultimately hurting yourself, that's just human nature. I doubt this movie would be just as good if it weren't for Mike Nichols directing.<br/><br/>If u need a lot of sugar coated stimuli to like a movie (like a LOT of movies need to have nowadays),then you'll find this movie absolutely boring,the way this movie is told is put in an unconventional way, very raw and ""tells it as it is"" type of movie,the time shift is always being fast forwarded, its not your usual movie, but its one of the few movies I liked so far this year.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts was promoting this film on Oprah(and talking about her pregnancy)she quoted Mike Nicholes for saying in Newsweek about the movie was all about how, ""Sometimes people should shut the F up or shut up about the F""..Oprah had a priceless look her face,who would of thought Julia would be the first guest ever to have a =bleep= on her mouth<br/><br/>*Julias character is someone who's experienced being scared by men emotionally and that radiates in her character.I think she questions inside of her,is she with the man because she wants to be there in that relationship or is it because shes too scared to find and embrace what could ultimately 'be' in another relationship that she wants with another man?<br/><br/>*Jude's character appears confident but deep down he's just an insecure loser,hes just jumping from one girl to another girls cause he fears of being alone and when hes all alone,he'll be forced to face himself and all his insecurities and demons. I think in the beginning he only wanted Julia's character cause he knows he CANT have her, she challenges him and that's attractive to him even though Julia pushes him away.He stays with Natalies character because he needs someone 'weak' and fragile to look down upon cause it somewhat makes him feel better about himself.Hes also a major hypocrite, he reasons to himself its OK for him to cheat with other people but its not OK for other people cheat on him.He says towards the end of the film that hes addicted to the truth and Natalie's character finally delivers him just that at the end.<br/><br/>*Natalie's character is the classic prostitute girl character who's with a man she knows is bad for her but cant help but stay in the relationship,she has the desire to love and has the capability of finding love but is searching for it in all the wrong places.Even though if its poisoning her, she still says with Judes character cause at least she feels needed by him.At the end of the film she finally learns whats good for herself,she sees the fragility of Jude which breaks down her illusion on who she thought Jude was in the beginning and that enables her to come to the awareness that what she needs cannot be found in the hands of another<br/><br/>*Clive is someone I can relate to A LOT.Circumstances that follow him in the movie allow him to see that hes not at all in control on what goes around him,and maybe that isn't such a bad thing after all, Julia cheats on him and realizes her alleged crap doesn't have to really reflect on his character at all but still he cant bring himself to letting her go .He feels deceived and it just kills him that someone would treat him that.Hes able to forgive Julia cause he sees shes the one that's lost and confused ,not him."
"Luke99","7","1","2","6 January 2005"," Great Art But Hard on the Heart
","Closer to me was a very well done film. The acting was excellent (epsecially Owen and Portman), the writing was top notch and the understated cinematography fit the story perfectly. As well done as the film was however, because of its dark content and the lack of a likable character, I have to say I did not really enjoy the movie. I highly respect it as art and would score it very high for quality. But if one is looking for a ""pick me up"" do not see Closer. In its complex content surrounding almost exclusively the sexual aspects of relationships, the film pulls few punches. Owen comments in the movie, ""the heart looks like a fist with blood on it."" That is how I felt after leaving the theater, a person departing with a wounded heart."

","OK, I'll be honest with you, my girlfriend dragged me to see this. I am glad she did. One, this movie will force you to examine you definition of love. Two, the script writer is a superb observer of human personality-this is coming from a trainer therapist. If anything, this movie was excellent at examining motivations, regard and other components of human attachment.Three, the acting really shined-albeit Julia Roberts and Jude were somewhat of the weaker link. Natalie Portman-superb-there were some comments below about her being immature etc-SHE PLAYS A 21 YEAR OLD! She played her role to the tee, slightly naive, a bit Lolitaish and very vulnerable. I've sen Clive in other movies, and this is his best so far. I am glad he had it in him-the well meaning Neanderthal. The other two-I would give them a B+. I guess Jude has always done well as a narcissist, perhaps it's the dependent part of him in this movie that was a little shaky. So, to summarize -go see this, it will exceed your expectations."

You do get hooked in to the lives of these 4 people...but in my personal opinion the movie stunk.<br/><br/>I walked out wondering what the heck the point of the movie was. Basically it centered around 4 weak-minded and insecure personalities with no morals or values who exhibited total lack of judgment and conviction in their commitments. <br/><br/>It's mind boggling to me how such creative and talented actors could get sucked into a movie like this.

"Chickibidi","10","1","2","29 December 2004"," An Honest look at love and relationships
","I saw Closer yesterday. I can't stop thinking about it. The more time that passes, the more obsessed I am with it's honesty and sincerity.<br/><br/>It's not a matter of ""liking"" or ""hating"" the movie as much as it is a matter of understanding. Either you get it, or you don't. The people who have given this movie poor reviews probably just don't get it and understand the beauty in it's complexity, and yet still simplicity.<br/><br/>The movie fed you no BS. It wasn't the typical story of ""if you're good and moral than good things happen to you, and if you are bad and immoral than nothing will work out for you"".<br/><br/>The entire movie was originally a play, with four characters. The amazing thing to me is that the movie stayed true to the play. With only four characters. No one else was in this movie. Everyone else was extra's with no lines, take away two people who had one line, but that was it.<br/><br/>It took place over four years of lies and honesty in all the wrong places. Going from being head over heels in love to lying blatantly to that persons face, and the very real, very human reaction of selfishness. That as much as you love a person and as honest as you may have always been, when you do something wrong, the human reaction is to skip over it, lie, and with a fake smile hope everything works out in the end.<br/><br/>For some, it works out in the end. And for others it doesn't.<br/><br/>This movie was also honest about sex. What sex means, what sex is, and that we are animals, essentially following a scent to get what we ultimately need to thrive on. Reproduction, or the ultimate form of entertainment - call it what you like. Sex is what makes relationships. It's emotions that are secondary. And often we trick ourselves into thinking that Love is Enough.<br/><br/>I left not questioning my relationship, but rather examining it. You leave this movie with a sense of dysfunction and unsettlement. Nothing but disease (and that's dis-ease, not the illness). You can either look at your thoughts as questioning - which is negative, or examining - which is a little more positive. And all I can think is how we just never know who we are sleeping with. And what they are capable of. Do they lie over little things, and if so than do they lie over the big things that we just never find out about? Go see this movie. It's incredibly well done. If you're new to ""love"", my immediate reaction is to say that you won't like it because you just won't understand it. But I think you should see it all the more so you know what you are getting into, and what to avoid at all costs. If you have been in a series of relationships, and had at least one that was dysfunctional (as I firmly believe every relationship has it's dysfunctions - I don't know one relationship that doesn't) than this movie will have you on the edge of your seat. And probably up all night in your own personal study of your own love life, behavior in relationships, and attitude toward your partner. Which I think you will find in the end that while you leave the theatre with the sense of disease, your attitude in the end will change to a higher level of respect."
"laciecat","Null","1","2","20 December 2004"," Think my viewing was flawed
","Did I miss a scene? Saw the movie today and there was a scene where Clive Owens opens the door to the strip club, then there was a motion and then it went to another location/scene. Some of you have mentioned a scene at the strip club. Was there something that happened there? I'm gonna take issue with the theater if so. There were several weird cuts in my showing. <br/><br/>The film brought up the way that men can be so focused on the sexual details of the betrayal. Women are drawn in to other relationships for mostly other reasons. Needing truer intimacy, fascination with another personality, etc., and even when they express what they are missing and why the betrayed man tends to go back to- is he a better lay? Usually that has nothing to do with it. Men and women are just different. It seemed like Alice wanted to be loved and Anna was attracted to the more artistic temperament, temporarily. The men argued the sex card.<br/><br/>I thought this film brought up a lot of gutsy relationship points. Wish there were more like it."
"CAOP","8","1","2","11 December 2004"," Pretty good, not great
","I am a fan of movies like Welcome to the Dollhouse, In The Company of Men, Friends & Neighbors, Happiness, etc. I often like movies that show some of the ugliness that human beings possess (I know that I am in the minority on that) and that is what I like about Closer. Relationships can be quite pathetic, and this movie explores that. I'd say that, for better and worse, Closer is a slicker, more poetic and less gritty companion to the aforementioned movies.<br/><br/>Reading some of the reviews here, I think Julia Roberts and Jude Law drew in some people looking for Pretty Woman II or something. Trust me, there is nothing pretty about this movie. Personally, I found the language and sexuality extremely inoffensive."
"bpfenzel-2","Null","1","2","6 December 2004"," The irony of the title ***moderate spoilers***
","The title is clearly intended to mask the truth about this people. It seems like manipulation and deceit far exceed the desire to be loved and love in return. This film is about as flawed as its characters. In the end, it's so weighed down by its headiness and desire for purpose that it never gels into anything refreshing or honest. Though, I would classify it as a disappointment before I would call it a failure. I has a few successful performances, particularly by Clive Owen & Natalie Portman, and the interest over the outcome of these characters is maintained pretty much throughout. This is due mostly to the shifting time sequence which is, unfortunately, one of the few things outside of the acting that comes off naturally in the film. The dialogue should have been updated to match a more naturalistic approach that stage to screen adaptations require. The playwright clearly wasn't budging when adapting his own material, and that's the movie's greatest weakness. Jude Law is sufficient yet his character is given few moments to break out of his desperate skin. Julie Robert's depiction of Anna is sympathetic albeit a bit lazy. She was truly miscast which seems to be the consensus regarding this choice. Overall, none of the choices that the characters make ring true, and a lot is left unexamined despite the neat theatricality of its ending. A few questions remain. Why did Alice lie about her name? Why did Anna choose the one she clearly didn't love?"

"ortenzia","Null","1","2","6 December 2004"," Nobody, not even the viewer, is going to get Closer.
","'Closer' is ultimately about 4 peoples' bony lust for sex and possession of a member of the opposite sex to the point where they will destroy the relationship they are already in, not to mention their own self-respect and better judgment, and they will do this all without ever really ever achieving intimacy with anyone. Thus, you could say the play and now film is really a take on the neurotic self, the self that really only considers its own heart and its own needs. <br/><br/>However, the very flaw of the characters is the flaw of the film. Whereas the characters can't ever achieve real intimacy, the viewers can't ever achieve true understanding of what is going on inside these people. And since all you have is people, beautiful people in beautiful places, there's not much to this film at all.<br/><br/>This can be blamed mostly on the fact that this film runs like a highlight reel of bad relationships over a 4 year period. You see conclusions, major fights or interactions and meetings and break-ups. You never really get to see the thought process of the character and why they ultimately make the decisions they make (whether it is boredom or lust, whether it is spite or genuine need). Instead, you are forced to gleam these ideas from the portrayals.<br/><br/>In other words, it's an actors own wet dream. None more so than Natalie Portman. In what she will look back on and thank for years to come as it stands out in that rather large gap of quality between 'The Professional' and everything before this. I have never been much of a fan, but her performance is brilliant. I doubt any one could have done better.<br/><br/>In the same hand, Clive Owen gives a balls-to-the-wall performance. If anything, he should get an Oscar nod for being the only actor to have the courage to play this with such unabashed virility and verisimilitude. He does not shy away from asking explicit sexual details about his wifes' affair or tearing out the heart of the man she had the affair with, he marks his territory and then fights for it with spit and iron. Yet, the true joy in his performance is that there is absolutely no sarcasm in it  unlike T.J. Mackey (another great alpha male character), there is nothing that is performed about Larry and that is indeed a beautiful thing to watch.<br/><br/>Jude Law plays the straight-man, the pseudo romantic/wimbly writer who is ultimately the play thing in their games. He is mindful of this and continues on in his streak of good performances in good films. I would have preferred the raw emotion he expressed in 'Cold Mountain' to be channeled in this as well but at no time did I want for a different actor to come in.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts, on the other hand, could have greatly benefited (so could the film) from stepping out of this film. I can see why she wanted to do this. I just can't see why anyone would let her. I can see what she should have been through Larry's exposition, but never once did I see it from the performance. It is especially difficult because the scene in which Larry and Alice confront each other in the strip club is such a masterful scene, it makes Larry and Anna's own confrontation almost laughable.<br/><br/>All in all, I doubt the words or the situations will shock you very much although they are far from the norm. You can open your email box these days and see worse in the Spam folder. However, that is the problem  it is not the situations which are truly of interest, it is the reasons people get themselves into these situations and that process is left out entirely. Thus, the movie does not speak to really anything other than exhibiting screwed up people doing screwed up things. I think with a little more digging and some slowing down to show a key week or a thought process, the audience would have most likely seen a little of themselves in the characters even if they judged them as 'screwed up.' <br/><br/>As a result, even the audience cannot get closer to the characters and that doesn't come off as anything more than frustrating and all the effort of great performances, pushing the Sex and the City train of sex chat, right down to Jude Law's attempt to look like a working class Joe are lost completely on what might of a been a truly brilliant film.

Its origins as a play are very evident. There is hardly anyone else of significance in the movie except these four characters. The writing and acting are engrossing. You will come out of the theater wanting to talk to someone about love, betrayal and relationships. Natalie Portman has grown to be quite and actress. Julia Roberts shows herself here to be capable of more than a pretty smile and lighthearted comedies. Jude Law is very attractive and you can see what these women see in him.

"davethemathtutor","2","1","3","21 November 2019"," A dismal failure
","Mike Nichols directed this drama about romantic entanglements among four individuals: a wannabe novelist who makes ends meet by writing obituaries (Jude Law); a fairly gorgeous young stripper (Natalie Portman); a somewhat older but still gorgeous photographer (Julia Roberts); and a doctor specializing in plastic surgery (Clive Owen). With that kind of cast and director, I expected a lot. Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>The movie is set in London, and the two men are English. The two women are Americans, and they bounce back and forth between the two men in a way that seems so arbitrary it might as well be a coin toss. There was even a point near the beginning when I thought the two women were going to start kissing, and the relations between the two guys have some distinctly overtones too (their initial encounter is online, with the writer masquerading as a sex-hungry woman); but none of the same-sex stuff ever blossomed.<br/><br/>Maybe that's just as well. Why add in more relationships, when the ones already there are so awful? Everybody's pretending to be sexually exclusive, and they're all lying; betrayals large and small abound. They all claim to be madly in love with whichever partner they're with at the moment, but they turn it on and off like a faucet. Perhaps this is intended as a cynical view of contemporary relationships, but it just comes across as unbelievable, only-in-the-movies stuff. Likewise the overly cutesy dialogue, which sounds like it was written by Oscar Wilde on an off day.<br/><br/>It's not just the falling in and out of love; in every way, these characters' emotions and statements and actions bounce around unpredictably, like nobody in real life outside of maybe a psych ward.<br/><br/>The title is weird too. Why is this movie called Closer, when none of the characters ever seem to really get close at all? It's a mystery.<br/><br/>With a cast of pros like these, the acting is pretty good. It even garnered some acclaim; Portman and Owen were Oscar-nominated, and won Golden Globes, for their acting. But good acting can't make up for an atrocious script like this one. (Incredibly, the movie also picked up some Best Screenplay and Best Director nominations. I assume these came from people who were so bedazzled by the big names, they couldn't even see the crap in front of them.)<br/><br/>One thing the movie is good for is plenty of eye candy. Playing the stripper, Natalie Portman's body is very much on display. And I gotta say, she has a very cute behind. In fact her derriere is what boosts this movie from a one star rating to two stars.<br/><br/>Long ago, Mike Nichols made some terrific movies. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and The Graduate stand out as classics. But Closer is a strong contender for the Golden Turkey award.<br/><br/>All in all: A shameful waste of solid talent."

"atlasmb","8","1","3","1 October 2017"," In The Name Of Truth
","""Closer"" is a film that inescapably feels like a work by David Mamet. It is very wordy. The characters speak their feelings and their words feel important, rife with both surface and underground content. As such, the film is not for everyone. Its stylized conversations can feel artificial, though they are revealing and they honor truth above all else. Patrick Marber crafted the play and this adaptation.<br/><br/>As the film follows its characters in and out of relationships, it puts truth on a pedestal, sacrifices its participants on the altar of truth, extracts from them glimpses into the true nature of man and woman.<br/><br/>The cast features Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen. Who could ask for more? They play four people of principle, who can change course on an emotional dime. Still, games are played between them, trying to save themselves or others from cruel truths. And the truths are always there to be seen if one is watching closely. Director Mike Nichols gives us an unvarnished look into the eyes of his cast.<br/><br/>All four protagonists are sadists and masochists, punishing themselves for their perceived sins, punishing each other as well, perhaps as another means of punishing themselves. Natalie Portman's Alice is a real heartbreaker, calling on the slave (to beauty) and the savior in all of us.<br/><br/>I am rating this film a ""8"", but I know I will eventually see it multiple times and I expect that grade to increase as its meanings reveal themselves to me. In the service of honesty, I must declare it."

","Mike Nichols' Closer is the story of a jagged love square between four very different and cynical individuals. Whether its the great acting or the extremely suggestive subject matter, there is just something so satisfying and enjoyable about watching other people's relationship complications.<br/><br/>Closer isn't even close to being a perfect film, but it's certainly an enjoyable one. I had a hell of a time with Closer and was fully engrossed with it's purposely flawed characters and it's great balance of tense drama and questionable humor.<br/><br/>Closer features four very talented actors at the helm of the project. Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law and Clive Owen all share roughly the same amount of screen time, but each of their characters are developed differently, giving us four emotionally problematic characters to connect with. While the bold and sometimes shocking acts that these characters commit make it kind of hard to directly relate to them as people, the acting displayed here is so colorful and refreshingly honest that it's hard not to feel connected to them, whether it's by pity or compassion. Jude Law and Julia Roberts are certainly the two most emotionally damaged characters of the film and that shows in their performances. Jude Law acts almost childish at times, which sometimes works in his favor, but mostly just makes us feel pity for his sniveling. Julia Roberts, on the other hand, attempts to be the adult in most situations but her actions only come across as steely and ice-cold, which conveniently also describes her facial expressions. <br/><br/>Despite these two entertaining performances, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman are the clear powerhouses of talent in the film. Clive Owen manages to create such a sleazy and manipulating character that is so incredibly unlikable that it's honestly quite impressive. It was hard to ignore the fact that I wanted to see his character more, despite how grossly back-stabbing and ignorant he is. This brings us to Natalie Portman. Natalie Portman is easily one of my favorite actresses and I must say that she is at the top of her game here. Her character has so many layers of emotion and personality that it's hard not to commemorate her performance here as she managed to pull off every one of the many shades of emotion with such grace and honesty.<br/><br/>While the story is admittedly quite silly, it never gets to the point of unbearably fictional. Despite it's repetitive and unrealistic nature, the story never felt too far fetched as the dramatic performances helped quite a bit to ground the film in some solid probability. The script however threatens to uproot these dramatic performances as it is almost laughably unnatural. There were times where I questioned if the writers were ever even in real relationships before as almost everything these characters say is either ridiculously dirty or just plain stupid. Even this talented cast couldn't completely sell this strange and unnatural script. It's a shame that we couldn't get a less juvenile script, but the cast involved did the best job they could with the subject matter they were given. <br/><br/>Closer is a very bold and unrelenting drama. All these characters acted with such ferocity and cynicism, making the entire experience seductively compelling. I couldn't help but be intrigued by the dysfunctionality of these characters' relationships. Despite it's unnatural and juvenile script, the actions of the characters really displayed enough emotion already. Closer is a film that I had a ton of fun watching and will probably soon revisit. Not only was I satisfied by the film's ending, but I was extremely grateful that I have never met people like the film's characters or experienced problematic relationships on their scale. For this, I feel eternally grateful."

","Closer Is A Misunderstood Film,But Not In The Good Way,So Here's The Deal:<br/><br/>First off let's talk about the acting,The performances are fine but they're not the best you will see in your life,Jude Law,Clive Owen,Natalie Portman And Julia Roberts try their best to make you believe the characters,but if you're like me you'll find that a bit difficult,And in my Opinion that's the Film's biggest problem,It can't make you believe the characters it has created because to be honest they do some ridiculous stuff that just take away that sense of trust in you.The problem aren't the actors but in my opinion the script writer and the director.In this film you're somewhat tricked into thinking that you're seeing a complex rich film,No the thing you're seeing is in fact a very confused film,See Oliver Stone once said ""When You look At A Movie You Look At A Directors's Thought Process"" i think in this movie director Mike Nichols keeped changing his mind between takes and you can clearly see his disarranged thought process.The writing i have to say is very inconsistent,In some dialogues you just want to applaud the writing(The Julia Roberts And Clive Owen One)and in some cases you just become bored,A good point in the film is that it demands your full attention almost throughout the whole of it and sometimes it actually doesn't disappoint,For example this movie slides through time without warning so if you're not the type to pay attention you might get very confused and in the end you will not understand it<br/><br/>Closer is not a horrible film,It's not a masterpiece either.it's a film that could have been a much better one had the director and the writer trusted each other a bit more"
"christophe92300","2","1","3","5 June 2013"," Empty
","The quartet of actors augured good things but the only thing the viewer is left with when the credits start rolling is incomprehension.<br/><br/>Because the movie boils down to a succession of empty, endless scenes, oozing arrogance, where the dialogues are ultra verbose and the mise-en-scène flat. You never get carried away by these crossed liaisons because the plot is much too far-fetched and uninteresting, you are bored to death from start to finish, much like the actors that seem completely unconvinced by what they are playing. To make things worse, the choice of the vulgarity, probably emphasized to add an impertinent aspect to the movie, stands out too much and turns out to be totally incomprehensible.<br/><br/>There is clearly nothing to save from this movie which main characteristic is its vacuity indeed."
"skay_baltimore","2","1","3","26 January 2013"," Star studded cast; cosmic, galactic failure
","Wow. I can't recall another film with such big name stars that was such a complete, utter failure from start to finish. The only thing that's worse than this film is the praise and the money this train wreck has managed to earn. As dcloysmith already pointed out...there is not one single frame in this 100+ minute movie that even resembles a human emotion or action. And that's hard to accomplish, when you think about it.<br/><br/>The screenplay; the acting; the plot -- EVERYTHING about this film just cries out for help. Loudly. In fact, I felt a throbbing in my head and a queasiness in my gut 15 minutes into this thing. And it just got worse as the time, which ground down to a paralytic crawl, dragged on.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong. ALL relationships deal with fidelity issues. ALL relationships have their ups and downs and their trials and tribulations. But ""Closer"" is such a stilted, distorted, absurd view of these issues that it would rival a child's Saturday afternoon cartoon for pure silliness. So unless you're a total masochist, or are on a life support system after having been declared legally brain dead, do something else -- ANYTHING else -- with 100 minutes of your life; 100 minutes you'll never get back, but wish you had, if you decide to watch ""Closer""."
"fb-851-209777","8","1","3","22 September 2010"," Psychologically revealing...
","Must say those adults behave like 16year-olds... In my feeling the issue is not whether telling a fact, i.e. ""telling the truth"" but how to behave in a way that is truthful to the person one loves. They (all 4) seem to be able to switch their feelings, esp. ""Love"" in a very short time and use this word so abundantly that is remains a word... without them ever being able to see the mystery that lies in that feeling. What they feel is attraction. Thay all lack deep respect for themselves and the other - that's why their relationship offers are very limited and all is just messed up from the start ;) At least that's what I think.<br/><br/>From my personal experience I might say that it is most important to not have ""overlaps"" between relations - if there is ever more than one in a lifetime - what probably might be the case in our societies nowadays. Leaving time for feelings to change. No overlap in a physical relationship also will make the whole topic of being truthful easy... there simply is nothing to tell what might affect the ancient trust by a partner. If that is gone once it will never be restored.<br/><br/>The girl with the short hair actually suffers from Boderline Personality Disorder. That is a common result from her activity to serve unknown people in a sexualized manner. Normally childhood abuse comes before that. Remember the red short hair? That was ""the rebel"". Having been in a relation with ""kinda boyfriend"" before coming to UK. He pimped her. She can switch her feelings quickly. She is not stable. After he left her she fell back to receive self-esteem from working in night clubs. That's frequent. Her ""partner"" accepted her working in that area during the relationship - remember in the end he asks her when she would quit. She replies ""soon"". So he is so deeply disturbed in his relation behavior that it hurts...<br/><br/>The doctor is the possessive/aggressive type. He got his ""property"" back and will punish her for what she did to him from time to time to satisfy his sadistic needs to degrade women and treat them like a ""whore"" as taking revenge for something that happened to him from his mother's side."

","This was an interesting find on IFC I did a bit of research on why this title was chosen, I learned this is not a small independent film with a budget of 27 million. Although I can see this being an independent film in the aspect that it's producer Mike Nichols (I) may have been looked at like he was an outcast from Hollywood and I believe he may have desperately needed this motion picture to take him to an acceptable level among corporate executives at Los Angeles Studios, he got lucky with a push in New York on this one to keep his career going. I feel as this was the right way to send his future in a positive direction.Especially with the plunge he took from Primary Colors *dated 3/4/2010, He must have decided to take a break on filming as IMDb has no other traces of his name to any future or current projects."
"TheLittleSongbird","6","1","3","23 October 2009"," Good acting, good script, but poor pacing and sluggish direction spoil it
","I like some romantic comedies like the Holiday and Love Actually, but I was disappointed in Closer. It wasn't terrible, but it was very disappointing. It does benefit from a very good acting ensemble. Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law and Clive Owen all give very creditable performances, Owen the standout of the four. They are helped by an above average script, that is surprisingly intelligent. The cinematography is beautiful, fluid and sensitive.<br/><br/>However, there were a number of things that made Closer disappointing for me. The biggest problem was the pace; the film is at approximation just under two hours, however the film takes a long time to get going, and the pace is very uneven, sadly it never recovers. The direction from Mike Nicolls is very sluggish, and lacked credibility. I will admit I liked the premise of Closer, but when I got round to seeing the film, its structure is disappointingly episodic and even underdeveloped. My next complaint is more of a semi-complaint. I really liked the overall music, but I disliked the song at the beginning. I think that was mainly to do with the singing voice of the vocalist, I found it very flat for my musical ears.<br/><br/>All in all, Closer isn't a bad movie. Unfortunately, despite the fine acting ensemble, there were a number of things that didn't work for me. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","1","3","18 August 2009"," A true Masterpiece.
","Closer is a true masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, then you must sit down and watch it. Even if you don't like it, you have to watch it because it's such a good damn movie. It was only nominated for two Oscars, and both nominations were reasonable. Every performance in the film is fantastic. Usually for some films it takes such a big cast to keep a film going. That's not the case with Closer. Closer keeps it together anyways, cast or no cast, it's a great film that doesn't need the cast to keep it together. Closer has everything to keep it together. The Cast of four is fantastic, including: Jude Law(The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Holiday) Julia Roberts(Erin Brockovich, Notting Hill) Natile Portman(V for Vendetta, The newer Star wars films) Clive Owen(The International, Duplicity) I know that's a fantastic cast. Closer doesn't have any flaws, and it's one of the rare love dramas for Adults. There are a lot, but closer is a pro adult film. I insist you don't watch it with children, though you could show them how great it is. Kids may not understand Closer, but they will someday. Closer is a fantastic film without a doubt."

","Closer is close to a ten!! I don't really like this kind of movies but when i heard Clive Owen was in it, i knew i had to see this one and no mistake there. It is hard to say if the actors higher the script or the script higher the actors. Lets just say they higher each other in this British masterpiece. The greatest one is Natalie Portman as an ex-stripper. I had high expectations on Clive Owen but he still surprise me. This is the only film where i can stand watch Julia Roberts. Jude Law is the only one that is just okay. It is interesting how the genders war against each other and how no one really wins. Like the script vs the actors with the only difference that they all are winners."
"tnrcooper","8","1","3","2 May 2007"," Tired formulaic drama enlivened by excellent acting (J.R. excepted)
","To be honest, I was a bit disappointed by this movie. It was rich, stupid people acting stupidly and self-indulgently and then wondering why they hurt. That said, the acting, Julia Roberts excepted, is cathartic and rescues what could be a dull, particularly inert, self- indulgent film. From glancing over several of the comments, this film apparently first existed as a play. This seems sensible; the film is set in close quarters and thereby its existence as a play seems sensible. Two of the characters I found sympathy for and two of them I found really abhorrent. Julia Roberts' Anna is an artist who has very little will of her own. Jude Law is a deceitful, manipulative con-man struggling journalist named Dan who will engage in almost any ruse to get a woman in bed. Natalie Portman's Alice is a free-spirited stripper who is open-minded but ultimately lonely and while she might be able to maintain her independence and playfulness for some time, makes bad decisions in the end based on her need for companionship. Finally, Clive Owen's Larry is a blunt-speaking doctor who is possibly honest to a fault. He outlines his love for a woman also too early and his seemingly deep wells of passion possibly unnerve women who look for an ulterior motive when he is really just a straight-shooter. Initially, Dan charms Alice and they stay together for some while. However, on a routine errand, Dan becomes involved with Anna and while she seems uncomfortable with the arrangement, they nevertheless become involved in a high-wire particularly explosive relationship. Larry is a rock but flirts with Alice after learning where she works from speaking to Anna. Their interaction is flirtatious and electric, indeed, this reflecting on the stellar abilities of Owen and Portman, but not combustible. This is just flirting by people who are very good at it. Their relationship is consequently not as fiery or combative. In contrast, the tempestuousness of Dan and Anna's relationship and their dishonesty with their partners takes a toll on them and their relationship. <br/><br/>The endgame seems to be a fair resolution of their behavior up to that point. The performances are all fantastic, except, as mentioned Julia Roberts. She seems to have only one mode in this film and it is morose. While of course that is fine for some of the film, there are electric moments of transcendence and passion when it would seem that her million-dollar grin and some of her famous charm might have made more of a display. Clive Owen lends a great deal of honesty, charm, and possibly desperation underlying it all, and Natalie Portman is electric as a vivacious and charismatic, if achingly insecure girl. Jude Law has never played such a deplorable character. His character is such a chauvinistic, two-faced cad one wonders that any woman would be deceived. However, it is testament to the desperation of the female characters in the movie and Law's considerable charm that he is able to sell this combination of characteristics as a successful ladies' man. <br/><br/>Again, the story is rather formulaic-successful if conflicted people who behave as though they own the world and take chances with other peoples' hearts and then are surprised when they find themselves in pain and hurting others. However, as mentioned (and the directing is good. Mike Nichols allows his talented actors to work their magic here and lets the story tell itself) the galvanic acting ultimately distinguishes this film."

"Davalon-Davalon","5","1","3","5 December 2006"," Strange and sad
","At first I was enthralled with this film, as I could (perhaps sadly) clearly recognize all the emotions of the participants, those emotions having to do with loving someone and having an affair with another person, i.e. actually loving two people in different ways. It reinforced my feeling that one person is not enough; that we do need others for different things in our life, a main one being sex.<br/><br/>I also had to say that I thought it was clever how any other person who was absolutely not essential was excised from the scene. You were aware that other people existed in the world of these four very troubled individuals (Julia, Jude, Natalie, Clive), but that no one and nothing else mattered except them.<br/><br/>As the film went on, though, I was struck by slopping editing, too bright or unrealistic lighting, inexplicable shots (the most disturbing being when Natalie was at the door in Jude's apartment, the camera first was behind them, showing them standing at the door naturally; then, suddenly the camera did a close-up on Natalie, then continued to cut back and forth between those two angles -- it looked awkward and unnatural). In addition, the dialog was so terse that while it might have sounded great on a stage, on screen it was like, ""People don't talk like this!"" Natalie's lines, in particular, were mainly one-word responses like, ""Irrelevant!"" -- It got old fast, and it did not remotely seem real.<br/><br/>The actors did a good job, but the only one who I found believable was Clive Owen, and I liked his character the least (I guess he must have been doing a great job). He was a pathetic, misogynistic, sex addict who desperately needed love and yet was a cruel, sad excuse for a man. <br/><br/>Jude has a distinctive style that sets him apart from other actors -- he somehow seems to inhabit his own universe and I always feel lucky to be invited into it, even if it's for a brief two hours. I felt he was quite vulnerable and he was given the unfortunate job of participating in two plot points that I found absolutely unbelievable: 1) In a borderline (intentionally) humorous ""sex chat"" between him and Clive (Clive thinking that he's a woman), he ""sets up"" a meeting for them. Clive shows up and who does he find (the person he is supposed to): Julia. Well, unless Jude was living inside Julia's mind and could also predict the next 24 hours of her life, there is no way in hell he would have known where she was going to be, so this was totally absolutely unrealistic. I didn't buy it for a second; and 2)That he, an obituary writer had written some book about Natalie's (""Alice"") life -- okay, fair enough, but then the book comes and goes (it's a bomb apparently), and he goes back to being an obit writer. I did not get a remote sense that he had written anything and the film asks us to believe that Julia Roberts is photographing him for the book's jacket cover... and we have to ascertain all this information and details as it's presented to us all out of context... and then, at some point later, when it becomes clear that the book has bombed (we never see a copy and only hear that it tell's ""Alice's"" story), we are asked to accept that Jude goes back to his obit writing as if nothing had ever happened and as if nothing will ever happen again. I got no sense of him as anything, except when he was sitting for Julia's photos. It was the only moment in the film where he seems to be truly alive -- perhaps that was the point, I don't know.<br/><br/>As for Natalie, I was actually saddened to see her in this film. She is so beautiful, not in a sexual way, but in a kind, honest, truthful way, and so much better than almost every script she's been given... that I just couldn't understand why she did this part. I could not accept for a heartbeat that she was a stripper. She looks like someone who might be engaged in a good will cause, or dishing out food at a soup kitchen. She did not convey anything remotely sexual, and seeing her slip into a G-string only made me think she was some kind of exotic animal that had been trapped and forced to perform a trick. I really disagree with the casting on this part.<br/><br/>And for Julia: I have to say that I was shocked that Julia Roberts took part in this film, because she strikes me as being an actress that has a legacy to protect, someone like an Audrey Hepburn. In other words, the last thing I want to associate with Julia is a scene where she talks about Jude Law's cum being sweeter than Clive Owen's. Also, she looked tired, depressed, sad, older... all the things she perhaps was supposed to look like/be... but I also got a ""What the hell did I agree to do?"" look running across her face for the majority of the film. I believe Julia is capable of something much greater, but I don't think she's gotten close since ""Erin Brockovich."" At any rate, ultimately, the supposedly clever dialog of this film and these people's ultimately pointless lives makes one (or at least me) walk away saying, ""And...? Who cares?"""

","After seeing scores of so-called R-rated movies that seemed more targeted to teenagers than adults, I really appreciated the refreshing change of ""Closer."" This layered, subtle, sexy drama demonstrated the tangled web woven by men and women in relationships, without being the least bit soapy or melodramatic. This is attributable, I think, to the impressive cast of actors in the movie. They did an excellent job of portraying the multi-dimensional, real, and flawed characters in ""Closer."" Julia Roberts pushed the acting envelope in this movie showing that, while she may still be one of ""America's sweethearts,"" she is up to the task of playing in imperfect woman with a dark side. Clive Owen--with his brooding good looks and intense acting style--was perfectly cast in this movie. Natalie Portman displayed an acting sophistication far beyond her years, capturing her the dueling aspects of her character: the lost little girl vs. the woman who wears her sexuality like a mask to avoid true intimacy. If you're looking for a solid drama with the plot/character development and maturity to captivate an adult audience, then ""Closer"" is your movie."

This movie should a lesson for all pretentious film students--it should be shown to every film student in the world as one of, if not the worst Hollywood movies ever made--filled with god-awful claptrap.

It could have been anyone and it would still be horrible. The movie seemed like it would never end. It was filled with silence. Silence can be a powerful tool, but this was not one of those times. I never wanted to see that much of Natalie Portman's behind, and I never EVER want to see the word perineum in a movie for as long as I live. It was vile! <br/><br/>If you are willing to disregard the poorness of the movie, there is some sort of moral lesson here. But I don't think it's necessary to watch the movie to get the point- don't cheat, don't be deceptive. I can't BELIEVE that this movie has received so much acclaim. It has no climatic moments whatsoever. I swayed between pitying the characters for being hurt and pitying them for being so miserably dull and sad. I can't believe all these big names read this script and thought ""OH! This is amazing, it will help my career and display my talents!"" It was embarrassing to watch. (And I am young and this type of thing wouldn't normally rustle my feathers.) <br/><br/>10 Minutes in, I wanted to go see a different movie, and the feeling only grew."

","Mike Nichols (""Angels in America"") directs this adaptation of Patrick Marber's stage play, starring Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen. One can easily see the play's theatrical origins, given its focus on dialog and the existence of only four real characters. ""Closer"" is a sexually graphic (mostly in terms of dialog) film, and contains four superb performances, especially from Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. Roberts and Law, the real movie stars, give very good performances, but they're outdone by their lesser-known costars. Clive Owen really steals the show, as the brutish Larry. Given that all four characters are horrible individuals, one can't help but root for the one who seems to be enjoying it the most."

Closer is far from this. This film is honest, brutally honest, it is shocking yet it does not shock, this film exists, it does not scream onto the screen or dig at your emotions, it does not try to move you yet does, it is a chunk of four lives shown to us in a way we have never seen before, no glorified love story, no simple ending, no ending at all really, you know that these characters can live without the film, they still exist, their lives still happen after the credits roll. i was moved, seriously moved by it, and amazed afterwards that i wasn't shocked by the language or the content and not because i have been de-sensitised to this sort of thing but because it is language that is used every day and content that you see everyday. i was truly amazed by this film, the only word i can use for it is brutal, brutal and honest. it made me look at myself, my relationships, the way i behave. but above all it is the first film i have ever seen that is 100% BELIEVABLE."

","I saw ""Closer"" today and found it to be a total waste of time and talent. I decided to stay through the end of the film hoping that there might be some redeeming point, but unfortunately I found none. The issues raised in the lives of these four most unsympathetic characters may be of interest to some niche population out there but I really doubt if there was any resonance with most ""normal"" people. Observing the audience after the showing, most were in a hurry to leave, many with a glazed look, some just sleepy. No one, including myself, was curious enough to stay for the credits.<br/><br/>As a long time admirer of Mike Nichols since the great Nichols and May days, I can't help wondering why the director of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, The Graduate, Catch 22, Primary Colors, and Angels in America would want to be associated with this thing. I suspect that some of the players, like Julia Roberts, only agreed to participate because of Mr. Nichols involvement and, possibly, some misguided attempt at pushing the envelope of American cinema. It didn't work."

Even if you have had no previous experience in this particular area of life, a little thing we call love, the way in which you know the turmoil and the pain that is tearing the characters apart little by little, is astounding.<br/><br/>A stunning movie where reality comes to the big screen.

","Mike Nichols' version of the play ""Closer"" is one of 2004s most engrossing films with its sharp dialogue and astonishing performances. Everything about this film cuts to the core of the viewer. We watch as two couples, both formed by chance meetings find themselves involved in adultery and manipulation. Each character claims to love their companion, but at the same point they are willing to use them for sexual gratification and deceit. The performances by Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman are sterling. However, the best comes from Clive Owen who delivers his dialogue with such ferocity that he strikes at the audience as well. You cannot help but be taken aback by how emotionally charged and powerful Owen's acting iscertainly worth his award for Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globes and his Oscar nomination, as well."

I would recommend this movie for those who had some bad relationships in their life. The movie really captures the essence of life, in my view. Some might find it to be a bit trashy and maybe even stupid. However, I think that it is very perceptive. The performances are OK, and the costumes are great.

","Jude Law gives another strong performance in an otherwise turgid piece of artless ham. Patrick Marber's script contains the sort of 'state of the nation' drivel which was popular amongst literary types in the nineties. It has not aged well. An excruciating piece of Brit-flick 'product', mistaking profundity for profanity, heavy on histrionics and sexual confrontation; an egregious and deeply unconvincing portrait of a London which does not exist outside of the shallow self-referential imagination of the enormously smug Marber. The judgement of the picture's stars must now forever be held in doubt. Jude Law manages to inject some charm and amiability into a role which appears designed solely to humiliate him. Clive Owen (disappointing since Croupier) is a sort of uber-Nic Cage, but overplays the machismo of his stock-in-trade to the near brink of comedy. Natalie Portman is faintly disturbing as the barely legal pole dancer and American enigma. The film is saved by the music of Damien Rice, which provides the first and last scenes with an emotional integrity otherwise entirely absent. But the decision to use The Smiths' How Soon Is Now as the elevator accompaniment to Clive and Natalie's strip club showdown will provoke righteous indignation amongst Morrissey fans. The lyrics are much, much better than the lines the actors are paid to recite."

Jude Law was able to convey weakness and pomposity, Julia Roberts (her best performance EVER) was both selfish and self loathing and academy award nominations for Clive Owen and Natalie Portman serve as the praise for their masterful portrayals.

"leejones_san","10","1","3","16 January 2005"," Modernity, loves, lies and betrayals
","Absolutely top class film, sold out for the second night running when I saw it, which is remarkable for a converted stage play. A chance encounter brings failed writer Dan (Jude Law) and ex-stripper Alice (Natalie Portman) together in London. Their relationship revitalises Dan, who writes a book about her, but soon his affections are straying towards divorcée photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), soon to be involved with cynical dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen) as a result of a revenge-joke played by Dan. The film plots over 4 years of their turbulent inter-relationships, their loves, betrayals, lies, defections, break-ups and reunions.<br/><br/>The cast shone in their roles, the characters carefully constructed so as to attract your fleeting sympathies in one moment, only to be rudely dashed by some horrible act the next, meaning your affections can never settle on a single individual, and dismissing the capacity for moral judgement -- this is a story about real modernity and the flawed, fucked-up characters who inhabit it, the weakness, fallibility and flaws of human passions. Even Larry, played brilliantly by Clive Owen, who is probably the most repugnant of the characters simply for his calculating ability to play the game and succeed, is not without his sympathetic moments, despite his 'caveman' tendencies. Julia Roberts played a very unusual role as washed-out Anna; whilst Al thought her acting was slightly implausible, my view was that Anna's personality was intended to be 'thin', a piece of debris that floats between and is buffeted by various encounters and disasters, hardly in control of her own fate, led by impassioned men. Paul informs me that Owen and Portman have been nominated for all the awards for Closer, but the nominations could easily have been extended to Jude Law (currently the hardest-working actor in Hollywood, surely) and quite possibly to Julia Roberts as well.<br/><br/>Sterling stuff - not affective or life-affirming in the way of a typical Hollywood 'story of romance and passion' as the film has been billed (rather dishonestly, resulting in its surprisingly large audiences), but engrossing, moving, intriguing - a razor-sharp incision into the human condition that asks how much we really know the people we think we love.<br/><br/>Recommended!"

A film where Natalie Portman finally comes into her own, and sheds the Star Wars make-up. Julia Roberts seems to be heading in this ""Indie"" film direction, lately in her career. This was a sure fire win for her. I also enjoyed Clive Owen's disturbing performance. I found myself comparing him with a lot of guys I know, and deep down her represents what a lot of guys are thinking and wanting at times.

","""Closer"" is the story of three self-loathing Londoners and the American waif that turns their lives upside down. Natalie Portman's ""Alice"" comes to London from New York with very little money and no where to go. She meets Jude Law's ""Dan"" on a busy street during his morning commute to work at a London Newspaper where he writes for the Obits page. He had the dream of becoming a writer, but he isn't any good at it, he has no voice and no ideas. Alice and Dan fall in love, she moves into his flat, and he writes a book based on her remarkable and highly sexualized 21 year old life. He gets published and he goes to a photographer to get his picture taken for the book jacket. Dan falls in love with Julia Robert's photog, but the recently divorced ""Anna"" rejects his advances out of a sense of patriotism, and because she ""is not a thief"". And we are introduced to the sex-addicted dermatologist ""Larry"" while he is chatting on an internet casual sex club website. He later meets Anna at the London Aquarium, and yes they fall in love as well. The couples swap pairings and then swap back, and the film focuses on the ugliest parts of relationships, the angry, nasty, hateful and bitter breakups. This isn't Mike Nichols' best work, but that's not really a negative because his resume includes some of the greatest films of all time. There are only four characters in the movie, and Nichols does a wonderful job of letting us really get close and get to know these people. Patrick Marber's dialogue is frank and honest and leaves very little to the imagination. The performances of the actors is what sets this film apart. Especially those of Owen and Portman. Whether Owen is being hurt or he is the one inflicting the emotional pain, he is incredibly in the moment and honest. I haven't seen a better acting performance in anything in the past 10 years. And this is Portman's first real adult role, before she has always played the child trying to make her way in a world of adults, but in this film her innocence is gone, and she possesses all unenviable traits of a beautiful woman that can rip your heart out with one look. The two scenes between Owen and Portman are two of the best in the film. The best is probably Owen's performance in the ""breakup scene"" with he and Julia Roberts. Throughout the life of the scene Owen transforms from pure heart-broken meekness to rage, without missing a beat. Owen should win every award for acting that exists for his performance. Next to the performances, the best thing about the movie is singer/song writer Damien Rice, whose song ""The Blower's Daughter"" bookends the film and transports the audience into a world that initially seems to be a fantasy, but ends up more like a nightmare. I give the ""Closer"" a 9/10, mostly because of the brilliant acting and the films brutal honesty."

I can't imagine other actors to form an ensemble for this movie because portman,roberts, law and owen just have that perfect chemistry on portraying the ""swingers"" in this film.<br/><br/>Roberts' acting was rather dull yet wonderful. When I saw her on the film, i was expecting her to blew me away by shouting a dialog or something that will just basically push you out of your seat. But instead, her silent depressed like lines was just perfect. <br/><br/>Portman just blew me away. She is making a great transition from teen actress into an adult actress. Her acting was terrific and not any scene she was in that I think she have done bad at all.<br/><br/>Law was alright, although i've seen him done better. In my opinion, his character was the weakest of all of them because he doesn't belong to any characteristic group. Is he the sensitive guy? The foul mouthed pervert? Or is he the tough man that would kick ass? <br/><br/>Owen is making a name because I thought he just carried the whole film. His acting and the character he played, revealed the sick and twisted world of love. He just basically showed the whole world that he's the ""expert"" in this film because he's been acting his character in the Broadway for many months.<br/><br/>For the script, it was well written and well noted with consideration of different language difference here in England. Every line seems to be a memorable quote of this film.<br/><br/>I can definitely see this film winning acting awards and maybe motion picture awards. All in all, this film was beautifully done because of its ""in your face"" attitude about love. It exposes the reality of love in our world and not the ""hollywood"" love in some films. It is one of a kind because it doesn't make people imagine about love, it makes them think how love really is and just literally slapping them to wake up because this is what love is like! The film truly invites you to take a closer look on the real big picture about love and life."

People just don't like what makes them uncomfortable. Also, if you have never been in the kind of relationship portrayed in the movie (or one even remotely close) it might be somewhat boring, or unbelievable that people really do such things.

All four are prone to destructive behaviors that hurt those around them. Some other people have said it is a terrible film because of this lack of authenticity; but I disagree with this assessment.

The language gets to be quite brutal and crude, and is reminiscent of Nichols' earlier grittier 'Carnal Knowledge'. This is the way writers want people to talk when they're more concerned with being genuine than with being evolved.<br/><br/>Clive Owen puts a big dent in his 'new heart throb' rating with a really vicious turn as a sleazy Doctor whose only emotional range seems to be egotistic rage vented on anyone who he can't control or who bests him. His lines are the most profane in the movie, mixing every common sexual expletive with his vitriol. But he thinks he's being wonderfully genuine!<br/><br/>Julia Roberts plays a co-dependent who goes with whichever of the male leads who wants her the most at the time. She's playing against her star quality and she does fine in this ratcheted down persona. Jude Law on the other hand struggles as a feckless loser who feels secure with Natalie's one down role but is over his head with the stronger Julia. <br/><br/>The movie has many problems. The lines work better on stage, and the characters would be better played by actors not movie stars - again I would exclude darling Natalie who is still enjoying quirky character roles.

","After viewing this film of complete decadence and filth, I know for a fact that London must be high up on the Al-Qaeda nuke list. This film is the story of four grotesque, utterly selfish and vindictive monster yuppies who subsequently sleep with each other, betray each other, and scream at each other. At the end of the film I was hoping one of this big red London buses would run them all over, splattering their bodies on some dank street in Soho, anything just to shut them up from their incessant bitching and moaning. If the point of the film was to showcase the empty unfulfilled and useless lives of yuppies in America and Britain, the film succeeded wonderfully. If it wasn't, then the film is on the level of a colonoscopy in terms of raw pain. The writer of the film is a nobody, and god willing, will stay that way for a long time afterwards. One small redeeming factor about this film is that if you are dating a pretentious stuck up girl, guys you know who I mean, definitely take her to this flick. Pretend you like it, and you'll be rewarded that night. Pseudo intellectuals of all stripes will wonder at the ""deepness"" of the film, especially women, not realizing that the entire world could give a hoot about the love troubles of four stuck up, high income earning pricks, while there are wars across the globe, famine, and unhappiness throughout human society. <br/><br/>I see a film like this as an indication of how decadent and disgusting mankind in the ""west"" has become. Does it qualify as intellectual to write about yourself non-stop, and the relationships you've had? I'd like to think that the relationships in your life are NOT the most important thing you will do with yourself, rather, what you've done to the community around you, what you've committed to the betterment of the world would be more important. I bet at the end of the Roman Empire there were similar books and plays written, about adventures in relationships at the Vomitorium, or something else similarly arrogant. This film succeeds in producing four main characters who I was praying would be killed by the credits, begging that at least one of them would be torn asunder. I was not rewarded. Obnoxious, arrogant types will no doubt be drawn to the ""complexity"" of the characters. Normal people should use this film as a barometer of how repulsive a person is, by their enjoyment of it. <br/><br/>Avoid this tale of pure decadence and selfishness. Its popularity will be a measure of how close we are to the end of civilization."

"politicon2003","1","1","4","31 July 2008"," A dreary tale set in a dreary City and a waste of a fine cast
","This is just not the kind of movie I enjoy so my review is bound to be downgrading. My initial and final reaction, after sitting through the whole dreary thing in the comfort of my own den (had I seen it in a cinema theatre I would have left long before the end), is why on earth were such a set of four fine actors persuaded to perform in such a pointless exercise? I've given Closer two stars mainly for the heroic efforts the actors must have had to make in dealing with a banal script and uninteresting parts. The whole thing seems to be about three disillusioned aging yuppies and one barely past-puberty attractive young waitress-stripper (23 year old Natalie Portman who plays Alice aka as Janet Rachel Jones). The play seeks to explore the sexual and personal relationships between four people who have met by chance in the City. That storyline might have been interesting except the characters are so selfishly wrapped up in themselves they are more even boring than some deadly boring real life self-absorbed couples I have actually met. Who would want to know about such people when there is so little of interest to learn? A psychiatrist, just back from a refreshing Caribbean holiday, might be prepared to hear their individual stories (and be well paid for doing so) but I am glad it only cost me fifty cents as the DVD came for that extra with the Sunday newspaper. I am not glad, however, that it cost me just about 90 minutes of my life to watch. The absurd thing is while in the modern fashion they are into partner swapping the two males get extremely uptight when they discover that their former bed mate is sleeping with the other guy. They constantly demand the truth from each partner and then don't like it when it's fed to them chapter and verse. Towards the end of the movie I recalled the 1957 film, The Little Hut, except that was a love triangle, not a quartet and also a movie I would like to forget but at least its script contained an element of humour, These things work much better as comical farces than as a drama which one is supposed to take seriously. In fact I usually prefer Julia Roberts in comedies or least melodramas. She is simply is not right for straight parts.<br/><br/>I cannot understand one professional critic who is quoted on the back of the DVD cover writing of Closer ""it vibrates with eroticism, bruising laughs and dynamic performance"". In my opinion exactly the three elements that are almost entirely lacking in the movie.<br/><br/>Despite the actors' best efforts their performance was hardly dynamic. The script and story didn't allow it any more than would have one for a Cinderella pantomime. As to vibrating with eroticism I would say this movie is no more erotic than a Made in China plastic vibrator urgently needing a battery replacement. Except possibly the one scene in the back room of strip club where Natalie Portman displays much of her pretty young body. But then if some voyeur wanted a good erotic pornography movie there is plenty of such dedicated stuff around without the need to view this particular DVD. In my eyes Julia Roberts was never very beautiful and a personality quite lacking in eroticism. As a young actress she was quite pretty and funny as a prostitute with Richard Gere and still vaguely attractive in a comic way as a film star who falls in love with a stuttering Hugh Grant, but she is rapidly losing her beauty and sex appeal as she ages and evident in this 2004 work. Richard Owen is ruggedly handsome but his role requires him to make remarks to Julia Roberts which suggests the character he portrays is not very sure of himself as regards his sexual performance, more of having a medical problem than erotic in nature. I was also disappointed with Jude Law who I first saw and admired in his secondary role in Gatacca. In Closer he looks seedy, effeminate and unkept. As to ""laughs"" the only lines that induced a slight giggle on my part was when Judes's character is asked if he still writes obituaries for a newspaper. His reply is ""No more, I've been promoted as obituary page editor"" When asked ""how come? he replies ""The previous editor died""! No exactly hilarious and probably not original. The whole play is set in a grey London winter, mostly in probably expensive but darkened flats and lofts which just adds to the overall impression of the banal dreariness that overwhelms the film. May be that's what the producer set out to achieve. It seems the movie won two Golden Globes and two Academy Award nominations (for Owen and Portman's performance in both cases).<br/><br/>I'm sorry , there are plenty of folk who seem to love this film but what I have written is my view after ""giving it a go""."

Julia Roberts plays a photographer. That's all you need to know. Jude Law plays a guy who's as pathetic as almost ANY character played by Julian Sands. Even worse: he SOUNDS LIKE HIM!! Clive Owen plays a doctor who can't deliver a line (even when it's supposed to be shocking, due to foul language) any better than the Domino's Pizza guy can deliver a pizza to Bangladesh in 30 minutes or less.<br/><br/>The movie is completely, utterly, mind-numbingly boring and you would just as well watch a movie about the house you grew up in (if you took yourself and your family out of the picture) and cast Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Jude Law as The Front Door, The Oven, The Living Room Table, and A Spatula.<br/><br/>Aaaannnnd ....

"chrissiew66","1","1","4","20 September 2005"," My summary of Closer
","I especially liked the song ""Can't take my eyes off of you"" and Julia Roberts, as always, acts superbly. But, is it me, or do most English actors sound wooden and untrue? The storyline was average but I just couldn't believe the acting ability of Jude Law and Clive Owen. They seem more ideally suited to average English stage productions than to big film acting. Natalie Portman played a great role. The Opera House was filmed beautifully and the various streets and sights of London were also appealing to someone who has never seen or visited London. Did I mention that Julia Roberts, as she always does, acts wonderfully and I thought that anything with her in it would have had me hanging off my seat but, terribly sorry, this film, was not well acted and I want my money back."
"The_Void","7","1","4","4 September 2005"," A resounding success on all fronts
","Based on a stage play by Patrick Marber, Closer tells the story of four people living in the upper crust of London society. All of these characters are flawed to an extent that it is the flaws themselves that make up their personalities, and that makes it very hard to really care for any of them. This is made up, however, by the scene setting. Patrick Marber also wrote the screenplay for this film, and some of his scenes are just brilliant. They're always interesting because of the things that the characters do and say to each other - their motives are well worked out, and even though you don't really like any of them; it's still possible to get behind them because their characters are so well defined and seeing them reveal themselves on screen is always great to watch. The film doesn't really have a plot to speak of, and all the action comes about through the characters themselves rather than any actual plotting. This may be a bad thing for some people, because the film lacks structure - but I liked the way that it panned out because it also makes it unpredictable and, as the characters are the stars anyway, it also ensures that we see them for what they are, as they don't have to follow any plot line.<br/><br/>For the characters, Mike Nichols has recruited four big names. Natalie Portman stands out the most among the cast members. This beautiful and talented young actress makes every scene she's in a treat for the eyes, and her beauty does Closer no end of favours in that respect. She has the best scene in the movie, which is shared by Clive Owen and takes place in a strip club! It's been years since Julia Roberts made anything worth seeing, and for that reason; she's the sore thumb of this cast of up and coming young stars. The male leads give strong performances, and Clive Owen in particular stands out. He's a very strong actor and that translates well to his character. Similarly, Jude Law's screen presence suits his character excellently but in a different way. Mike Nichols has his first big success with an adaptation of a stage play with the brilliant ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", and although this film doesn't come close to the brilliance of that one, the great director has managed to inject just the right tone into the proceedings and it is that which ultimately makes Closer the success that it is."

"Gooper","1","1","4","15 August 2005"," A Trenchant Analysis of Tony Blair's Britain - Yeah, Right
","Other reviewers here have given good evidence as to why this film is a failure, so I need not go on about it here. I would like to add however, that 'Closer' does show, without any sort of brilliance or depth, just what a bland bore Tony Blair's 'Cool Britannia' has become. Where boring people are content with being snotty and obnoxious and self-centered, and there's really no outstanding reason NOT to be. The emptiness is everywhere. And what are two American women doing in all of this? The story might as well be in Dacron, Ohio. London is as nothing. And Mike Nichols! Once a master director, now, his talents ebbing, attempting to make a hip picture with hipper stars, should have known better. This rubbish, from the man who brought you 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' and 'The Graduate'! Think about retirement, Mike. Every opportunity for making this story into something noteworthy was spitefully thrown away. At least the petulantly 'victorious' so-called dermatologist Clive Owen could have tossed in a scabies or eczema joke or something when he has just reduced delicate Jude Law to tears. And this, in the Land of Monty Python! It almost makes one pine for the Thatcherite days, when at least the Great British spirit of satire was alive and well. Now we have a sort of transatlantic blandness. Yak yak yak, blah blah blah. So I have to assume that the cast and crew thought they were making some sort of intellectual statement, either via a modern existentialism, or via a much baser technique: by bludgeoning the audience softly with just plain boring and uninteresting empty characters. If they wanted to dabble in this sort of water, they could have at least done a viewing of Peter Greenaway's masterpiece, 'The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover'. But boring is safer and does not require so much depth or imagination."

Closer makes three. Maybe it's unfair for me to review it, because it only polluted our DVD player for about twenty minutes before the poor thing gagged, retched and and spat it out. I've read others who comment on the intelligent dialogue. Maybe they were listening to an SAP channel or something. Pretentious/cutesy and so achingly full of itself that it was embarrassing would be our take on it. I don't care how misogynistic you may be, there is no way you are going to convince me that even marginally intelligent, educated and/or sophisticated people talk like this or relate to each other like this. I know. I'm a people. And I would laugh myself to tears if I ever encountered a poser like any of these characters. I think the internet chat scene was the breaking point for us. Had the cast consisted of eleven year olds it may have been believable, but even then one wonders why anyone would think it worthwhile to commit such drek to film. We did hang on into the aquarium scene, hoping against hope that since the film seemed to garner a number of decent ratings perhaps the first part was just a mistake of some sort and something worth watching might actually happen. It didn't. Eject. If you're a poser yourself, maybe you'll find something of interest in this film (I'm not going to even speculate on what that might actually be). If you're an authentic human being living within several light years of the planet I inhabit, I can't think of one single reason why you should subject yourself to this mess."

","Dialogue stripped to the bare minimum, characters struggling with truth and lies, and exploration of the inner workings of the psyche. This kind of stuff I usually leave alone, but considering the cast and director involved, I thought I'd better check it out.<br/><br/>I am very glad that I followed my instinct, as I find myself profoundly affected by this film. It is not a comfortable ride, but one that I found mesmeric, challenging and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>All the leads are convincing, with Clive Owen giving a blindingly good portrayal of an everyday psychopath (or is he just much more upfront than most of us?) Natalie Portman is also excellent, bringing the kind of spark that made Leon - The Professional such a success, except that now she's sexually mature, which makes life more interesting... On first viewing, Jude Law and Julia Roberts didn't have quite as impact as Owen and Portman, but their roles are the more introverted ones, and I look forward to assessing the depths of their portrayals in further viewings.<br/><br/>What really glues Closer together, though, is the editing. Like the dialogue, it is bare bones stuff, with four years of four characters lives condensed into an hour and a half. With dots of detail Nichols conjures up a vivid portrait of the relationships between the characters. But it is the twists and turns that make up the beginnings and ends of relationships that are really the subject of this movie.<br/><br/>Be warned: this is not light material. But rarely do you find such a taut and compelling drama containing no weapons but words, and no action but the tearing asunder of hearts and dreams."

It was great drama, from step one and it was driven with the words and language, which is what theatre is driven by, the text not the actions.<br/><br/>This was probably one of the greatest transformations of theatre to the big screen, because nothing was changed, ecept for the ending, but you needen't not know what that is, but if you must buy the book and read the play.<br/><br/>This theatre transformation to film is amazing, I loved every second of it and I went back and say it again for the second and third time, and it was just as great, and I loved so much more of it, an learned so much more from it.<br/><br/>Watch it, read it do everything you can do and see it again and again."

We feel the happiness, pain, vulnerability, etc. the characters are going through. This film is intended for a mature audience, so if you decide this movie is for you please use wise judgement when deciding who to take.

","CLOSER has the makings of your typical romantic comedy: A contrived change-partners-and-romance plot; love-at-first-sight meet-cute situations; glamorously superficial characters played by superficially glamorous actors; manipulative schemes to seduce and/or abandon lovers; and glib, archly self-satisfied dialogue. The film offers up nothing that hasn't been done hundreds, if not thousands, of times in hundreds, if not thousands, of movies and sitcoms. Indeed, it has everything you would want in a romantic comedy, except for two things: romance and comedy.<br/><br/>Dark and brooding, CLOSER is one of those insufferably smug exercises in droning pomposity that truly thinks it is delivering a pious sermon of Truth and Honesty about Relationships -- though the word used in the movie isn't ""relationships,"" but a less polite one that begins with the letter ""f."" The use of profanity -- the f-word being just one of many bandied about in the film with casual contempt -- is meant to punctuate just how Truthful and Honest the characters/filmmakers are. It is also an indication of just how lazy and/or pretentious the writer is.<br/><br/>The basic storyline is trite, but admittedly dependable: She (Natalie Portman) loves he (Jude Law), who falls in love with her (Julia Roberts), who is attracted to him (Clive Owen) -- though everybody plays musical beds -- until, in the best of all possible soap operas fashion, everybody ends up (or doesn't end up) with the right person. But in CLOSER, who ends up with who is irrelevant, since the characters are so truly petty, self-centered and deceitful, it is impossible to care if any of them live happily ever after. Maybe that is screenwriters Patrick Marber's point: Lovers and liars are synonymous words -- unselfish love is a contradiction of terms. Such cynicism is nothing new in movies like this, but usually it is eased down with a bittersweet coat of humanity, if not humor. Marber revels in the bitter, but denies the sweet: The characters have to keep telling us just how madly in love they are with each other since the film supplies them with precious little screen time to actually show it. Any display of love, kindness or even respect between any given couple is merely a preamble to an act of betrayal or rejection or revenge.<br/><br/>While enduring the movie, one can amuse oneself trying to figure out the point of the title, which seems to be a misnomer since no character really ever gets particularly close to another before they begin to push each other away. I assume the title refers to the way that the story condenses time into bite-sized pieces, revealing the film's roots as a multi-act play. Since the story takes place over a period of four or five years, the characters keep having to announce that a year has past between scenes to explain gaps in the story's logic. And repeatedly segments of the film begin with characters announcing their undying passion and ending with them angrily breaking up, squeezing days or weeks of reality into a few minutes of unconvincing, heightened melodrama. Such artificial manipulation of time is understandable in a play, but unnecessary and irritating in a film which pretends to take place in the real world. It is possible that director Mike Nichols was purposely trying to mislead the audience about the timing of events in order to make a point, but what that point might be is unclear.<br/><br/>To give them credit, the actors do what they can with so little to work with. Their characters are one-dimensional at best and clichÃ©d at worst. (Marber's idea of originality is making Portman's waif-like character a stripper, rather than a prostitute. Wow, how daring!) At least Roberts endows her character with a consistent tone, albeit one of somber self-absorption; I guess there is a certain triumph for her in being able to suppress under a cloud of chilly aloofness all that warm charisma that has made her a star. Meanwhile, Portman, Law and Owen have to somehow make their characters sudden shifts in attitude and temperament credible, with varying degrees of success. All are at the mercy of Marber's empty, loveless pessimism.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols is one heck of a director and he has a quartet of perfectly capable actors at his command for this film. And he has trod this path before with films like WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (a great movie) and CARNAL KNOWLEDGE (an overrated movie), so he has experience in turning theatrical artifice into credible cinema. But those films had complex stories and even more complex characters (and arguably, much better actors). Here all Nichols has is Marber's adaptation of his own ""award-winning play,"" which presumably has lost something in the translation. As a result, the closer you look, the less there is to see."

","Please visit my website www.worldofkj.com and check out the forums!<br/><br/>Closer <br/><br/>By: Karl Schneider <br/><br/>Love it seems, is no more than a fancy lie.<br/><br/>Any movie with a cast like the one brought together in Closer immediately jumps out at you, grabs you, and makes you want to rush out and see it. Couple this with a very intriguing trailer, and you have a movie that gets thoughts of possible Oscar Nominations rumbling about in your head. Add that to the promise of Natalie Portman as a stripper, which is enough for me by its lonesome, and you best believe I am going. Speaking of Portman, has she evolved beautifully as an actress or am I hallucinating again? I won't lie, I have always adored the girl, but I had never realized she was so amazingly talented. First seeing her in The Professional as a cute girl with a plant befriending a hit man after her parents murder, I should have seen her potential. Regardless I missed it, and failed to pickup on her blooming career. I was unimpressed by her in Star Wars, mainly because of her co-star who we will forever refer to as 'Anchor' because of his uncanny ability to ruin an amazing movie, and I tended to glance over her other performances with this yawning gaze. Recently though this young girl from Jerusalem has really come into her own, first with Garden State, and now with Closer where she manages to overshadow one of the greatest female actresses of our time. Just stunning.<br/><br/>Closer as a movie works very well. It is entertaining, funny, dramatic, and most importantly has a realistically believable story allowing its all star cast to really run with their roles. Between Jude Law, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman, and Julia Roberts their isn't a single average performance. Everyone of them becomes their role, developing it to the fullest extent and making them real people with their own unique intricacies, facing their own problems. Only one character comes off as remotely likable, something that oddly enough doesn't prevent you from becoming attached to the drama that ensues. You are still so drawn to the various characters that you can't help but watch the train wreck their lives become.<br/><br/>The only real failing of Closer is its ungodly want to jump around through time with no indication of where it is going, leaving those viewing to play catch up. It is nothing serious, and quite easy to pick up upon, but at the same time I can't help wondering why they purposefully lacked any transition when skipping through things as large as a whole year of the characters lives.<br/><br/>Other than the jet lag you get upon stepping out of Closer's time machine, the movie is outstanding. It takes something so highly regarded like love, and drags it down into the mud, finally letting it up only after it has totally filled it with lies and deceit. As depressing as it can be at times to see Closer tear apart something as virtuous as love, it really does nothing but make it all the more stronger. To borrow a bit, there is always that moment, that one instant where you can stop, turn back and choose not to do something. Being able to do that is what makes love truly special, and what makes it sad to watch these characters fall apart as they do.. Even with it's depressingly uplifting tone, Closer manages, in it's own little way, to strengthen the bonds of love you have with others, though after this you may find yourself watching just a little bit ... closer.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"Cheesedemon28","10","1","4","8 December 2004"," Closer To Perfection Each Time I See It
","[WARNING: This review contains some language and a whole lot of senseless<br/><br/>blathering about how fantastic Mike Nichols is]<br/><br/>All right, Nichols, you win.<br/><br/>I've been looking, I guess, for a favorite director for some time now. It was jumbled between Polanski, Fuller, Allen, and even Takashi Miike for awhile, but they all wane (slightly, mind you, but still wane) in awe at Mike Nichols.<br/><br/>I was wondering how this movie, being a relationship movie, would stack up<br/><br/>with audiences, to quote the film, to ""that witch we do not speak of.""* To be honest, it was about as divided, but I think it's a clear sign that since most of the people who came out of Closer who either liked it or hated it spoke with such vocabulary and a surprising, staunch lack of grammar. True quote: ""Fantastic<br/><br/>movie... must... defenestrate... DVD collection."" People literally are entranced by this piece of pure, unmitigated CINEMA, damn it!<br/><br/>The story is sparse. It is more about the feelings of the characters than the actual plot, but here's my take: couples cheating on one another. That's pretty much all you need to know plotwise. The plot does not fail in any way. In fact, the<br/><br/>minimalism is key to the reflection in the mirrors that are the script and acting. WHOOOOLY HECK. The dialogue as stilted as hell, and guess what? It works,<br/><br/>like a charm. It feels very much like the play it was scripted on, and that just gets me thinking: relationships really are like a play going on before you, and that's why people say things as trite as ""do you think I'm ugly?"" or ""please, don't leave me."" In any other movie (like the one by the asterisk at the end), this dialogue would have faltered, but the pure frankness of the events that unfold and the way that they are portrayed is genius. Julia Roberts, who I really don't like, gives her best performance, bar none, and she's incredibly convincing. In one<br/><br/>particular scene, she and Clive Owen are both as frank, biting, and funny as the movie they star in. Jude Law's truly shone this year in his pictures, and he<br/><br/>shines the brightest here (yep, even better than in Huckabees, and he was<br/><br/>pretty damn good in that one). Natalie Portman, though not nude, is probably<br/><br/>the best of the foursome. Admittedly, she has the best lines of dialogue, but only she could make them as funny and as tragic as they are.<br/><br/>The best thing about Closer? No matter how straightforward it is with breakups and infidelity, it never loses its sense of surreality, which is tough to pull off if your name doesn't start with an ""R"" and end with an ""oman Polanski."" The way<br/><br/>the film is shot is perfect: any scene that involves infidelity or a question of infidelity, the camera angles become obscure (not too obscure) so that the<br/><br/>unfortunate events playing out on screen become that much more effective.<br/><br/>So in all, how is it? Three words: ""Life On Screen"" or ""Pure F'n Cinema.""<br/><br/>Yep, it's that good. :)<br/><br/>*The movie referred to was indeed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. And<br/><br/>unless you don't have a funny bone and are not in relationship, Closer dunks<br/><br/>Eternal Sunshine's head in the toilet bowl 98 times, one for each minute of film.<br/><br/>YES: IT'S THAT GOOD. :D"
"ajmartin-3","4","1","4","1 December 2004"," Don't bother getting ""Closer""
","I saw closer on Monday. I wanted to like this movie, unfortunately I found it contrived, hard to follow, and while it has good performances and is fundamentally well acted, the characters are totally unbelievable and the dialog is ridiculous. I wanted to like this movie for many different reasons, the cast, the director, the chance to see Natalie Portman playing a stripper, but even that couldn't save this movie. This movie had to be better in its original form as a play because it's not a very good movie.<br/><br/>'Closer' tells the story of four strangers and their relationships. Dan and Alice (Jude Law and Natalie Portman) and Larry and Anna (Julia Roberts and Clive Owen). It begins with their instant attractions that turn into relationships, and then onto betrayal and infidelity, and back again. Set in modern day London, 'Closer' is the tale of love, love lost, honesty and relationships.<br/><br/>Part of the problem with this movie comes from the fact that it was originally performed on stage as a play, which was then adapted by the original playwright into the screenplay. The movie feels like it should be on a stage not on a movie screen. It has very static locations, long-winded dialog that no one who is not on stage would ever say, and a general 'this should be on Broadway feel to it. However this is not what dooms this movie, it's the unrealistic character interaction, it's the unexplained jumps through months and years of time, and it's the constant barrage of unbelievable dialog.<br/><br/>The movie credits itself with being an honest look at relationships, infidelity, and love but after watching this film you will ask yourself 'Why are all these people so stupid?' Everyone is cheating on everyone else and everyone loves someone else, or then again maybe they don't. All we know is that the characters are so enraptured with love one moment and then literally two minutes later they are not in love anymore, and then you guessed it, a couple minutes later they are in love again, or maybe not. One thing is for sure though they love to talk about their pain, and what better why then with long in-depth, well thought out monologues. All of the characters have really graphic conversations about sex and cheating that sound well rehearsed and thoroughly contrived. <br/><br/>'Closer' definitely has a few enjoyable moments or good laughs but they are few and far between. You will find yourself getting angry at the characters and the unexplained jumps in time between scenes. While the movie conveys some of the true hardships of love, the situations the characters are put in and their reactions could only happen in the movies. Unless you really want to see Natalie Portman almost naked save 'Closer' for cable."
"lfh82533","1","1","5","10 December 2011"," A film like this should never have been made
","First of all, what was the purpose of making this film. It did not entertain nor was it meaningful in any way. I am what is considered elderly, but I don't expect every movie to be Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Language used in context with the movie is alright. But the content of this went way beyond language and sex. It was, to be direct, disgusting. Worst of all, it has greatly lowered my admiration of Julia Roberts. With all of the good movies she has made, why did she lower herself to be involved in this crap. With all the wonderful story lines out there, this was not a movie I would recommend to anyone.

"Chris_Docker","8","1","5","25 January 2005"," Not for everyone's taste, but a superb tour de force for those can digest serious theatre
","Closer is a deceptively innocuous film about four young singletons in contemporary London that has divided critics fiercely.<br/><br/>Set casually and unpretentiously across such fabulous locations as the South Bank, the London Aquarium, the National Portrait Gallery and the Theatre Royal, this intelligent, biting and (at times) shocking film will thrill as much as it will appal.<br/><br/>I liked the four virtuoso performances, tightly scripted action, psychological dilemmas of sexual politics set against a modern lifestyle, constant surprises, and the soul searching it offers on the importance of truth in relationships, the meaning of love and the things that are needed to make a relationship work (or ensure it will flounder).<br/><br/>It's director Mike Nichols most powerful tour-de-force since the classic Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, easily surpassing the more commercial fare of Graduate or Working Girl, the minor anti-nuclear film Silkwood, or the flawed and over-ambitious Catch 22. It's a film that works on many levels and matures from repeated viewing.<br/><br/>The four lead characters are newspaper (obituary) writer played by Jude Law, Natalie Portman as a new woman who comes into his life, commercial photographer admirably understated by Julia Roberts, and finally Clive Owen as a dermatologist. The actual action is incidental. The main point is the way they interact and form relationships.<br/><br/>Closer has been adapted for screen by award winning playwright Patrick Marber from his stage play of the same name. This may give a clue as to the nature of the film - what is marketed deceptively as an almost light-hearted romp (which is what it starts out as), has an acerbic and even vitriolic core that is more suited to serious viewers than those looking for straightforward entertainment. This is also the movie's main flaw: it is not everyone's cup of tea. Additionally, there will be large groups of people who will be shocked or disappointed. There is not much graphic sex, but there are very explicit verbal battles of a sexual nature, and persons who might be offended or turned off by jealousy arguments about who put what where and what their bodily fluids tasted like might as well save themselves the price of admission.<br/><br/>There are, however, some excellent comic moments, such as when Dan asks Anna ""Do you want babies?"" and she quips back, ""Yes, but not today."" Similarly, the scene where Dan cons Larry in a sexually explicit internet chat room is almost unbearably funny in an excruciating sort of way. But the meat of the movie is reserved for big questions about how we view relationships and 'edit out' bits we don't like when we remember them fragmentally, or through the keyhole of our single, personalised viewpoint.<br/><br/>Happily married people who have never had to sail the tempestuous seas of dating and trial relationships may find it harder to identify with the characters, but many others will be able to project themselves into these intelligent, strikingly attractive and trendy would-be relationshippers. People can put their better selves forward as honestly as possible but then get mired in situations that are of their own making but not of their own ultimate choosing or living up to their own ideals, and in various ways this is what we see happen in the film. For some, the process of getting 'closer' may be painful, or the closeness may come with the realisation that it wasn't the marriage made in heaven you thought it might be.<br/><br/>In the opening (slow motion) scene, Jude Law and Natalie Portman move towards each other with sizzling self-confidence and oozing devastating sexuality. If they are cocky, it is in the suaveness that affects many eligible young adults, that self-effacing sureness that is designed to elicit the attention of the opposite sex in an almost accidental way. Natalie Portman shines through several remarkably different 'real selves' until the stunning denouement where we can come to know her and understand the difference between her honesty in the sense of trueness to oneself and honesty in the more literal sense. <br/><br/>Clive Owen, as Larry, the realistic doctor who combines intellect and a certain amount of breeding with a sometimes vicious honesty, achieves a performance that will jump start his career to greater things. Julia Roberts, sadly too often known more for her star appeal than her acting, gives probably her best performance since Erin Brockovich as a successful and self-sufficient photographer. Instead of stealing the limelight by making her character stage centre, she underplays it, giving conviction to her part rather than reminding us she is a superstar. Finally, the talented Jude Law as Dan, who aspires to be more decisive and successful than he maybe has the stamina for, captures our imagination with his all too human failings, his attempts to prove his sincerity, and his good looks.<br/><br/>Closer features a charismatic soundtrack starting with Damien Rice's haunting 'Blower's Daughter' and continues with frequent excerpts from Mozart's similarly themed Cosi fan Tutti. Like many things in the film, the Rice track, where he sings, ""Can't take my eyes off you"" has more than one meaning. For anyone unfamiliar with Mozart's opera, I can say it asks the age-old question: how much can you really trust your lover? with earth-shattering consequences for everyone concerned. In our movie, for those who are seeking some answers from what on the surface is a very cynical view of modern adult liaisons, some clues may be picked up from the throw-away comment, ""You don't know the first thing about love because you don't understand compromise."" Oh yes - and watch out for who finally makes it through to the end, and ask why!<br/><br/>I've seen Closer twice already and can't recommend it strongly enough - although I also hope my comments have put off those people who won't enjoy it and might have gone to see it in the mistaken belief that they would find it digestible."

","Sensationally realized adult-themed drama that is about as subtle as a sledgehammer with its electrifying performances, magnetic direction and hard-as-nails script. In modern-day London a struggling journalist/obituary writer (Jude Law) falls in love with a young American stripper (Natalie Portman). Their relationship is thrown a curve-ball when Law meets photographer Julia Roberts. Roberts appears to not be interested and Law unwittingly gets dermatologist Clive Owen involved with her instead. Almost instantly, Roberts and Owen start a love affair of their own. However, nothing is as rosy as it appears. Law is really in lust with Roberts, Roberts is quietly obsessed with Law and Portman is coming apart at the seams emotionally as she learns about Law's true feelings. While all this occurs Owen gets caught in a pickle as well as he realizes that there is much more to Law and Roberts' relationship than meets the eye. And a short conversation between Owen and Portman may also lead to more fireworks as time goes by. Talk about lovers and other strangers. Wickedly demented chess match of wits, would-be-loves, lusts, jealousies and cruelties culminate in arguably the most brilliant and important picture of 2004. The four leads create a crazed square in a dark and bleak London landscape. Each individual performer has an earth-shattering moment and each has at least one emotional sparring match with each of the other three co-stars. Symbolism is also a key ingredient in this recipe. The occupations of the four leads being the most important of examples. Taking place briskly over a four-year period, ""Closer"" highlights its points with striking blows and difficult outcomes. Director Mike Nichols gets back to the wild and revolutionary film-making that shook Hollywood and the system with 1960s classics ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and ""The Graduate"". Patrick Marber's screenplay, based on his equally potent play, is a demoralizing, cruel and mentally draining experience that paints a portrait of the lengths people will go to have what they want---the feelings and emotions of others be damned. Perfectly directed, wonderfully scripted and accurately performed, ""Closer"" is sure to get next to the deepest parts of your soul. 5 stars out of 5."

","I've been eager to watch this film for a while and to be frank, I wish I had spent my dear spare time for another film. When you see the casting you know that the acting in this film is going to be great, and it doesn't disappoint. Jude Law is as ensnaring as ever, Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman are yet again phenomenal; just as expected. Closer has a twisted way of showing the parts of love that most of us want to turn our heads away from. No one wants to think of the possibility of lusting over what you can't have, only to stop wishing for it when you have it. Even worse, to start lusting for another unobtainable. After watching you'll find yourself pondering on love and how each person perceives it. But the thing is it doesn't deliver what a film is supposed to. The lack of cinematic elements makes you feel like you're watching a record of the original play rather than a film. Besides the intro and outro, the film lacks creative shots. Simply put, this film is great for watching while cooking, or those who want to look at pretty faces with great acting. You really don't have to focus on the scenes, they don't add anything to the film anyway."

","Closer: 8 out of 10: Mike Nichols directs this theater adaptation with a top-notch cast consisting of Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts, and Clive Owen. Portman and Owen went on to each win a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role only to lose out in the same category at the Academy Awards to Cate Blanchett and Morgan Freeman respectfully.<br/><br/>The story is how these four people in two relationships (Portman/Law and Roberts/Owen) intertwine and destroy both their current relationships and each other.<br/><br/>The Good: The acting as one imagines is outstanding in this. Everyone seems to lift everyone else, and the awards committees got it right with Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. Those two are at another level here. Between the two of them, Owen has a much harder job as his character is less flashy and easily could have been eaten by the scenery. Machiavellian wheels are spinning behind his goofy facade, and subtle threat of violence towards both his enemies and his lovers are always just below the surface.<br/><br/>Many people will forever remember this film as the one where Natalie Portman plays a stripper. What is impressive is the scene in the airport hotel near the end of the film. She plays every tone so ideally, it is almost impossible to look away - an incredible performance.<br/><br/>That said her stripper stuff is also awe-inspiring. I had never really thought of Natalie Portman as drop-dead gorgeous. I have changed my mind.<br/><br/>Mike Nichols is no stranger to directing plays nor directing theater adaptations. ('Angels in America' being one of the most impressive of the genre). He has a good eye for blocking and movement considering the piece consists of only four people talking with each other about things that happen off-screen. If you didn't know upfront that this was based on a play, you would eventually figure it out, but to Nichols credit, it could take a while.<br/><br/>The Bad: Jude Law and Julia Roberts each get the short straw in this quad. Their relationship makes little sense for either of them, and the story does them no favors. Jude Law doesn't look good in this film. He is starting to lose his hair and skin seems sallow. He has a job that is such a dead end that the symbolism is a bit on the nose. Oh and he is a duplicitous stalker creep. So why is Julia Roberts doing anything other than getting a restraining order? Whatever the appeal is it happened offscreen, and neither Roberts no Law sell any real relationship. It is believable that they could hook up for sex mind you. Both have no moral compass whatsoever. It just isn't plausible that any such tryst wouldn't end permanently with the calling of a cab.<br/><br/>The film takes dramatic time jumps without telling the audience. On one level I like the way Nichols trusts his audience to figure out that it is a year later just based on dialogue. On the other hand, a lot has happened during the time skipped, and it isn't always clear what. This dependence on offscreen action results in a lot of the possible tension being out of the piece as we start at the end a then describe what has transpired.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Thor came out seven years after this. What were the producers thinking? All the had to do is give Natalie Portman a wig (Blonde, Pink or Purple) and tell her to play this character but instead of being in love with a declining Jude Law she has to be in love with Chris Hemsworth. Honestly, I would like to recut all of Natalie Portman's films and replace whatever her current performance is with this Manic Pixie Dream Girl she conjured for this film.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, I am having a hard time nailing down how much I like this film. The Jude Law/ Julia Roberts scenes really take the wind out of the sails but then Clive and Natalie show up, and I am loving life again. Overall I have a feeling parts of this film will stick in my mind long after most movies are forgotten and for that reason, I can't help but recommend."

The way the time passes keeps you up on your feet, and the performances were just as amazing. It came across, at least to me, as a quite believable and unpredictable plot. However, it doesn't fulfill my expectations.
Maybe I should have seen this movie knowing that other's people's praise for it would be ruining my own experience, but that didn't happen. I've seen people naming this film as one of the ones that shaped them as a person, I've heard albums that, now that I've seen the movie, seem completely extracted from it. Perhaps this is how I've taken the most out of this film, by seeing and enjoying art that derived from it, and therefore this movie, even if in itself came as a disappointment to me, did mark me quite a lot.
But did I love it? Does the effect it already had in my life balance out the lack of it the experience of watching brought to me? Probably not. Maybe this is a problem that not many people will have with this movie, so you probably will be alright and will enjoy it as long as you can appreciate good cinematography without needing a mind blowing plot.

","I thought this movie was very well done. All the characters and dialogue were believable and seemed like they could have happened in real life. <br/><br/>Each character was portrayed beautifully. They came across realistically. Likable and unlikable but flawed humans.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman should get more credit than she already has for this role. You won't be let down by it. I think people can empathize with her character best. She plays a young stripper/waitress who is looking for love. Her demeanor seems almost meek on the surface whereas she is probably the most self-assured and confident in reality.<br/><br/>Jude Law also should get a lot of credit, but, like Natalie, they always get high marks on the performances. He plays probably the least likable character: unsure, frail, deceptive and petty would all describe him well. He does have a smug, sarcastic wit to him that can be charming at times.<br/><br/>Clive Owen may play the next-best character in this after Natalie. He is a boorish, nymphomaniac who can be intimidating but also has an honesty about him that makes him likable. His ingenuity remains apart from the other characters and we really understand his hurt and wrath, even if one doesn't agree with it.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts does well in the role. But, like others have said, she is just average compared to the top-notch performances of her co-stars. Her character is also unlikable. She is dishonest, cold, and estranged from all the other characters. She also is indecisive and her actions are probably the biggest reason for much of the hurt among all the other characters.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to most adults who have ever loved, but it should be noted that there is infidelity in this film so avoid if that is a touchy subject to you."

Closer's outstanding, brilliant, a classic romance really, but I personally feel it's hated on because all-time sexy Natalie and all-time sexy Julia and sexy Clive and sexy Jude and their uber-sexiness should have been put on way more display in this slow messy film and the picture's focus on the exhaustive personal dynamics should have taken a major back seat to Natalie's major back seat and to the stars' personal performances but I still personally really love it it's 1 of my personal favorite love stories (IMPeronalO). So personal. Natalie Portman is so raging hot in Closer OMGod I love her! I seriously do. Natalie has the best ass, and laugh. Portman parading around in her pretty purple little petite panties and pink wig is pure f'ing paradise and maybe the most pleasurable and perfectly pleasing hot nude scene/non-nude scene I've ever seen, thanks to Natalie and her exquisite body. It's also one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a film. Julia's the hottest, sexiest, beautifulest actress ever and Natalie's like top 10, uugggh. Natalie's star's still rising though O M G I love Natalie and Julia; their 2 of the hottest actresses/women ever! Roberts is the hottest girl ever, she really is, but Portman is a new generation girl and new generation girls are way hotter than old generation girls, aw, oh my God, I love Natalie Portman. Closer is a beast of a movie."

","Closer (2004) is a movie about 4 people who all are romantically or sexually involved with one another at some point in the course of the movie. Clive Owen, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, and Jude Law all turn in fabulous performances here, Owen and Portman even earning academy award nominations for their portrayals. The movie has fitting dialogue for the subject matter it deals with, it gets highly sexually explicit at several points due to what's happening. The tense scenes that contain fighting and yelling between the characters because of the deception and betrayal are the ones that are the most well done in my opinion. The film offers up a very raw and realistic view of these people and I think that is good, because the film had to be graphic and real, in order to show the true feelings and torture these characters endure. There are a couple places where you feel exhausted from the goings on, because things are constantly changing, but it's supposed to be that way. 7/10 for Closer. Raw, well done film with great acting."

","Closer is without a doubt a one-of-a-kind film that either gets you off of your seat or grabs your attention to an unusual extent. My reaction to it was the latest. <br/><br/>It's a movie that's not for everyone, depends what you're into. But if you like drama, a complex story and odd characters that are not necessarily likable, but yet beautifully written; then this is the kind of film for you. It's about love, break-up, cheating, identity, relationships, among other minor things. <br/><br/>I have trouble trying to figure out if it would've been better to have a wider amount of characters, maybe to make the story more real and convincing. But the narrative is fine, and everything about the story really IS about this four complex, relatable and human-like characters that are put under unstable circumstances and vulnerable states of mind.<br/><br/>The soundtrack by Damien Rice is outstanding and on point with the story as a whole. I loved the little bits of piano of Cold Water through some of the scenes. All principal actors do an excellent job but Natalie Portman is the one who naturally steals the show, she does indeed a pretty good job with a fascinating performance of the most iconic character here."

","Closer (2004): Dir: Mike Nichols / Cast: Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman, Colin Stinton: The title symbolizes relationships and encounters, and in this case, four individuals who come and go into each others life within several years. Jude Law plays a struggling writer who meets Natalie Portman when she is in an accident. She plays a stripper whose identity she prefers to remain a mystery, or at least to the thoughts of the other person. Julia Roberts plays a photographer whom he ends up seeking a relationship with despite the fact that Portman is aware of the situation. Clive Owen is the fourth piece of the puzzle who is set up with Roberts. Director Mike Nichols clashes these relationships with interchange but it often jerks us around as if they are in a game of hide and seek. Nichols has directed many worthy projects including Primary Colors and The Graduate. This doesn't rank with those titles but it certainly poises as a worthy followup. The relationships here are flawed but played off by a terrific cast. Law is seeking without looking. Roberts is in denial. Owen is an opportunist. It is Portman who delivers the best performance as the stripper, scarred and reserved under a pink wig. Outside the lead roles, there is little of interest in other roles. It examines our false intentions when it comes to commitment and nurturing any form of relationship that permits that we move closer. Score: 7 ½ / 10"

No one is who they seem and they all and hurt each other. The dialogue is unique and kinda brilliant. Great soundtrack too. 1/6/16<br/><br/>Anna: Why are you dressed?

","It starts with a look and the unforgettable song the ""The Blowers Daughter"" provided by Damien Rice. Walking the busy streets of London two people lock eyes and make an instant connection only to have it end in near tragedy. Dan, played by Jude Law, is eyeing Alice, played by Natalie Portman, only to have their flirting session end when Alice is hit by a car. With only a few cuts and scrapes, Dan waits with her in the E.R. and they get to know one another. Alice is a former stripper who just moved to London from New York after a break up, while Dan is a struggling writer and journalist who currently writes obituaries. <br/><br/>""Closer"" is Directed by legendary Mike Leigh and adapted from the play by Patrick Marber. Its the story of 4 characters that all get involved with each others and make each other rather miserable. Along with Dan and Alice we have Larry (Clive Owen) the dermatologist and Anna (Julia Roberts) the photographer. We jump ahead a little bit and Dan has completed his book and is getting his head shot taken by Anna. Although he's in a relationship with Alice, he can't help but fall in love with Anna. She is also into him but doesn't want to hurt Alice. Angered Dan sets up a prank that ends up backfiring on him. In a very funny scene that is probably taken straight from reality, Dan poses as Anna in sex chat room and strikes up quite the filthy conversation with Larry. Knowing that Anna will be at the Aquarium he set up Larry to meet her where another very funny and awkward scene takes place. Through that meeting Anna and Larry fall in love and eventually get married.<br/><br/>All of the characters get their fill of jealousy, anger and betrayal but Dan gets the worst of them all. He is tormented and played around with by all three. He is weak minded and easily manipulated. His lack of loyalty and pure jealousy costs him Alice not once but twice. Once he inadvertently introduces Anna and Larry he dooms his chances forever with her. Larry is the exact opposite, he is like a caveman with an overactive sex drive. He is smart and will stop at nothing to get what wants. Ana is a down to earth fine art portrait photographer who falls in love with both Dan and Larry and must make a choice, but it seems like it has already be made. Alice is a strong independent woman who is looking for a new start in London but after her first break up with Dan she goes back to her old ways. Alice is a mysterious character and the one we know the least about. Anna is jealous of how young and beautiful she is and this is probably why she is into Dan. Alice is many things, a tease, a flirt and a manipulator. After a bitter argument, Larry goes to a strip club where Alice is working. Since Larry is quite obsessed with her he pays for a private dance and she plays the part perfectly. ""Lying is the funnest thing a girl can do with her clothes on"" she says at one point. The story ends seemingly as it should almost like fate has intervened and told these characters what should happen next. We close with more ""Blowers Daughter"" and Alice? walking the streets of New York looking as beautiful and as confident as ever."

","I'll be honest, I was attracted to this movie because Natalie Portman played a stripper. But 'Closer' does not rely on the selling point of Portman in a thong. It is a story about falling in love and the heart ache that comes with break ups. <br/><br/>A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits. And 'Closer' certainly leaves you pondering things when the credits roll.<br/><br/>Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen and Julia Roberts are two couples who lives become inter locked<br/><br/>With the exception of Portman none the lead characters seem nice people to hang out with. Ranking them in terms of unpleasantness. Owen walks away with it as Larry. He is a disgusting, vile man. Up next is Law as the pathetic selfish weasel Dan. Then comes Roberts, as Anna who doesn't seem to love any of the characters she claims to. But compared to the others, she ain't so bad. Then comes Portman last who seems to be the innocent party of it all, until the very end.<br/><br/>I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. (Only time I'll do this with Jude Law) All of them do a great job of making you believe their characters and their motives. <br/><br/>Some of the cast were never as good before this movie, and never were again. Jude Law has been dire in everything (except Sherlock Holmes) since. Clive Owen had 'Derailed' with Jennifer Aniston, but other than that has disappointed. Roberts has not done much since, and I'll be honest, I have not bothered to see any of her work (barring Oceans 12) as it simply didn't look that interesting.<br/><br/>As for the Oscar nominated Portman, she would go on to win the Oscar for the disturbing 'Black Swan'. She remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in the movies, and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply. Any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast."
"anthonyehler","7","0","2","22 June 2014"," Omission and flashback structure a stark drama
","Closer is an intense drama, focusing on a menage a quatre, starring Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. It is interesting to note that the film is based on Patrick Marber's stage work, with the playwright as screenwriter. Often great writers play with time in a narrative, and this definitely informs the structure of Closer. Marber uses omission and flashback with abrupt emotional power in telling the story of betrayed trust, emotional and sexual infidelity. Each sequence is of another timeframe of the story - sometimes a day before, sometimes a year forward – without using title cards to cue the audience. What he leaves out comes out with breathtaking emotional reverberation is scenes of raw confrontation.<br/><br/>The dialogue is superb: cutting, cruel, insidiously real – often uncomfortably honest. The problem, however, of stripping characters down to only their emotional selfishness and sexual secrets is four unlikeable protagonists. We don't particularly like any of these characters – Law's character seems weak and needy, Owen's is a bully, Roberts's character seems indifferent. Only Portman creates some teasing mystery and deeper vulnerability in her portrayal.<br/><br/>I think the production compensates for this by casting highly attractive actors, but it doesn't always work in making the characters seem sympathetic"
"rasmushelms","6","0","1","18 May 2014"," Good Performances, Mixed Writing
","I was left with very mixed feelings after finishing ""Closer."" While there are many things that work in the film, it is a largely uneven picture, and ultimately doesn't quite live up to the hopes that I brought to the viewing. Having loved Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"" and being impressed by the strong cast, I was looking forward to another thoughtful, moving, yet funny picture from Nichols. And while there is some genuinely witty writing to be found in ""Closer,"" I found that most of the dialogue takes the form of verbal ""showdowns"" as the characters interrogate and try to manipulate each other, which although sharp and snappy at first, begins to become slightly tiresome in the long run.<br/><br/>The film moves along at a steady pace. It starts strongly with an opening scene that immediately draws the audience, as Dan (Jude Law) takes Alice (Natalie Portman) to the hospital after she is hit by a car, which leads to the start of their romance. The film's editing sees large time shifts occur very suddenly, and without even witnessing the high points of their relationship, we are taken to where it begins to fall apart, as Dan becomes infatuated with a photographer, Anna (Julia Roberts). From this point on, the theme of appearance vs reality, already implied through Dan's work as a writer of obituaries which use euphemisms to ""cover up"" the deceased's lesser qualities (a clever aspect of the screenplay), begins to dominate the love ""rectangle"" between Dan, Alice, Anna, and Larry (Clive Owen).<br/><br/>The characters in ""Closer"" are all morally ambiguous, and their tendency to utilize lies and deception is what makes the film unpredictable. It must be said that all the performances are solid, although Natalie Portman shines brightest as the sly, seductive Alice. Furthermore, the direction is sound, yet somewhat ordinary and uninspired in comparison to ""The Graduate,"" for which Nichols won the Oscar for Best Director. <br/><br/>Ultimately, while ""Closer"" is entertaining for the most part, the strange thing is that it fails to have much of an emotion impact, despite the clear emotional pains that the characters endure."

Larry marries Anna but the wander eye strikes again.<br/><br/>Director Mike Nichols is going minimalist with Patrick Marber's play. This is a movie with four incredible performances.

","Definitely unwonted, this film, full of candid conversations (each one gets you off guard). Overall, great for drama or psychology aficionados. Its very well directed, with an amazing script, neat screenplay and not to mention the casting too couldn't have been better...each one chosen perfectly for the role, although Jude Law might be a stand-out. I'd give it an 8.3 but apparently decimal values aren't an option here.<br/><br/>The conversations are these amazing..conspicuous and the stand-out elements of the film that keep you hooked, loving the peculiarity waiting for more to come. And the entire film is a sequence of them...occurring one after the other in a different scene of a different time frame, twisting the movie as they go. The sheer candidness and raw nature of the conversations are attributes rare to find in any drama...considering the rest are mostly filled with clichéd dialogues.<br/><br/>The characters are deftly built (Jude law's is just another version of Clive Owen's with a more humanly side to it while both are brazenly truth addicts). From the way Larry cunningly sets ploys (with more than accurate anticipation of Dan's reactions) to have his way, to how Dan keeps falling for for them realizing the hustle too late is delightful to watch. Alice is this juvenile with a cute and evasive smile and I cant think of any better cast than Natalie Portman. Perfection's the word...similar feelings for Julia Robert's casting choice too.<br/><br/>Concluding, its a must watch for those with preconceptions about romantic dramas waiting to ignore the film looking at the title and the ratings thinking its just another hit a widely cast concept."

","Having recently come of out of a long term relationship, I watched this film based on a recommendation of it's potentially cathartic qualities.<br/><br/>What unfolds is a tale of the polluting effect of paranoia, and the dark side of compromise. <br/><br/>Break ups are painfully authentic. The emotion conveyed by the cast, particularly Portman, compensates for dialogue that is occasionally overblown and unrealistic.<br/><br/>Crucially this film will have you empathising with those that display infidelity.

"Steffi_P","9","0","1","16 May 2012"," ""The pictures make the world seem beautiful""
","It's nice to see that, over three decades since the likes of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and Sleuth, stageplays with minimal casts can still be made into workable movies. Closer, adapted by Patrick Marber from his own play, looks at the love lives of four professionals in early contemporary London. Set in amongst the bustle of the metropolis, yet brutal in its intense focus on the individuals involved.<br/><br/>The director Mike Nichols made his debut with the aforementioned Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, and as then he shows a rich lexicon of techniques to bring out the right aspect at the right moment. Every scene seems played for different effect. The photography scene in which Julia Roberts first appears is all about faces – well-lit, unobtrusive backgrounds and close-ups big enough to make us notice eye colour and twitching mouths. The sex chat scene shows Jude Law at first simply sat at his computer, then a little later we see wider shot with clothes strewn around a poky flat, giving us a clue as to his current living arrangements, before finally moving into mean close-ups, mostly played for comical effect. Not only does each scene have the necessary impact and perspective, each one is distinctly memorable in style and setting.<br/><br/>When such a small cast carries the burden of the whole movie upon them, you need a very capable set of performers. Jude Law at first seems a little disappointing in his woodenness, although arguably it's right for his rather weak-willed and stilted character. Julia Roberts is muted but entirely convincing. Natalie Portman is overwhelmingly emotive, silently bearing her character's pains but also believably forceful towards the end. The best performance is perhaps that of Clive Owen. Not a particularly pleasant character that he plays, but Owen somehow manages to make him likable, and almost vulnerable in his slavery to his own libido.<br/><br/>Being adapted from a minimalist stageplay, Closer makes an unconventional movie, but not a bad one. The long, dialogue-based scenes of the theatre remain intact, but the strength and individuality with which they are acted and directed prevents things from ever seeming boring or wordy. Closer is unusual for any narrative in that it rather confusingly leaps forward between scenes, sometimes across several years, without explicit notice. Once you've got the pattern however it becomes very easy to follow. The fact that it tends to tell the story through the eyes of the most despicable characters at their lowest moments forces viewers to consider their own actions rather than take the place of the victims. For all that it is about deception, it is painful in its emotional truth, which makes it fulfilling. It is dark but with a dark wit, which makes it bearable."

Jude Law gives a very good and very nuanced performance. Natalie Portman is fantastic and provides the perfect balance for a character that is flirty, manipulative, sweet, and sexual. Clive Owen is outstanding is perfect as a brass, sleazy, character who should be unlikeable but gains the audiences approval for such harsh honesty, which is a rare in a world we live in. Every character mesh well and have amazing chemistry. The story pulls you in from the very beginning in one of the best openings I've ever seen. As soon as you hear Damien Rice's ""I Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" you know you're in for quite a ride. Memorable moments, unforgettable lines, and outstanding direction make this a must watch. This is not an easy watch, but it is a brilliant film about people and their uplifting romances along with their brutal falling outs. Simply perfect."

","Mike Nichols directs a modern day complex chambre piece that follows a series of adult themed conversation involving four key characters. Themes such as sex, fidelity, desire, envy, ego, loneliness, and intimacy are explored through dark layers. 'Closer' initially gives the impression of being a silly romantic comedy but even then, if one looks carefully, there's a hint of negativity in the tense atmosphere, a darkness in the two characters. The layers are peeled as the story unfolds and relationships between the four protagonists are starkly exposed. The steady camera-work brings space to the tension filled sequences. The score is subtle and suitably underused. The lighting too is very effective. Clive Owen does a fine job as the sleazy, desperate yet intriguingly messed up doctor. Julia Roberts delivers a wonderfully understated and underrated performance. Restrained performances are often overlooked in movies where the other actors perform more dramatically or vocally and perhaps this is why Roberts did not get the deserved recognition. Natalie Portman is impressive in a complex role. It is almost as good as her career-best (which was in 'Garden State'). Jude Law makes the best of his role even though he is overshadowed by everyone else most of the time. With the backing up of strong performances and fine execution, 'Closer' additionally succeeds in its stark portrayal, exposing the relationship through dialogue without any inhibition. It's as if the conversations have been stripped off their clothes, as though an eavesdropper is listening on a very private conversation. 'Closer' is about modern dysfunctional relationships and Nichols succeeds in making his point by 'baring it all' through interaction."

","In movie form, ""Closer"" ended up being a bit of a turkey, but if nothing else it had the most attractive cast of 2004.<br/><br/>Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman take the reins of this four-hander about relationships and the nastiness they can bring out in those involved. It's a fairly grueling, unpleasant exercise -- none of the characters is especially likable or even sympathetic, so it's hard to muster up any energy to care about them and their relatively insignificant problems. On stage this probably worked, but in a movie, restricting the point of view to four people doesn't make a lot of sense in context. If they're so miserable with each other, can't they branch out and date any number of the millions of other people living in New York? <br/><br/>Still, the acting is pretty impressive, especially from Clive Owen, as a truly vile character, and Natalie Portman, sexy and enigmatic.<br/><br/>Grade: C+"

I cringe even just thinking about how awful he was in this role.<br/><br/>many comments criticise the unpleasantness of the characters. there was no one to warm to. and i agree that i didn't warm to any of them, but i don't think that is particularly a fault. what is a fault is that this film was meant to give an insight into relationships in the raw but i was not convinced by any of the relationships. there was a lot of sex, and discussion about sex, which is fine, great, but there was no passion or love or connection between two people and relationships are not just about sex. i needed to believe that jude law felt incandescent love for julia, so much so that he would be prepared to throw his actual relationship away. instead i saw them both eye each other meaningfully and say clever things to each other without making any connection.<br/><br/>In fairness, i did think that clive owen was incredible. his anger and his aggression was powerful and intriguing, however, his part simply didn't go anywhere. again natalie portman's character appeared more interesting and certainly the theme of her naming herself pondered many interesting thoughts, but again this idea wasn't developed and became a curiosity rather than the profound insight that was intended."
"wangmeijuan001","Null","0","1","26 April 2009"," Is it closer or more far away
","Having watched so many love movies with a happy ending, I was struck by ""Closer"". Change is good but maybe the movie is a bit too much for me for while now I am trying to recall its plots and lines, I am still in the same low spirits as when I finished watching the movie two weeks ago. It is the kind of movie that makes you think other than make you cry or laugh. The tag-line of the movie is ""If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking"" with which I can't agree more. In my opinion, love at first sight is ridiculous. In the movie, Alice and Dan fell in love when they first met on the street, Dan and Anna kissed when they first met in Anna's workplace, Larry began to love Anna when they met in the aquarium after he chatted with ""Anna (pretended by Dan)"" on line. The four strangers then became two couples. But they were not really intimate. They loved not because the other was the right one but because they themselves were lonely so they wanted to be closer to others in order to get companionship and comporting. Thus their love was selfish and limited, resulting in the weak relationship between each couple. That could explain why Dan could fell in love so easily with Anna when he was already with Alice, why Anna kept seeing Dan even when she got married, why Larry cared more about Anna and Dan's sex after Anna confessed to him, why Dan left Anna when he knew how Anna got Dan sign and why Dan was eager to know whether Alice slept with Larry when Alice forgave his betrayal and accepted him again. Among the four, Alice may be the one who understands love most and is most faithful to love. But what confuses me is that why she did not tell Dan her true name though she must have plenty of chances in the four years to tell him. Is it because though she knows how to love, she has never believed in love?<br/><br/>In the movie, the four characters are in a tangle, and meanwhile truth and lies are inter-twisted. Perhaps in nature, we desire truth but we are not able to tell it from lies, for example when Alice told Larry her true name, he did not believe it at all. Still we keep searching and exploring the truth even if it hurts both ourselves and others. Larry was hurt by the truth that Anna did not love him and he made use of the truths that he had sex with Anna and Alice to win Anna back and hurt Dan. Dan finally got truth from Alice but only to make Alice determine to cease loving him and leave him forever. Dan and Alice were more far away. Larry and Anna were not any closer as we can see from the movie that when Larry was in sound asleep, Anna was lying with her big black eyes open. And Dan was not closer to the truth for he had never known even the real name of the girl who was with him for 4 years. We struggle to get closer to others, but it may turn out to be the opposite. We try to get closer to truth, but who knows where truth is? I have been trying to get closer to what the movie wants to tell us , but I don't know whether I am closer or more far away to it."

","Alice, an American stripper in London, is a selling point of this movie. Credit should be given to not only her daring incorporation of nudity into purity, but also the mystery she brings about. <br/><br/>Her identity alone is so mysterious that it is not until the movie draws to its end when we could know that her real name is Jane Rachel – Alice Ayres is the pseudonym she adopted from one of the tiles she saw in Postman's Park. In fact, Alice accepts her identity as not quite human for any of the other characters, but as an object so that others could benefit. She was the subject of Dan's book, the model for Anna's photography project and the stripper for Larry.[1]<br/><br/>All the characters have a tense relationship with truth—only Alice is ""not passionate about veracity.""[2] In real life, she uses her pseudonym, Alice Ayres, while in the strip club she uses her real name, Jane Rachel. She does not, from beginning to end, reveal her identity to Dan, the man she loves deeply, but exposes everything, including her body, to Larry, the man she has no feeling for. Her inability to deal with the truth causes her to leave Dan at the end.[3] <br/><br/>Still, Alice remains the most believable character. As Portman, the actress who played Alice, points out, ""Alice is really alone when she comes to London, so she makes up her entire world, completely creates herself. Yet, she also has this childlike side. She's really honest and direct in her feelings, which distinguishes her from the other characters. So though she's lying about her persona, she's the most direct, honest character in the film.""[4]<br/><br/>The last scene echoes the opening, in which Alice is walking down the street, and strikes our curiosity about her outcome since she, once again, continues walking when the red light is on. According to the play, from which this movie was adapted, Alice dies in an accident, and Dan summons Anna and Larry to Postman's Park to remember her. It is at this point that Dan, Anna and Larry realize that they have been eluding themselves for four years, and that it was Alice that, in a roundabout way, unified them. She helped them find their identities because she herself had none.[5] It is indicated in the movie, nonetheless, that Alice will die in the end. On the tile which Alice saw at the beginning of the movie, it was written as follows: Alice Ayres, Daughter of a Bricklayer's Labourer, Who by Intrepid Conduct Saved 3 Children from a Burning House in Union Street Borough at the Cost of Her Own Young Life. It can be assumed, therefore, that the other three characters might be the ""3 Children"", and that Alice might die for them. <br/><br/>References [1] Iris. www.goodreads.com/book/show/399138.Closer Retrieved 26 April 2009.

","When Alice and Dan meet for the first time on the crowded street, they smile at each other, with traces of shyness, which reminds me of the sweet feelings of loving somebody secretly. I have expected the film to be about romantic love, however, as the scenes develop, I find it is full of love tangles.<br/><br/>Alice seems not to be interested in anything except that she wants to keep all Dan's love for herself; although she appears to be cold and tough, actually, she is very fragile and she is just a little girl who needs protecting and loving; she cannot bear to be betrayed, neither does she have the courage to face herself in real life, she chooses to move to another city or change her name when she gets hurt; she would rather to live in her own world as a liar. Dan is a charming guy, but he is a coward. I doubt he knows whom he really likes, Anna or Alice, or both? According to him, the reason why he tells Alice his affairs with Anna is that he still loves Alice, so he doesn't want to lie to her, what an odd logic! The truth is that he chooses to hurt Alice in order to satisfy his selfish desires. I am not quite clear about Anna and Larry, it seems that they have never really entered into each other's life although they try hard to. Anna is Dan to some degree, because she feels guilty after her affairs with Dan, but she dares not to confront herself, especially in front of Larry; she tries to conceal, however, Larry doesn't to allow her to do so, he is such a smart guy, he can read Anna's mind, making her a transparent object in front of him, that's the reason why Anna feels bored and wants to leave. <br/><br/>In this battle of love defense, who wins, who loses? Actually, all lose because, whether they stay together or depart, their hearts are equally empty as, even emptier than before. I can only say that they meet wrong guys at wrong time, maybe they are just the passengers in each other's lives."

","This is a difficult film to like (imho) because as many other comments have noted, the characters are unsympathetic jerks. Further, I saw no chemistry among the various permutations and combinations of the four leads, nor any development of relationships. Perhaps better acting or staging could have floated this sinking ship.<br/><br/>The characters appear to jump into connections (I won't dignify them with the term relationships) with nothing more behind them than that they have ended up in close proximity to the other at some point. If any of you ride or have ridden a subway or crowded bus route, would you have sex with someone just because he or she happened to be standing near you one day? Exchange pleasantries, some banter supposed to be witty, lips get trembly, kiss, have sex. The concept is preposterous. Or, I missed out on a heck of a lot of potential activity back in my subway riding days! With all due respect (my better half bought this turkey for $3 at an odd-lot discount store), this had ""chick flick"" written all over it, confirmed by the sappy opening dirge.<br/><br/>In addition (as others have noted), the flashbacks and fast-forwards are not differentiated from ""real time"" at all, making the activities even more difficult to follow. This is worsened by the unsympathetic personalities of the leads.<br/><br/>Definitely, one to miss..."

","This is a raw adult drama,and is very good thoughtful entertainment. If you want a mushy Hollywood style ""romance"" then this movie ain't for you. Two men and two women who are really into lust rather than love show us some of the sexual politics of real relationships and its' a game of cat and mouse where the strongest and cleverest is likely to win the day.<br/><br/>This film comes from a play and whilst one of the leads,Clive Owen,is lauded by many for his performance,yet for me he came across as slightly artificial delivering lines that did not come from his character but from a writer. Seems the picture could have been ever better if the two male leads exchanged roles. Nevertheless the story is still an engrossing show and when movie makers start to try to tell the truth about life, as this film attempts, rather then portray things in fantasy terms, then we have a decent film experience. Seven and a half, rounded down, 7/10."

","First of all, the big debate.. Is this movie supposed to be realistic or not?? I read some of the reviews here and found that, people who liked this movie, presumed it to be unrealistic and went on extolling the artsy story and witty screenplay. I found the story to be utter crap, although the screenplay, or most importantly the dialogues were extremely witty, it was the premises of this movie that left a bad taste in my mouth. My question is - Are we supposed to feel sorry for the four idiots who go on making mistakes in their love life and fall in and out of each relationship with no sense at all. I personally thought that the movie was supposed to be a realistic effort by the director, but he completely failed at it. The only likable character in the movie is portman's and its a shame to see her falling for Jude law's pathetic character again and again. The same goes for the others(Roberts and Owen). So much so, that it is impossible to empathize with any of the characters at any point. If I wanted to watch a good ""unrealistic"" artsy movie - I would watch Aliens vs Predator instead. This story is just a mockery on emotions, and the praise it receives is mostly a case of Emporers new clothes"

","The movie is actually similar to many Finnish movies from the last decade, since they too have had their fair share of people with loose morals cheating on each other. The difference is that this is even more absurd and unbelievable in some of its twists, and towards the end it gets rather uncomfortable for the viewer as well. Also, for some reason this just wasn't that entertaining.<br/><br/>Infidelity is not a new theme. This movie tries to make it to an intriguing and maybe thought provoking thrill-ride but in my opinion it's too weird to be truly successful at that. The plot twists seem forced, and that's why a more realistic touch would probably have made the movie more impressive."

","Initially I got this movie (for 4 bucks, so I'm not heart broken) because I was like ""I worship The Graduate, Natalie Portman had a couple of gems in her donut with Leon and Garden State, and I dug Jude Law in I ""Heart"" Huckabees, so why not?"" Also, the Kubrick colors and lofty camera angles made me hopefully optimistic. So now that I've given my excuses for buying the movie, here's what I thought:<br/><br/>First off, I found that Natalie Portman's very first line was an disappointing harbinger of what was to come: an unbelievable, shallow mess of a ""destructive drama"" with assumed comic relief.<br/><br/>As a whole, the dialogue reminded me of high school freshman trying desperately to come off as confident, ""experienced"" adults (but with slightly more vulgarity). Now this made for a disturbingly accurate memory jog in Fast Times, but here we're supposed to be following four jaded adults...not convincing in the slightest, and gratuitous enough to surpass a possible shock value becoming completely annoying and expected.<br/><br/>Story wise...the plot was mostly flat with a few expected twists and attempted surprises (particular at the end...yes I watch the whole thing...I was hoping for a holy moment to make my four green backs well spent, but alas...).<br/><br/>As for the acting, there were a couple of moments (mainly the prize of type casting, however), but most of the time everyone just seemed bored.<br/><br/>Photography was very nice, though...as I noted above, the colors were incredible and very possibly mood inspired and, for the most part, the shots/camera angles had their rule of 3 art quality and played well with the architecture (I say ""most"" because there was one that I found incredibly childish involving Clive and Natalie (despite the content) that should have been left out entirely or done from a more ambiguous angle to maintain the aesthetics of the rest of the film...the scene as is = think the end of the first Austin Powers...yeah).<br/><br/>But aside from that, if you're in the mood for a ""destructive relationships drama,"" I recommend you actually ""cross the pond(s)"" and try Peppermint Candy or Cry of the Owl (both very different, but very well done films)...or simply watch The Graduate, if you haven't already."

","The first time I watched this, I didn't think it was amazing, but the second time I watched it, it blew me away. It's a deeply layered character study from the director of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (another excellent character study). It plays like a play, which makes sense, because it's based on a play. <br/><br/>The acting was amazing (although I'm surprised Jude Law and Julia Roberts weren't recognized...I'm glad Natalie Portman was, as she was probably the strongest actor, but Clive Owen I felt was the weakest, although he was convincing). <br/><br/>I can see why some people may not like it, as the plot consists of its main characters deceiving each other and selfishly destroying each other's lives. Some experience karma, others don't. It's very realistic and the emotions are high and raw. There are many reversals - every character experiences what the others experience at different points. The characters are very flawed, complex, self-contradictory, and very human. There are many themes - truth, betrayal, deception, guilt, love, forgiveness, the horrible things we do for love, the tremulous nature of love, etc.<br/><br/>The screenplay doesn't insult the viewer. The dialogue is fantastic - almost every line is a double entendre. It's a moving, funny, beautiful, heartbreaking experience, if you're willing to sit through the graphic sexual dialogue. It may take repeated viewings to capture every bit of dialogue, every emotion portrayed on screen, every subtle nuance, every reversal, every metaphor...I don't really have a good ending to this review, so just watch it."

And, ON THE TOP OF FOOD-CHAIN... The scene that Julia and Owen had a couple fight was THE WORSE ever made. But, seeing the Reviews on IMDb, I read a phrase very intriguing... The phrase was almost like that: ""Even love isn't pretty from this up-close."". That phrase changed my mind. So, I decided to watch again. And I saw a outstanding romance/drama movie. I saw me there... I think everyone who have watched this movie saw themselves there.<br/><br/>Anna (Julia Roberts) is a self-destructive woman, who simply can't accept love or happiness. Yes, people like her are real.<br/><br/>Alice (Natalie Portman) is a tough, cold but romantic girl. But the problem is that... to her, the love ALWAYS ends, and than... she run away, starting all over again, and again.<br/><br/>Dan (Jude Law) is a loveless man. He can't decide which one he will love, because he suffers from a terrible absence of love.<br/><br/>Larry (Clive Owen) represents the most common love form. He Really loved Anna, and did all for her. He even made the classic mistake of a cheated man.<br/><br/>The characters are brilliant, and the cast was a good choice. You will love this movie, believe me. And by the way, the scene of Julia and Clive couple's fight still pathetic. But still, the rest of the movie will reward you. That's it! Rent and fell it."

","Based on the play, this is a movie about how each one of us damages the other, to the point where any repair is impossible, and the scars never heal. Ostensibly simple in plotting and characterization, layer-after- layer is peeled off with each new interaction one of the 4 characters has with the other, and we understand their motivations, their grief, their hurt and the depth of their wounds, some of which are still open and festering, encouraged by the attitude of the wounded, who, unbeknownst to them, perhaps even revel in the festering of the same. <br/><br/>This is how movies should be made. This is a fine example of all players being in the top of their form, and playing off each other as well. Nastiness oozes from everyone, and no punches are pulled.<br/><br/>Popcorn-munchers beware, you might bite your tongue off if you're not careful while watching this movie. This is how real people talk to one another, when they're hurt and in pain. This is how we hurt one another, and expect that we're not hurt in turn, but life has its way of making sure everyone falls. This is how people are when they're alone, when they reject someone, when they get rejected, when they're depressed, alone. <br/><br/>Some amazing direction from Mike Nichols (Silkwoood, Carnal knowledge, Catch-22, Wolf, The Birdcage - but this most closely resembles the fierce and exemplary work he did on 'Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf) make the characters deeply fleshed out and the players (Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen and Julia Roberts) make them come alive with a zeal on display that depicts their complete knowledge of how powerful they think each of their characters is, and even a flick of an eyebrow is done with a delicious relish. <br/><br/>Another great thing is the soundtrack initially belting out 'The Blower's daughter' by Damien Rice. Perfect accompaniment to a perfect movie."

Now let's talk about the strangely lovable manipulators that are Natalie Portman and Clive Owen.

I could deal with terrible relationships, but I can't deal with a bunch of pretty people crying about their problems when they create these problems for themselves. Like I need to waste time trying to believe that any of these jerks care about anything other than themselves or their problems.<br/><br/>The only thing Natalie Portman was good at in this movie was being a retard and getting ran over.

Besides astonishing performances by the actors and an exquisite yet ironic choice of music, the movie shines by its dialogs, thanks to Marber. I have seen this movie 6 times with 8 different people. The reason why most people dislike Closer is clear to me, and is even exposed in the film itself. In her first conversation with Larry, Alice says: <br/><br/>All the glittering assholes who appreciate art say it's beautiful because that's what they want to see. But the people in the photos are sad and alone. But the pictures make the world seem beautiful, so the exhibition is reassuring, which makes it a lie. And everyone loves a big fat lie.<br/><br/>That is the exact positioning of the movie. Every movie in Hollywood, every TV show, keep telling us that love is a beautiful, wonderful thing, probably the most beautiful thing to happen between humans, that it's all about doing good to each other and being true to each other. And why? Because that's what we want to see and hear, don't we? So when a movie comes out and show the dark side of love in such a raw way, we refuse to admit that, unfortunately, love is pain as much as happiness. Come on, open your eyes, it really is! The very notion of love in a couple is all fabricated: two hundred years ago, people never thought that marriage would even bring them happiness. Even courteous love was a game, and, by the way, played outside of marriage! The movie depicts perfectly our incapacity of getting into relationship in an harmonious way. Seduction is really a game in which you lose or win. <br/><br/>So if you didn't like the movie, maybe it just doesn't talk to you. Or maybe it shows what you don't want to see or believe: that those characters are extreme but realistic. The movie may be bitter, but is true and intelligent. And above, it's a movie made for those who accept to open their eyes on what love was and still is on many aspects: a war."

","Closer was one of those films that I had wanted to see for the longest time, but forgot all about the trailers I had seen over time. A year later, I spotted it on the movie store rack, and just had to check it out before I forgot about it again.<br/><br/>Closer. This movie was an incredible movie to say the least. Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman played their roles so well, and I do think it helped that I related to the film and its characters.<br/><br/>Movies with plot twists get a thumbs up from me. And to top it off - and I'm not trying to be a 'typical male', but Natalie Portman's scenes half way through the film made it that much more worth watching. Aside from that, the storyline itself was a great tale, and I hope to see another film of its caliber in the future.<br/><br/>As a last note - I was angry after I watched it the first time. Angry at the characters. The roles these two actresses played here... I was upset that they had taken those roles, and wish they hadn't. Yet, if they were not in the film, I don't see how it would have been as good as it was, and I also would not have a reason to have seen it (since I have had a crush on both actresses for so long I can't remember!).<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, you should. It is a great movie!"
"kingcaratacus","Null","0","2","14 February 2006"," Why do we relate to them?
","The four principal characters are unsympathetic. They are selfish, promiscuous, even perverted, and yet we believe in them and sympathise with them. I believe that is the strength of 'Closer'. It gives us manipulative, callous characters and yet we relate to them because their flaws are human, their evils understandable. The most sympathetic character, Ms Portman's, actually turns out to be the most manipulative of them all. This film asks us to examine our dark halves, our own private perversions and selfishness. It asks us to examine the multiple natures of humanity. It's a manipulative film, definitely, but it's only reflecting the way we manipulate ourselves and those around us."

","I haven't seen much of Mike Nichols since this one, so it was a real surprise for me. A love story for adults and a cure for those who thought love was a simple thing you could easily play with it. Strangers,it's all about the ones we think to know, the people we love in vain, that we are sure to know and then in the end they weren't themselves for us. Magnificent performances by the actors, an excellent director, very intelligent dialogues and a simple script - my God, that's a masterpiece! i have no doubt about it. Some people may be reluctant about the movie and it did't won any Academy award. Well, if it was unfair for ""Lost In Translation"", is much more unfair for ""Closer"". Thank you Mike Nichols, one of the movies of my life."

","This movie tried hard to be intelligent and claim that mental capacity was the answer to overcome the temptation of jeopardizing relationships. If you are smart enough to realize this is not true, you probably weren't stupid enough to give the movie a try. For those of you who are, like me, not so bright, don't be fooled by this lavish attempt at convincing a bunch of horn-dogs that we're on a higher plane. Closer is nothing but cleverly disguised trailer trash, who are avoiding the realities of frail existence. May we all realize that every day we wake up is a mercy, not a playground for our privates. Julia Roberts is plain, and manly. Natalie Portman knows how wrong such a portrayal is, and Jude Law wishes he could come up with such snappy replies without poring over a script."
"happy_hangman","Null","0","1","19 January 2006"," Thought Provoking But Theatrical
","Adapted from his own play by Patrick Marber, 'Closer' is without a shadow of a doubt the most theatrical film I have seen in a very long time. This isn't entirely a criticism, as it establishes a firm structure upon which plot and characterisation can be built. This skeleton is very leanly fleshed-out: there's a great economy of location, with each scene change advancing the narrative by many months, and we are provided with minimal information as to what has occurred in the lives of the principal characters in the intervening time. This, of course, means that the use of flashbacks  though rare  jars with the general tone and rhythm of the piece. A more cinematic re-structuring of Marber's script may have remedied this, but I fear greater fault lies in the rather pedestrian direction of Mike Nichols.<br/><br/>The performances are sound, particularly that of Clive Owen. Although unsubtle and aggressively (though not violently) sexual, there's an endearing earnestness to his character, Dan. Interestingly, he is the only character who is entirely open about his feelings, intentions and desires. He immediately admits to an infidelity, fully prepared to accept the consequences of his stupidity  and is outraged not by Julia Roberts's admission that she has been sleeping with Jude Law but by her deception of him. Marber clearly believes that Dan is a model for the modern honest sexual male  openly acknowledging his pornographic lusts  and this may be true, I suppose. Unfortunately Nichols direction, in spite of Owen's performance, renders Dan as a tragic-comic caricature much of the time.<br/><br/>A painfully flat performance by Julia Roberts  another one of Marber's bland women  doesn't help. She has only one outstanding scene, a vicious argument with Owen where she is forced to confess the sordid details of her liaison with Law. Even here, though, it's Owen who steals the moment with the glorious kiss-off line which it would be inappropriate to reprint here  but which I hope, in the course of some future failing relationship, to use.<br/><br/>Law is no more annoying than usual, and tries hard to turn on the charm. What could have been an interesting representation of a selfish moral coward verges all too often (and unsuccessfully) toward apologia. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives a capable turn, too, as Law's stripper girlfriend, Alice. All things to all men - Caesar's Wife in a sequined thong - she becomes an object of fascination for both Law and Owen (and briefly, artistically, for Roberts, though this is not developed). We are told that her wild sexual history was used as inspiration for the former's only novel and that, in her words, the only thing he missed out was ""the truth"", but we are, as an audience, told nothing of her past. A sexually obsessed Owen seeks her out, pays for her to strip for him, but becomes frustrated because she'll tell him nothing but the truth about herself and her sexuality  even if he is incapable of recognising it as such. She's cast in a variety of fantasy roles: Law's rescued waif and Owen's whore (Marber's Sphynx, perhaps?), but how far either is accurate is uncertain. Alice, I think, meant to be shaped as much by our own prejudices and preconceptions as she is by Portman's performance. <br/><br/>Portman is a strange choice for this role. She is a stunningly beautiful young woman, but  even when garbed in the most minimal pole-dancing garb  oddly nonsexual. She's like Audrey Hepburn in that regard. Perhaps the argument could be proffered for Alice as a modern-day Holly Golightly  both, after all, have mysterious pasts, work in areas of the sex-industry (though unlike Capote's Golightly there is no indication that Alice is, or ever has been, a prostitute) and have rather tortuous emotional relationships with their unsuccessful writer boyfriends.<br/><br/>'Closer' is a good play. It's not a bad film, but Nichols surprisingly fails to recognise it's essential un-cinematic nature."

","I thought this was a great sexy movie. I just love Jude Law's and Clive Owen's characters in the movie. Natalie Portman was excellent. She is such a great actress. I really had wished that Alice and her boyfriend would have ended up together again. I love the song played at the end when everyone is looking back at Alice, which I think the title is can't take my eyes off of you. Can you tell me who sings this song. I would like very much to get this recording. On another comment someone had asked why everyone was looking at Alice. I think that was a great way to end the movie for Alice's character. She's confident and starting a new life for herself even though as I earlier commented I had wished they had worked things out."

","I was blown away by this movie. It continues to haunt me too. It's not very often when a film makes you think so much and do deep soul-searching. I really liked the story and the characters. It was so true... so real. I do think the title could have been better. Closer does not describe the experience. Something like ""Brutal Honesty"" or ""RAW"" would've been better suited.<br/><br/>The main thing that sticks with me about this movie is how anyone in their right mind could cheat on the gorgeous Natalie Portman! Yeah, yeah, it was with Julia Roberts, but come on! OK, you could say that Julia's character was a mature woman and Portman played a young, naive, flaky stripper. Fine, if you want to knit-pick!!! ;)<br/><br/>The other thing that I remember most about this movie is the intense conversations the jilted lovers had with each other! Men do ask those insane questions about sex. Why???? So crazy and yet so true.<br/><br/>The music and images at the beginning and ending are haunting..."

","When I first heard about Closer I thought 'Oh God another romance flick!' So, I decided not to go and see it in the movies. Many of my friends did and they all loved it, but me being someone who doesn't like typical romances told them that I didn't want to see it or hear about it. A big mistake on my part! My ignorance meant I missed the experience of seeing this movie in the theatres. Finally, I went to rent some DVD's and it was there. I thought 'What's the harm?' So I rented it and watched it. But, not all of it, as it seemed slightly complex and I couldn't be bothered. Again, my ignorance served me badly. Finally, I got round to watching it properly. I thought it was OK, and it wasn't until I sat and read the quotes on this website that I realised just how funny this film was. Not only was it funny, but it was interesting and very well mad in my opinion. OK, so maybe it's a little confusing, but once I realised who was who and what was going on, I couldn't tear my eyes away.

","One of the most realistic love stories I have ever seen. I can't say I'd call it a 'romantic comedy', although it has to do with romance and has plenty of good laughs in it. But the story does not follow that of a romantic comedy. It shows how love really is. I absolutely can't stand romantic comedies but this movie has become one of my favorites. I just love movies that make you think. And this story was so realistic- I watched it with my boyfriend and even he liked it. I could really relate to the plot. It shows that love is not perfect, the 'real' aspects of relationships, and that things don't always turn out to be what you want them to be. There are so many great lines in the movie that have stuck in my head. I absolutely loved Natalie Portman in this movie and can completely relate to her character."

"Paddy-49","5","0","1","3 October 2005"," Discomforting and unreal, but compelling viewing
","I found this one of the most discomforting movies that I have seen for a long time. I revere Mike Nichols who has made some of the very best films of the last forty years. But Closer seemed in an alien style with dialogue and action that was unrealistic (maybe deliberately so) and a plot line that constantly made me want to say WHY? It is a film about lust and love without any actual sex scenes to speak of. That was quite smart of Nichols as it made us concentrate on the action and the screenplay rather than acting as voyeurs. I did not find the scene in the ""Mens Club"" (or whatever it was) particularly shocking, but what was Alice actually doing there? Played by Natalie Portman she was so delectable that you couldn't really believe that she would pass her days as a pole dancer! Julia Roberts made a reasonably believable photographer and there was some depth in her performance. But she didn't actually look particularly good (sorry Julia)! The key scene of the film is the cyber-sex scene and I frankly found it repulsive. Was it believable that the two male leads (Jude Law and Clive Owen) would get their kicks in this way? Not to me it wasn't, but perhaps I've lived a sheltered life.<br/><br/>Does the film seek to suggest that in the first decade of the 21st Century anything goes as far as relationships are concerned? That you can love (Dan says that he loves Alice) but still prowl and try and make it with someone you fancy within minutes of a meeting(Dan and Anna). I suppose that this may be the way of the modern world, but it is awfully cold and cynical and really loveless.<br/><br/>I rather wish I had not seen Closer for all its technical excellence and even given the pretty good performances by the four leads. It was an unsettling film and it left me confused rather than entertained."

"paul_johnr","9","0","1","18 September 2005"," Seems made for home viewing
","Considering how little physical action there is in this film, it is something of a minor miracle that 'Closer' works as effectively as it does. Patrick Marber's screenplay, adapted from his successful stage play, is built entirely on dialogue and the social interactions of four people. With a great cast and sex as the main theme, fireworks are bound to go off.<br/><br/>I did not see 'Closer' when it was released in theatres, deciding to watch it on DVD. While I do not know what kind of experience the movie is on a big screen, there is a level of intimacy that makes it seem ideal for watching alone in the living room. This film is about four out-of-the-ordinary people who are in bizarre relationships, yet call for our own self-examination. Marber's writing is not kind; it is a brutal portrayal of how sex can be used to establish personal territory and hurt others. There are definitely connections between Marber and the work of two other playwrights, Harold Pinter (especially 'Betrayal') and Edward Albee, who hold similar views on intimacy and the use of language (or absence of it) to maintain power.<br/><br/>Besides watching Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts take on completely new persona, it is a major surprise to see all four marquee actors work so well as a group. This is the type of film where one actor's talents can overwhelm an entire cast. Portman and Clive Owen, in my opinion, stand out the most, but never does one actor seem to be looking for an upper hand over the remaining three. There is wide debate as to whom the best and worst 'moral' characters are, which owes to the fine balance in Marber's writing and the excellent direction of Mike Nichols.<br/><br/>Date movie seekers beware, do not see! You may be banging your head against a wall afterwards. Recommended for solitary viewing with a very open mind. Also be aware that the Columbia Pictures DVD does not offer much in the way of extras. 'Closer' is presented in anamorphic widescreen format only with English and French subtitles. Besides a standard trailer, the disc carries a music video of Damien Rice's 'The Blower's Daughter,' Closer's main theme.<br/><br/>*** ½ out of 4"

","With movies like ""The Notebook"" coming out, it annoyed me that all these movies had a typical ""happily ever after"" ending. Yes, I'm only 16, but I want to see what relationships are truly like, not the sugar coated versions. Then I rented Closer. A couple of my friends tried to talk me out of it, saying it was too crude, not realistic and just hands down horrible. Thankfully, I didn't listen to them. I'm not going to summarize it, because others already have, but this is what I wanted to see in movies. Closer is sharp witted, sad, and crude, but this is exactly what I wanted to see.<br/><br/>I've seen almost every Julia Roberts movie out there, but this one is probably my favourite. This is not the average Julia Roberts movie. Her one scene with Clive Owen made me hold my breath. As for Clive, he is spectacular here. So is Natalie Portman. This is Natalie's breakthrough role. Her portrayal of Alice is so real, it's hard to imagine her as a character. Jude Law's Dan annoyed me, honestly, but he played the character well, as he usually can't annoy me.

","Closer is trying to say something profound, but who knows what. It's a case of style over substance - a ""much ado about nothing"".<br/><br/>An anti-feminist movie, with two thoroughly unlikeable men, one silly woman (Roberts), and an OK, but naive(?) fourth (Portman). The women are just chess-pieces being played by the men, and seem quite content reacting to their manipulated status. No empowerment, insight or intelligence. Maybe this is real life, where women just cannot help themselves, poor things.<br/><br/>Quite a tedious movie about a pointless subject, lots of talking about pointless subjects and debating about pointless subjects, meaningful looks, bed-hopping, lying, deceit. There is very little character sympathy developed - as each character is completely indulgent and fails to exercise restraint or discipline.<br/><br/>This mediocre picture is not helped by gratuitous attempts to give the characters some vague backgrounds: Roberts is a (mediocre) photographer, who seems to live by the rule that a crap picture is better if its enlarged, Portman is a stripper (now that's worth the rental fee!) and Owen is a doctor of some sort. Most contrived, Law is an obituary writer. Maybe he could write an obituary about his nearly dead career, having been in turkey after turkey recently.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it's good to see Julia Roberts in an understated ""Adult"" role, and she shows that she can excel in a good dramatic role. Portman isn't too bad, and Jude Law and Clive Owen just go through the motions. Well, the male characters did OK, given the weakness in their scripts."

","Closer reveals the beautiful people being beautiful, or, lying liars and their lies. Another Mike Nichols portrayal of beauty in emotional distress, i.e.; Ann Margaret, Katherine Ross, Annette Benning, Sandy Dennis, Stockard Channing, Meryl Streep. A story of attraction and repulsion, Closer is well photographed with an interesting story and great casting. Urban London is a wonderful setting. From Nichols, who directed several of the finest American films of the '60s and '70s some of the most atrocious and embarrassingly bad dialog I can remember. All four characters are dishonest with each other and themselves, conniving, manipulative, and tormented by their own awful, immoral behavior. When Julia Roberts and Jude Law first kiss she presses the shutter release on the cable she is holding as though it's a metaphoric climax. I actually laughed out loud. Portman is the star of what could be her breakout film. The story also concludes well. Law's character is alone and discovers Portman's waif was never honest or really trusted him. Carnal Knowledge has been one of my favorite films since I first saw it in the seventies. There are similarities that would make this a suitable bookend to Nichol's career. Well worth seeing but by no means a major film."

","Legendary director Mike Nichols turns his attention to sex, and lots of it, in the highly controversial Closer. The entire cast is full of Academy Award nominees and winners including Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen (rumored to be the next James Bond). The story revolves around four strangers who make one another's lives miserable as they continually love and cheat on one another. This is a very chatty film, but luckily for Nichols the screen writing by Patrick Marber is so jaw-dropping that it could keep the focus of an auditorium full of attention deficit disorder teens for the entire hour and forty minutes.<br/><br/>All four bring very different personalities to their characters, some who lead a false existence and others that are so brutally honest with one another that it is scary. It seems like an ultimate showdown between real and fake in the dangerous game of commitment. I love the overall message and tone of the film, as Nichols shows how easy it is to love and even easier to lose.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but shake my head at some of the things I heard from this film, some of it actually making me laugh because of its excessive use. Of all the talent, I was surprised by Julia Roberts the most in this film. You just don't expect her to be as controlled and fragile as she is in this role.

This film has annoyed me and I want you to be saved from having to suffer it.<br/><br/>I am sure, however, that there are people (in fact I know by its rating) that like this sort of film. I just ask you to try and enjoy life. Embrace amusing, light-hearted and rewarding films. For goodness sake, watch Around The World in 80 Days with Jackie Chan and look on the bright-side!"

","possible mild spoilers ahead . . .<br/><br/>To be fair, 'Closer' is only rarely painful to watch, and though I found myself loathing most of the characters, they held my interest. The actors are engaging and attractive--especially Clive Owen as the oddly sympathetic Larry and Natalie Portman as Alice, the one character who doesn't seem to deserve the misery that befalls her--and though the settings seem a little excessively hip (big, airy London flats; upscale art gallery; high end, 'gentleman's club'-type strip joint, etc.), this is the movies, after all: even in non-escapist fare, we audiences prefer to watch people who are better looking than us, have cooler wardrobes and haircuts, and hang out in the land of the beautiful people, looking perfect, sipping champagne, smoking French cigarettes, and talking about serious stuff like art, literature, and, of course, sex.<br/><br/>The trouble with 'Closer' is false advertising. The title of the film and play itself suggest that the story will be about intimacy, but the screenplay keeps the audience at arm's length. We open with the chance meeting of Alice, a precocious American tramp meant to fit the 'La Boheme' archetype (she actually refers to herself as 'a waif'), and Dan, another big, black-and-white stock character--the struggling artist, confined to an unrewarding job as a writer of obituaries for a London newspaper. The melodramatic soundtrack does the work of informing us that these two have made an instant connection of epic, Romeo-and-Juliet, Tristan-and-Isolde proportions. We learn that Alice is fresh off the plane from NYC, where she has left both a problem boyfriend and her job as a stripper (yet another of an endless string of clichés that mar this film). Dan self-effacingly reveals his deep desire to be a successful novelist.<br/><br/>But before we get a chance to see these characters gain some depth below type, we are propelled one or two years into the future. Dan has sold his first novel--borrowing shamelessly from the presumably colorful life of Alice, who is now his girlfriend and flat-mate--and is being photographed for the novel's dust-jacket by Anna (Julia Roberts), to whom he finds himself inexplicably and overwhelmingly attracted (hey, Julia's hot, no doubt, but would she really knock Natalie Portman off the pedestal that easily?), particularly after he learns she's been up all night reading a galley copy of his book. We know so little about Dan that the sincerity of his attraction can't really be known; his first scene with Alice suggests that he's a shy, unassuming fellow, but with no indication of what has taken place between his meeting with Alice and his session with Anna, we have no reason to think he doesn't flirt with every attractive woman he meets. Alice arrives, instantly senses the attraction between Dan and Anna, provokes a bizarre but arresting confrontation with Anna . . .<br/><br/>And then once again we are flung into the unspecified future, where Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist who occupies himself with pornography and on-line sex chat, is cruelly lured by Dan (posing as a horny female swinger named 'Anna') into confronting the real Anna at her favorite place to relax, the London Aquarium. Lo and behold, the two hit it off (though one might suspect that Anna's initial interest in Larry might be fueled by a desire to get back at Dan for the sadistic joke).<br/><br/>We jump ahead haphazardly again and again, and it's safe to say without giving anything away that the sexual tension between Dan and Anna eventually comes to a head, after which bad things ensue. We then get the pleasure of watching our pretty, serious actors berate each other in vulgar, bitter exchanges. Jealousy and resentment abound; the wronged lovers Larry and Alice have their own encounter when Larry stumbles drunkenly into the club where Alice works after having left Dan (with Natalie Portman proving once again that the best ways for a pretty girl to get an Oscar nomination are either to wear a fake nose or play a stripper/whore). I assume we're meant to be filled with admiration for these 'courageous' performances, but even pretty, serious actors can't make us sympathize with these despicable characters. Julia Roberts gives the subtlest, most restrained performance, but we're never given any indication of what Anna sees in either Dan or Larry. Clive Owen's Larry is probably the most interesting character--a relatively sympathetic nice guy with a dark, misogynistic streak and a penchant for rough sex and porn. Dan seems sweet in the first scene, but then proceeds to behave monstrously, so that you find yourself hoping he'll get his well-earned comeuppance.<br/><br/>The structure of the film seems like the sort of device that might work well on stage, but on film, the audience is too distant from the characters' inner lives. Furthermore, Mike Nichols chooses here to take the melodramatic route, overusing Damien Rice's maudlin pop confectioneries to overstate the seriousness and importance of what's happening, so much so that we feel as if we're being pounded over the head with the film's deep seriousness, when in fact it's a rather simple story about shallow, selfish people betraying each other.<br/><br/>The real trouble here is that, despite the rare opportunity to see Natalie Portman bending over in a thong and Julia Roberts comparing the flavors of her two lovers' sperm samples, this film has nothing new to say about contemporary love relationships. Deception destroys trust, love is soured by jealousy, vindictiveness is ruinous . . . don't we already know this? Alice summarizes the situation appropriately early on in the film: when Dan lamely apologizes for having fallen in love with Anna with the classic 'I didn't mean for this to happen' line, Anna succinctly reminds him that 'there's always a moment' when one can choose to resist temptation--to suppress his/her own desires or perceived needs and avoid betraying trust. This one scene renders the rest of the film superfluous."

","The justifications for spending any more time on this movie than watching it are two: First, I have lots of spare time, and second, it gives me something to do to try to come up with a second reason.<br/><br/>That said, the only character of any interest is the doctor, Clive Owen. The character seems sort of genuine and Owen is convincing in the role. Unfortunately, even his character seems to be a thawed out freeze dried shell of a human being, a circumstance certainly true of the other three characters. Of those three, why did the makers of this minor venture get Julia Roberts to play such an unchallenging role? That seems among the most blatant wastes of talent in a long time until one views the Willem Defoe role in Bill Murray's insomnia curing ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"". Now, Natalie Portman is definitely a treat for male eyes, and maybe the same could be said of Jude Law for the female gender, however, the movie is too simple to take in any sort of serious way, and possibly because of its foppishness can not be seen as offensive as ""Sideways"". At any rate, if you are in the mood to see a marginally amusing c- attempt at romantic comedy (or maybe even seriousness) with a decently written character and young pretty people, ""Closer"" could be an alternative to consider."

","I'm sorry to all of you who believe that you've witnessed a masterpiece because I had some serious problems with this film. At no point did I get any reason whatsoever for why these characters are so madly in love with each other. Nothing of their personalities is really examined because all of their conversations are about one thing and one thing only, Sex. Please, if anyone can prove me wrong and say that there was actually some substance to the characters relationships besides sex I'd be glad to read it, because I don't think it's possible. My main problem with the film is Julia Roberts character, who for all of my understanding has little to no qualities, at least expressed in the film, that would bring two men to fall so helplessly in love with her, pretty smile aside. I can't believe Roberts as an artist, actually taking the photographs and I cant understand why such an integral part of the story is based around those talents, because ultimately it is completely irrelevant to her actions. She isn't kind, or caring, or understanding, and she certainly isn't a morally fit human being. WHY are they in love with her? The reason is never clear because she has no redeeming qualities, pretty hair aside. I can't say that Roberts did a bad job, and I do respect her work, but she didn't have a whole hell of a lot to work with, besides two very talented actors in Clive Owen and Jude Law. The character killed the movie for me because she is NOT lovable, and the story is based around two men obsessively in love with her. Oh, wait, I must be a moron, it was love at first sight, doesn't that just clear up the whole thing."

I'm not saying that she shouldn't be allowed to do things outside her 'Pretty Woman' thing. It's just that she wants to have her cake and eat it too.

"TxMike","Null","0","2","21 May 2005"," There are no likable characters, but an interesting movie if you like watching people cheat.
","Set primarily in London, ""Closer"" has only four characters who matter to the story. Natalie Portman is young New Yorker Alice (or maybe Jane?), new in London, and who has a chance meeting with Dan (Jude Law). Maybe it is because she was looking left instead of right at the intersection and is hit by the vehicle. Dan is a London newsman, his job is writing obituaries for the newspaper. Julia Roberts is a bit daring as Anna , a photographer. Quite by different accident, Dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen) comes into Anna's life, then they all come into each other's lives, for better or for worse. Mostly for worse. None of them are ""model"" people, and Larry is certainly not what you would want your doctor to be, or maybe your doctor is! How would you know? Interesting character studies, but with no likable characters, I found myself a bit unconcerned after it ended.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. Portman seemed intent on shattering her ""girl"" image and here plays a stripper, in some very revealing costumes. Roberts also plays against her usual roles, as here she cheats sexually willingly. Larry surfs the internet when he can, looking for dirty-talking young girls for sex. Angry that Anna put him off, Dan pretends to be a horny girl and lures Larry to the aquarium to meet Anna, as retribution. But Anna and Larry hit it off, and eventually get married. But Anna still has groans for Dan and she cheats. Larry is controlling, and by sheer will gets Alice in bed. Each in turn destroys the confidence and love of the other. At the end, Alice returns to New York, we see on her passport that she really is Jane."
"rosie_smash","10","0","1","10 May 2005"," Closer
","Closer is one of the most interesting films I have ever seen. The four main characters are not really nice people - especially not to each other - and yet they are very intriguing. The story is basically about 4 people who happen to meet each other under very weird circumstances. The story continues through several sexual betrayals that are dealt with very bluntly and realistically. That is really all I can say about the plot without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Two of the performances from this movie have been nominated for several awards and they were definitely deserving. Natalie Portman plays, in my opinion, the most interesting character - Alice - and it is the first time I have seen her in a very ""adult"" role. She holds her own amongst established actors that are all older than she is. Clive Owen, as Larry, is unbelievable. He is, at the same time, the character that delivers the harshest lines - they make you want to squirm in your seat due to their personal nature - and yet he is also a character that you find you want to succeed. The best scenes in the film are between these two actors and I think they deserved all of the awards they received (and should have gotten more!)It is worth it to see Closer just for their acting.<br/><br/>Jude Law is good, but his character, Dan, is just not the most interesting one. I found that I didn't really invest too much in him. Unfortunately, the big problem for me was Julia Roberts as Anna. She, once again, plays her typical ""Julia Roberts"" character, although in this case she doesn't smile at all. She is so boring that myself and the person I watched the film with couldn't understand why the men were so interested in her. Her character has a little ""kink"" that I didn't even realize until Clive Owen's character spells it out later in the film. I know I am in the minority when it comes to Julia Roberts. I just don't think she is all that good. She's certainly not terrible, but when compared to the excellence of the other three in Closer she becomes a massive drag factor to the film.<br/><br/>Like I said, the people in this film do awful things to each other an yet I found myself really interested in their stories. While there is no sex on screen that I can remember, the dialogue is very sexually graphic and very personal. If you have problems with this then Closer is not the film for you. I, however, thought it was one of the best written, best acted, most intriguing movies I have seen in a very long time. Excellent film!"

","This movie makes the assumption that when beautiful people, who are complete strangers, get together, they immediately kiss and fall in love. It amazes me that so many people comment of the realism of this film. It could not be farther from reality (unless you expand the definition to include ""Reality"" dating shows.) Where do we see that these people would ever fall in love with each other? They meet and then they are all in love. Not one frame of this movie is devoted to the how or why they fall in love. ""You're pretty, I'm pretty"" leads to sex not love. We are not even shown when the couples get back together. We have to hear it from the characters mouths. Is that suppose to be exposition? Making up is the low hanging fruit of any love story. They couldn't even write this in? A myriad of factors go into falling in love. Not the least of which is the test of time. This makes writing love into a movie very difficult, but there are several examples of it being done successfully. To call this a ""reality based"" love story discredits films like ""Eternal Sunshine"" and ""When a Man Loves a Woman"". Yes, even the sci-fi movie ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" does a better job of showing us a true picture of two people in love than this movie does.<br/><br/>The final collection of scenes (especially the hotel scene with Portman and Law) were pretty good and provided some redemption for the film. However, the final scene with her walking down the street and all the guys' heads turning was really bad. What are we supposed to believe that she is ""beautiful"" and empowered now? She's Natalie Portman! When in this film was she not beautiful? If you want to see the transformation of a female character from self conscious and meek to strong and empowered (and therefore beautiful on that merit alone) then look to Whoopie Goldberg's character in the Color Purple."

","Watching these morally bankrupt characters go about their lives is similar to, but less interesting than, watching ants in an ant farm. That's how detached from them I felt. <br/><br/>But the worst problem is that there is almost no motivation for anything that happens. People say, frequently, ""I love YOU now"", or ""I don't love you any more. I'm leaving"", or ""I've been having an affair"" and there is almost nothing prior on screen to indicate why. Apparently these schizo people just wake up one morning and decide to make major changes in their lives for no apparent reason. <br/><br/>The only sympathetic, flesh-and-blood, character is played by Natalie Portman. There is not a camera angle or pink wig that can make her look anything less than stunning. There is one scene, not sexual, where she is in bed with a lover she has just been reunited with, bouncing around like a puppy for joy. In this short scene she goes way beyond the words, to communicate utter contentment, hope for the future, vulnerability. Her acting was terrific and made the film worthwhile."

If you are even thinking of having any children watch this with you or heaven forbid by themselves, please rethink that. It would be a very bad idea. But the sexual language isn't all I object to. It's just the pitiful humans that are represented by these actors. If this is supposed to be a portrayal of a ""normal"" relationship then I feel sorry for all those ""normal"" people out there. If you are looking for a feel-good movie, this is definitely not it.<br/><br/>With that said, I do see so much talent in Natalie Portman and I see her winning many Oscars in the future.

"ztkl40a","4","0","1","7 April 2005"," A boring movie not worth the time
","I just saw this movie last night, after hearing a lot about it, and I didn't really like it. It failed both as entertainment, and as art. It's not a love/hate response like some reviewers seem to be implying, it was just boring. Normally, for a movie this boring, I wouldn't waste my time writing a review, but I figured since so many people are raving about it, and that influenced my decision to see it, I'd warn others before they watched it.<br/><br/>I wasn't put off by the vulgar language, or the frankness about sex. I just didn't find the movie engaging. I already knew from a review I heard on the radio that none of the characters were going to be likable, so I was prepared for that and it didn't put me off. But if the purpose of art is supposed to be to evoke an emotional response, this movie failed. It's about four dislikable people, doing what you'd expect them to do. There's no sympathy towards the characters when they get screwed, because you don't like them to begin with, and no anger about what they're doing to the other characters, because the other characters are just as bad. So, it just ends up being a rather bland movie from the point of view of emotional response from the audience.<br/><br/>So, I wouldn't ever buy this movie, or take the time to watch it again, but that being said, not everything about this movie was awful. I think the actors and actresses did well acting their parts, there were a few humorous moments where me and my wife laughed, and (to completely lose all credibility of this review) Natalie Portman was easy on the eyes. But after watching this movie, I really just didn't like it. However, it seems that many people do, so if you like relationship movies about characters you don't like, where everybody gets what they deserve, and nobody ends up happy, go ahead and watch this movie."

There was a big hype about it where I was and it was a movie everyone was talking about it. But when I sat back and watched it I found that I had a hard time keeping up and following time lines. They would flash back and then flash forward. The acting was great. Julia Roberts was as good as ever. But the acting does not make up for the hard to follow script. This movie is very close to the truth on what goes on in a love square. People bounce back and forth then back and then leave or stay where they are unhappy. In that respect it was very real. I found it to be a little too graphic for my taste in the scenes in the club.

This movie is beautifully shot and narrated, using pictures and events as much as words. There are some jumps in the timeline, but not at all confusing. The performance of the actors, which is great all over, in addition to the work of writer and director, makes this a movie just as much felt as seen. There are laughs (much thanks to a witty dialog) and there are sorrows.

","I don't have a lot to say about this movie, as it left me largely un-moved by the shenanigans of the characters. First no-one is together, then ""Alice"" and Dan get together as do Anna and Larry. There is a small amount of humour in how Larry and Anna meet - Dan is on the interweb in some chatroom, pretending to be Anna and gets into some pretty puerile sex talk with Larry. It really was rubbish. They agree to meet at the Aquarium, which it just so happens is where Anna is sitting. So, some interesting play with identity - Larry is full of references from his sex talk and Anna, of course, has no idea what he's talking about.<br/><br/>But then Dan ""loves"" Anna, so of course they have to get together, and damn the consequences. Not that I cared for either Larry, who was pretty much a jerk, or Anna. In only a couple of scenes could I summon up any affection for Dan - right near the end, he seemed like a decent enough fellow for a bit, but then he turned out to not be. At least he could recognize that his need to know, his need to have the truth, made him an idiot - I could admire him for that, but then he couldn't handle the truth (if, in fact, it was given to him - I rather suspect he was not).<br/><br/>Which brings me to the only character I could feel anything for. ""Alice"" turns up in London (ex USA) as a waif on an expedition. She meets Dan thanks to a small car accident - it was kind of cute, the way he went with her to the hospital, stayed with her, then when it came time to part, he did so formally, only to wheel around and come back for her. She loves him, perhaps needly. Once Dan goes after Anna, ""Alice"" returns to her former work as a stripper. The best scene, not because of her near nudity but because of the way she played it, was in the strip bar - Larry has come in for a bit of fun, recognizes her and wants to break through her professional mask, get her to tell him something ""real"". She insists her name is Jane, but never drops the mask: since Larry knows her as Alice, it never occurs to him that that might have been the mask and that this is the truth. So, she keeps saying she is Jane, he keeps throwing money at her and shows he really isn't a pleasant fellow at all."

Both are excellent, but if we're being honest, don't see both. Choose one or the other. The play is more depressing, but also much more brutally honest whereas, in the process of taking the play to the big screen, several things had to be changed to make it more Hollywood, a.k.a. less depressing. Another thing that kinda got to me was the Britishness of it all. It was supposed to be British, it was good British, but when you get two American actresses to play the lead roles, see if you can get rid of the British slang, they just sound kinda dumb saying it."

","I just finished watching Closer and all I can say is what was the purpose of this movie? Perhaps it's because I couldn't relate to the characters. To me, sex does not equal love. It's almost a distraction at times. None of the characters were ever in love with each other, they all had meaningless purely physical relationships. Perhaps that was the point of the movie, to show how far society has sunk into carnal pleasures over actual affection and commitment to a person you care about. IF that's the case, it's been done before countless times. Also, I felt that Natalie Portman, as nice as she is to look at, turned in her usual crap performance. The others in the film were par; all this talk of Oscar consideration is way out of the question. I also felt that the story was a tad predictable after the first switch occurred; it was pretty obvious that no one was going to end up happy no matter what happened. Still, I forced myself to watch the whole thing to confirm my prediction.<br/><br/>If you like petty sex dramas, and aren't mature enough to realize that sex does not equal love, then watch this movie, you might learn something."

","Having only seen a TV ad for this movie, and based on the poster, I was expecting a romantic comedy or love story - some sort of ""chick flick"" - wrong. Being a fan of Natalie Portman, it expected that her presence would make the film worthwhile, and I like Julie Roberts too. After enduring the movie I had to wonder why Julie, and more so Natalie, would chose to be a part of something this (verbally) graphic and vulgar. I can only assume she wanted to ""demonstrate her versatility"" or some such thing. It's a safe bet George Lucas would not be pleased to see Queen Amidala spreading her legs wide - I joked at the time that ""now we know what drives Anakin Skywalker to become Darth Vader"".<br/><br/>All four actors do their job well enough, and the cinematography likewise gets a passing grade, although it's - appropriately enough - dark. Aside from the somewhat jarring presence of porn dialogue in a love story, this film's main failing is that you don't care that these characters are destroying their own relationships. Natalie's character is the most sympathetic, but all four suffer from their own bad choices. One of them even says ""you made the choice"" to cheat - it doesn't ""just happen"" as is so often the excuse.<br/><br/>There are probably real people whom are as weak - even pathetic - as the four in ""Closer"", but I don't want to watch them, and worse pay to do so."

The rest of the cast too have turned out decent performances. The movie does have a very mature soundtrack which is probably the savior lobbying her into the 7-7.5 range . Apart from this , the movie can offer you some clever mentions of the ""F"" word . Overall, it's just ""Zebra Lounge"" where the amoral sleaze has an honest purpose called Love.<br/><br/>This movie is strictly not suitable to watch with your parents.

My favorite part was when Natalie Portman's Alice overheard a conversation near the beginning, and told Julia Robert's Anna ""just take my picture!"" A tear slid down her cheek then, and you could tell that she was hurt. I think that a lot of people can get something out of ""Closer"", and really relate to it. It's simply a wonderful portrait of human deception, lies, and suffering. I would recommend ""Closer"" to anybody, but it's not a date movie if that's what you're in the mood for. In ""Closer"", you can see how people intenionally try to hurt other people. I think that Natalie Portman did the best job in her role as the stripper Alice.

"Philby-3","7","0","1","27 February 2005"," Too close, maybe
","This is a film that hasn't really left the theatre, from whence it came. The original author, Patrick Marber, a hot young British playwright of the 90s, produced an intense theatrical sexual shocker and his participation in the screenplay has ensured that the intensity, confronting dialogue and angry characters remain. There are still only four speaking parts and the twelve scenes (with flashbacks) of the original have been retained. Marber has however toned down the ending, with little effect on the overall impact of the piece. It is a powerful statement on the ability of apparently civilized and cultivated persons to screw up their personal relationships via sexual adventurism.<br/><br/>When we first see him Dan the obituary writer (Jude Law), who takes the dazed Alice (Natalie Portman) under his wing, seems like a thoroughly nice guy. A year later, when he shows up at Anna's photographic studio, for a book dustcover photo, he's almost a different person, vain, overconfident and promiscuous. He plays an elaborate practical joke via an internet sex chat room (the most entertaining sequence in the film) and becomes the means whereby Anna (Julia Roberts) meets Larry (Clive Owen), the dermatologist with attitude. The subsequent tangles between the four of them involve a great deal of deceit, manipulation and emotional bullying (though all four never appear in the same scene). Larry in particular, the alpha male, is good at getting his way, though Anne suffers greatly as a result.<br/><br/>I'm not going to complain about the acting. I was pretty impressed with Clive Owen, previously seen mainly in detective-type parts. He played the Dan role in the original National Theatre stage production of 1997, and has no trouble with the more robust part of Larry in the film. Natalie Portman is practically faultless as a contradiction in terms, a naïve stripper. Actually, she turns out not to be so naïve, note the name in her passport, revealed towards the end. Julia Roberts acquits herself well in a less difficult part. Jude Law as Dan has a strange personality change part way through as mentioned but manages to make him more sympathetic towards the end.<br/><br/>People have compared this film to ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf"" and Carnal Knowledge"" both directed by Mike Nichols more than 30 years ago. The dialogue is certainly witty at times and the themes of love, sex and betrayal are certainly similar, but the characters here are even harder to like than those of George and Martha in ""Woolf"" and the Nicolson/Garfinkel characters in ""Carnal Knowledge"". There really is a problem when the audience has the shock of non-recognition, that is it says ""I could never do that. Even if I'd like to."""
"diand_","7","0","1","25 February 2005"," The photographer, the writer, his wife & her lover
","Patrick Marber's play at first hand seems to portray modern relations between four people. But there's much more to this: Larry is a doctor in order to express a pure physical (human) animal. He reacts to basic instincts and the fact that he 'wins' is perhaps a comment on our modern society. The most fascinating character is Alice (mind the name) because it's not so sure that she exists in the screen world for real or only in the imagination of the characters. The opening and ending sequences seem to support this notion. She's the subject of the writer's book, and the writer is in the movie as the one who documents relations (with her). Typical for a writer is his subjective view on events. A photographer has less ability to distort reality and therefore Alice is crying on the only picture of her that's shown at the exposition. Meanwhile, the doctor lives out his sexual fantasies on her, but the fact that he cannot touch her in vital segments of the movie is only proof of his inability to have human contact or indeed, come closer.<br/><br/>Although well structured as a play and movie I was surprised to find the writing details very uneven. Horrible, immature lines (for example, the first lines of the movie) and brilliant, mature lines are intertwined and as a result it brings the movie down as a whole.<br/><br/>As director Mike Nichols does a fine job, but some more experimenting would have seriously enhanced the value (see Dogville for example of a more experimental 'movie as a play'). Also the movie drags a little in continually toggling between the love the four characters show for each other.<br/><br/>For an actor, there's no better movie to act than in these ones, but it's also very dangerous as there's almost no hiding to cover any weaknesses. Especially Jude Law disappoints here with a terrible flat performance, Julia Roberts holds up reasonably, Clive Owen is interesting and his portrayal will certainly play very well with British audiences, and Natalie Portman shines again and is rapidly developing in one of the better actresses of our time."

","""And so it is, the shorter story, no love no glory, no hero in her sky."" Patrick Marber's highly acclaimed stage drama about interactions between two couples has been adapted to the screen, much to the credit of veteran director Mike Nichols. Dan (Law) is a London writer vainly working on a novel, but in the meantime is writing obituaries. One day he bumps into Alice, a beautiful young American expatriate. She immediately falls for him, and he in return is initially enchanted by her. But as time progresses, and after his novel is completed, her neediness grows thin. Anna (Roberts) is a photographer who is hired to take a portrait of Dan for the dust jacket of his book. Dan is attracted to her easy confidence and flirtatious advances are exchanged, but Anna backs off once she becomes aware that Alice is in the picture. Through some irresponsible and rather explicit internet chatting (at the misleading hand of Dan), Larry the perverse dermatologist (Owen) encounters Anna at an Aquarium. The two marry, and inevitably become distant and unhappy. Dan and Alice also find difficulty in their relationship after Dan engages in a year-long affair with Anna, but complication grows between them when Dan is frustrated by Anna's reluctance to leave Larry. <br/><br/>CLOSER is mesmerising, I was so transfixed that as the end credits began to roll, I felt as though I had forgotten I was watching a film. It was like an intrusion on four people's lives. These are four beautifully written characters, none of which are very likable; they're all selfish, nasty people who don't care who they hurt in order to sleep with whom they wish. I was wondering before I saw the film, which characters would be the 'bad guys' (my bets were on Alice and Larry), they're ALL bad. But they are written with such intelligence and veracity that we can't help but be utterly compelled. All the characters are as rendered as real people, with such complicated sexual needs. Anna wants what she can't have, as does Dan. Larry wants pure animal, utmost primitive and emotionless sex, borderline deviace. Alice is the most enigmatic of the ensemble, all she really wants is someone to hold, she's delicate, yet she's in her own words a ""floozy"". There's something very elusive about her. All four actors are superb. Roberts brings a very interior quality to Anna, a very un-Julia Roberts character and performance. Law brings an interesting perspective to Dan. But Portman and Owen steal the show. Portman is simply wonderful, and Owen (my favourite) is Oscar worthy. Mike Nichols has had a great two years, last year with his mini-series 'Angels in America' and now with perhaps his finest film to date. Marber's screenplay is crafted with humour, acumen and pathos. Through the entire screening I don't remember moving once, this is a smart love story, there's no clichés or happy endings. It's an unblinking and uncompromising look at relationships and sex. This is thought provoking and unforgettable. This is about sex without showing it, it's about love without meaning it, it's about relationships and above all, desire. This film still echoes in my mind. ""And so it is, the shorter story, no love no glory, no hero in her sky."" 5 STARS"
"joemystery2004","9","0","1","23 February 2005"," A Beautifully Written Film
","Mike Nichols' ""Closer,"" is at once a cross-section of relationships in western culture and a scathing revelation of the deception and underhandedness that lies at the root of these relationships. The audience was silent at the end of this film when I saw it, and rightly so. It is one of the best films of the year, put very simply.<br/><br/>The film, based on screenwriter, Patrick Marber's successful play, centers around two couples: Dan and Alice (Jude Law, Natalie Portman) and Larry and Anna (Clive Owen, Julia Roberts.) How these people come to be with one another is coincidental. How they deceive one another is despicable and how love quickly mutates into a desire to cause each other pain is tragic.<br/><br/>Through Nichols' brilliant direction, he creates the illusion that there is an entropic tragedy, where there is really just a melodramatic relationship drama. That's what's so great about this film: you are so sucked into the experiences of these four characters and you feel their pain so deeply. The dialogue scorches like acid and burns hard and deep. Particularly, the scene in which Larry (Owen) confronts his wife Anna (Roberts) about her affair with Dan (Law.) There are explicit descriptions, at Larry's request, of sexual positions, practices and even talk of bodily fluids because Larry simply has to know if she enjoyed it. ""I'm a fu**ing caveman,"" he explains.<br/><br/>Despite all the graphic sexual conversation that takes place in this film, there are no ""sex scenes"" in the traditional sense. There are no scenes where people are actually having sex, there are only scenes directly before and after the act. This is possibly to add to the theme of the mystery of sex: how it makes us do weird things and how it tears us down the middle. It is amazing to me, that in the absence of sex scenes, this movie is incredibly sexy. It's all in the script and the wonderful performances.<br/><br/>All of the actors really pull together and deliver outstanding performances. Jude Law and Julia Roberts bring subtle and poignant performances to this film. even whilst uttering laughable lines of dialogue such as ""I can see the love it draining out of you."" I was particularly impressed with Roberts, who delivers her best theatrical turn since her Oscar-winning performance in ""Erin Brockovich."" Though I don't normally enjoy her as an actress, her absence from this year's best actress nominee roster seems strange.<br/><br/>Even more impressive than Jude Law and Julia Roberts are academy award nominees Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. Clive Owen, with his large, sinister teeth and angry throaty voice make him the perfect jealous husband. Portman's performance is so multi-dimensional that I will not refer to it as ""her first adult role."" While her character is a stripper, and curses like a sailor, Portman's Alice has a tragic vulnerability reminiscent of her performance in ""Leon."" She is the most likable character in the movie and the best performance. For it is Alice and Larry who are victims in the beginning, yet they use one another to get back at their lovers. While it's deplorable, you identify with Alice's need to hurt Dan who has hurt her. It is lovely to see her get the last laugh. If there's any justice, Natalie Portman WILL win best supporting actress for this performance Closer will surely be studied in film classes as an example of film-making at its best. It is a film that rises above its humble appearance to so much more."

","Although this film is not as harrowing as ""Death of a Salesman"", ""Long Day's Journey into Night"", ""'Night, Mother"", or ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", it nevertheless deserves to be ranked alongside them or perhaps even above them, for the accuracy of its portrayal of men and women (and their motives, their emotions, and their relationships) in our current society.<br/><br/>This film does *NOT* deserve less than ten out of ten. Perhaps those who find it disgusting are reacting to the awfulness of the characters, and the situations they get themselves into, rather than to the superb quality of the acting or directing or the script.<br/><br/>Men and women do have those exact motives, emotions, communication difficulties, and ways of relating! All of the conversations between the men and women in this movie are so accurate I suspect that the author may have recorded actual private conversations and and selected the essence of those. The men talk and think just like men I know and the women talk and think just like women I know, and the difference between the sexes gives rise to the exact type of difficulties portrayed in the relationships in the film.<br/><br/>It's a fascinating story, showing men and women meeting, relating, breaking up, just as they do today in cities all over the world, and down your street, as well."
"valadas","7","0","1","19 February 2005"," What is love?
","This is old Mike Nichols at his best. The theme of love which he treated so many years ago with a dramatic approach in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" comes back now in an apparently less dramatic way. What is love indeed and what is the meaning of the words ""I love you""? Are those who pronounce them always convinced that they are speaking the truth? Can a man (or a woman) love two women (or two men) at same time? All these questions arise in this movie in a continuous succession of encounters and dis-encounters in a permanent sway between the same four people whose characters are superbly acted by the four main performers. This is how love between men and women must be faced in modern life and I can't remember now any movie where this conflicting reality is presented in such an authentic way. The most important feature of this movie is made by the dialogues between the protagonists. The sentences are short, incisive, bright and intelligent. Through them we can learn all about the characters and penetrate deeply inside their souls and discover their feelings. It's true that love and all the feelings related to it maybe the same since the Antiquity till nowadays. But modern times with all the liberties they have brought give birth to more dramatic events because it's not true that freedom of love has curbed drama down. On the contrary the more freedom the more drama mainly interior drama because freedom of decision and choice brings more responsibility and the correlative anguish. One detail: the faked cybersex scene is hilarious and reveals much of what human soul hides in its deepness even in what concerns normal human beings. I think that this movie will enrich your knowledge of the modern human behaviour in respect to love between the sexes."
"SajeevaS","8","0","1","17 February 2005"," Close enough to being one of the most twisted movies
","I have to admit that I have never seen such a twisted movie about relationships. There was 'We don't live here anymore'  however this is more twisted, that it van be passed as a thriller disguised as a love story. From the beginning to the end the movie is solely focused on 4 characters - Anna, Larry, Daniel and Alice. The twist occurs with the exchanging of partners back and forth amongst these 4 characters. Credit needs to be given to all these 4 actors. Clive Owen who plays the lustful Larry was my least favorite - I guess it was the nature of his character  a pervert who gets what he wants. Julia Roberts, gives one of her 'natural' performances again, Jude Law played the 'wimp'  if I am not mistaken for the first time, and Natalie Portman, who all credit should go to, gives the performance of her career  I guess it was time she took the time off that Star Wars crap, to give something more worthwhile. However, I do not see much 'Oscar' potential for this film. It may have been really good, but not 'Oscar' worthy, I guess it should not have aimed for the Oscars - it would have definitely been more successful if it was released widely as a holiday blockbuster."

You can think, that now Your life is good, wonderful, but You can't forget, that this moment is only a miracle. You can't forget, that You ARE ALONE, because love is temporary, not for a long, and it depends only from circumstances. You can find another meaning - You want more than one thing in one moment. You want to have all, and in same Yoy don't want to belong to other. You want that You can't get it. This movie shows us, that we want perfect life, women, love, job. But if something is missing - we cannot feel ALL joy, fun of life, we want ALL, but we can't get ALL good things in a life, and even if we have this, we will brake this joy, we will brake other man or women feelings, joy. And another paradox - when You finally feel happy, ant You can think, that You have ALL You want - something will happen, bad, very bad. Ant then You will have pain, much of it. And even if You think, that You don't like pain, You like, You enjoy it, we need the pain, that we could explain our failures, our depressions.

"hawkesjames","10","0","2","3 February 2005"," My new favourite movie!
","This film won't be for everyone. The language is strong and diverse with a strong sexual content. The characters are real and raw. The themes covered are touching and heartbreaking but honest. The combination of the screenplay and the beautiful direction of Mike Nichols bring London to life on the screen and while we only really see the four main characters, the many facets of their lives touch upon so much as to keep you hooked. The soundtrack helps the emotive qualities of the subject matter and Damian Rice's 'Can't take my eyes off of you' sums this up.<br/><br/>The performances of the four characters are pitch perfect. The neediness and faux strength of Alice (Portman), the 'I can't help it' roguish charms of Dan (Law), the vulnerability and lack of self worth of Anna (Roberts) and the strange brew of respectability and depravity of Larry (Owen). Strong direction, great acting and beautiful cinematography fill these people with the right blend of vitality and longing.<br/><br/>Don't go see this expecting an easy film. It challenges you to leave; it wants you to stay. The story, the characters draw you into their world and leave you wanting to know more, wanting to see what happens next. Stick with it and you will be rewarded with a gritty and intense yet mellow film that touches the heart and makes you think."
"rcoles","6","0","2","1 February 2005"," Did I miss something?
","And then, perhaps not. First, great cinematography, great locations. Nice to see London as London even if it was always grey.<br/><br/>The story-line? It had possibilities - ones I don't believe were fully explored or, rather, could have been explored more fully - as in the games people play.<br/><br/>The actors? A serious mismatch. Each on their own may or may not have been good. As a mix - the whole just seemed too two dimensional. The mix lacked critical depth.<br/><br/>Might be difficult transforming a successful stage play into a good film. Stage plays essentially depend on dialogue and this, in usual absence of any visual cues or props. Here one listens to the dialogue and becomes involved in all its nuances. This is where the theatre of good theatre lies, in good dialogue and its delivery.<br/><br/>In a film, one has dimension. One needs dimension and somehow, for me, Closer lacked that.<br/><br/>To appreciate the point I'm trying to make, perhaps some readers here may have seen Alan Rudolph's ""The Moderns"". Now there's a film with dimension. The Moderns is a film not too dissimilar to Closer in many ways. This film is also about relationships. But there was something there that I have rarely ever found in any other film - the subtlety of dialogue - not only of the spoken word but also in its visual delivery. I think this is what I mean by ""dimension"". Closer somehow didn't have that.<br/><br/>May be its a generational thing - The Moderns was made nearly 20 years ago. Must have made some impact if it still comes to mind now.<br/><br/>That aside, is not that I'm seeking fault with the film. Natalie Portman's performance was sterling. Julia Roberts was Julia Roberts as was Jude Law. Clive Owen was effective.<br/><br/>Oh - where this film did lose some credibility for me was where Anna used a Leica (35 mm camera) to take the crying picture of Alice and, in the exhibition, the picture was printed up in a square format with its ragged neg holder borders and all. Wouldn't say this was typical for a ""real photography"" if the intention was to print full neg - what more can I say?"

The movie did not offend me in any way but, like it did with some people, but it didn't attract me either. The movie consists of some fragments of a sad love story, but the viewer is very distanced from these events.<br/><br/>I think the high ranking is mostly based on the good acting and the 'arty-cultural'overvalue that these kind of movies seem to get.

If you are one of them who says that this movie is very good, ask yourself if you really liked it or think you should like it! 5/10"
"ttranyh","10","0","2","30 January 2005"," Most people cannot handle truths
","It is a very interesting and riveting film The story is about love, hatred, betrayal, truth, sex, infidelity etc. I think we can learn a few things from this film:<br/><br/>(1)Very few people in this world have the luxury of finding and getting true love. So, if you marry or live with somebody you do not truly love or somebody you think you love, and one day, you fall in love at first sight with another person, whom you think is your true love, you will very likely betray your original partner. That is one of the many reasons people having affairs.<br/><br/>(2)True love is not only about give and take, romance and passion but also about forgiving and understanding and the ability to accept that fact that we humans make mistakes. So if your partner betrays you and has a sexual affair with another person, can you forgive him/her completely? Unfortunately almost all people cannot, and most people want to know the truth but cannot accept the truth and once the truth is known, the relationship,even if the couple can get back together, is never the same again (just look at the last scene when Julia ROBERTS lies on the bed and I am sure she is not happy with her rekindled marriage)<br/><br/>(3)If you have the courage to betray your partner, do not feel guilty and it is best to keep it discreet and secret. If you feel guilty, please do not commit adultery. If you tell your original partner about the infidelity, then your relationship will never be the same again, even if you get back together"

Mike Nichols carefully makes sure all the performances intersect in just the right synchronization like his directorial debut in 1966 with 'Who's Afraid of VirginiaWoolf?'.

","Closer is one of the only movies I've ever seen that can't be trivialized by any standardization or gist. The depth of the characters is so intense and vivid that it takes over any ostensible plot. It's not so much one should really care about who ends up with whom, but rather the focus is on the extreme emotional vacillations of any form of intimacy. I think the intricacies and subtleties of life in any meaningful relationship, whether dysfunctional or not, poses not only so many questions psychologically, but artistically as well. One of the most lasting impressions thus far is the movie's portrayal of love as an outpouring of almost every other emotion fathomable which coexists with any given emotional extreme. Thus, this movie becomes beautiful as it is swollen."

","For people who are enthusiastic about CLOSER, may I recommend a listen to Mozart's opera Cosi Fan Tutti. It's no accident that this is the music in the background for much of the film, including a very clever use of the videotape (tv for opera latecomers) in the bar of the opera house thus employing a very economic means of filming attendance at a performance.<br/><br/>Anyway, Mozart's opera is all about fidelity and mistaken identities. The two male leads, ""sent off"" to war return in disguise and begin to court each other's girlfriends as a way to test their faithfulness. The opera is hilarious but consistently underscores the fickleness of love. The different ""identites"" in film are a direct play on this. Janes assumption of the name Alice and the two guys engaging in Cybersex are the most obvious examples. The palpable confusion each of them experience is much more difficult and gives the film its depth.<br/><br/>I found the conceit genuinely interlink and all of the performances superb."

Human flaws and inner desperation are drawn out to extreme by Mr. Nichols, for dramatic effect and to give the viewer a clear image of some of the darker sides of human nature: from the vulnerable Daniel who is cannot stand to be alone but unable to allow someone to need him; to the bowing Anna who has dark inner desires to be possessed and abused by her lovers; to Larry who sees women as objects and sees his partners as whores as opposed to lovers.<br/><br/>Enjoyable movie.

"vivesi-1","8","0","2","2 January 2005"," Rampantly joyless, often intelligent
","I am not surprised to read that CLOSER is also play since I left the theater thinking that this doesn't seem like a story to be filmed. There is precious little to work with here cinematic ally but Nichols likes his bleakness, cold lighting, dull colors and he is right at home with those techniques in this movie. These are four joyless characters, and the filming reflects this--there is nothing sensual about the movie--no colors, no soft textures, no food, no wine, nothing that reminds us of the link between sensuality and love. And that's an important missing ingredient since love is paraded around as the the subject of all of their conversations. CLOSER is love minus the joy of feeling, which is to say, the opposite of love. Lack of sensuality is what makes pornography and CLOSER isn't far from that kind of portrayal.<br/><br/>These characters are one dimensional and they strike the same note too often, but let's toss aside realism and viewed from a metaphorical perspective of power masked as love, the movie succeeds. At one point a character says ""this is not a war"" but of course it is. What else could you call deliberate cruelty in order to gain power over another? The women and men vie for power and the men are also at war with each other. I recognized male sexuality as territoriality easily in the film but the female sexuality was harder to pin down (ah, no pun intended). The female roles in this movie are something I've never quite seen before, as equally brutal about sexuality and power as are the men. There is no effort in this movie to walk the fine line between Madonna and whore--which is, of course, closer to the truth. I think the movie misses the mark, however, in that there is almost no exploration into the women's feelings about each other. There is an implicit sexism in this movie in that men can sustain many conflicts whereas women can only handle one gender at a time. We all know this isn't true and the movie suffers a little from this lack of recognition. As anyone knows, relationships between women after the same men are complicated, highly charged and very interesting. The one scene between the women merely serves to set up another scene between a couple. What a HUGE letdown. Kundera didn't do that to us in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING, by the way. Note how that scene in Kundera's book and in the movie adds an entire layer to the story that CLOSER lacks altogether. It doesn't have to be kindness that these women find, of course, but they would have feelings about one another equally as interesting as those with which the men grapple. That was the missed opportunity to strike another note, in my opinion.<br/><br/>There is talk of children between the couples but this sounds as depthless as the conversations about love. They know what they're supposed to say and do only they have no idea how to reconcile the fact that they don't want to say or do those things. Society, although open to new roles for women (by economic necessity in my opinion), is still a restrictive force. Celibacy means failure; multiple partners means failure. One is supposed to exist only in the ""happy couples"" format once one reaches a certain age. This is also one of those movies where no one has any parents or friends, heightening the importance of their romances and their dalliances.<br/><br/>This movie got one thing right, though--the old adage is b.s. on screen--the closest way to a man's heart is not through his stomach. Just ask Godard and Fellini."

Many people say ""no one is like any one of the four main characters"". True, it seems that no one is THAT far gone but what they do not realize is that these four are you and I. The people in this movie are gong through what many of us go through, we just do not realize it. The film also features performances that are worthy of Oscar recognition and the directing is wonderful. This , if you see no others, is the must see of the year. I would ,however, advise you to leave the kids at home, seeing as this film has a large amount of sexual discussions."

","if you're into movies that concentrate on the intricacies of infidelity, guilt manipulation, human fealty, disrespect for and lack of commitment in a marriage...then this film is for you. I found the whole theme very negative and disturbing, promoting infidelity and lack of respect and commitment in marriages..just what we need to view more of in our current era and generation of high divorce rates and adultery. Just about everyone reaction around me was negative upon the movies conclusion..one woman commenting that the only good thing about the whole film was the soundtrack. The acting overall was pretty good and as bizarre as the story plot was...each of the four were very believable in how they would describe their emotions. However, if I had known ahead of time that the entire content of this story revolved around cheating and guilt manipulation...I would have passed. You certainly won't leave the theatre uplifted. many I'm sure, leave filling a lot of guilt of their own..which maybe was the intent of it all."

","If you have a ball sack, do not go and see this movie. I'm sorry, but there is just way too much emotional dialogue for me. This movie is a great chick flick. I can really see how women would love this movie. My girlfriend however didn't like it. (She does not have a ball sack however, she's just not ultra emotional). I'll give it a 5. Not because the movie sucked, but because it did not fit my perspective. I do wish that I stayed to watch the ending because the movie has seemed to send waves through a lot of people's thoughts... But however it ended, what will always remain true is that women will always spread their legs for guys that are unattainable jerks, and the nice guys will be pushed into the rest of the herd of nice guys and not get laid. I've run out of things to say about the movie and there is a minimum amount of lines I'm required to type.. hence the last couple of sentences.... thank you.."

","Finally. A movie with a huge dosage of truth. I saw this movie last night and loved it. Throughout the movie, i grimaced and was forced to close my ears as the screen poured out bucketful of real words. the performances by each of the four stars is phenomenal. The movie really starts out slowly and keeps you wondering what it intends to end up as. As things get complicated and hearts are broken you realize how close to real life the movie revolves. the script is shocking in its simplicity and the use of lewidity. If you ever have been betrayed in the matters of the heart then i guarantee you will love this movie. Not a romantic, not a comedy but an all out drama that you must watch with patience and acceptance. Please do not miss!"

","I have voted to give this movie a six, not for the story, but for the acting by the star studded cast. Jude Law (the everywhere mane) is very good, as well as the rest of the cast which consists of Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. With a cast like this how can you go wrong, well it did as far as I am concerned. I am no prude, but the dialog in this movie was excessive, and about 2/3 through the picture I had enough and got up and walked out. I can see the point of mixed relationships, and how a story can develop from it, but the sexual theme got out of hand. As far as I am concerned this one is a video store selection and should be for you too."

","This movie has generated a great deal of arguing, bitching, and whining about this movie, and that's really too bad. Here's the simple truth (or at least my closest approximation of such): If your favorite movies like Van Helsing, Armageddon, or anything by Jerry Bruckheimer, chances are that you won't like Closer. You will likely enjoy Closer if:<br/><br/>1 you are able to honestly say that you enjoy going to plays, as this movie was adapted from a play, and it shows. 2 your prefer Decalogue-heavy movies 3 you want to see Natalie Portman's buttocks 4 you can tolerate a slightly higher than typical amount of ""dirty talk"" in a movie, as well as a few scenes that are more risquÃ© than artistic (though they were probably trying {without success}to be artistic, or at least clever) 5 you are not expecting a typical Julia Roberts role, or a ""happy"" movie of any sort. 6 you are able to enjoy a story of people with moral and mental health defects and their attempts to get what they want at the expense of others.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is clearly not for everyone. My wife and I quite enjoyed it, though early on we had our doubts. The movie builds a momentum with several plot twists and time lapses that require some effort to follow, but we like that sort of thing. <br/><br/>Roughly half of the 30-or-so person audience walked out during the first 45 minutes of the movie. We're both glad that we stayed."

","""Closer"" is great movie in the same sort of way that ""Requiem For a Dream"" is a great movie. You don't necessarily like it, and you don't approve of the lifestyles of its characters, but it is still a superior piece of work. I personally do not think that being in agreement with a film's characters is a requisite to understanding a film. However, the characters of ""Closer"" are distinctly human and therefore we understand the basic concepts of lust, greed, etc. that they feel. Although they are hurtful and often terrible people, they are still human beings and we can feel that humanity and understand it. ""You women don't understand the territory, because you are the territory"" is a statement that basically sums up the mentality of the leading men in the film. Both Dan (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen) are men that are fueled by their sexuality and guided by their attempts to romance women into having sex with them. The two women affected by this brutal game are Alice, played by Natalie Portman, and Anna, played by Julia Roberts. Both of these women fall into their separate traps, but do not think for a minute that they are innocent. The women of ""Closer"" play just as hard as the men do by lying and cheating their way into the hearts of the men. The performances by all of the actors are excellent and so is the direction by Mike Nichols who also directed ""The Graduate""."

","This is clearly the kind of film that will divide people. If you believe in romance, and at all expenses are afraid to let go of this ideal: you will hate this film. If, however, you would like a film that makes you think and realise the infinity of complications love can bring you will be heavily rewarded. The brilliance of the direction is in the way no one character stands out as central, each illuminates the other.<br/><br/>This an actual film that stands up to European cinema and puts to shame the influx of formulaic cinema so rife in Hollywood. To highlight this, the way four separate characters stand apart, with no character as central is masterful and refreshing. As Robert's character says to Portman 'You have a great face,' Portman responds 'Doesn't everyone?' This film has enough depth that it will always remain watchable. It runs on themes so infinitely relevant, that Shakespeare would have praised the writing. And with Shakespeare the quotable lines are as dense as the film. Amazing"

So many flavors of betrayal, morality, and infidelity are childishly entangled with ""love"" that you'd swear you're watching a bad soap opera written by someone with the emotional intelligence of a 12-year old.<br/><br/>Here's a quick synopsis: I love you, so I hurt you to show you I love you....I hate that you hurt me, so I don't love you anymore.....I love someone else, so I must leave you....that hurt me, so I'll get my revenge on you and your new/ex lover....we're all really shallow fickle emotionless robots.....<br/><br/>Every character sounds like they're written by the same person....that's just plain amateur.

"johnl1957","3","0","1","19 December 2004"," There is only one reason to see this movie Natalie Portman
","From the previews I was not expecting this movie. This was one of the most disappointing movie experiences I have had in a long time. From the beginning of the movie you wonder where it is going and at the end you wonder where you just went. Nobody, and I mean nobody in this movie is likable and by the end you don't care about anyone in the movie. The movie is not really about people, it's about sex. It is even more about talking about sex, in ways that are boring, and how people can mess up relationships in a lot of different ways. These are also some of the dumbest people I have seen on screen in a long time. Nobody seems to have the ability to learn from past experiences.<br/><br/>All that aside, it is nice to see Natalie Portman finally get a role that shows she can act. I was afraid she was going to be thought of as the Queen in the latest Star War movies. She must have taken those movies for the paycheck. Awful!!! Here she shows the potential she showed in Beautiful Girls. She stole that movie, and she was only 15. She should have a great future.<br/><br/>I would not waste your money on this movie. Wait until it is in the $.99 aisle in the rental section if you have to see it. Based on the reaction of the people I heard talking outside the theater, it will be in the rental stores soon enough.<br/><br/>One last comment, if you were one of the people who actually liked this movie, you should look for Your Friends & Neighbors starring Amy Brenneman. It was a very similar movie."

","The actors do not pull me in or make their roles believable. Portman obviously has never been inside of a strip club. Julia, absolutely boring to watch throughout this entire film. She lacks depth, and passion, while Portman gives true effort to make Alice come alive, but misses the mark during the club scenes. She can bat her eyes really well though. The verbal exchange of lude commentary made me laugh here and there. The scenes in which one or the other is telling their partner that they have cheated, and the reactions were absolutely off base from what would happen in the real world. Having been in that situation, the short cutting remarks were strange and humorous. ""I don't love you, goodbye."" ""You look like the cat that just got the cream..."" Okie dokie! While most in their reviews of this film sound horrified, stating their jaw was hanging open through the movie, I sat there wondering why? The film attempted to shock me and push the envelope and failed miserably. Four people admitting to screwing around. If you are into watching 100 minutes of nothing but verbal confrontations and confessions of adultery, without any actual sex scenes, then go for it!"

","Like most films I've seen that upset or disgust me greatly, I am going to buy the Patrick Marber play, ""Closer,"" to see just how close Mike Nichols & Marber got. What I'm really hoping to see in the play is more about the humanity underlying these sexual neanderthals. The word ""love"" is used in the film. LOVE is non-existent in it. These 4 people play sexual ring-a-round-a rosy with each other and think the word ""commitment"" is spelled the old anglo-saxon ""f"" way.<br/><br/>And maybe ""f"" is what they are basically committed to. <br/><br/>There's some line about ""truth"" in the movie (in my head I kept hearing Jack Nicholson say, ""You can't handle the truth"") and this is a movie in which there is little if any truth among the sexual predators. The only ""truth"" comes as a semi-surprise at the end of the movie. I don't want to be a spoiler so you'll have to sit through the whole, nauseating mess to find what seemed to me to be the only ""truth"" in this ugly, sometimes funny - although not meaning to be, exercise in pathetically unfulfilling lust.

","As a huge fan of Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Natalie Portman, I was very excited to see Closer. Now I would like my money back. I'll be honest I generally prefer happy, feel good movies but I will make exceptions for movies that teach you something, or touch you enough to make you cry or think about them.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie was the development of the characters and relationships. I get the whole love at first sight thing I do. But one minute Jude Law falls in love with Natalie Portman. They begin what seems to be the perfect relationship. I mean the man is so enamored with this girl that he writes an entire book about her life. But only a few minutes later (minutes for the audience, months for the character) Jude Law falls for Julia Roberts. There is no reason for this. Yes Julia Roberts is beautiful but so is Natalie Portman. And Natalie Portman's character had wit and personality from the second that we all laid eyes on her. Roberts character was just blah in my opinion. All that is really shown of this womans life and personality is that she is a photographer who has a problem with monogomy. One minute she is taking Jude Law's picture and all of a sudden is obsessed and willing to drop Portman who he supposedly loves and built a life with? <br/><br/>Roberts loves Law too but its also unclear when or why this happened. I mean granted most girls would fall in love at first sight with Jude Law but his character was not charming at all. I thought he was pathetic.<br/><br/>If you are willing to buy that Roberts and Law's characters fell in love at first picture then you might find yourself asking why then did Roberts character marry Clive Owens? I mean if she was going to destroy Law's relationship with Portman anyway was it necessary to to destroy another man's life as well?<br/><br/>I get it these characters are cold blah blah but aren't they still human? And Portman's character, the only character in my opinion who showed any humanity was able to revert back from being a heartbroken, vulnerable girl who needed Law, to a self sufficient stripper without a care in the world.<br/><br/>Having completely bashed the movie I will say that I think every actor gave a good performance. People keep saying this movie is true to real life relationships and yes in the real world people get hurt and it doesn't usually end happily ever after. But I would like to believe that people have more regard for the feelings of people that they claim to love. That Roberts would have fought harder for Law. <br/><br/>The movie ended with me asking what the ??? but the thing was that I didn't even really care."

","I just saw this absolutely atrocious film, and it was -- quite honestly -- the worst movie I have EVER paid to see. And I own ""Russian Ark,"" a foreign film shot throughout the Russian Hermitage discussing Russian history and culture! This is not about tastes or styles; I am not some action-junkie bored by a ""deep"" movie. The fact of the matter is that ""Closer"" suffers from a lack of characterization and -- more importantly -- intimacy.<br/><br/>All of the characters are horribly unsympathetic, and worse -- unbelievable. What ""Closer"" does is bandy about a lot of useless exposition and little in the way of storytelling. Simply put, this film does not show, it says. We don't see any attraction between any of these characters -- the audience is simply told, ad infinitum, about love, lust, romance, and intimacy.<br/><br/>What then, can the movie possibly showcase? Drama. Endless, insufferable drama. And not poignant or beautiful drama -- but the worst kind imaginable. The drama you'd see in a reality TV show. The drama you'd see at a gay bar. The drama that most sane people will consciously try to avoid.<br/><br/>So we see mad fits of jealousy. Jealousy about -- gasp! -- sexual crossovers. Jude Law reprises his ""Alfie"" role to bring yet another unsympathetic user. Julia Roberts' motives make absolutely no sense. Clive Owen is really absent from any true character: he personifies a male-sexuality archetype. And Natalie Portman -- who is the source of ALL the film's decently acted scenes -- ultimately makes no sense.<br/><br/>In fact, her character said it best (and I paraphrase): ""It's a lot of depressed people, made to look beautiful, so that it's all okay to the rest of us.""<br/><br/>Yeah. That's ""Closer"" for you. A lot of depressed people -- filmed quite beautifully -- masking itself as casual, beautiful ""art."" How freaking ironic.<br/><br/>And beware -- you're treated to the most ludicrous cyber-sex scene in the world, as well as Julia Roberts talking about every scrap and tittle about her sexual life with Jude Law. Talking openly about sex is not ""real"" nor ""honest"" -- Howard Stern's been doing it for years, and he had to move to a satellite network to receive air time.<br/><br/>Again: insufferable."

The fact that 90% of the second act takes place AFTER the fact, with sometimes years skipping in between scenes, left me wanting to know what happened in between those moments--maybe then, Law's Dan would come off as more than an effeminate Romeo...<br/><br/>The only one who comes close to giving any semblance of authenticity to a character's desire in a scene is Owen, and even then it's hard to not be put off by his incessant yelling (an attempt to manifest his insecurities, I guess, that opposes Law's whining)... <br/><br/>Portman is willing and daring as the youngest of this bunch to be welcomed into their morally perverse world, and I question her youth as a possibility for her being able to exit the rut.
