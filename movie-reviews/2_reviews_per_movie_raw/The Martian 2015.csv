"bob the moo","Null","26","31","2 July 2016"," Entertaining and slick enough to make you go with it
","I heard a lot about this film regarding its scientific validity as a piece of fiction. Perhaps as a result of this I assumed that the film would be a dry affair – an impression sort of confirmed by the longer than normal running time. As it happens, this is not the case at all because The Martian has much more in common with the entertaining blockbuster that the starry cast list and presentation suggest it will be. The story wears its science very much on its sleeve, but yet makes it accessible and fun – with the slick presentation making it so. As a result everything seems to be explained with everyday objects, and even the most complex principles are presented in simple terms (references to Iron Man for instance). As a result the film gets to have its cake and eat it – although the film is helped by the knowledge of a lot of this being possible (eg hitting a point near Pluto recently with very tight tolerances on a journey of years).<br/><br/>The film itself doesn't really play up the drama in a heavy way, but rather does enough to invest the viewer in it without making it too much of a downer or serious. The soundtrack is hugely upbeat, the content is mostly light in tone, and the science is delivered in a very user-friendly fashion – essentially in the service of the tone and the entertainment value, nothing more than this. The starry cast add to this feeling, and use their screen presence well. Damon is consistently likable, which is just as well since he is alone in the vast majority of his scenes. The ensemble cast has a lot of depth to it, all of which are solidly watchable – Chastain, Wiig, Daniels, Eiofor, Peña, Bean, and so on. The Chinese aspects of the plot serves as another reminder that this film is a blockbuster out to make money, but it doesn't seem too out of place. Technically it looks great and it impressive how convincing the surface of Mars looks.<br/><br/>In the end we get to the fist-pumping mission control scenes that we all knew were coming, but along the way the film is slickly packaged and entertaining as a result; even if the oft-mentioned scientific validity of it all is not something it ever seems concerned with itself."

","Seeing that the movie was over 2 hrs long, and knowing that the person was going to be stuck on the planet by their self for the majority, I didn't have high hopes for it. Usually these types of movies are boring. Not a lot of writers can pull this off. This movie was really good tho. A group of us watched it and really enjoyed. There were some things they failed to explain, that we collectively came up with our own answer for. Other than that, it was great. I never felt bored or left waiting for more. Overall, I feel it was very well written, produced and acted. Well worth the watching. Some people on here have griped that it was 'predictable', but then, most movies are. Who ever watched Star Wars with the thought that Vader would ultimately win??? Who ever watched Star Trek thinking that Kirk wouldn't find a way to save the day? And frankly, who grew up watching Scooby Doo thinking that someone would actually kill Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne or Velma???"
"hjpog","9","59","84","14 December 2015"," The best of 2015...
","The film is the finest examples of science fiction and science fiction embodies everything required. Matt Damon has given the right role until the end of the case. Besides the fact that one does not really need. All movies have moved on their own. We have seen examples of this, such as the Buried and 127 Hours of very good quality movies. The master Ridley Scott's science fiction after a long separation has made a great comeback with this film case. After this film, Ridley Scott disappointing those who say the sound was cut. Thank you for this wonderful film Ridley masters. Maybe the best in 2015, as I mentioned in the title."
"Siebert_Tenseven","10","173","265","22 December 2015"," I Am The Only One Who Was Not Disappointed
","Having read the book, and being very impressed, I was looking forward to the movie interpretation. I was not the least bit disappointed. I was hoping this movie would not be an overacted, overproduced and sappy version of the original, and I was pleasantly surprised that the story played out without the overblown extraneous embellishment that Hollywood seems to depend on so often.<br/><br/>It was great to see how the screenplay added extra material that was not in the book, and it enhanced the story to make it even better. The characters were interpreted with full respect to the intention of the author, Andy Weir, and nothing was overdone. The pacing and editing of this movie was some of the best I've seen, in fact, some of the one-liners from the book are done so quickly it pushed the story forward relentlessly. <br/><br/>One thing that struck me is that everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I think that could be a testament to the originality and uniqueness of the book. I believe anyone who reads the book is captivated and involved with the story from beginning to end, and it's possible this comes across in all phases of the production; the acting, the sets, sound, everything. They all knew they had some great material to work with and ran with it."

","The crew of an American base on Mars are forced to make an emergency departure leaving one crew-member behind presumed dead. But he is alive! Can the stranded astronaut find a way of communicating his plight to those on Earth and survive while he awaits rescue? <br/><br/>A fairly standard 'castaway' plot but one which offers many dramatic possibilities. Unfortunately few of these are realised in this pedestrian movie which fails to generate any significant dramatic tension. This is partly because the characterisation is thin but also because the challenges the stranded astronaut faces seem to be so easily overcome. Starvation? Grow potatoes. Punctured space-helmet? Sticky tape. Mars rover vehicle lacking power? Wire up a few solar cells. Communications equipment destroyed? Motor over to a handy Mars lander. We never sense that the 'Martian' (Matt Damon) is in a desperate, mind- and body-sapping struggle against the odds (conveniently he is a botanist).<br/><br/>Damon effectively portrays the 'Martian' as a likable guy but the problem is how to fill the two hours of the movie that remain after he is stranded? When a character is alone and unable to communicate it needs something exceptional to keep us glued to the screen. Maybe what's going on back home will do it. Not really because the cast of characters there are verging on cardboard cut-outs. The returning crew? Likewise. And the script is written on the assumption that the audience is a little dumb, e.g. A: It will be 500 Sols (Martian days) before we can rescue him. B: But his food will run out in 300 sols. C: So he'll die before we get there. Indeed! And so may we. <br/><br/>The movie has some good FX and the Martian landscape looks convincing. But there's nothing exceptional here to compensate for the lack of an effectively told story.<br/><br/>In essence this is an American feel-good fantasy film, celebrating ideals of technical omnipotence, racial harmony, gender equality and international collaboration (with those cool Chinese guys and gals). If only it were so. No wonder the credits rolled to the tune of The O' Jays singing 'Love Train'. School-kids will probably join in! But, to quote Sam Goldwyn, 'Include me out!'<br/><br/>(Viewed at the Odeon, Warrington, 06 October 2015)"
"slingeraap","6","795","1316","8 October 2015"," Expected more
","I am a bit of nerd of this kind of realistic science fiction movies and therefore I had high expectations of this movie. I regret to say I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of how the main character struggles to survive on Mars and how the space agencies work to get them back. But I was missing the emotions, the human touch. The main character never displays any signs of loneliness, despair or fear. He is more like ""oh, looks like I'm stuck on Mars, let's grow potatoes"". He makes a one- off reference to his parents in an electronic communication, but nowhere in the movie is it made clear what his main drive is to want to return to Earth. It appears as nothing ties him there. Maybe the directors wanted to avoid the cliché of the eight months pregnant and terminally ill wife eagerly awaiting her husband's return from a dangerous mission, but even a cliché had been better than nothing. His character is also too flat. The only character trait that is highlighted slightly in the movie is that he may be a bit too smug about himself. Nothing else to make me identify or sympathize with him. To be honest, I couldn't have cared less if he had not survived.<br/><br/>The Mars landscape is beautifully rendered en very credible with dust clouds and all. This is the main attraction of the movie.<br/><br/>The main problem that there is nothing novel about this movie. There have been better movies for every aspect of the film:<br/><br/>Human aspect/psychology of being marooned in a strange place: Cast Away did it so much better; set in space: Matt Damon's role in Interstellar was more credible than his performance here. Space action scenes: Gravity had me on the edge of my seat Ground control scenes: Apollo 13 already set the standard<br/><br/>In summary, the movie is a beautiful, but hollow shell."
"Rose-Warren","10","58","87","5 March 2016"," My favourite movie of the last decade
","I am genuinely amazed at the number of bad reviews there are on here for The Martian. Now I never read the book, but I absolutely LOVED the film. So much so, I watched it twice within a week. It has been such a long time since I have been left with that wonderful sense of satisfaction after investing two hours in a really good movie, and this did it 100%<br/><br/>I am usually left highly disappointed after watching this genre of film, so I wasn't expecting much. Something like Gravity I thought, great special affects, dramatic scenes, and an average storyline, but The Martian was a whole different calibre of film and was perfectly constructed from start to finish. <br/><br/>I was instantly thrown in to a scene where astronaut Mark Watney and his crew are setting about their mission on Mars. But the sh*t hits the fan about ten minutes in where a storm causes Watney to be thrown from the crew and left for dead. There was no long lingering introduction to the film and its characters, just instant drama and character development. This forcibly got me caring for the entire crew, and got me emotionally invested until the end.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has always been good at what he does, but I felt he hadn't really shown off his true raw talent since Good Will Hunting back in 1997. Well he did in this. He was captivating in every single scene, and managed to do what Tom Hanks achieved in Cast Away and single handedly gripped the viewers' attention completely (with the help of a beautifully crafted script). Another reviewer got it bang on when they described it as Apollo 13 meets Castaway. The exact comparison I too had made and a combination, which works superbly. <br/><br/>The makers of this film put so much effort in to making it scientifically accurate which made it all the more pleasurable to watch. There was nothing far-fetched or stupid like in a lot of films of the same genre, and the combination of this, with a solid plot made for a truly interesting, exciting and enjoyable film.<br/><br/>There was drama, great effects, humour, heartwarming moments, a great soundtrack and a flawless screenplay. If you only see one movie this year, make it this one. An absolute must see."

","I read some of the reviews and decided to review this title myself. That's because I'd like you not to miss this lovely movie.<br/><br/>It got some very bad criticism (Reviews&Ratings first page hosts at least 4 reviewers rating this title '1', lowest possible value on IMDb), most of which deals with Physics laws bended to screenwriter's desire. <br/><br/>Well I just want to reassure you that even though I am among the nerdiest guys on the Internet, I didn't get annoyed from what I saw. Not once. And if you weren't annoyed by Tom Hanks and his boys killing almost an entire German Division before giving up in 'Save Private Ryan' you won't be annoyed too.<br/><br/>It's a movie, not a documentary.

","I can't really believe that I just finished watching a Ridley Scott science fiction movie and feeling this low, this one never felt like anywhere close to any of his classics. This is just nothing but a typical Hollywood s***. Matt did a poor performance as a character who is caught in a life and death situation. He is not scared or emotional but instead he keeps throwing Hollywood typical punch dialogues on your face like an Avenger hero when you are expecting Science. A make-up artist or a sound engineer from the set of ""Big bang theory"" would have written better science script and dialogues. For me there are plenty of ""WTF"" or ""Seriously?"" moments in this movie and I wonder what happened to one of the favorite directors of all time. Also repetitive high five/triumph scenes where we don't feel anything. To brief: Drag, bad drama, insensitive emotional scenes, poor acting, very less science, predictable and not at all funny punch dialogues! Just YIFY it, don't buy!"
"animalover-1","6","245","416","8 October 2015"," Were my expectations too high?
","I wish I liked this movie more like a lot of moviegoers who are giving it good to even great reviews, but I left the theater with a bitter taste in my mouth I had to write this review to reconcile my feelings.<br/><br/>Imagine a movie that takes from the glory of Gravity, Cast Away and Apollo 13 which also tries to be as hilarious and groovy as Guardians of The Galaxy at times but fails? You've got The Martian. The first 1/3 of the movie was quite engaging: An astronaut on Mars expedition team gets left behind after a huge storm because he was assumed dead. But he was alive and we watch him try and utilize every cell of his brains and science savvy to survive until help comes. But once he gets out of initial danger things get all too predictable and over-wrought. Couple of annoyances: 141 mins. About 30 mins too long for the storyline. There were too many mentions of Disco music the commander of the mission left behind to ill effect, unconvincing supporting characters on the Earth who seem to be just reciting a script, and some characters the movie shouldn't have had whatsoever (such as Kristen Wiig). <br/><br/>Did Matt Damon do a good job ? I thought so until they showed a body double that didn't even resemble him and from there nothing he did was believable unfortunately. Had Damon actually lost weight without using a body double, I might have gotten more into the movie. But then again, he is no Christian Bale. So I wasn't expecting it but a little weight loss would have made him more convincing. <br/><br/>A few good acting jobs came from Michael Pena and Benedict Wong whose characters added to the storytelling instead of subtracting it in the midst of too many unnecessary characters reciting an already weak script."
"sportsfan08","10","46","71","2 February 2016"," Smart, funny, eventful, and well performed
","The Martian, based on the novel of the same name written by author Andy Weir, is an eventful movie that serves both as an epic sci-fi adventure, but also provides viewers with some smart laughs. Those are who not that interested in sci-fi will probably end up liking the movie, because it is not unrealistic. Acting wise, Matt Damon puts in an excellent performance as the lead, and supporting actors such as Jessica Chastain, also put in solid performances. Probably one of the best aspects of the film, is that the mood of the movie is quite optimistic, considering that the situation of being stuck on mars, is quite a scary one, that requires a lot of panic. In Conclusion, The martian is a fun, smart movie, that is likely to be enjoyed by most audiences who watch it."

The team quickly assemble and flee, unfortunately Mark Watney is caught in the storm, loses his communication device and presumed dead. Watney has survived and has a harsh realism that he's abandoned on Mars with precious little supplies, no company and little chance of survival. Being 50 million miles away and 4 years away in terms of rescue life seems bleak. Watney has to defy the odds in order to survive.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott is responsible for so many wonderful films, and for many The Martian will sit among them.<br/><br/>This is a beautifully made film, it looks incredible, I love the realisation of Mars's surface, truly brilliant, wasn't going to be otherwise with the budget they had. The music is interesting, the score itself is quite subtle, but the tunes from Abba, Gloria Estefan etc are so random.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film is very cleverly done, never does it feel rushed, and on very few occasions does it feel slow or padded. If i'm honest at twenty minutes I was questioning how the film was possibly going to last over two hours.<br/><br/>Matt Damon shows his class, he carries the film on his shoulders, he gives a stellar performance as Mark, cannot be faulted. Some of the others in the film were a little hit and miss, I enjoyed Chiwetel Ejiofor very much. Jeff Daniels was fairly good. Kristen Wiig seemed an odd choice, but she was good too.<br/><br/>It was better then I expected, I enjoyed it a lot 8/10"
"MrDHWong","9","155","267","15 October 2015"," A welcome return to form for Ridley Scott.
","The Martian is a science fiction film starring Matt Damon and directed by Ridley Scott. I'm a big fan of Ridley Scott's work as a director, but I feel that most of his recent films have been very hit and miss. However, The Martian serves as a firm reminder as to why I am a fan of him in the first place. Not since Interstellar have I seen a sci-fi movie this thought-provoking or cleverly written.<br/><br/>After an intense sandstorm devastates a manned mission to Mars, the crew are forced to abandon the desolate planet and astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead and left stranded. Unbeknownst to the crew, Watney survived, albeit injured from the storm, and tries to find ways to survive the inhospitable climate of the red planet. Being a botanist, Watney figures out how to grow food for himself out of the crew's leftover vegetable supplies and uses his scientific knowledge to create water using hydrogen crystals and oxygen from the crew's base camp. However, these supplies can only sustain him for a matter of months as a rescue mission from Earth will take 4 years to reach him. Watney must find a way to signal back to Earth that he is alive and is in urgent need of rescuing before he runs out of food and water.<br/><br/>Despite its somewhat bleak tone of survival in a hostile terrain, the film still manages to have its fair share of funny and heartwarming moments, which are seamlessly intertwined into the film's more dramatic scenes. Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the wisecracking, yet intelligent astronaut Mark Watney and his positive attitude toward his survival is what keeps us invested in the story. The rest of the cast are great too, which includes Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Jessica Chastain, and even Donald Glover from Community. I was also particularly pleased with the film's pacing, there was never a moment that felt rushed or slow and boring. This is a welcome return to form for the legendary director Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10."
"CalRhys","Null","252","449","7 October 2015"," Thrilling Sci-Fi Survival Adaptation
","In an era where science-fiction survival tales are becoming a popular occurrence - with 'Interstellar' last year, and 'Gravity' the year before - writer Andy Weir and sci-fi connoisseur Ridley Scott team up to craft a complex tale that is carried by a single character, that character being Mark Watney, played fantastically by Matt Damon (Hollywood's biggest calamity, who requires being rescued... again).<br/><br/>As the film tees off, we are instantly given a first-person view of the dangers of Mars and the fight for survival each astronaut is living out each day on the planet's surface, that is until their emergency evacuation - but nope, even Damon couldn't do that right. Abandoned upon the desolate surface of Mars after being presumed dead by his crew, Damon must do all he can to endure the martian environment. One huge thing I admire about this film's plot, is that it doesn't care about the intellectual level of its audience, as the quote above states so well: it'll science the s**t out of them. It's such a complex and well-executed premise that on paper seems nothing more than a impossible feat to pull off.<br/><br/>Technically this film is stunning, the cinematography, the CGI, the production design, all utterly gorgeous, and according to the Golden Globes, it's one of the best comedies of recent years too... yeah, sure. Admittedly the tongue-in-cheek humour does add a more fresh appeal to the film, making it a little more unique than previous sci-fi adventures, it piles on layers of thrills, emotional value and complex character development to create one of the finest science fiction films of recent years."
"utgard14","8","94","159","4 January 2016"," Smart, exciting crowd-pleaser
","Exceptional sci-fi drama from Ridley Scott about an astronaut (Matt Damon) stranded on Mars and the efforts made to rescue him. As others have pointed out, there's more than a little bit here that reminds you of movies like Apollo 13 and Cast Away (particularly the former). I fail to see how that's a knock on it but it's being presented as such by some. We all come to movies with our own expectations and baggage. I'm not a Scott fanboy expecting him to wow me (his last two films were not great). I just wanted to be entertained and this did the trick. It's a movie aimed at the masses that is smarter than your average movie aimed at the masses. Maybe it's not for all nerds (a quick glance at some of the reviews shows a lot of inane nit-picking from people who seem to have no concept of dramatic license), but I didn't find the movie dumbed-down at all. I also want to say how much I appreciated that this managed to stay remarkably light and positive while still maintaining the tension, proving once again that you don't have to be depressing to be good drama. If you haven't seen The Martian yet, you should. It's a great film with a first-rate cast, good direction, and stellar effects. If you're just looking for a quality movie to entertain you for a while, this should be something you'll enjoy."
"danjocross","3","288","518","15 October 2015"," This movie is really NOT good! Here's why.
","It's so frustrating when so many people like and praise a movie that really doesn't deserve it. The Martian is such a movie. I had such high hopes for it after all the hype, and after reading reviews by smart critics I usually agree with, but it was such a disappointment. Here's why: <br/><br/>Plausibility. Just like Gravity, there are so many non-sensical depictions of the physics of space travel, it makes my head hurt, and I'm not even a physicist. The characters and their actions are pretty implausible too, starting with Damon's chipper attitude about being left alone on a planet 100 million miles from Earth, but certainly not ending there. After realizing he is alone and will be for so long that he will run out of food, he gets the brilliant idea to try to grow his own, which we are supposed to take as a mark of his plucky brilliance. But he's a botanist! What would a botanist be doing on a space mission *except* studying how things grow? And then when an accident causes all his potato plants to die, the brains at NASA (who can't believe he figured a way to grow potatoes in the first place) instantly conclude (and tell us) that since the accident froze all the bacteria in the soil, he won't be able to grow any more. Why not? He still has potatoes to eat, and he still, presumably, shits occasionally, so he has all the ingredients he used the first time. Ugh! My brain hurts! <br/><br/>Writing. The script seems written more by market researchers than a screenwriter. Corny little one-liners (""My balls are frozen!"") appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience, and the relentlessly happy tone makes being stranded on Mars seem like a big party, complete with disco music (literally). And the dialog!! There's a moment when Jeff Daniels, the head of NASA (whom it is hard to imagine has ever ever taken a science class or piloted anything) talks to the heads of the Chinese Space agency who offer (presumedly--we only hear his end of the conversation) to lend one of their ships to the rescue effort. He says, ""Mmm Hmm. Okay. I see. Thank you."" (That's what a discussion about loaning spacecraft between two space agencies sounds like.) Then he hangs up the phone, clenches his fists, and says, ""Yes!"" It's like Homer Simpson finding out there is still one donut left. That someone wrote that line is astounding. That the director and actor saw fit to actually shoot it is bewildering. That it survived the editing process and made it into the final cut--well, there should be an investigation. <br/><br/>Pacing. It's a movie about being stranded on Mars for months and months. Why does it feel like a comedy by Woody Allen or Edgar Wright? There is never a pause, never a prolonged quiet moment that might begin to capture something of the unbelievable space and loneliness this movie is supposed to be about. Instead, it is a constant rapid fire of dialog and action. Even the scenes where he is communicating with Earth via text happens faster than I usually get with my iPhone and 4G. (NASA technicians mention, at one point, that there is a 25 minute delay between all communications, but the filmmakers hope we forget this two minutes later when all the subsequent conversations happen instantly). Then there is the rest of the crew and their additional unplanned two years of extra time stuck in the spaceship, going all the way BACK to Mars to pick up what they left there. If I have to run back home to get something I forgot, the trip always seems infuriatingly long. But not these cheery space travelers! Another two years in space! No problem! And it takes only two minutes of screen time. Piece of cake! <br/><br/>AGH! What a frustrating experience. If you want a sugar-coated popcorn movie that will make you think that if being on stranded on Mars isn't really so bad, why complain about our petty little problems here on Earth? then this movie might be for you. It does for being stranded in space what The Shawshank Redemption does for being in prison. It tries to tell us that it's really not THAT bad after all. It's such a lie, and such a disappointment, all the more so because there are so many serious issues and exciting psychological and scientific aspects about space that could have been explored here."
"jbroc62","9","353","644","7 October 2015"," The Martian: ""Cast Away"" Meets ""Apollo 13""
","The Martian is a new Ridley Scott classic, featuring his best work in years, the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, an outstanding supporting cast, a surprisingly funny screenplay from Daredevil creator Drew Goddard, and a great narrative that ties the film together beautifully. <br/><br/>As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully. <br/><br/>Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come. <br/><br/>The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own. <br/><br/>I have nothing bad to say about The Martian. It's the best film I've seen all year."

","Boy, I haven't hated a movie this much in a long time. I actually just joined IMDb (I have been a long term viewer) in order to vent this out of my system, and to express my amazement that this terrible, vapid, cliché movie won a Golden Globe and is nominated for the Oscar best movie of the year. What the heck is going on? Are Aliens sucking the brain matter out of us little by little so that we actually think this tripe is not only good, but great? <br/><br/>A script a high schooler could have written, bad acting, terrible dialogue, one dimensional characters you don't care about, bad disco music, overly politically correct casting, mistakes in basic ""science"", stupid hap-hap-happy ending where everyone in the world (literally) is jumping, smiling and hugging each other, I could go on and on. This movie was so bad we actually kept watching it, like the morbid curiosity of looking at an auto accident. <br/><br/>My favorite line of the movie was when Jeff Daniels said that the Matt Damon character would be fine with his supplies ""as long as nothing goes wrong"". I looked at my husband and said sarcastically ""Gee, I wonder if something is going to go wrong"", and wouldn't you know it, in the very next scene it does. <br/><br/>We have sworn off any future Ridley Scott movies, for good. He is obviously in cahoots with the Aliens sucking out all our brain matter."
"davidc-29","1","197","368","12 December 2015"," What do you get when political correctness takes precedent over good movie making? (If telling you why this move is terrible qualifies as a spoiler then beware)
","This movie can be summed up with one word... vapid. As if Matt Damon's inherently vapid acting weren't bad enough, the makers of this film were so overtly focused on presenting an idyllic reality where no character behaves in any offensive way, to anybody, they produced an un-suspenseful, uninteresting, boring, vapid turd of a story. They fall over themselves to be so certain that no minority demographic is stereotyped that all characters have the sane vapid personality. And in what seems to be some sort of perverse effort to recompense reality, a very transparent hierarchy is followed to be certain that: the Black people are the most clever; the Hispanic people are next most clever; the Asian people are next most clever(carefully not portrayed as exceptionally smart), and of course the women are more clever than the men. Of course the only flawed demographic were older white male authority figures. To me this liberal, philosophical portrayal of what an ideal reality is reveals that they are the true bigots, the haters. They hate the differences that make people interesting. Ethnicity, femininity / masculinity, and their different traits should be loved and celebrated, not shamed, muted, or eliminated. It is the interaction of those differences that create an interesting story, not a vapid one."
"veravangroos","1","212","400","2 November 2015"," The worst thing about this movie
","Spoilers below. <br/><br/>The worst thing about about this movie was that everything is so hard to believe because it's such nonsense. It doesn't follow basic physic laws. It doesn't take much to get me invested in a movie as a viewer, but this just goes too far. The absolute worst flaw is not even all the fake science, nor I'd it the overuse of disco music or the fact that the astronaut doesn't really get desperate and only makes cheesy jokes... No, it's the fact that China's space program has some secret spaceship which they want to reveal and give up for the eyes of the world to save one unknown American dude. That just doesn't make any sense. First of all, China could care less, also, why give up a rocket on which you've been apparently working in secret, just to send food up to space? And if all this would happen for some strange reason... America responds with 'ok. I see. Thank you'. Hangs up and goes ' yessssssss.' Idiotic."

","Wow this was a bad one, I thought Interstellar was painful but this was even worse (I know hard to believe!) My favourite part in the whole movie was when Matt points out that an explosion which occurred in a particular room during an experiment he was conducting was due to (you'll love this!) him exhaling too much oxygen into the room! Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure we exhale CO2 and inhale O2. I think even a fifth grader would be able to tell me that. I nearly cried with laughter when I heard him say that line and how he kept a straight face is beyond me, unless he thinks its true of course.<br/><br/>This was just the beginning of the lack of believable science in this movie and it was so painful to watch after more and more random unbelievable events started popping up. His one line killed the movie for me, from that point on I was looking for more ""errors"" and they just kept on coming.<br/><br/>Anyway to cover the opening sequence with how poor Matt ends up left on Mars to die, well there's a big storm that no one seems coming, they all rush to their landing vehicle to hot tail it back up to their orbiting mothership. Matt gets a whack in the gut with something (which we later find out pierced his suit completely but yet somehow the suit manages to stay pressurised with a hole in it) and decides to pass out. The rest of the crew fly back up to the mothership and, get this, immediately set course for home! They don't stay in orbit for say another 24 hours and recover Matt's body they just leg it back home asap. Odd I thought for a NASA mission to just abandon him and not say bring the body back for his family to bury.<br/><br/>When poor Matt wakes up he finds all the communications are down and all his friends gone. And by communications I mean the one satellite dish that was stuck to the habitat roof has blown down in the storm and been completely demolished, but not one of the solar panels outside is damaged, just a bit sandy. Seeing how comms back to Earth would be one of the critical systems would there not be 3 or 4 other methods of calling home, redundancies in case of a disaster? NASA didn't see the point in having any of those backups on this mission to Mars, what could possibly go wrong? Another good one is when he is told to drill and cut a whole in the roof of a perfectly airtight rover and sticky tape a big plastic balloon to the top of it. No reason is given for this yet it happens, I think it's so he can take some more plastic painting sheets with him but I cant be certain. Also wouldn't this drilling and cutting a big hole compromise the pressurisation integrity rendering the vehicle unsafe to drive around in without a space suite on, oh but not for Matt, he happily drives around Mars with no suit on at all with his new plastic sticky taped sunroof fitted trying to work out how far he can get on his batteries while whinging about how he'll never make it to the RV due to lack of power all the while singing along to the stereo with more flood lights turned on than at a football stadium. Um turn some crap off Matt that'll save you some juice.<br/><br/>Again another scene in the movie, an airlock somehow gets blown to bits and a big gaping whole is left in the side of the habitat Matt lives in. The solution, a big piece of plastic sheet and more sticky tape, he then repressurises the habitat and somehow his sticky taped plastic painting sheet is able to hold up fine, outside there are wild storms going on (which are visible through a few of the more believable looking pressurised windows) raging away and not one single piece of debris punches through his plastic painting drop sheet or does any damage to his rover or solar panels.<br/><br/>The mission to get him home is to send back the craft which ran away and left him in the beginning. NASA didn't tell the crew of the ship for months that he was still alive as they didn't want to hurt their feelings! So the plan to get him back is drive the mothership all the way back to Earth, do some gravity sling shot thing around Earth (sounds like Apollo 13?) rendezvous with a supplies pod (food and movies onboard probably) and fly all the way back to Mars and pick him up as he fires himself into space from a lander (after stripping out all the gear inside, removing the roof and covering it with another plastic painting sheet held on with sticky tape to save weight) already there for the next disastrous mission to Mars NASA has already cooked up.<br/><br/>For me this movie just went too far, way beyond what any normal person with a even a tiny grasp of science can cope with. I cannot believe Ridley, NASA and JPL were happy to have their names mentioned let alone their relevant ground breaking departments portrayed with such a lack of any real science.<br/><br/>I know it's a SciFi movie but you have to get the basics right and have some kind of explanation for the viewer to be able to buy into the ludicrous things which take place in the movie. Otherwise it just becomes a complete bore to watch and the viewer spends their time looking for more flaws.<br/><br/>My opinion, save yourself the money, stay home, get a pizza in & watch Blade Runner on BluRay again :-)"
"Sankari_Suomi","4","102","186","10 November 2015"," Matt, you're not making this easy
","This tedious family adventure film is the latest contribution to the popular and well established 'Where Are We Rescuing Matt H. Damon From This Week?' genre.<br/><br/>I like Matt H. Damon, I really do. But he's been making it very difficult recently, and this 2+ hour marathon just doesn't help.<br/><br/>Damon plays an astronaut accidentally marooned on Mars by a storm that literally could not happen because Mars lacks the necessary atmospheric conditions, where he must somehow survive with nothing but an unlimited supply of electricity, an unlimited supply of water, an entirely self- sufficient artificial habitat, half a dozen spare space suits, multiple land vehicles and probes (all in perfect working order), food supplies intended for half a dozen people, and a large quantity of magical potato seedlings that grow to maturity in just a few days despite a complete absence of soil nutrients.<br/><br/>Since the first act establishes that Damon is so well set up he doesn't actually need rescuing, Ridley Scott fabricates a second act 'emergency' in a vain attempt to raise tension (it doesn't).<br/><br/>Damon keeps in contact with Earth via a magical transmission technology that provides full HD streaming with no latency whatsoever, allowing him to have real time conversations with NASA headquarters, where everyone does and says whatever they want because there is no chain of command even though it's ostensibly run by Jeff Daniels (played by Jeff Daniels).<br/><br/>His fellow astronauts remain hovering above Mars, beaming their own HD stream to NASA by the use of a magical camera that automatically homes in on Damon regardless of where he is on the planet.<br/><br/>NASA builds a brand new rocket from scratch in less than 14 days so they can send Damon a fresh load of unlimited supplies. It explodes immediately after takeoff because Ridley Scott still has another hour to fill. Meanwhile Damon accidentally blows up his potatoes.<br/><br/>NASA's lone Chinese employee suddenly remembers that his uncle has a private rocket he's never got around to using, so they phone China and ask if NASA can borrow it. The uncle agrees so the Chinese government sends it into space immediately, where it is instead caught by Damon's astronaut colleagues, who nick all the supplies.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Damon is travelling to the other side of the planet, where he intends to escape using a previously unsuspected bonus rocket that just happens to be lying around the place in perfect working order. <br/><br/>Damon can't carry his unlimited supply of water and only has enough room in his vehicle for a few sandwiches, but by a remarkable stroke of luck it turns out that his body is capable of indefinite peak physical performance despite minimal hydration and a complete lack of nutrition, so that's OK. Also it turns out that the gravity on Mars is exactly the same as Earth's, so he hasn't lost any muscle tone.<br/><br/>Damon arrives at the bonus rocket and is told by NASA that it's actually too heavy to lift off the planet despite being designed for that exact purpose (???) The only solution is to remove the nose of the rocket, which is actually easier than it sounds because the entire spacecraft is made of Lego and can be easily disassembled by a single undernourished man with no tools.<br/><br/>With the nose of the rocket removed, Damon risks being killed by the extreme physical pressure generated by takeoff. NASA points out that a simple tarpaulin is strong enough to protect him, so he finds a spare one from... somewhere... and straps it on.<br/><br/>Damon's fellow astronauts pair their ship with his rocket using Bluetooth, and take over the controls. Damon is almost crushed to a pulp as the rocket leaves Mars, because it turns out that tarpaulin isn't as strong as industrial steel after all.<br/><br/>Somebody on the astronauts' ship blows something up because of reasons, and this somehow makes it easier for one of them to rescue Damon, who has jumped out of his rocket and is now flying towards their ship with the aid of a hole in the finger of his space suit and an unlimited supply of pressurised oxygen.<br/><br/>NASA is helpfully streaming this heroic rescue to the entire planet using their magical realtime HD stream, because of course they are.<br/><br/>Damon and his fellow astronauts arrive home safely just a few hours later, and Damon is rewarded with a free pair of glasses. Henceforth, everyone must call him 'Doctor.' Because doctors have glasses.<br/><br/>I rate The Martian at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a mediocre 4/10 on IMDb."

"LiamCullen6","10","50","87","17 October 2015"," It truly is impossible to please everyone isn't it?
","First off I just want to stress that this is absolutely the kind of film you want to see on the big screen; don't wait for it to come out on DVD! The Mars landscape is truly stunning and the visual effects look fantastic.<br/><br/>I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the cinema today. I knew it was about some guy getting stuck on Mars, but that's about it. I had no idea that what I was about to watch would end up being one of my favourite movies of the year.<br/><br/>The whole of planet Earth is trying to help Mark get home after he's been left behind on Mars and presumed dead. You can clearly see the emotion of those at the NASA command centre who are pulling all their resources together to make it work. The dedication and loyalty of Mark's crew is captivating as they come up with an idea to supersede NASA's original plan and swing the Hermes around the Earth and back towards Mars to pick their fellow astronaut up.<br/><br/>And, of course, there are Mark's struggles on Mars. This botanical genius of an astronaut is forced to grow his own food and ration his resources so that he can survive long enough for help to arrive. His creativity, innovations, and breadth of knowledge undoubtedly save his life in this impossible situation. <br/><br/>I lost count of how many times the cinema erupted into laughter. There were so many clever lines and witty comments that you couldn't leave the cinema without a smile on your face. <br/><br/>But despite the comedy, this film was able to be very gripping and tense when it needed to be: Mark removing the shrapnel from his stomach, NASA's failed attempt to launch the supply probe, the malfunction in the base on Mars leading to all of his work being ruined, and the Hermes crew desperately trying everything they can to readjust their course towards Mark are all great examples of where The Martian excels dramatically.<br/><br/>I also really liked that they were able to show the effect of such severe rationing: Mark loses substantial weight and muscle (I know it was a body-double, but still the effect is the same). In addition, the visible tooth decay was a nice touch which just goes to show how polished and attentive to detail the film is.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the cast was phenomenal: Matt Damon (Bourne), Jeff Daniels (The Newsroom), Sean Bean (Game of Thrones), Kate Mara (House of Cards), and Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) just to name a few.<br/><br/>Several of the criticisms I have seen of this film are, to me, actually its strengths: the main protagonist who isn't concerned with his family back home (thank goodness it wasn't another cliché where he has a family that he oh-so-desperately needs to get back to), the length of the film (Interstellar, I would say, was bordering on too long, whereas Gravity seemed a bit short - The Martian felt just right), and the comedic element (to me, the comedy is what makes this film stand out - it is integral to its success - just like with The Edge of Tomorrow).<br/><br/>And, as with all Ridley Scott films, the pacing was excellent. The plot didn't seem too rushed, but it didn't drag on either. Perfectly executed.<br/><br/>If you enjoy good storytelling, excellent acting, stunning visuals, comedy, drama, and survival, then you can be sure to enjoy this movie as much as I did!"

They created a film of shallow, lame, cliché stereotypes with bad developed characters.<br/><br/>It's all about the hero. It's not about ""Matt Damon in his best role"".

"arroyodorado","1","80","149","17 October 2015"," I'm giving up on Ridley Scott!
","Man, I was so disappointed by this movie! Did I have too high expectations? I don't think so. If you have a bunch of actually Hollywood-A-class actors and a director who made ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"", you are officially allowed to have expectations! But they all failed terribly in my opinion. I could rant about the bad jokes, the awful soundtrack and the cheesy 3D-renderings - why didn't they manage one single time to make these things, the ship, the rover, actually look big? It all looked like toys! Awful! But my biggest complaint is the terrible storytelling! The movie had zero suspense from beginning to end. It was always, hey we have a problem, let's have a cool dialog/monologue, and then, hey, we'll solve the problem within the next minute - no problem at all! Hey, I got no milk in the fridge, OK I'll get some from the supermarket... That level of depth. I didn't feel for one single minute with the main character and I couldn't have cared less, when he had died in the end. There was at some points emotional music and we all were told, that this and that is dangerous and what not. But I couldn't feel it at all. Just for comparison: ""Gravity"" had me on the edge of the seat and ""Interstellar"" had me hold my breath. Not to mention ""Moon"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Odyssee"". Wasn't there a time, when Ridley Scott made actually great movies? Do yourself a favor and spend the money on something else. This movie isn't worth it."
"alexandercappelli","7","10","14","8 March 2016"," Not the film you think it is.
","The Martian (2015) directed by Ridley Scott, written by Drew Goddard, based on the novel by Andy Weir. This is not the film you think it is. To elaborate, the premise of the The Martian suggests a tale about one man's solitary struggle against seemingly insurmountable odds as he overcomes one hurdle after another while stranded on Mars. Isolated and detached from humanity in every sense of the word we would expect to see a mans emotional and intellectual battle with this overbearing desolation and the pain of never seeing his loved ones again. However, in stark contrast to this what we get is an eternally optimistic film with a persistently upbeat, wise-cracking protagonist set to a soundtrack of '70s disco music. The tone is consistently light throughout, save for a few fleeting moments such as when Matt Damon's character mentions his parents on earth or the brief moments when something doesn't quite go to plan at NASA. When they do encounter a problem it's resolved so quickly it scarcely seems to have posed any threat. The films insistence on never getting weighed down by it's subject matter unfortunately means that it fails to produce any real tension. From very early on in the film it's clear that everything will be OK by the end, one way or another this astronaut is getting home safe, that much you can be sure on. Consequently what we have then is an entertaining, easy to watch space travel story in which we watch an astronaut devise some nifty scientific devices to help him survive in his man made habitat while he waits for NASA to rescue him. There are several scenes where Damon's character actually seems to be enjoying himself. The character development is paper thin, he starts of a self assured, relatively cheerful every-man who endears himself to us almost instantly. By the end of the film he remains exactly that, his harrowing experience of surviving a harsh alien wasteland after being left for dead by his crew has failed to instill even the slightest sense of self-reflection or introspective behavior. The question then remains, does this make it a 'bad' film? My answer is no. It's just not what you'd expect from a Ridley Scott sci-fi. It's an easy going film with a likable protagonist, a healthy dose of humour with just a touch of sentimentality. I will say that I appreciated that we had both a female captain leading the space crew and not even the slightest hint of an unnecessary romantic subplot. Adjust your expectations and you'll have a good time. If, however, you were hoping for a masterpiece of suspense that brilliantly captures the terrifying dangers of space, Scott already made that film in 1979."
"AyeLewisTheVerified","8","207","415","28 September 2015"," Sir Ridley! More gravitas than Gravity! More stellar than Interstellar!
","After sleeping through Gravity and laughing through Interstellar, (a fine unintentional comedy if ever there was one), it's good to see a contemporary Sci-fi tell the story well - and do the science right.<br/><br/>I am not a big Matt Damon fan, mainly because of his loudmouthed lefty nonsense and his limited acting range, but he was very good in this. The support cast were also excellent, especially the always compelling black guy who I can't spell the name of and Harry Dunne.<br/><br/>There was some unfortunate pandering by Sir Ridley to the PC brigade, which the film could have done without. The Gen-Y unhygienic (accurate), disorganised, (accurate), disrespectful (accurate), black guy, who also happened to be an astrodynamics genius rocket scientist, (inaccurate), was a poor casting choice. Also to suggest the Chinese would give a fat rat's crack about an American astronaut....at the expense of their state rocket-technology secrets....is laughably far-fetched. Probably more far fetched than flying into space in a roofless/windowless capsule.<br/><br/>But putting the film's failings aside, at least Ridley told a good story, laced it with plenty of well-explained science, spliced it with genuine humour and soaked it in amazing vistas of the Martian landscape. Plus he showed that if you put a woman in charge of a dangerous mission, she will ultimately fail. This degree of honesty is refreshing, in an age where every second antagonist is a flimsy female (beating up men ten times her size), or a female weapons expert/assassin/whatever.<br/><br/>Show em as they are, Ridley. Well done.<br/><br/>All in all a great film where I expected a load of boring tripe.<br/><br/>8/10."
"emcdonough-96068","2","67","127","14 October 2015"," So Science-y.
","This movie is so science-y. You will just love how much it quotes science. Like, you know, real science. And that is why I loved this movie. Science tells us that everything in it is totally possible. Anybody who doesn't like this movie must be anti-science. Because science rules. It's like Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye had a love child. And Carl Sagan.<br/><br/>But don't just go for all the science. The story is so unique. I know Matt Damon just famously played a brilliant NASA astronaut who got stranded on a planet in the movie Interstellar, and that Jessica Chastain was also in that one, but it is not like Interstellar at all (what was with that weird ending, anyway??). The Martian has its own unique plot centered around a team of brilliant NASA scientists in Houston trying to get their astronauts home after a difficult journey that had to be cut short, but it is not like Apollo 13. Sure, in both movies they don't have enough fuel, and there is an explosion on board, and they have to use this brilliantly hatched scheme to use gravitational pull to propel them. But get this: while Apollo 13 had its astronauts being propelled around the moon, The Martian has them going around Earth! Science says that the earth is way bigger than the moon, which makes this way cooler. Nope, not at all like the entire movie Apollo 13. Oh, and also, there is a great part at the end that made me feel just like I was watching Gravity again. You'll know the part when you see it. But really it is nothing like Gravity.<br/><br/>It is so funny through the whole movie when Matt Damon explains everything in minute detail as it happens. Such a brilliant choice by the writer and director. Exposition like that is so scientific because he has to know all those big words in order to explain everything. I can imagine all the anti-science global warming deniers' heads exploding at these parts, but if you're anything like me, you will find yourself nodding along and thinking, ""Yep! I know what he's talking about!"" Example: that moment he had to make his own water and he said, ""Fortunately, I know the recipe. Take hydrogen. Add oxygen. Burn."" So true!<br/><br/>Again, The Martian is a smart, complex movie. Luckily, in another brilliant choice by director Ridley Scott, title cards appear at the beginning of nearly every scene explaining where the action is taking place, and who is taking part in it. I found this extremely helpful, as it was a bit confusing when it would switch from Mars to Earth all the time. Plus, it was extremely gratifying when I would see a new character, and before I even had time to think who the heck is that, lo and behold, his or her name and title would appear to clear away all doubt.<br/><br/>Then there's the music: So many familiar tunes!<br/><br/>And I've been hearing a lot about perhaps the most quotable line of any movie for years—you know the line—let me just say it because it is so funny: ""I'm gonna have to science the s*** out of this."" --That is said by Matt Damon's character, Mark Watney, who is literally one of the smartest and most capable men ever. But as you can tell, he isn't all stuffy, you know? He is really funny. Can I just quote some more of his hilarious lines? I couldn't stop laughing the whole way through as he smugly said these things to the audience, I mean his camera:<br/><br/>""Hi, I'm Mark Watney and I'm still alive... obviously.""<br/><br/>""I don't want to come off as arrogant here, but I'm the greatest botanist on this planet.""<br/><br/>""Mars will come to fear my botany powers.""<br/><br/>""So yeah, I'm f***ed.""<br/><br/>""In your face, Neil Armstrong!""<br/><br/>""Tell Commander Lewis, disco sucks."" ""F***!""<br/><br/>""So I blew myself up.""<br/><br/>""Mark Watney: Space Pirate.""<br/><br/>""I admit it's fatally dangerous, but I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.""<br/><br/>""F*** you, Mars.""<br/><br/>Anyway, he is hilarious as you can tell, and this movie definitely deserves all the praise it is getting for its humor alone. You will just love this.<br/><br/>Ten/Ten ""Stars"" (Get it?)"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>During an outer space mission around Mars, astronaut Matt Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from his spacecraft, and is presumed dead in the immediate aftermath. Stranded many light years from his home planet, Mark is forced to use his survival training (including fertilising faeces for food!) in order to survive, before managing to contact Earth and bring news of his survival to NASA president Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), who desperately works on Earth with scientist Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to get him home, while re-assuring a frantic public.<br/><br/>Having made his name in a landmark sci-fi classic many decades ago, Ridley Scott returns to the genre for a film where the only alien appears to be in human form. His ability to create an impressive visual spectacle doesn't seem to have diminished with time, and The Martian features some sets and designs in outer space that could quite blow your mind. The director oversteps any meaningful character development, and plunges us straight into a story that serves as a lengthier rendition of 2013's Gravity, with elements of Tom Hanks's Cast Away chucked in for good measure.<br/><br/>For a film stretching at nearly two and a half hours, it really needed not just an interesting story, but an effective screenplay to match it. While the 'one man stranded in space' plot still has some life in it, Scott seems overly preoccupied with stuffing Damon's Watson character full of insightful technical jargon and waffle, to reassure us he's highly intelligent and 'NASA's finest', to the point of disconnection. To try and balance the script with some humour, Scott has displayed an affection for '70s disco music, which Damon must awkwardly eschew. It's a welcome touch, if not truly effective.<br/><br/>Performances wise, Damon must carry the lengthy film almost singlehandedly, and it's his varying degrees as an actor that make as little or most of this. While a better actor could have made more of it, by turns a weaker actor could have made it worse, and so you're grateful for small mercies. In what could be the main supporting role, Daniels is grounded as the head of NASA but, in a film determined to have as much humour as drama, that role he took with Jim Carrey all those years ago (and recently reprised) can never get out your mind. A further colourful supporting cast further make it up, including Michael Pena, Sean Bean and Ejiofor.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not an entirely unsuccessful film, just one without the genuine tension and suspense to really make it last as long as it does, and so the cracks do appear at times. ***"

He correctly understood the impatience of miseducated Americans with annoyances such as basic laws of physics. IOW, he took the movie money and ran, like the smart kid I know him to be. <br/><br/>So I would say that any idiotic disregard of science on screen—the use of Visqueen and duct tape to secure a 6 foot hole vacated by (richly ironic) a blown hatch cover against a 50,000 pound pressure gradient, for example—resulted either from production or directorial indifference. The list of anti-Newtonian horrors goes on, and gets funnier, particularly when Matt Damon punctures his space glove and uses the escaping oxygen to propel himself toward his rescuer. Next, I was half expecting the crew of the rescuing spacecraft to line up, bend over, and torch off an ensemble fart to correct a course deviation.<br/><br/>In any case, this movie was not intended to portray a real human battle against nature, as was so wonderfully chronicled in Apollo 13.<br/><br/>Rather, The Martian was intended to make money by playing on current themes of political correctness and the warm fuzzies of international cooperation, framed by the awesomeness of space.<br/><br/>It fails spectacularly even at this wretched goal—not at making money, you understand, but the furtherance of World Peace—placing its bets on star power, flaccid dialogue, dumbass jokes and cheap CGI effects instead of a solid script, good acting and a credible stab at realism. Jeff Daniels as the director of NASA? My God...<br/><br/>Watch this movie only if you're looking for something to distract you from doing something more useful, such as expressing the dog's impacted anal glands.<br/><br/>Higher emotional content can be found by chopping up an onion."

","From the earliest days of cinema, films have explored what man can do when cut off from society (and indeed, the interest of the topic pre-dates the art form: think how long ago Robinson Crusoe was written). But in a world ever more monitored, depictions of life beyond borders are often set in space. These include both fictional tales and true stories. 'Apollo 13', for example, is a riveting film, but mainly because of its raw material: in 1971, a manned space mission suffered from an explosion and the astronauts were stranded, thousands of miles from help; amazingly, they managed to fix their stricken craft and make it home alive.<br/><br/>'The Martian' is a fictional story, but is in some ways Apollo 13-redux. It starts with a gripping scene where, post-disaster, the hero is forced to operate on himself: gripping, yes, but also not a scene that needs to be set on Mars. And subsequently, it can't quite live up to this compelling start. As I see it, there are three main problems. Firstly, some implausible science (how can you grow plants without carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?) and psychology (the story is set over a period of years, but we never really get the impression that the character is stranded alone for so long). Secondly, the need for the Hollywood virtues where force of character compels eventual triumph. And finally, perhaps, that the remarkable thing about Apollo 13 is not that its crew could have saved themselves, but that they did: the triumph was not one over the laws of physics, but rather a win against the odds. In a fictional story, this is a less compelling narrative structure: why does the character get repeatedly lucky? Simply because the screenwriters wrote it that way.<br/><br/>Yet in spite of its faults, the film's basic set up draws you in, and by the (admittedly melodramatic) rescue scenes, one can't help but watch on the edge of one's seat; and keeping an audience interested for over two hours is not such an easy thing to do. Perhaps the fact that in the real world we've basically given up on manned space travel adds to the appeal: this may be a futuristic story, but at the same time, it also feels like a tale of something we used to do, to boldly go beyond the limits of our planet to see what we might find."

","2 hours and 21 minutes of Matt Damon gardening, and people at NASA discussing how to rescue him. Seriously. That's the whole movie.

And the casting is terrible. A 22-year-old hot model-type woman is the only one at NASA smart enough to locate Damon. And a 22-year-old slob who looks like he's strung-out on drugs (rolling out of a bed in his FILTHY MESSY office, twitching, shaking, stuttering) is the only one at NASA smart enough to think of using a slingshot-effect for the rocket. But they're SOOOO smart that they can attend high-level, and I'm talking the highest level on a national scale....they can attend these meetings in street clothes, while everyone else is in suits and ties.<br/><br/>I know Damon is extremely politically-correct, and so are most Hollywood movies these days. But this one goes too far. Literally every scene alternates between a person of a different race. White, African-American, African, Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern.

","I believe this is one of the overrated films on IMDb. While it has a high user rating and for some reason totally mistakenly in the Top 250, user reviews are mostly bad. And they are right. This movie is boring, unrealistic and totally not entertaining. I mean, what makes a movie a good movie? We all know that a movie is not real. We still feel entertained, why? Because we can feel the main characters struggle in a difficult situation, we suffer with him, we have empathy. None of these are happening to the audience when you watch this one.<br/><br/>It was actually the sappy behavior of the characters making you feel bored watching. I would have accepted the fact that he grew potatoes out of the feces of his buddies and they have left them there, okay why not ... he a botanist (how exciting by the way).<br/><br/>Just a few examples: For reasons unknown, he starts taking Vicodin with his potato - I actually had to look it up what Vicodin was, and then did not understand the message of this.<br/><br/>The captain of the ship blames himself immediately ""I left him there"" after they have received the message. Come on guys, give the character some time to emotionally apprehend the situation, before she starts blaming herself! Nobody does that immediately... not ever!<br/><br/>Who is this stupid moron looking like a drug addict in his totally messy office, where no one should have taken seriously? A total loner-loser, who works for NASA, doesn't even know the directors name when he is in his office... and then performs an act of a 3-year- old? What is this, are you kidding me? Why should the audience take this seriously at all?<br/><br/>Ridley Scott has totally failed to give the crew them some meaning. They could have just robots as far as I am concerned, wouldn't make this movie less worse.<br/><br/>There is just no excitement the whole time. He was deserted. You know exactly that his own crew will go back to help him at about in the middle of the movie. You know the attempt with the first rocket will fail, because you have already understood, some heroism with the ""we won't let anybody behind""-message is actually the main story here. But you had to watch all that story of building that bogus rocket – I was bored to death! And then it explodes and fails, what a surprise!<br/><br/>So after that, you beg for a plot where something miraculous will happen. Instead, something totally ordinary happens, again! He flies to the crew. An astronaut goes out, he flies out of his capsule. I was asking myself... this is it?<br/><br/>For a moment I thought I was watching a Roland Emmerich, but I had sworn never to watch an Emmerich again. Ridley Scott now goes the same way.

Here's the scruffy ethnic that lives in a pile of mess but has worked out how to save the stranded astronaut - and develops his idea in the most childish way even though most of us had worked it out a good hour beforehand, Gruff Sean Bean growls and fights against the system. Pretty female astronauts are in control, a teenage NASA technician (female) spots something none of the more experienced men in real life would have noticed at the drop of a hat, the hideously white NASA director is stupid but the USA's new friends - the Chinese - come to the rescue. The scenes of jubilation in Times Square, Trafalgar Square and somewhere in China with massed crowds waiting with bated breath as the ""live"" rescue mission is beamed directly on to large screens is just pure nonsense.

BTW, I ""appreciate"" the whole re-use and abuse of the ""Aliens"" concepts and designs in the initial titles and the crew quarters appearances. Awesome. Reuse/Recycle. No new ideas there.<br/><br/>A whole manned mission to Mars couldn't include a way to observe the Martian weather (this being possible for tens of years as we speak) and to land safely at a nice, wind-safe crater or to anchor a return vehicle securely enough? REALLY? And once a bit of a storm blew, the entire crew had to hurry back to Earth? ALL THE WAY BACK? They could not stay in the Martian orbit for a few hours even to make sure that they didn't leave anyone behind? WHAT? The orbit became dangerous too because of some storm? Am I the only one who could not believe that the hatches would seal nicely in a sand/rock/what's not storm? There was no two-way comm with any crew members? Once someone got blown away, then it was the end for him/her? Even on Earth this sounds dumb. Cool crappy, unrealistic suits! No real protection, funny boots, no visible means of backpacked life-support, lots of light blinding the users inside helmets and no light (as well as no two-way comm) for the actual work?! Then, no one could keep a communication satellite in the Martian orbit? So that no one would have to reinvent the wheel it order to communicate between the surface and the command center??? No further comments here.<br/><br/>Kudos to the political correctness lawyers. They didn't miss one single detail. The manned mission to Mars includes the politically correct balance of males and females, they got a Mexican, a German (seriously???), and then the entire NASA's Martian program has the necessary number of very respectfully black Hindus and other African Americans. Good Job! Then there is the necessary number of Asians gets involved. And the Chinese government decides what's wrong with the whole rescue mission. Nice.<br/><br/>Considering that neither NASA nor the Chinese can STILL fly anything worth a rat's jazz into space without the Russian-made tech, it is funny to see the whole story without any Russian involvement. Even the privately funded SpaceX program seems more effective these days than NASA! Nice political BS, holly-crap-wood.<br/><br/>Look. I have given up expecting anything even closely serious from Hollywood. Yes, this movie is another all-time-low.

How did he survive after the accident? Let's find out.<br/><br/>This movie began with a big sand storm. The Ares crew and Mark Watney were collecting samples of stones and dirt, when suddenly a sand storm came. Mark and the crew were separated by it. A metal stick stabbed Mark's body and the crew thought Mark was dead. To protect the other crew members, the commander forced the crew to abort the mission and Mark was left behind on Mars! The following day, when Mark woke up, he found he was alone on Mars. He wanted to survive on Mars; it's lucky that Mark is a botanist, he knew how to grow potatoes and make water by himself. He began to survive on this planet with very little water or food.<br/><br/>One day, an engineer named Mindy Park found two satellite photos were different; the solar panels had been moved! The director Vincent Kapoor knew that Mark had survived. They wanted to save Mark's life, but the NASA director Teddy Sanders didn't agree. To rescue Mark, Mitch Henderson, who was the flight director of the Ares 3 Mission, used a special code to tell the Ares crew that Mark was still alive. Mitch wanted the crew to decide if they wanted to save Mark or not.<br/><br/>In the end, the crew and Mark meet again. I felt so excited about their reunion. I liked the movie very much!

","Science fiction has been one of the genres churned out many times, most turning into capers with few exceptions like Apollo 13 or Gravity. ""The Martian"" isn't a caper nor does it delve into the sentimentality of ""Apollo 13"" or ""Gravity."" It's simply a clever and entertaining sci-fi drama that contemplates the scientific facts meticulously. The story seems more for pleasing the crowd rather than accomplishing a rich literary work; but whatever it does seem flawless and detailed for which the film becomes gripping throughout despite its over length. Based on a novel of the same title, the film pretty enriches your knowledge on astronomy for which it can serve a very good resourcce. Matt Damon in the title role steals the show using much of wit to his role, avoiding sentimentality, and above all, tries something different than the desolation portrayed by Tom Hanks in Cast Away or Leonardo Di Caprio in ""The Revenant."" His role is pretty fun filled and amusing; a memorable performance he has given in recent years after 'The Departed."" A superb narration, brilliant camera work, and a nice performance definitely make it a smart and entertaining movie of the year though the subject and treatment might not feel a regular Oscar worthy material.<br/><br/>Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4"

I felt like the main character ( Matt Damon) didn't capture someone actually stranded in a life or death situation. Compared to Interstellar this movie was a flop. Had no emotional attachment to any of the main characters. This movie was extremely "" Hollywoodized "" with an unreasonable amount of impossible ""WTF"" moments. I knew from the 1st couple minutes the entire script and how some characters would act ( predictable ). Id rather see a more realistic version without the humor.

","This film made me feel neutral. I found the using-science-to-solve-problems aspect interesting but that isn't what makes a film resonate with me. It's the characters. The characters in this film do not feel like people. They feel empty. Sure, Mark Watney, the lead played by Matt Damon, has a personality I guess. We learn early on that he is an easy-going guy who can remain calm in most stressful situations. However, there isn't much else to him. I had no reason to connect to him. No one bothered to give him any sort of arc or background. He doesn't change or grow as a person at all. I know not every protagonist has to go through some sort of change but this character could have with at least a little bit of internal conflict. <br/><br/>This applies to the rest of the cast as well. Only four characters in the film stood out to me in anyway: Watney, Rich Purnell (Donald Glover), Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Michael Peña's character. Watney because he is, I suppose, more well rounded than the rest of the cast; Purnell because an archetypal quirky genius character is better than no character at all; Kapoor because his skills in communication and persuasion make him stand out which is a required quality for his job (Mars mission director, I had to look it up on Wikipedia); and Peña's character because of the two tiny moments of banter between him and Watney. Everyone else is defined by their jobs (which I've forgotten for the most part anyway) and what actions they need to do for their job. <br/><br/>When it comes to technical aspects, nothing was really done badly but nothing was done exceptionally either. The direction served its purpose but didn't impress. The cast did a pretty good job in their roles but no one made up for their lacklustre* characters. The visual effects are good. Granted, nothing stood out but that wasn't the purpose. They're supposed to make the spectacle look convincing, and they accomplish that. <br/><br/>Lastly, I would like to mention the score. Throughout most of the film, I didn't really pay attention to it but in the first few scenes when Watney is stranded on Mars, I felt that the music was too overdramatic. This probably isn't that much of a problem as I forgot about it quickly but it's distracting when the score is too intense or emotional for the scene it's accompanying.<br/><br/>Overall, this film neither impressed nor annoyed me. It's competently well made but it feels empty. If either the premise or the problem solving aspect interests you, you might like it. Otherwise, you can skip it.<br/><br/>*That's the British spelling of ""lackluster"" apparently.<br/><br/>http://letterboxd.com/lloyd_morgan/film/the-martian/"

I am appalled both by the movie as well as the number of people here on IMDb who actually found the movie worthwhile. I am not even going into the scientific aspects of what Whatney did and whether or not the fiction was any close to truth. In general, I don't like to poke holes in sci-fi, simply because the second word is 'fiction'. What got me was just the childish and rather superficial treatment accorded to everything. Not once did you feel for Whatney or any of the other crew members. The dialogue is gcheesy, bordering on inane. Clichés abound - there is a half-hindu (a separate dialogue was introduced in the movie just to highlight this fact) good-natured scientist and helpful Chinese space agency to boot. Even the special effects are underwhelming. There are instances where you can quite clearly see and feel its a toy car on the red soil.

I enjoy being moved by great acting performances and being awed by the mysteriousness and the unknown this type of genre is able to project on the big screen. However, this movie did none of the above for me. Although Matt Damon is an excellent actor, it was difficult for me to fully buy into his character. Despite being alone and stranded on Mars, he lacked emotion and credibility. The other characters in this movie fell flat, too. The biggest disappointments were Kristen Wiig and Jeff Daniels – it was too one dimensional, lacked versatility, and was to cliché. Actually, the plot was very cliché and was very predictable. And the special effects and action sequences were far too similar to what we saw in Prometheus. I guess I expected more with this cast and director but was left wanting so much more."

","SPOILERS*******************<br/><br/>Ten reasons why THE MARTIAN didn't work.<br/><br/>10. They tried to make it funny. Matt Damon is not funny, except that one time he was a puppet in Team America: World Police. 9. 1990's quality special effects. Couldn't they have hired the effects guy from GRAVITY? Or even watched GRAVITY to see what a space movie looks like in 2015? 8. The main character had no back story. None. Zip. We know nothing about this guy who we are supposed to be rooting on. Except in a random voice over where he said he loved his parents. And that he was the ""best botanist on Mars..."" I actually hoped they would leave stranded so he could glib himself into the next solar system. 7. The device of the voice over was him talking directly into camera a la THE REAL WORLD - again a 1990's device - known from this day forward as ""The Pipe Cam"" where Damon would lay out exposition mixed with a bag full of bad jokes. (My guess is this: these clams were pitched by Damon himself because SEE REASON 10) 6. The supporting cast was dreadfully miscast with special accolades for horribleness to the other astronauts, and (the usually terrific) Jeff Daniels. Daniels must have made this film while doing NEWSROOM and forgot to change characters while walking from one sound stage to another. I'm never going to Michigan if this is what happens to a man. (Chiwetel Ejiofor had the only compelling performance. But that's no surprise) The film's best actor was Damon's ""skinny"" body double who happened to be a foot taller than Damon, but this guy could dry his hair to cover his face until Matt could put his space suit back on like nobody's business. If he hadn't been a 70 year-old John Holmes body double, you never would have guessed it wasn't Damon. 5. The soundtrack was wall-to-wall disco. Yes, disco. Yes, wall-to-wall disco. Which we had finally KILLED by the 90's. 2 hours of disco left behind by the sadistic Commander of the mission. There's even an ABBA song! And I paid $15 dollars to listen to this. The on-the-nose but BEST disco song plays over the closing credits. Not the first disco song where they roll the cast and A.D.'s credits that everyone in LA stays to see. No the second half over the caterers and ""Mr. Damon's assistant"" credits. The song was I WILL SURVIVE by Gloria Gaynor meant not for the fact that Damon survived, but that WE DID SURVIVE this entire film. Damon's character even jokes about the lameness of the disco, but... 4. Matt Damon is NOT funny! So now we're stuck with bad jokes told by an unfunny actor and lots of bad disco. AND I'm sitting next to some old broad whose hearing aid has fallen out of her ear and she doesn't even notice. So Helen Keller here has scammed Medicare for $500 or whatever a Costco hearing aid runs for these days. The aid apparently has a two second delay because I get to hear disco and bad jokes twice. If I had filled my empty popcorn bucket with water, pulled my t-shirt over my face and had my wife dump it on my mouth and nose it wouldn't have been as tortuous as this movie. Not that water-boarding is torture, but you get it... 3. Derivative. Seen it a hundred times: when Damon successfully docks with his returning shipmates (who had abandoned him, ostensibly because he is so damn annoying) the film cuts from one foreign city to another where Times Square type crowds are rooting on the American as they watch the happenings on their own Jumbotron. Russia, France, communist China rooting for America. America. Right. Another example is they lifted an entire scene where Damon operates on himself removing a piece of antennae which is a beat-for-beat rip-off of Javier Bardim removing a bullet from his leg in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Only Damon didn't have to blow up a car outside a drugstore for an opiate because... 2. Damon has his own pharmacy at the space camp. When things look grave he resorts to drug abuse. He breaks open a Vicodin, rubs a potato in it, looks into his Pipe Cam and tells us, ""I ran out of cat sup 3 weeks ago."" It made no sense, so I assumed it was another joke. Because as we all know.... 1. MATT DAMON IS NOT FUNNY."

","Sir Ridley Scott is finally back on track. There's no argument that his last couple films have not been up to his standard. However, now he has gone back to his roots to bring us an adaptation of the sci-fi novel by Andy Weir The Martian.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty straightforward. Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead when stuck with debris during a storm on Mars. When the rest of his crew decides to abort and he turns out to be alive, Watney must ration his remaining resources in an attempt to same himself and make contact with NASA. Despite the familiar storyline (can you say Cast Away meets Apollo 13?), only a true mastermind behind the camera can give the story so much depth and make it so enthralling. <br/><br/>The cast is definitely one of the best ensembles of the year. Everyone does fantastic with the roles given to them, namely Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels. And while everyone does a great job in the movie, the man whose shoulders the film truly rests on is Matt Damon, and he excels in every scene he is in. The audience is always eager to follow Damon's successes and failures on Mars. Damon is so good at playing a wise- cracking scientist and showing us what it might actually be like to get left on Mars alone. With Damon's character, the movie is allowed to delve into themes about what makes us human and our drive to help one another.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of the film that truly fascinated me was how much science was explained out in the movie. The science is always intriguing and never makes one feel as though they are in school needing to remember everything they heard. <br/><br/>The Martian is easily one of the best films of the year and a very welcome return to form for Sir Ridley Scott.

In it, Colonel Paul Foster (the late Michael 'nearly Bond' Billington) was stranded believed dead on the moon a hundred miles from Moonbase with diminishing oxygen supplies and with the deadly threat of a similarly stranded alien to also deal with. To say it fired my youthful imagination would be an understatement. With Ridley Scott's new film ""The Martian"" we have an almost identical plot, albeit without the alien involvement.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney who after a freak Martian storm is left for dead by his colleagues in the NASA crew of the ""Hermes"" (led by the excellent Jessica Chastain). By ""sciencing the s**t out of this"" he struggles to survive in the airless and inhospitable landscape. By chance, his presence is detected by NASA and the action switches to the NASA team – principally NASA Director Jeff Daniels, Mars mission director Chiwetel Ejiofor, PR lady Kirsten Wiig, JPL specialist Benedict Wong and ""Hermes"" flight director Sean Bean – and their struggle to save him given the logistical impossibilities involved.<br/><br/>I loved this film.

Matt Damon – never 'Mr Charisma' in most films – is spectacular here, delivering his video logs (which – particularly in 3D – works better than Tom Hanks talking to footballs in ""Castaway"") with a wit and charm that is quite endearing. The supporting cast all bring home the bacon with strong performances, with Ejiofor positively twinkling in the role. The rest of the ""Hermes"" crew, especially Michael Peña and the cute Kate Mara, are also excellent.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Drew Goddard (""Lost"", ""World War Z"") and based on the bestselling book by Andy Weir generally works well. A few of the lines, my wife noted, smelled a bit of cheese (some of those from Sean Bean in particular), and there is a largely underdeveloped Chinese side-story (presumably to woo a Chinese audience), but overall the mood of the film carries the script triumphantly forward. (There's a nice nod and a wink to Bean's involvement in Lord of the Rings as well, which made me chuckle).<br/><br/>The film also looks marvelous, with the Mars sets and special effects being spectacular, the Mars spacecraft being beautifully realized, and some very impressive long-duration zero-gravity scenes aboard the ""Hermes"" that boggle the mind.<br/><br/>In retrospect, the film's success might be deemed to be assured given it is an amalgam of some notable film classics of recent times: the spectacle of ""Interstellar""; the intrigue of ""Moon""; the vacuum-based-perils of ""Gravity""; the hopelessness of ""Castaway"" and the 'world holds its breath' tension of ""Apollo 13"". But after the blockbuster food-mixer stops whirring, the whole thing gels beautifully and despite its fairly long running time (141 minutes) boredom is never close and you leave the theatre buzzing. A key factor in maintaining the tension for the running time is that this is a Ridley Scott film: whilst other directors might insist on a 'Hollywood' ending, with Scott at the helm you can never be sure which way the story might twist in the final reel.(And I'm not letting on here).<br/><br/>Unlike last year's ""Gravity"", and the no-doubt accurate but mind-boggling ""Interstellar"", the science all holds up pretty well (although I did have serious reservations about the robustness of polythene sheeting and duct-tape replacing a door at one point).<br/><br/>Harry Gregson-Willams' score apes Jerry Goldsmith's ""Alien"" a bit in places, but works well and is massively and joyfully supported by a wide range of disco classics, neatly incorporated into the plot.<br/><br/>Go see this film, ideally at the cinema and in 3D: I doubt you will be disappointed. Heaven knows, I don't give away 10 stars very often, but in this case.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review please see the graphical version at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up for future reviews by entering your email)."

","During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meagre supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.<br/><br/>Andy Weir started writing a book about an astronaut stranded on Mars. He hadn't had any success with publishers in the past, so he begun posting chapters to his website. That was 2011. People really liked it - so much that Crown Publishing made it become a best-seller. Weir tells this story through largely detailed work logs. The Martian is impressively geeky. Smart science-fiction is such a rarity these days. Our parents witnessed the first man in the Moon decades ago and we witnessed the landing of curiosity on Mars: WE are the Mars generation. That's the inspiration. Astronauts really are the real pioneers. They do something incredibly heroic, brave and risky but also incredibly necessary. This book is adapted by Ridley Scott, who transformed science-fiction cinema with Blade Runner and Alien. Once again, Scott goes back to the future, which is a familiar destination for him. Andy Weir and screenplay writers wrote us a love letter to science. They obviously skipped a lot of complications in the film, there's so much in the book but they decide to pick out some bits and leave others which is natural and not a problem at all. You definitely don't need to have read the book to enjoy the movie but you definitely SHOULD read the book because it's fantastic! <br/><br/>Mr Weir, from online serial to book to screen, has brought a little appreciated genre into the mainstream: the nerd thriller. This hyper-technical genre, deeply developed by novelists does something that classic thrillers do not: it puts the nerd (female or male) in the centre of the action. The intellectual is the hero. Imagine that instead of Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg was the star of Mission: Impossible. This is an adventure for those of us who believe, deep in our hearts, that the heroes of Star Trek are Spock and Scotty: the science officer and the engineer. And writing about The Martian seems to be bringing out the geekiness even more in your humble correspondent. Still its heart, humour and rousing story of perseverance and global collaboration promise to broaden the film's appeal well beyond nerds. A lot of people - including myself - responded to the characters in the book. The humour and the way he keeps his logical, practical spirit in order to solve one problem at a time; is what makes this character compelling and super duper interesting. Andy Weir admits freely that his character has little inner life. Watney simply pushes forward, putting crises into a mental lock box and figuring out how to survive. ""It could have been a deep psychological thing"", he said ""but that's not the kind of book I like to read and it's not the kind of book I wanted to write"". <br/><br/>Engineer at NASA - who are hoping to get people to Mars someday - said Mr Weir has captured something important about what make Humans want to explore. Mark Watney character represents the very cutting edge of humanity and what's possible and what we know we all need someday; which is move some of the species off the planet to ensure the species survival. Nowadays still, there are people working toward that goal. ""Watney's everybody's favourite"" because he's the brave, resourceful American optimist. We all know a smart ass nerd just like him. Moreover, if you're going to be stuck alone with an actor, who guides you through a story with nothing but video diaries, you need someone who can exude the right amount of humour and confidence. In significant measure due to his character's mordant humour, Matt Damon provides a very good company during the long stretches when he's on screen alone. Plus the actor's physicality makes Mark's capability entirely credible. <br/><br/>Matt Damon has the charm and wit to land the tricky one-liners. You try making ""Fuck you, Mars!"" sound cool. From there Watney must not only come to grips with the most dire situation any astronaut has ever faced, but also mends his own gory abdominal wound in a scene that is Prometheus-level in its guts wrenching body horror. Watney is supposedly a symbol of hope for all humanity in the final act. Creating at the same time a new Manifest Destiny. This movie is the Die Hard of space film. Matt Damon gets stab, he gets frozen, he gets exploded and even burnt. Scenes back on Earth provide a hectic, densely populated counterweight to the Martian aridity. The rest of the cast is diverse in a way that feels genuinely authentic. In the story the rest of us on Earth have this understanding of what this man sacrificed and the beauty of that. They do everything they can to bring him back because he represents the best of us all. <br/><br/>However (...) > Head over to my blog to read more about The Martian"

","This is certainly an entertaining film as a formula movie. It's fun like the earlier ""Independence Day"" film with Bill Pullman and Will Smith. We put a poor guy in an untenable situation, trapped on a planet when his colleagues are forced to take off and leave him behind. As a scientist, he does miraculous things to stay alive, including creating a greenhouse where he can grow potatoes (that just happen to be on board providing seed). That's OK. That's a plot element. He also has incredible knowledge of all the incredible stuff left behind on Mars. An amazing rover as well as a nuclear device. That's OK too because we can't have a plot without something for this guy to do. Where it falls down is in the reality of NASA (which we are told are a pack of insensitive boobs or nerds). They are going to do this and then they are going to do that. Jeff Daniels plays a stuck-in-the-mud guy who is only concerned about the politics of the job. I love Matt Damon. I've seen nearly everything he has done. He's adequate in this film but certainly not Academy Award material. He expresses almost no emotions other than a couple little under-control tantrums. What about the loneliness, the sameness of every day? Years of eating potatoes. Anyway, it is candy for those who don't want to think very much.

"broken-stairs","1","12","20","27 March 2016"," Marring a great story
","REVIEW OF MARTIAN MOVIE<br/><br/>I will start by saying that I read the book this is based on. I am not one of those people who always think the book is better than the movie; American Psycho is one of my favorite movies and I think Christian Bale's performance along with Mary Harmon's direction make it more enjoyable than the book (although the book is more twisted and perhaps a bit deeper).<br/><br/>To summarize my review, the movie-making establishment has yet again marred an interesting and inspiring story. The book had a wonderfully realist and analytical view of a marooning story, which was over-glamorized and under-directed by the director (shame on Ridley Scott). The faults can be found in this adaptation in every aspect of the film. It should be considered a disappointment and the only saving grace is the original story, which should have a much better movie made of it some day. If I am ever in the position to make it, I will.<br/><br/>Let's start with the casting. Matt Damon is a fantastic actor but this is not a role for him. In the book, Mark Watney is an engineer sent to space and, truthfully, a nerd. As smart as I know Matt Damon to be and as many intelligent roles as he has had, he does not personify the Watney from the book. He does the serious parts pretty well (although it sounds like he is dumbing it down all the time, which is probably the screen writing's fault) but as soon as he tries to tell a Watney joke, it falls flat. That's because he isn't nailing the role. In my mind, the main role should go to someone who is nerdy and who can pull off sarcasm better. I would go with an unrecognizable actor who fits the role because what I loved about the book was how I felt like I rediscovered how cool engineering is, not how cool Matt Damon is.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also terrible. Most of the actors and actresses are just your stockyard Hollywood actors; pretty and over-dramatic. Of all the parts, Vincent Kapoor and Bruce Nguyen are actually well-acted, maybe Teddy. Otherwise, you could replace any one of those actors with another and it wouldn't change much.<br/><br/>Then let's go to the set design and cinematography. Space travel is not glamorous, nor should it be portrayed in that way. Even Interstellar overdoes it, and I believe what made the story of the Martian so great was how real it felt. It's like reading a biography. Spaceships shouldn't have extra space in the hallways (the Hermes is huge), the ""gym"" room shouldn't exist (think of the actual international space-station's set up; the treadmill just extends down from the wall), and the HAB and Hermes have ridiculous amounts of internal volume. Every cubic inch of space inside a shuttle costs a ridiculous amount of money. It makes moot points that Teddy has against creating another Ares mission when they are spending extra money on a crazy T-shaped table for discussions for a ship with 6 crew.<br/><br/>Also, in reality, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) don't animate like they do in the movie; that serves no purpose in reality. They should also not be uniformly blue all the time. They also don't project onto people's faces. Also, NASA doesn't have fancy lecture halls with light bars around the desks and a metal engraved floor (I'm pretty sure); it is probably pretty basic since they should be spending their money on space exploration. All of these things pull me away from the story, which is in essence, how do you survive when you have nothing and nobody. Surrounded by all this beautifully but insensibly designed technology and space, why should we feel for this astronaut? If movie makers were to tell a story about the colonization of America, would they all be wearing dry cleaned, beautifully sewn dresses and have a big old yacht with plenty of space for everyone to hang out? Why doesn't Mark Watney's spacesuit have any dirt on it after 2 years on a dry, dirt covered planet?<br/><br/>A small note about sound design: interfaces also don't beep like they do in this movie. Also, bombs made in 39 minutes attached to a lighting panel do not beep as if on a timer (why waste time on that). I feel that none of these things add to the story as I'd love it and serve to detract from the realism of it. Want to make a good movie about traveling to Mars? Make it feel real. Direct it as if it were a documentary. Think like Kubrick did 40 years ago: Does space have sound? Do spaceship GUIs only have one color when representing complex data? Ridiculous.<br/><br/>Lastly, they butchered the book. They cut out or shortened all of the bits that actually make this story interesting. Driving for 3200km on a planet no one else exists on deserves more than a footnote. How about when the rover crashes entering the crater? That was the suspense of the ending. Loneliness; feeling like he missed his window. Where is that in the movie? Every time there is some over-dramatic pause in the film, take that out and replace it with some part of the story that was actually written.<br/><br/>Overall, it's sad because I was excited to see this movie having loved the book. It's even more sad that people might think that the book wasn't that great because the movie was even just on par. Hollywood, you ruined another story, I just wish people would stop paying you to do it."

","to name a few: Robinson Crusoe, Mission To Mars (2000), Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964) whereas Andy Weir's novel is a blatant theft of those ideas as well as it is the script of The Martian, . . . etc.<br/><br/>To give the very unoriginal story some gravity, the prominent cast obviously was the means of choice. This movie was solely developed as a typical Hollywood cash cow with pretty faces and implausibly characters. Scott's attempt of pseudo-realistic 'science' suffers from the same symptoms as it did Prometheus: stupidity on all levels.<br/><br/>Scott said, The Martian is about people of all kind combining their sources and powers. Well, this is quite pathetic for a bunch of very unoriginal ideas glued together. Maybe Scott recently watched some Star Trek episodes or Apollo 13 (1995) to get 'some' inspirations . . .<br/><br/>I guess it's time to avoid Ridley Scott movies from now on."

George Clooney comes to mind too. I have not read the book and after the movie I probably won't. But I understand that there was a lot of danger and suspension in the book, not so in the movie. Damon obviously is too big a star now to go through the trouble and actually loose weight for a role where he is supposed to nearly starve to death. Instead we get a naked, emaciated body of somebody else walking through the room and the well-fed Damon for the rest of the movie after eating minuscule portions for months. Decades ago I loved to see the NASA movies on Imax whenever I visited Houston or Cape Kennedy. None of the movies about space I have seen lately gave me the same sense of awe-inspiring greatness of our universe. I just sit there and ask myself if it is all filmed in a studio or in some desert , or is it all the work of computers? Nothing awe inspiring. <br/><br/>Well, I should have learned my lesson by now, if a movie is really pushed by the studio I am always disappointed. Luckily I paid only four bucks to see it."
"StevePulaski","8","29","57","7 October 2015"," A low-key triumph on a massive budget
","Ridley Scott's new film ""The Martian"" does not mess around with buildup or anything in the way of expository drama; it gets right to the point and recognizes why you came to see it. It opens with Ares III, NASA's manned mission to Mars, experiencing a treacherous storm upon arriving on the red planet. Debris is flying and visibility is next to nothing, and before the astronauts (Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, and Kate Mara) can take off, fellow astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by a flying antenna and presumed killed. The group takes off with the notion that Watney is dead.<br/><br/>Following NASA head Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) making the announcement of Watney's death, we see that Watney is indeed very much alive on Mars, albeit slightly handicapped after being impaled in the stomach by the antenna. Watney now has to essentially operate on a field of landmines whilst acting as a scientist MacGyver to try and sustain life on Mars, a place where presumably nothing grows and anything can go wrong at any time. In addition to monitoring water reclamation, oxygen, and atmospheric levels, he winds up growing an array of potatoes with the help of the feces of him and his crew and makes a small home for himself. It will over four years for another manned mission to rescue him, but NASA headquarters, comprised of Sanders and assistants like Vincent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Annie (Kristen Wiig), is determined to bring him back home in a timely fashion.<br/><br/>Headquarters is also struggling with the idea of telling the surviving members of the Ares III mission that Watney is alive, which ignites a fiery ethical side to the film's story. With that, ""The Martian"" is essentially a gigantic teamwork exercise where everyone feels human, which is a pleasant attribute for Scott, whose recent films have really lacked in the filmmaking craft and humanization elements. Scott's visual effects and grandscale directing usually never fail, but when these become the focus and human characters and the little touches (the science, the cause-and-effect relationships, and the narrative interest) become secondary or gravely shortchanged, then there's a real issue with his films on a macro level.<br/><br/>""The Martian,"" even with its nearly two and a half hour runtime, remains consistently interesting because it's a generally optimistic film, surprisingly enough. Watney is a wisecracker a lot of the time, even in the face of certain doom, and seeing NASA's constant efforts to bring him home show a certain diligence on their behalf works to make this film surprisingly hopeful. Then there's the roundtable of rich performances here; aside from Damon, who does solid work being the only actor on-screen in his scenes for his sheer honesty mixed with vulnerability, Daniels and Ejiofor work off of each other incredibly well together here.<br/><br/>Consider the scene following Ares III's escape from Mars during the storm, when Watney is still presumed dead; the two consult one another about what to do with Watney's remains whilst subsequently trying to find a way to turn it into a more positive, caring PR display by sending another mission out to recover his corpse. This is a perfect scene in the way that it shows the way corporations and organizations balance humanity while considering their bottom-line, and who better to play figures in those pivotal positions of power than Daniels, who's work on ""The Newsroom"" has gone on to be acclaimed, and Ejiofor, who, much like David Oyelowo, will likely win an Oscar in the next ten years.<br/><br/>Aside from a reliance on montages instead of actual exposition, ""The Martian""'s biggest problem as a film is the fact that we simply do not get enough time with Watney alone. The audience can never get a strong grasp on a relationship with this character simply because we're never allotted enough one-on-one time without the intrusion of mission control. We needed more scenes with Watney ostensibly helpless, trying to farm, or simply trying to get by on what little he has to surround himself and the film doesn't do that.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" also makes fairly strong use of its 3D elements, using it as a tool of immersion rather than a gimmick that works to add a surcharge to already high movie ticket prices. Consider the storm scene, which completely floods the screen with indiscernible debris and disarray; the scene is only emphasized with the benefit of 3D and makes the experience that much more horrifying, being that, like the characters, we can barely see a thing.<br/><br/>Above all, this is a film destined to please a crowd; in addition, it also keeps its pathos down considerably, doesn't do a whole lot of pandering to a crowd anxious to see action, and never loses sight of its deeply human and remarkable story. It also reaffirms the value of logical problem-solving in the face of a truly unexpected, and granted unprecedented, time of tumultuous uncertainty. It's a low-key triumph made on a nine figure budget."
"carlosinseattle","3","23","44","15 March 2016"," Not a good movie at all, can;t understand why people like it.
","Okay, I am also perplexed as to why people have given this terrible movie a favorable review. It seems like all we care about is a big name director and big star, then the movie has instant credibility. There was not one truly memorable moment in this movie. I cannot remember a single word, phrase, exchange of dialogue, or turn of event that left a lasting impression. The only positives were Matt Damon's likability and some decent special effects.<br/><br/>For one thing how can this premise be taken ass even remotely plausible? Does anyone think that we would send ship to Mars that is vulnerable to a naturally and regularly occurring storm on Mars? And who would design a ship that is docked so perilously? It was standing up like one of those red/white/blue popsicle rocket treats we used to get from the ice cream man as a kid. Or even more than that it looked like a ship from a 1950's era sci-fi movie. C'mon man, this is a new millennium. Make a ship that is supported as it would be supported on Mars. It should be shorter and more stable, not doomed to tip over like shown in the movie. That one scene lost me for the next 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Here are the other things I feel left me wanting with that movie. 1. When the storm struck I didn't know who was left behind. I knew it was the Matt Damon character but I didn't ""know"" him, meaning I had no emotional investment in that character. 2. He was a botanist, how convenient. His character didn't have to transform or change in any way in order to survive; he was the perfect guy to be left behind. 3. And just why were the potatoes going to run out??? They said you have 400 and something days, but never said why. Was it because there were other vital nutrients that would be lacking at that point? 4. If you give me 2 years to figure out how to solve a problem that means my survival, and there's nothing else to do but figure it out, I bet I'l find something too. The dates before his food was going to run out were so far out that I never felt a sense of urgency. You can call Mars ""The Monster"" but it wasn't pursuing the main character, just waiting for him to run out of food. How boring is that??? 5. When was the last time we saw nobody but good guys in a movie? There was nobody to blame, no bad guys anywhere. That was just plain weak. A bad guys doesn't have to be a bad person, just a person who either has too much fear or fears the wrong thing, which causes him/her to make poor choices. Nobody served as a villain in any way. I know from playing sports and working in small and large companies that there's always a person who feels like the bad guy, even unintentionally. This movie, with it's little slice of heaven, was absurd to say the least.<br/><br/>For these reasons and other minor reasons I was totally disappointed. My wife liked it and I couldn't understand why. This was the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. I really wanted to like ti but was terribly disappointed."

Maybe that one is on me for being so cynical, I am not sure. The attempts at humor never made me laugh and sometimes made me feel embarrassed.<br/><br/>I am not saying that it is a bad movie.

","Really IMDb? An 8.2 rating, for this piece of crap? <br/><br/>Reviewer DavidC-29 put it best when he wrote; ""This movie can be summed up with one word... vapid. As if Matt Damon's inherently vapid acting weren't bad enough, the makers of this film were so overtly focused on presenting an idyllic reality where no character behaves in any offensive way, to anybody, they produced an un-suspenseful, uninteresting, boring, vapid turd of a story. They fall over themselves to be so certain that no minority demographic is stereotyped that all characters have the sane vapid personality. And in what seems to be some sort of perverse effort to recompense reality, a very transparent hierarchy is followed to be certain that: the Black people are the most clever; the Hispanic people are next most clever; the Asian people are next most clever(carefully not portrayed as exceptionally smart), and of course the women are more clever than the men. Of course the only flawed demographic were older white male authority figures. To me this liberal, philosophical portrayal of what an ideal reality is reveals that they are the true bigots, the haters. They hate the differences that make people interesting. Ethnicity, femininity / masculinity, and their different traits should be loved and celebrated, not shamed, muted, or eliminated. It is the interaction of those differences that create an interesting story, not a vapid one.""<br/><br/>When you go to a movie or turn on your TV, you think you're being entertained, but in reality you are being PROGRAMMED! Why do you think they call it ""television programming""... <br/><br/>I would also like to point out one other angle of the propaganda in this movie... Like when the communist Chinese offer the assistance of their top-secret rocket in an effort to save one lone American. Also the way they made the crew be from multiple countries... I know NASA really does work with astronauts from other nations, but I also know that this is one reason why Hollywood loves these space movies, because it's a great vehicle for pushing globalist propaganda. Independence Day 2 is sure to take the globalist propaganda to the next level, as a planet united under the leadership of the UN (which is sick and laughable) must fight for their survival against aliens (which don't really exist)... The not so funny thing, is that the REAL greatest threat to humanity as we know it, ARE THOSE THAT PUSH THE GLOBALIST AGENDA! Check the ""GEORGIA GUIDESTONES"" for proof of that... Billionaires like Bill Gates and Ted Turner are working day and night, doing all they can to ensure that your family tree will stop bearing fruit as soon as possible. Ted Turner says lower global population by 85%, yet he has 5 children and 14 grandchildren... Why not sterilize your children and grandchildren TED? ""Save the planet"" TED! Or how about the big ""climate conference"" last month in Paris...?... Supposedly the planet is about to boil over (LIE) because people drive too much, or fly too much, or eat too much meat, so it was critical that all the world leaders meet in Paris to discuss a solution... Unfortunately the politicians, billionaires, and all their massive entourages were all forced to fly on lavish private jets, be driven to and from in massive convoys of armour-plated SUVs, and they were made to gorge themselves on 5-star cuisine... Why cant we come up with a way where we could have meetings like this, without having to ""destroy our planet by burning these evil fossil fuels""? If only the technology existed which allowed numerous people in different locations to all have a conversation with each other at the same time... I mean I'm sure if such a technology did exist, ""our leaders"" would surely utilize such a technology, because NOBODY TAKES THE THREAT OF ""CLIMATE CHANGE"" MORE SERIOUS THAN THEM! Lol........<br/><br/>Wake up people... Every person on the planet could fit into a landmass the size of Texas, and we'd still all have enough room for everybody to have both a front and back yard... They are sterilizing us generationally as we speak... They have contaminated our food and water supply with GMO's... They know that all animals fed the GMO corn were sterile by the 3rd or 4th generation of animals who ate the corn... Many other rabbits/gerbils/rats/etc that were fed the GMO food developed large tumors and died from said tumors... You think Bill Gates and Ted Turner eat the GMO food? Hell no! That's for us, the peasants/slaves..."

","This movie was made by the director of Blade Runner and Alien, two works of art, but that was many years ago, back when Mr Scott still had some creativity left. After making this movie Ridley Scott should go into a nursing home and hide. What a piece of crap!! Matt Damon growing potatoes on Mars? Acting? There is no acting! Stay home and watch Blade Runner one more time..:) And the music... Disco all the way!! With David Bowie - Life On Mars? That's when you should close your eyes and get lost in the music, but unfortunately they don't play the entire song! Then there is ABBA, and we all like ABBA... :) NASA is desperately trying to survive and needs a new ""project"" and Mars is it. They always ""forget"" to mention to the general public that the atmosphere of Mars is about 100 times thinner than Earth's, and it is 95 percent carbon dioxide. Is much colder also. The average temperature is about minus 80F. So, if there is water on that planet I would not drink it...:) Going back to the real world...If you like sci-fi I recommend Ex Machina or Luci, if you want to have some fun."
"howard.schumann","6","38","81","15 November 2015"," No character development or introspection
","For all the excitement, awe, and energy that are worked up in Ridley Scott's The Martian, the story might just as well have taken place in New York's Central Park with the hero stuck up in a tree. Instead of the sense of mystery and wonder (and terror) that could be expected from being stranded on a different world, what we have are buckets full of the down-to-earth (or up-to-Mars), nitty-gritty practicalities of science and a predictable plot that leaves no room for character development or introspection. In the story, written by Drew Goddard and based on the 2011 novel by Andy Weir, science is the redeemed and the redeemer, the hero and the heroine, the beginning and the end.<br/><br/>Shot in 3-D, the film's fictional aspect is established almost immediately when we find out that NASA is actually engaged in space exploration rather than tallying up its budget deficit. Though we are not told the purpose of the Ares III manned mission to Mars, we know soon enough that the crew is forced to abandon their plans when they discover that a huge life-threatening sandstorm is fast approaching. Like Home Alone, the crew takes off for home but - wait a minute - they forgot Kevin. In this case, Kevin is fellow crew member Mark Watney, played with excruciating blandness by Matt Damon. Watney, presumed to be dead after the storm strikes, turns the tables on the departed crew and decides to stay alive, though according to his best judgment, his reprieve will only be temporary.<br/><br/>Watney must use his ingenuity and skills as a Botanist to solve his food problems to stay alive, but that is not his only concern. He has no way to communicate with Earth, knows that the next planned Mars mission will not be for four years, and that the landing spot on Mars is 3,200 kilometers away. As Watney explains in his video diaries, to survive he is going to have to ""science the s..t out of this."" He first makes changes to the Rover, his only vehicle, to allow for longer trips and then sets about growing potatoes in an artificial environment. Whether he likes potatoes or not, they are now his only source of nourishment and means of survival. The subject of embarrassingly phony eulogies back on Earth, NASA is shocked when satellite photos of Mars reveal that Watney has defied the odds and is still alive.<br/><br/>The crew returning home on the Hermes spacecraft are not informed, however, to avoid distracting them from their flight - a decision made by NASA director Terry Sanders, played by a miscast Jeff Daniels. When Sanders, marketing chief Annie (Kristen Wiig) and NASA mission director Vincent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) find out that Mark is alive, they must find a way to ""Bring Him Home"" or else the film's promotional department will get very upset. Eventually, Watney finds a way to talk to NASA by using communications devices from the Pathfinder probe, dormant since 1997, but the film provides little insight into Watney's character and he seems to be emotionally unaffected by his plight, telling lame jokes as if he was planting potatoes in his back yard.<br/><br/>The more interesting story takes place at Houston's Johnson Space Center where plans are underway to send a probe to Mars to resupply Watney so he can last another several years on the planet, then return to the spacecraft carrying colleagues Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean), Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan) and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). After the launch ends up in disaster, help arrives via the Chinese space program and the Ares III crew itself must now make a crucial decision that has life or death consequences. The Martian has some fine technical achievements including breathtaking vistas of the Martian landscape by cinematographer Dariusz Wolsky and it is an entertaining film, yet all its achievements are subsumed in an atmosphere as exciting as a how-to-manual.<br/><br/>Disco music left behind by Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) such as songs by David Bowie and Gloria Gaynor, attempt to enhance the film's entertainment quotient and appeal to younger viewers but they only serve to distract viewers from whatever reality the story has. To its credit, The Martian has a humane message empowered by the enormity of the cooperation required to attempt to save the life of one man and it reminds us of the days when we all had a common purpose, yet the film lacks conviction and never moves past banal dialogue such as ""YES"", ""let's do it,"" and all the standard clichés of triumphalism. While Damon may have scienced the s..t out of his predicament, the film has also succeeded in sciencing the beauty out of it."

However there is a total lack of emotions and suspense and it is hard to understand the hype around this film.

"callanvass","6","27","55","15 January 2016"," I wasn't overly fussy about it to be honest...
","(Credit IMDb)<br/><br/>During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.<br/><br/>The Martian was a major disappointment for me. Mars looks fantastic and everything looks great, but I wasn't able to ever fully get into it like I wanted to. It never felt like Matt Damon was in any true danger to me despite how it was presented otherwise. It tries way too hard to be epic and that's one of the reason it fails. I also felt it lacked suspense. One thing Gravity did well was deliver suspense, but The Martian doesn't. This surprised me a lot because Ridley Scott is a master at suspense. Even though I didn't really go nuts over this movie like a lot of people did, Matt Damon is fantastic. He holds the film together with his excellent performance. I can't really say the same for the rest. Everybody else isn't developed that well. Jessica Chastain is a very capable actress, but she isn't given much to do as I'd hoped. Wiig, Daniels, Bean, Mara, Ejiofor all do fine in the roles they are given. Ejiofor and Mara shine the most out of the people I listed<br/><br/>This movie has its moments, but I was very disappointed overall. It looks great, Damon is superb, but I wasn't in love with it like so many others. Hopefully I'm not alone <br/><br/>6/10"
"littleging12","5","23","46","4 November 2015"," Saving Private Watney
","The Martian features an a-list cast with acclaimed director Ridley Scott at the helm. Together they bring Andy Weir's best selling novel of the same name to the big screen. Matt Damon plays overly optimistic Mark Watney who unfortunately gets stranded on Mars after a horrific storm leaves him abandoned and presumed dead by his fellow astronauts. As depicted in the trailer, Matt Damon's character is faced with the near impossible predicament of having to survive on Mars with limited food supply while also trying to find a way to contact NASA for a rescue mission. With that in mind one could reasonable expect exciting set pieces with peril at every turn while combining dramatic intensity with clever comic relief. However, The Martian simply failed to live up to these expectations and was mostly a disappointment.<br/><br/>Now what exactly made this so disappointing? Firstly, Matt Damon's character failed to bring any seriousness given his situation of inevitable doom. His character seemed so upbeat which did add to the comedic effect of the film but it was just so overdone it took away from the movie being dramatic and intense. Though Matt Damon did a good job portraying his character, the overly gleeful Watney just simply was not the right fit to make this movie dramatic. All of this added up to the film being so unrealistically upbeat that nothing bad seemed likely to happen to Watney's life resulting in the climax of the movie to be unexciting and quite predictable. Also it took away from the empathy one should feel for the character. So if anything unexpected did happen one would not really care about Watney's fate.<br/><br/>The Martian failed at trying to skillfully blend comedy with an exciting survival story. Also the movie lacked excitement. There really were no memorable scenes given the film's location and dangerous landscape. The film solely relied on how Watney was going to survive, how he was going to contact earth, and how earth would respond to his situation. Honestly all these events portrayed looked exciting in the trailer but just ended up being tedious and uneventful.<br/><br/>Now what exactly did The Martian do right? One of the positives of the movie was its intellect. The intellect behind the writing was arguably one of the best parts of this film which helped redeem it a bit. Also, as expected, the film featured some pretty good special effects. It mimicked the realism of space in a very accurate and practical manner. Unfortunately for The Martian, its special effects were overshadowed by the wondering spectacle of Gravity and the sheer beauty of Interstellar. Lastly, given the talent within the cast, the film was destined for great performances, particularly those of Matt Damon, lead through Ridley Scott's masterful direction.<br/><br/>In short, The Martian disappointed through its lack of excitement, intensity, memorable scenes, empathy for the character, and its failed attempt at trying to blend comedy with drama. I would only recommend to scientists, and space nerds who would actually be interested in seeing how someone would survive on a different planet. I would not buy this and it is definitely not a good 3D or IMAX experience. Still waiting for Ridley Scott to make that awesome movie we have not seen in over a decade! 6/10"

","First of all sorry for my English. I haven't read the book and my review is based solely on the movie. There are almost no spoilers in this review. Points of criticism: 1) they didn't manage to show the time scale of what's happening so that the viewer can feel it. They show numbers like 500 Sol, but you don't feel that this time has really passed. Interstellar shows the effect of long space travels on people souls and minds way better. 2) the results of some rocket launches were really predictable 3) I have a feeling that China is mentioned there only for commercial reasons. Like you have a market of 1.5 billion people and mentioning China would really attract Chinese viewers to movie theaters. 4) weather is too harsh there on Mars:) 5) (cliché) young genius scientist-sociopath who comes up with a solution of a problem 6) the main character basically overcomes a number of random events as in Gravity. Gravity, however, is more dynamic and makes you feel that there is a danger for the main character. In The Martian, basically, the main character does no mistakes, does not take the risk to achieve anything. His success is limited by some random malfunctions, otherwise he knows more or less everything."
"badajoz-1","3","37","82","8 October 2015"," Very very ordinary and boring for long stretches
","Someone came up with the idea in Hollywood that the hopeless position of 'Apollo 13' could be crossed with the CGI/techniques of 'Gravity.' And as the story is not true we can really go to town on the jeopardy elements in space as well as on Mars. Hence we have someone left behind on the red planet with little hope of rescue, trying desperately to think of ways of staying alive - Daniel Defoe - does he still get royalties for rip offs of 'Robinson Crusoe?' For most of the time it all seems comparatively easy, and you do not believe for one minute that we are anywhere but in the desert on Earth, even Wadi Rum from 'Lawrence of Arabia.' Atmosphere is the same!!!! Work is just a matter of humping a few things, and trouble can all be fixed with white tape!!!! The middle of this film is awfully boring and totally uninteresting - drama having to be provided by painful expressions of disbelief and horror at the predicament of Matt Damon (the stranded astronaut) by Edifor and Wiig that does not really convince. Action in the last third is pure Hollywood - let's space walk without a safety rope, and we can cut our spacesuit to use pas propulsion! For most of the film you are looking and feeling with Matt Damon (not a lot as he is given little to work on), but just in case you did not get his predicament, there is a totally redundant speech by him on what he faced as the final scene! But worst of all, there is a hole in the plot so large it undermines the rickety edifice of a superficial movie completely. They leave Matt Damon because of a storm on Mars which threatens to topple the MAV (escape rocket back to orbit), and it would have done if they had not left. Guess how Matt Damon escapes the red planet? Another MAV has been sent early for a later mission and is sitting upright untouched some thousands of kilometres across the surface! Oh, really, come on Mr Scott and Hollywood that is cheating your audience. Acting is basic and perfunctory. Direction just a red shaded desert scene with endless vistas. Script needed heavy doctoring - forget the jokes, they are mere pleasantries! Overall another over-hyped film that is pretty empty and ordinary."

When is somebody going to give Mars a truly grandiose sci-fi treatment? How would Kubrick have handled this subject? So much of the suspense and pacing of the book is totally missing from this movie. Even at over two hours the events of the film just doesn't connote the passage of months. Further, it all seems just a little too glib. Our hero doesn't ever seem to be in any peril at all as long as he can ""science the sheet out of this"" he'll get by just fine. Red Green fans will love the somewhat comic use of NASA's super duct tape too. Even if you haven't read the book, in this typically ""Hollywood"" film, we know right from the first frame that our wisecracking group of explorers will never be in any real jeopardy. Even the premise of the entire movie is totally false. Wind speeds on Mars can be high but the atmosphere is so tenuous that it exerts a negligible force. The sand storm depiction is just plain wrong. Yes I know - suspension of belief - even Andrew Weir makes this concession in You Tube presentation.

","As a real Ridley Scott fan, I hate to say this, but the director has lost his spark and talent in recent years. In other words, do you remember ""A Ridley Scott movie"". You can't feel this anymore which is sad for fans like me. The Martian is another disappointment, so if you don't know about the fact that this film was shot by Scott before watching the film, you cannot understand until the end credits. As for the problem of the movie, the movie is not ""Cast Away on space"". I wish it was, but it is not. Why? Because there is no suspense, no mystery and no horror. The film ignores the psychological nature of the character and he doesn't face with any real challenge or trouble. Do you remember? When After Earth was released, it was mostly criticized for not being ""too dangerous"". The Martian is much worse. You cannot feel the danger, so does character! Because there is no real danger in the film. The main character behaves like John McClane at times, but he is not John McClane though. I mean a witty John McClane perfectly fits Die Hard franchise, but here it doesn't work. Most of the time, our man alone is ""happy"". And this ""happy"" mood defines the tone of the film. I would even prefer Red Planet over The Martian, because despite Red Planet was just a passable popcorn flick, it was mysterious, dark, suspenseful and interesting. The story in The Martian is not interesting, because it is not a survival type of a movie! I am a Matt Damon fan, I can watch him peeling potatoes and onion for hours, I am such a fan, but even he was dull here. The Martian is also a talky film, in fact too much talky, but the story needs more visuals than chatting, in other words more silence than words. 3D was just fine except for a few dazzling Mars images. The film reminded me the masterpiece Silent Running and I wish it would have been as great as that movie. The final chapter of the movie becomes lazy, dull and cliché unfortunately and it cannot add something fresh to the story. And do I have to say the film lacks emotion and real entertainment which is weird. Additionally, some supporting characters were supposed to be funny, but actually they are not.

Completely incapable of any emotion whatsoever: no tears, no laughter. All brain and no heart.<br/><br/>I started to feel very uneasy when the crew debated whether to turn around and rescue Damon. Any sign of reluctance? Of conflict? Any feeling at all? Nope; not a peep. Oh, yes, we'd be happy to ""solve this problem."" Evidently, the thought of spending another 2 years in space requires no pondering, no soul- searching; in other words, no sacrifice. And why would it? These are not humans, they are robots.<br/><br/>Oh, sure, we get a shot of the leader making a slight ""moue"" of regret, when she learns that Damon is alive after she left him to die. But does she lose any sleep, any self doubt? Not a bit; it's on to the next ""solution.""<br/><br/>(Maybe she should open a business and call it ""Rescue Solutions."")<br/><br/>I felt emotionally boxed in again when Damon was reunited with his crew. Was there any questioning of motives, signs of team rivalry or sexual tensions? No,no recriminations, no resentment. Instead, it was all about superficial joy at having ""solved"" the problem. And why not; he was never in any real danger, was he? Because he was not really human.<br/><br/>Maybe this is film is for those who like detective stories, solving mysteries and reading riddles.<br/><br/>But, for me, there is nothing of the wonder and mystery of life, nothing of that riddling essence we call humanity."

","Are you kidding me? It's what Matt Damon / Mark Watney asks at a certain point in the movie about NASA's plans to bring him home and it was basically the only moment when me and Watney felt empathythough commenting entirely different matters. I have not read the book, if it's a blatant John Wayne sci-fi take on the ""throw me anything, I am an American cowboy and will laugh in the face of death, finding a brilliant solution to survive"" concept, then brilliant, Ridley Scott totally nailed it. Otherwise the story and dialogs are among the poorest things I have seen lately. It just looks like a NASA-on-steroids advertising striving to convince that ""we can solve anything you throw at us and we'll also be funny and classy doing it"". There are so many positive reviews about this movie here in IMDb and it frightens me. I get it, the movie is visually quite great (but NOTHING in comparison to something like Interstellar, which stands not just higher, but totally on another level), and for sci-fi, space travel nerds like me it's always amazing to see spaceships, spacesuits and realistic attempts to visualize it. But why should the story be so dull?? It makes you think about Ridley Scott with a super size me cigar in his mouth sitting on a human leather couch in a gazillion million dollar house in Hollywood chatting with a bunch of producers saying ""ok, we'll set a bunch of explosions, and the guy will laugh about it and say something funny, then we'll, like, make everything go south, super-south, and he'll find solutions for everything, then we'll throw in the Chinese that help us Americans but we do it better anyway in the end, oh, and let's stick in a young nerdy physicists that nails the perfect solution that not even a Nobel prize would come up with!"". There are way too many clichés in this movie and nothing is innovative left aside the wonderful spacesuits."

I didn't care to see alien conflicts. I didn't care to see mega weaponry. Sure there was some clever resourcefulness but not worthy of a 2 hour movie. <br/><br/>While I am not a big fan of Mark Watney's creativity(he was a knowledgeable scientist doing what scientists do), he was more creative than the creators of this movie.<br/><br/>Seriously, this movie was like going to work and dealing with everyday problems.

","I was not impressed with The Martian especially since Ridley Scott directed it. Matt Damon was excellent but I was not impressed with the rest of the cast. Jeff Daniels seemed like he walked off the set of The Newsroom and stayed in his Will McAvoy character. Jessica Chastain as the captain of the ship was beyond belief as well as Kate Mara as one of the crew members. Kirsten Wiig was also very distracting and ill cast. When making serious decisions, they were too busy smiling and joking around. No way anyone on a 500 day journey would act like this. I guess I was expecting a darker, more foreboding tone to the movie. I never felt that there was any real suspense that a signature Scott movie is known for. I gave it 6 out of 10 stars to be nice. I wouldn't watch it again."
"lawyer24","4","46","108","4 October 2015"," The 4 stars are for the visuals
","I'm a space junkie. I follow the latest news and developments from the Mars Rovers. I follow Voyager I and II on twitter. I also loved the movie Interstellar. In Interstellar, I felt like the science, although unbelievable, was actually believable from a scientific theory perspective. Interstellar was great science. In addition to that great science, was an excellent and heart grabbing storyline and screenplay. And this inter play between heart grabbing story and good science that made Interstellar so powerful, is what the Martian lacked and for a movie focused on one guy, it was sorely needed. <br/><br/>Let me first say that the visuals of mars, outerspace, the inside of the spaceship Hermes in The Martian were amazing. It was truly interesting to see on film what our current understanding says the surface of Mars looks like. The sky looked almost earth like and the terrain was very Arizona desert like. It was cool to watch and think about what it would feel like if you were on Mars. Aesthetically beautiful film. <br/><br/>Now, for the rest of the movie... I could not relate to Matt Damon's character, Mark Watney. Not in the sense that I needed he and I to have a similar background, etc. But in the sense that I didn't see any real human element to Watney. He came off as robotic in his attitude. I get it that he wanted to be upbeat but c'mon Ridley Scott, the guy is alone with his thoughts 24 hours a day for hundreds upon hundreds of days and we can't get a flashback of him thinking about loved ones he left behind on earth, or of him showing mental agony, stress, and sadness.... Just something to let us know that this guy isn't some type of A.I. There is one quick, seemingly thrown in, scene 2 hours into the film where Watney makes a quick mention of some family back on Earth. Other than that, he seems to be a guy who has no loved ones, nobody that personally knows and cares about him except the crew he went to space with. Nor does he seem to have any true feelings for anybody that we know of. He's just a guy who constantly makes sarcastic remarks and acts as if he is starring in a reality show, not someone who is stranded 50 million miles away from Earth alone with his thoughts. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the film. There are no surprises. No real suspense except at the very beginning and at the end and even then you knew what was going to happen. This movie won't make you feel really happy or sad. It won't make you wonder what happens next nor will you really care. It's basically just a documentary about how to survive on Mars if you're an astronaut and your crew leaves you behind. The end.<br/><br/>4 out of 10."

Early in the film Matt takes off his spacesuit and glancing at his inhuman well buffed torso you know every hetrosexual woman on the planet will want to use him as their own personal lick toy if he makes it back to Earth .

""Luckily I'm a botanist so I can grow things"" he states. Wow , how fortunate is that ? Very fortunate I'd say and this type of good fortune reminds you you're watching a contrived story . It does try and bring science fact to the narrative but at the same time when you've got the actor who played Boromir in THE LORD OF THE RINGS explain why the rescue mission is called ""Operation Elrond"" this tends to underline the fact that you're watching a movie <br/><br/>One puzzling thing is that it's picked up several Golden Globe nominations - in the comedy/musical category ? This is ridiculous since the film is in no way a comedy or a musical . Its style is somewhat reminiscent of these films in the 1980s with either a diegetic or non diegetic musical soundtrack blasting away . Anyone consider APOCALYPSE NOW a musical ? I didn't think so . That said I did slightly respect THE MARTIAN more than the rather overrated INTERSTELLAR . It's just that when you compare it the breathtaking achievement of GRAVITY a couple of years ago or the thematically similar THE REVENANT then you'll probably find THE MARTIAN a bit lacklustre in comparison . I also think because of voter politics - Inarritu won best director at the Oscars last year - the Academy Awards might just give Ridley Scott a long overdue Oscar in 2016 , but to be honest he's made better films than this one"

"mrsmithgoes","6","18","37","8 November 2015"," Not very entertaining, and not very exciting
","I'm an engineer, so I enjoy science in my science fiction. But more than that, I most enjoy a science fiction movie that's exciting and entertaining. ""The Martian"" is mostly neither. ""The Martian"" must have been sold to investors as ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" meets ""Gravity"". Ultimately, though, it is not as entertaining as either of those movies, and here's why.<br/><br/>What I really like about ""Gravity"" is that they took an otherwise rather slow-moving and potentially boring space story and turned it into a roller coaster ride. I thought the movie had good pacing and good effects. The film excelled -- was perhaps groundbreaking -- in its look and feel of being in space.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" presents itself as science that could really happen, almost a documentary of this guy's life on Mars. But the story is full of holes -- see many other reviewer comments -- just as ""Gravity"" is -- many pointed these out as well. ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" (1964) is a silly tale, with not much scientific accuracy, yet I found it (still do) to be entertaining -- even endearing.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" comes off as full of itself. Everything is so melodramatic. The writers feel they have to throw dialogue at us to make us understand just how amazing something is that is about to happen or already happened. I do think Matt Damon is a fine actor and does a good job with his role. It's just that the writers and director chose the easy route of letting their actor's ability and the Mars special effects sell the movie. They made an okay movie, but not a very entertaining or great movie.<br/><br/>If it were me, I wouldn't nominate the director or writers for this one. I've always had a fascination with Mars, so for me it was enough just to see the fantastic landscapes revealed in the movie through some nice special effects. Wish there had been more of that and less gratuitous dialogue."

Everything is explained to you like you're an idiot, and even to the NASA officials like they're all interns, rather than rocket scientists who know their stuff. There's a shameless amount of movie-computer sound affects. There are several characters in this movie that are pointless, like Kristen Wiig, who is always trying to keep a straight face through her unnecessary lines. It is almost devoid of tension because problems are solved within seconds of being encountered, often to a blaring disco soundtrack. About 40 minutes in I began to lose interest and wanted to check the reviews of this movie to see if I was the only one disappointed.

","Disappointment - this is what i felt while watching ""The Martian"". I had been waiting for the movie since spring 2015, and i was expected a lot, but as it turned out, i got nothing. There is no atmosphere of solitude, fear for character's life, feeling of happiness when he managed to do something. I consider ""The Martian"" is the fail of the year, because you are waiting for a lot of things but gets nothing.<br/><br/>First the script seems very fascinating. The astronaut appears to be on the deserted planet, because his crew left him by accident and he is fighting for his life with the desolated land of Marc. After reading this, in my mind immediately came presentation of something which could touch the soul, something like Tom Hanks's acting in ""Cast away"". ""The Martian"" obviously loses itself not just compared to the well-known movies about the universe, but also to the movies which demonstrate the loneliness of the person, who stayed alone in the inclosed place. <br/><br/>The scientists who says some foolish things by TV, the another science guy who is making choice between food or his ideas every time, the crew which shows theirs heroism at a very low level, all this will make me not to watch this ""masterpiece"" again.<br/><br/>And just Matt Damon is trying to pull the movie from the abyss. His jokes are very strict, his emotions are deep, but it isn't enough.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Martian"" is the another blockbuster, which pays more attention to the special effects, than to the atmosphere. Definitely i will not watch it twice, the first time was more than enough!"

","Should have been called 'Avatar:The Red Planet Rescue'. It's a blockbuster pop-corn muncher, but could have been a much deeper and more worthy film. I was hoping for a thriller sci-fi but got a saccharin Disney effort.<br/><br/>Personally I like movies that try to teach us life lessons, often despite struggles and hardship. That narrative was all sitting there in the plot and never touched, such a waste. The acting was heavily wooden, Damon probably through poor direction or too time sensitive a plot fails to engage as a fellow human, he's Mr Prefect and well balanced, even surviving alone in a hostile environment.<br/><br/>I'm no scientist, but the whole of the physics and biology seem far too woolly, convenient and unlikely. Even the movement on Mars seems wrong, there is only about a third of the gravity so things should look like the moon with long jumps or certainly less earth-like. Even the Mars rover looks like it is driving in an Earth desert, not really on Mars. There are so many other examples, too many to list, ranging from not very probable to impossible.<br/><br/>-Sigh- another Chinese tie-in. Our Chinese friends in their space administration help, and are portrayed as the good guys. There's nothing really wrong with the premise, but the reason is simply to make more money in Chinese theaters, a tacky corporate gesture and totally unnecessary to the story. This is very ugly cynical marketing, pandering to the lowest level. Why not have an entire Chinese ending then? Mark is rescued by the Chinese and they call the Americans 'shameless' for their abandonment. Mark learns perfect calligraphy, speech-making putonghua that nobody actually uses in real life (as in the movie), how to use chopsticks and cook up a killer sweet and sour pork in the galley on the way home.<br/><br/>The saving graces are the beautifully rendered shots of Mars which were worth the price of admission, and just the idea that could catch everyone's imagination get the ball rolling on a real manned international mission to Mars sooner than later.<br/><br/>I feel that the story could have been split into two or three feature length parts, explaining psychology, science and the day to day difficulties of isolation on much deeper level. It seems for the company that made this the idea of success is to make as much money as possible, not the best film possible."

","This movie is rated highly on IMDb and features Matt Damon in space, so I thought it would be worth a watch. Unfortunately, it wasn't very good. The main problem is that you only rarely feel that the main character is in any real danger. He is pretty upbeat about the whole thing and keeps making trite comments/jokes, such as ""I'm gonna have to science the sh*t out of this"". And when there finally is some crisis, he fixes it very quickly and the suspense is killed again. The use of disco music also adds to the silly atmosphere in the movie.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm not supposed to compare this movie with Gravity and Interstellar, but those two movies are vastly superior in my opinion. They both deliver experiences that makes you hold your breath and feel the danger and harshness of space and foreign planets, whereas The Martian just feels long and boring.<br/><br/>The acting and CGI is fine, for the most part."

","I didn't expect much, and that is perhaps the only aspect of the movie that did not disappoint.<br/><br/>You ever get the feeling from a movie or a series that given the plot - that the setting could be just about anything? This is exactly the case with this movie. It could have been set on an island, on a remote mountain top, in a desert right here on Earth... literally anywhere. There is so little Mars- specific in the plot (or rather focused on the fact that this is another planet... something that should have been much more capitalised on) that the whole survival thing could just as well have been about a guy stuck in a service elevator in an abandoned hotel after his coworkers accidentally shut off the power for the whole building on their way out. As for the rest of the plot-specific action going on... meh. A lot of ""video-diary"" stuff, Matt finds poop to grow potatoes, Matt does something to survive and something happens because of that, Matt tries to keep himself busy with some other nonsense, Matt talks to himself because he's so alone and a bit nuts because of that, Matt does some McGuyver stuff to survive/communicate/whatever... that's just it there is so little excitement about the plot it basically revolves about mundane routine with some halfway-decent slapstick humor every once in a while there is not much to tell. I was almost expecting some serious plot twist/aliens whatever to come crashing in and turn it all around but that never happened. As far as the rest of the characters go some of them over-played and over-exxagerated their roles, while the rest were just stereotypical characters that needed no character building and didn't get any either. The only thing that kinda spiced up the drama was the rescue effort, but again by that time the movie was already as blant as one of those bad dished Gordon Ramsey gets so disgusted with on his show. I don't know what this movie was supposed to be exactly, an experiment with how boring a one- man survival thing can become or something like that, but it didn't even get CLOSE to what a good movie ""cast away"" is. My 2 cents worth of advice just forget about this movie and watch Cast Away."

"room102","5","22","48","21 October 2015"," Roland Emmerich directs SAVING PRIVATE RYAN vs. INTERSTELLAR
","(Contains minor spoilers, nothing that would ruin the movie)<br/><br/>The movie is a joke. It is currently rated 8.3/10 on IMDb, taking #134 at the top 250 - and it's not even funny.<br/><br/>If you expect a sophisticated movie, you're in the wrong place. This movie seems to be written by kids or intended for them. The script is ridiculous, spoon-fed to the audience and repeats everything twice in case they still didn't get it. Every character in this movie is stupid and one-dimensional. It features silly jokes and moronic behavior which you haven't seen astronauts do since PROMETHEUS.<br/><br/>This movie wants you to believe that an astronaut left alone on Mars finds out by himself time after time ways to keep alive. It wants you to believe that astronauts were sent to a mission to Mars without taking into consideration that something could go wrong, they didn't think of ways to grow food or survive on Mars and didn't train the astronauts or gave them basic instructions book for a case of emergency. They simply left it to the astronauts to figure it out by themselves in a case of emergency. And voilà - when something like that happens, one astronaut invents endless ways to survive - something that all of NASA's scientists didn't think of before. This guy should have made billions in making his own startups.<br/><br/>In MOON - one of the best movies in recent years - they put a computer so that the main character is kept isolated from society but has someone/something to talk to, thus sharing his thoughts and feelings for the viewer.<br/><br/>In THE MARTIAN, on the other hand, the character simply talks to himself. Yes, most of the time he talks to the camera, but not always. When he does, he talks as if he were explaining stuff to a 6-year old. I expect an astronaut to leave behind a vlog intended for his peers, who should know a thing or two when coordinating a multi-billion mission into Mars. I don't expect him to talk like he's explaining this to his kid.<br/><br/>Characters don't only think like kids, act and explain like kids, but they also make their own decisions - again and again - like this multi- billion mission was their own private game. From taking over a space vehicle, through sending hidden messages against the commander's decision, to sharing country secrets. This is beyond ridiculous. This is straight B-movie material.<br/><br/>Just like in INTERSTELLAR, Jessica Chastain again has to save Matt Damon who was left alone on a far away planet. There's nothing much I can add to that.<br/><br/>I simply refuse to believe this movie was directed by the same guy who directed ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER. This is 100% a Roland Emmerich job. From the poorly directed acting and script, to the ridiculous crowd scenes at the end. This is pure Emmerich. If tomorrow the studio would publish that they pranked us and used Ridley Scott's name, but actually Emmerich is the one who directed this film, I wouldn't be surprised at all.<br/><br/>I said it several times before and I'll say it again: Jessica Chastain and Kate Mara simply can't act. They are awful actresses and should only appear in B-movies. Chastain's acting makes it impossible for you to believe, even for one minute, that she's the team's captain. She acts like a girl on a field trip. And Kate Mara is Kate Mara, no need to add anything to that.<br/><br/>As for the visuals, which got such praising reviews - well, they are OK. Nothing astounding, definitely not after we've seen GRAVITY. There are some nice zero-gravity shots, but frequently it seemed to me like wire work and the movement wasn't nearly as clean and natural as what we've seen in Gravity. Same goes for the movement in space (both in the ship and outside) - frequently it seemed to ignore the laws of physics.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is pretty good in his role, but the silly script and direction ruin that too.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a big disappointment.

","The Martian was on my most anticipated list of 2015 and I am so happy to report that this is easily one of the best films of 2015. The premise of the film sees astronaut mark watney stranded on Mars after his crew think he is dead, he has to survive and try to find a way off Mars. Meanwhile, NASA and his crew are trying to find a way to save him. Now matt Damon is an underrated actor in my opinion and he was amazing in this film with one of the best performances of the year. You are rooting for mark watney and you really want to see him survive this ordeal. He was a really funny character as well and delivered a great dramatic performance that could see him get an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is also top quality, chiwetel ejiofor us one of the people on earth trying to save watney and he is great in the role. Michael Peña provided a lot of great humour to the film and was great. Jessica chastain was great, Jeff Daniels was great and Sean bean was especially great. The story is pretty simple but it is so cool seeing Damon trying to survive on Mars and how he uses all his skills to try and make it work. I also loved the relationship he had with his crew even though there barely on screen together. And the NASA stuff on earth was all fascinating to me as you see a group of people try to do good. The script was surprisingly brilliant, there was allot more humour then I expected and it all worked in this film. But also there was a great dramatic quality to this film as there should be. The style is phenomenal, Mars has never looked better and i was blown away by the cinematography of this desolate planet. I also loved the use of suit cams and video logs as a fresh unique way of filming. Overall this film is easily one of my favourites of 2015 and is an absolute must see."
"Turfseer","5","17","36","7 October 2015"," Slow-moving but informative tale of beleaguered astronaut on Mars is undermined by lack of suspense back on earth
","After taking in the most entertaining ""Gravity"" in 2013, I was looking forward to comparing it with ""The Martian,"" which is similar in theme. Both Matt Damon and Sandra Bullock play astronauts, who as a result of a disaster, are forced to save themselves from certain death in the vast expanse of outer space. Gravity, unlike the bloated Martian, has a more than workmanlike plot that occurs in real time—the ticking clock forces us to view Dr. Ryan Stone as she battles one setback after another, placing the viewer on the edge of one's seat throughout the heart- pounding narrative. The Martian, in contrast, chronicles Mark Watney as he devises various stratagems for survival over a much longer period of time. Thus by the very nature of this most different, much slower-moving tale (based on a novel and not on an original screenplay, as is the case with Gravity), The Martian, is only mildly entertaining, more for its ""educational platform"" than a scenario involving death-defying life-and- death maneuvers. <br/><br/>Thus the first third of The Martian manages to be fairly compelling as we follow Watney in his initial stab at survival after the Martian storm separates him from his Ares III comrades and strands him on the virtually barren red planet, with no expectation of rescue for another four years based on NASA's projected schedule. <br/><br/>Watney, brilliant botanist scientist that he is, devises a way to create a water supply from human waste and grow potatoes in a makeshift greenhouse. As the first half of Act 2 slugs along, there's more enormously clever stuff in store as Watney extends the battery life of his Rover and journeys for days, eventually locating an early Pathfinder probe buried in the sand. Watney reconfigures the Pathfinder which enables him to communicate with NASA. One of the film's thrilling moments occurs when mission control realizes Watney is still alive and eventually devises a way to communicate with him.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, The Martian loses steam in the second half, after the focus shifts from Watney to NASA in their attempt to rescue him. We see this in high relief at the midpoint when a breach in the crew's Hab's airlock ruins Watney's potato crop and NASA is forced to send an unmanned probe full of supplies which blows up upon liftoff. This might sound exciting but it takes so much time for everyone on the ground to make this happen that the launch (reminiscent of the Challenger disasters), proves anti-climactic. <br/><br/>There's a brief aside involving an offer from the China National Space Administration to send one of their secret probes to resupply Watney. The inclusion of a Chinese benevolent offer undoubtedly was inserted by the film's scenarists to perhaps promote better Chinese-American relations, but in reality it does little to heighten the suspense surrounding Watney. Ultimately the Chinese probe proves to be a time waster for both viewer and plot: its lack of practicality becomes obvious when it's postulated there's no way to control the speed of the ship when it enters the Martian atmosphere.<br/><br/>The Martian almost grinds to a complete halt before the big climax when a coterie of geeks and NASA personnel are intent on explaining how the story ends before it actually does. A geeky astrodynamicist, Purnell, comes up with the idea of a ""slingshot trajectory"" which will lengthen the Hermes mission by first hooking up with the Chinese resupply ship and then making a beeline back to Mars where they'll somehow ""catch"" Watney in a module stripped of its top portion, covered only by a tarp. The tension of Watney's quest for survival is replaced by a tale of NASA infighting—the chief honcho nixes the idea of a Hermes reboot, but his assistant emails Purnell's risky maneuver to the crew who of course go against orders and decide to save Watney anyway. The big climax is once again outlined before it happens by the Aeres captain, who illustrates to the crew what's supposed to happen utilizing a set of salt and pepper shakers!<br/><br/>Even though we finally get back to Watney, his trip in the reconfigured rover for a rendezvous with his getaway rocket is again somewhat anti-climactic, replete with clichéd orchestral music and wide shots highlighting the aforementioned barren Martian landscape. <br/><br/>Finally Watney's rescue is exciting enough, but one cannot help but feel that we should have gotten to it a lot sooner (whatever happened to the old cinematic axiom, show don't tell?). One also can't help but feel that Damon's successful rescue is quite reminiscent of Bullock's maneuvers in Gravity. But Bullock's turn in outer space just seems to be a lot more exciting and well choreographed, than Damon's!<br/><br/>The Martian also suffers from a lack of multi-dimensionality in its characters. No one except Damon really stands out. Damon, on the other hand, shines--particularly in his scenes where he details his machinations on the Red Planet in his trusty video diary. Those videos make Damon's Watney come alive and saves the film from the second half chronicle of mediocre doings on earth.<br/><br/>The Martian is by no means a terribly bad film, and I understand that director Scott was determined to create some kind of paean to man's ingenuity and self-survival. Nonetheless, the unabashed jingoism in his misplaced salute to NASA and the US space program in general, leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. With all the poverty and suffering going on in the world today, isn't the space program, with its hopeless quest to find extraterrestrial life in the universe, nothing more than a terribly misguided canard? Ridley is one of those guys who still believes in ""The Idea of Progress,"" that emerged from the Enlightenment in the 18th century. Better to have consulted the Biblical admonition found in Ecclesiastes: ""There is nothing new under the sun."""
"Snowgoat","4","15","31","8 October 2015"," Lavish based-on-real-events TV-Movie about something that didn't happen.
","I found watching this film a very underwhelming and slightly bizarre experience. It seems to have almost invented a new genre – but one that feel to me utterly pointless. The Martian is basically a factual/historical drama – about something that never actually happened. The style, pacing and storytelling is exactly like Apollo 13 (and I mean exactly) – and fairly familiar to other based-on- real-events films like the recent Everest. But the obvious fact that none of this stuff actually ever took place just seemed to suck any interest right out of me. <br/><br/>Now, clearly, in most films the events never actually took place, but typically fiction usually presents us with interesting dramatic or philosophical questions – none of which are present in The Martian. You could compare it to Contact – which kind of used the same fake-factual/historical drama style, but Contact posed big questions – and took us to places we could never really go and so was interesting. The Martian was so close to life without being more remarkable than life that it just felt dull. I'm sure a lot of people would compare it to Gravity – but they just don't feel much alike to me. Gravity was basically a thriller – and a real cinematic experience But the The Martian feels more like a lavish TV movie which has absolutely nothing of interest to say, show, or make you feel. The film and 3D looks pretty good, but the visuals aren't exactly stunning. Meanwhile, there is almost zero character development in this film. We know literally nothing more about the protagonist, or any of the other characters, at the end of the film than we did at the beginning. <br/><br/>As in Apollo 13, most of the dramatic interest is supposed to come from the characters trying to work out solutions to problems of how to keep the protagonist alive and get him home. But since none of this actually happened and the solutions can effectively be dreamt up out of thin air they lack any real interest in watching at all. I haven't read the book, but can imagine that perhaps the problem solving aspect came across better in print, since I imagine the writer tried to come up with practical/plausible solutions to the idea of being trapped on Mars and work the problems through in detail. But on film the solutions all just feels contrived and redundant."

Apparently they all went to NASA. If I was stranded on Mars I'd be making all kinds of deals with G_d. They were afraid to Disney-ize the movie, so they took Castaway and improved it, but with no real oomf. Consequently the movie comes up as cold as the potatoes after the HAB blowout. But what else should we expect from Matt Damon? Isn't his cold detachment what made Bourne so believable?<br/><br/>The Chinese angle was funny too, because at one point the media coverage describes the joint effort as the rebirth of the American Space program, which we know was saved by the generosity of the Chinese. I'm not sure if this was intentional or an oversight, but it seems like a loose end.<br/><br/>I did like this better than Gravity, which should have negative stars for a rating, but this is no where near Interstellar. Seems like Hollywood is having trouble coming up with good space movies while the visual side of the business is fantastic. <br/><br/>Maybe Hollywood should forget the Human Robots like Matt Damon and just use real robots or Androids?

It's like they went out of their way to avoid white males in the technical roles.<br/><br/>The one bit of skin (naked butt) and few uses of curse words (most heard on cable already) are both unneeded.<br/><br/>There's virtually no character emotional development.

Don't get me wrong as a film It has its unrealistic scenes like the storm on mars (Just read that that's not possible to happen on Mars) but still it is a movie it's not a documentary!

","RE: a friend calling The Martian a veritable, American masterpiece. <br/><br/>What about the false ease concerning mathematical and scientific computation? That scene when boss man tells JPL they have half the time they thought they would and then goes into a comedic exposition about how he'll say it can't be done but then he will—it was funny but not true to the difficulty of engineering, I thought. You don't see the man hours either. It's stupidly dumbed down for the audience and while that may drain its mass popularity, it's the selling point of the film and book. I was excited for a true engineering movie but what I got was a word bank of engineering jargon spewed at me and then some problem fixed *snap*.<br/><br/>Or how there's no sense of isolation? Even before he makes contact, we get shots from his camera over his shoulder, and it's like someone's watching him. Oh, and he's always talking to the video diary, us. No one is with him but the switching between scenes on Earth and Mars make Mars less distant. Moreover, Ridley doesn't explore the mental psychosis of a man ""stuck out there. He thinks he's totally alone and that we all gave up on him. What kind of effect does that have on a man's psychology? I wonder what he's thinking right now."" Yes, he mentions it but he doesn't expand on it. And what about this unexplored gem, ""Everywhere I go, I'm the first. Step outside the rover? First guy ever to be there! Climb a hill? First guy to climb that hill! Kick a rock? That rock hadn't moved in a million years! I'm the first guy to drive long-distance on Mars. The first guy to spend more than thirty-one sols on Mars. The first guy to grow crops on Mars."" Did you get any sense of wonder or exploration?!? I did not.<br/><br/>Or lack of stakes? To its credit, the night he walks back into the base after patching the door with a tarp is tensing but did you ever actually feel as though the mission was going to fail? Pardon my meanness, but what is Matt Damon's character even living for? No love interest or children and a ""thankfulness"" towards his parents. I'm not saying his life, or any character without ""love"", is meaningless but they are lacking in emotion. Had he at the very least rattled off a bucket list, I would have felt more emotionally involved. Matt Damon did an exceptional job of squeezing every ounce of emotion to make us empathize with him because the character just isn't emotionally interesting.<br/><br/>And by god, another slight at ABBA and I'll kill someone. They made that stupid joke 10 times, the first time it landed but that was it. It had it's laughs, ie space pirate and colonizer of Mars, but at the same time, it wasn't hilarious. Just go through some quotes from the book (https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/21825181-the- martian) and look at all the missed opportunities. <br/><br/>What I will give The Martian is an appreciation for what astronauts and the like accomplish. I actually liked that China gave NASA their technology, that action did a nice job of highlighting the universal interest in science and not political agendas. Then there are two good scenes I must nod to: when Matt Damon's character decides to shave his beard before being reacquainted with his team, a nod of the human need to be presentable in society, and visually, the belt/ ribbon tangle near the end. Big fan of the set designs as well, especially the base on Mars and Ares 3 but are tragically... unexplored.<br/><br/>Overall, a 2/5, simple, feel good movie with a lot of unexplored, interesting ideas."

","The Martian is a 2015 science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and stars Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Jeff Daniels. Set in 2036, The Martian centres on the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut presumed dead and abandoned on Mars after a violent storm separates him from his crew, forcing him to survive for up to four years on the surface of Mars with limited food rations and contact to Earth. The Martian certainly shines throughout and delivers a fun, intriguing and at times extremely tense sci-fi adventure, with many thought provoking ideas and scenarios presented throughout. It is also visually stunning and features perfect accompanying scores. However, my flaws with the film are mainly with the 'attempted comedy' dialogue. Far too often many characters were cracking jokes in life or death situations, destroying the tension and ruining the experience slightly. On more than one occasion the script came off as silly, childish and cringeworthy. I also felt there wasn't enough varying personality within the characters, with the exception of Sean Bean's performance, again this may hinder on the script as some of them come off as 'failed comedians' rather than top scientific astronomers. The Martian is still however superbly acted and following Damon's journey and the obstacles to he had to overcome was exciting and engaging. Overall, The Martian is a great sci-fi film with gorgeous visuals and special effects, brilliant, well-fitting scores and an engaging interesting plot with unique and revolutionary ideas. 8/10"

","The poster for Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi masterpiece Alien told us that in space, no-one can hear you scream. 36 years later, and it would seem that no-one can hear you colonising a planet in a desperate effort to stay alive either. Scott's latest, which has recently invited controversy due to its ridiculous Golden Globe victory in the 'Musical or Comedy' category, takes a refreshingly optimistic view of one man's struggle when left stranded on Mars with only his wits and a never-ending list of obstacles to overcome to keep him from losing his sanity. After the let-down of Scott's recent return to the sci-fi genre with Prometheus, The Martian has the director firmly back in form.<br/><br/>In 2035, the crew of the Ares III, commanded by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), are exploring the surface of Mars when a violent dust storm forces them to flee. Botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris and when his space suit reports a breach and no sign of life, the remaining crew reluctantly escape presuming Mark to be dead. When he awakes hours later with an antenna protruding from his stomach and his oxygen levels dangerously low, he makes his way back to the living quarters and quickly sets about calculating how long he can survive on what he has. Discovering he only has about a month left, he ""sciences the s**t"" out of whatever he can salvage and successfully starts growing food.<br/><br/>As ludicrous as The Martian's inclusion in the Musical or Comedy category was, the film is still very funny. In one of many efforts to hold on to his sanity, Mark talks to himself while recording a log of his actions, revealing a laid-back and sardonic sense of humour which seems to come naturally to the actor. With little in the way of explosive set-pieces, The Martian opts to be subtly engaging as opposed to outright exciting. Mark's can-do attitude gives a stubborn optimism to the movie's outlook, and with comments such as ""f**k you, Mars"" following one particularly hard-earned achievement, it's hard not to cheer him along. <br/><br/>Also absent are any suggestions of puffy-chested patriotism or evil- doing among the people back on Earth trying to bring Mark home. The only person resembling a 'baddie' who mission director Vincent Karpoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) clashes heads with is NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), but even he retains his humanity throughout. If there is a criticism to be had, it's that Mark never feels truly in danger in such an inhospitable landscape. But The Martian takes care to lay out and explain all the science-y stuff going on with clarity and without heavy exposition, and although I wouldn't have a clue if what they were saying was nonsense or mathematically correct, you have to marvel at the detail. A smart and unexpectedly joyous space survival movie, with what is undoubtedly Damon's finest performance to date."

","If the latest movies didn't reach the expectations, The Martian comes to solidified Ridley Scott's genius. The film is breathtaking, the tension will surely keep you on the edge of your seat. Ridley Scott is well known for being a master in set design and in The Martian, he did not disappoint. To distinguish the ones which graphical computing are used from those that are real settings is challenging. The scenarios are outstanding and the level of details is impressive, making them quite immersive and leading you to believe that they actually filmed in those places. To ease the burden brought by the solitude of the astronaut, the synergy between the soundtrack and a very clever sense of humor make the scenes much more amusing. Throughout the movie, there is a good distribution among the most tense scenes that are visually fantastic and the others which are responsible for the development of the characters and this is something that leaves no wish unfulfilled as we have the opportunity to really get to know the personalities of each individual. Despite significant changes, The Martian is based on a book by Andy Wier and an aspect that is very similar is the constant use of a more scientific language. This feature does not make the movie hard to understand, quite the opposite, makes it more realistic and believable. Many of these explanations Mark Watney himself does, in order to keep a record of his journey on Mars. By doing so, there's the impression that he speaks directly to the audience and using a more friendly and humorous tone, these explanations don't become too didactic or boring.<br/><br/>The entire cast does an extraordinary job. The actors and actresses responsible for both astronauts on the spacecraft as NASA scientists play their roles marvelously. From the work done in the creation and development of these characters, the cast manages to build them in a way which makes it easy to find them more interesting and convincing. But the one who I have to take my hat off is Matt Damon playing Mark Watney. Matt Damon delivers one of his finest roles of his career. With his charisma and talent, he is able to hold the screen and makes Mark Watney a character that gains the audience sympathy very quickly much due the combination of his nerd, lively and comic sides that pulls the character to a spot much more closer from the public. Reading the synopsis of the movie, it is assumed that due to solitude, the film would have a more depressing tone. On the contrary, much due to the optimism and sense of humor of Mark Watney the loneliness is far less depressing. Of course there are moments when the situation gets worse and he almost gets at the edge of losing hope and accept his fatal destiny, but his perseverance makes him keep fighting for."

","Every good story has 3 major components: A beginning, a duration and an end, somethings many Hollywood writers are afraid to do anymore.

However, the public speaks, and box offices like making money.<br/><br/>This being said, The Martian certainly seems to please most people, even the critical. I don't think I'd be spoiling anything by saying the plot of the movie is about an astronaut left for dead as the crew evacuates from the planet surface of Mars only to find out the crew member didn't die. You have the story from a bureaucratic side, a scientific side, a social media side and engineering side all interwoven around the subject's story; the guy they left behind.<br/><br/>I personally don't think many people outside the enthusiast would know the difference between Mars and Wadi Rum in Jordan where the principal filming took place, and seeing even my understanding of the terrain is limited it was quite convincing. You get comfortable with the associations pretty quickly when you add all the environmental supplements that add to location that dispel the earth atmospheric conditions. I think most people have accepted the way Hollywood deals with space and give it a great deal of flexibility, so space travel is somewhat forgiving, but mixing the tech that got the various crafts into the air and the ship its self ""Hermes"" (Check your Greek mythology – very appropriate name) builds this story into one congruous epic. Obviously, the whole story revolves around Mark Whatney, a botanist who is left for dead and between his skills and ego are able to survive the elements until he is rescued. One of the nicer things about the story is that unlike other Ridley films, is that it isn't one emergency after another. The strong point to the screen play is that it breathes so well when mixed with the various sub-stories that the movie never gets tedious or overly long.<br/><br/>Using the word ""Mix"" is a very appropriate term to describe this epic scifi movie. An experienced recording engineer know when to emphasize a specific instrument when doing the final edit to enhance the focus and listeners experience. Harry Gregson-Williams score is not intrusive but well integrated (Credits include Shrek, Man on Fire and Cowboys and Aliens); Dariusz Wolski cinematography translates Ridleys vision to screen, and all the various departments all seem to come together to culminate in a perfect ""Mix"" for this compelling story. This movie has a great beginning, an absorbing duration, and satisfying ending.<br/><br/>So, I give this a full 10 our of 10 for experience. The audience was totally engrossed in the film, fully responding to the humor and horrors, empathetically sensing the singularity of being stranded but ultimately making the best of a bad situation. As the alien in John Carpenters ""Starman"" quote on being human: ""You are at your best when you are at your worst"". -B"

It should hold up fine, even though the first spacecraft almost tipped over in a major storm. Tarp should be great.<br/><br/>Damon is just a series of smug, cutesy lines - amazing how he kept such a light-hearted attitude left to die on Mars. If that wasn't bad enough, add disco music.

","Let me start out by saying that I loved the book. It is one of my favorites of all time and I highly recommend it. That being said, this movie was the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen. (just behind Eragon) The movie itself is very well done, with great acting and special effects. I just hated how much it wasn't like the book. I know you're not supposed to compare books to movies, but man. This was just awful. <br/><br/>Mark Watney in the book is a hilarious character and very well thought out. The movie made him seem like a typical guy who occasionally cracks a joke. In the book, I was laughing almost every page because of how funny the guy is. That is one problem with the movie. It wasn't funny enough. The book was basically a comedy. You could market it that way and nobody would bat an eye. You couldn't really do that with the movie. <br/><br/>:SPOILERS IN MOVIE AND BOOK: One of the things that I really hated was the ending. I realize they gotta make it dramatic and all that, but man! Way overdone! In the book, it is Beck who saves Watney, not captain Lewis. I just thought, why? Why the heck did Lewis go in the movie? Beck was specially trained in that field. That was his thing. That is what he was trained for. That's like having the captain doing surgery even though she wasn't really trained for it. (kinda extreme, but i think it gets the point across) Also, Watney didn't do that dumb iron man thing. I'm sorry, but that was just stupid. I mentions it in the book, but he didn't do it. <br/><br/>So all in all, the movie was crap, but the book was amazing. I recommend you skip the movie, and just buy the book instead. Much better usage of your money."

","I had trouble with this movie. Someone should remind produces that movies are about 2 hours long. They can't include everything. The Chinese really serve no useful purpose here, as they debate whether to help or not using subtitles.<br/><br/>There was an awful lot of talk. By and large, Matt Damon delivered it well: if he had not, the film would have been a total bomb. He is engaging, charming, witty, observant, intelligent and courageous. He does convey (lightly) the problems he has and so by the end, we believe him when he says <br/><br/>At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work. That's all it is. You just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next. And If you solve enough problems, you get to come home.<br/><br/>But the dialogue can become tiresome, especially when nothing is really going on. Many people I've talked to found the syllogism on becoming a space pirate very engaging. I did not. At best it was sophistry and at worst garble that took up valuable time. I defer, however, to those that liked it.<br/><br/>It is long.<br/><br/>It does not have well developed minor characters.<br/><br/>It has scenes and speeches that are inappropriate or at best underdeveloped It had Picardian science (Jon Luc Picard -- Star Trek -- The Next Generation) who is wont to say ""Make it so."" Well just because he commands it to be so, does not make it so -- like explaining the sling shot effect to the director of NASA. The Director of NASA would understand what it was.<br/><br/>If you want to see how this movie should be done, rent Apollo 13 and save yourself 25 dollars doing it. See how Ed Harris plays Jeff Daniel's part and how Tom Hanks does the Martian.<br/><br/>That is not actually the fault of either Daniels or Damon.

"alrodbel","2","11","22","20 October 2015"," Effective Institutional Advertising for NASA
","As cinematic entertainment of sci-fi genre rated a six. But this will be an different review of the film, one from a sociological, historical angle. There are a number of reviews that explore the scientific plausibility of the film contrasted with the artistic license that is a necessary part of any futuristic fiction. When the Matt Damian character, Mark Watney, got into real trouble, beyond being stuck in a planet with no water, oxygen or contact with other humans, his combative words were, """"I'm going to have to science the sh-t out of this,"" There have been articles on how NASA gave copious support to the filmmakers that was described as promoting future appropriation for Mars exploration, which is similar to how the Pentagon supports films such as ""Top Gun"" to turn aerial warfare into a thrilling adventure. There is no way to know how films that glorify the joy of war affected the public's acceptance of our invasion of Iraq, and still in spite of all evidence the the contrary, instills a certainty that this war was, as expressed by Jeb Bush, ""a good deal."" The creation of a permanent facility on Mars would cost in the many trillions of dollars, something that must evaluated in terms of other needs that would not have this funding. The film was shot in the Jordanian desert, which right now is not habitable. For a tiny fraction of the cost of our Mars colony, it could be a bountiful land that could be the home of those now living in the virtual prison of the Gaza strip, at one stroke ending the perpetual conflict precipitated by placing Israel in the midst of a different ethnic group.<br/><br/>The film was like the series ""Friends"" except their shared apartment wasn't in Manhattan but a a space ship and Martian habitat. It was fun to watch, but also depressing. Marketing courses teach about ""Institutional Advertising"" that insidiously sells an idea rather than a specific product. ""Cisco"" systems paid the production company for one in the form of their logo in the foreground of the 3D image for several seconds that they figure will sway future purchasing agents towards their industrial routers.<br/><br/>I don't think any group of space related companies sponsored this film, but the optimism had the effect of fomenting a mass movement, something best done when opposing ideas are silenced. As a postscript, an older Watney lectures astronaut trainees on how when they get into trouble in space, not to get depressed but start to get to work, to ""science"" out the problem and then they will survive. Not mentioned are the fourteen people of our two Space Shuttles, who certainly were aware that they were in such trouble, but all the ""sciencing"" in the world could not have prevented their fate. Such is the difference between realty and fantasy.<br/><br/>Colonizing Mars will mean diverting resources to address the monumental challenges on planet earth, where the outcome of this outpost is sill in question."
"mohamed-auc","4","11","22","15 October 2015"," A very predictable movie with an unjustified hype!
","I have been following many reviewers whether on youtube or IMDb for this movie and most of the feedback is positive which is making me really confused. Is the movie fun, well...yea, its a mediocre 2 hours killer if you have nothing else to watch, but is it Riddly's Scott come back? Wow, NO! It is not. If anything its a very lazy movie.<br/><br/>Let me tell you where I think this movie went all wrong:<br/><br/>1. Poor character introduction: <br/><br/>The movie started out great, into the heart of the action, no time to waste, and I loved that. You are dropped in on Mars watching these astronauts in the middle of the storm, something hits Matt Damon (yes I will call him Matt Damon) and boom, he is left behind. Afterwards we get to see him waking up, fixing himself, and everything looks intense and serious and I was engaged. Only until, he speaks to the camera, and not only that, he is basically telling us the right amount of what we need to know about him throughout the movie. He says something like ""fortunately, it happens to be that I am the best botanist in the world..bla bla"" more or less. Seriously! Is this how we introduce characters in movies these days?<br/><br/>It felt like ""Hi, I am Matt Damon, I am playing the role of a botanist/astronaut in this movie and the situation looks shitty, but hey, I will survive 'wink 'wink""<br/><br/>Seriously this what I would expect in an interview about the movie, not how you introduce characters, or in this case, Matt Damon.<br/><br/>Whatever happened to lets say: flash backs, anything about his background in a none cheesy, speak-to-the- camera kind of way? I know it would be difficult to incorporate it in a movie about a guy stranded alone on another planet, but this is not an excuse, there are plenty of creative or at least a little bit subtle ways, to introduce characters, but no, lets be lazy.<br/><br/>2. The stakes are soo low in this movie (predictability)<br/><br/>He literally said in the beginning of the movie that he is going to survive, and with the ongoing tone of the movie, we know he will. So let's all silently weep about the money we paid for that ticket and just get over with this popcorn....uhhh<br/><br/>Why do we even care about him saving his life? I don't give a damn! Who the hell is he? Why is he important? Why should I route for him to go back home? Why is he even struggling to survive? I am sorry, the fact he is only human and wants to survive is not enough to make a movie about! Look at any other movie, say Interstellar, being the most recent, Cooper wants to go back back home for his daughter, we know the emotional bond between them, and I bought that. But why is Matt Damon so desperate to go home? Seriously it's not in the movie.<br/><br/>Even the editing is so predictable it is spoiling the movie. Look at that scene where the NASA director says: ""this is assuming nothing goes wrong"" (when they were estimating how long can he live) and then the movie cuts to Mars right after he says that, they have already blew the moment away! Now I know something will go wrong, it can't be any more obvious!<br/><br/>3. A Sci Fi movie about space exploration does not explore anything:<br/><br/>Does the movie explore the effect of living stranded on a planet have on the human psyche/psychology? Nope, Matt Damon is so happy he is on Mars, seriously, watch the movie, or wait, don't.<br/><br/>Does the movie explore the effect of the journey on Matt Damon after he returns? Nope, he says some punch lines and some cheesy stuff and that's it.<br/><br/>Does the movie explore our fellow humans reactions to the situation back on earth? Nope, aside from random shots or news paper headline, nothing...<br/><br/>While I do have more to write about, but I won't be able to make any accurate examples from the movie because it is so forgettable and predictable. Is it worth watching? Well, if you have nothing else to do, it won't hurt you but please leave any expectations from Riddly Scott behind you."
"blitzhighboy","2","11","22","14 October 2015"," Very Disappointed
","The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott and is based on the novel by Andy Weir featuring Matt Damon as our main charter Mark Watney. The movie is about a group of scientist who needed to abort Mars due to a severe storm, during the process Mark Whiney was hit by a debris and considered dead. He has to find a way to survive and contact Nasa and inform them that he is Alive. I have read the book and I loved it. This movie was on my top list this year, and guess what, I hated it. I have to say I was bored out of my mind while watching this film, every second of it I just wanted it to end. In the book Mark Watney was in constant danger, I was rooting for him the whole ride and I was looking forward to do the same in the film. But in this movie, I was so bored I almost forgot about him since the movie is filmed on earth half the time. In the book, the story mainly focus's on Mark Whitney survival, but in this movie, more then half of the movie was filmed on earth, this ruins the feeling of loneliness on Mars, it lost the grip of dangerousness since we are are constantly surrounded on earth with human beings. This gives the feeling that Mark Whitney is going to survive since we see that half the movie people are trying to save him instead of seeing Mark Watney struggle to survive on Mars alone. This really ruins the movie, it took all the tension away. <br/><br/>There were some scenes that could have defiantly been made a lot better. Ridley Scott could have done a way better job if he could show what caused the disasters to happen in the movie. In the book when something bad is about to happen, Andy Weir describes it and shows the reader that Mark Whitney is in danger and he has no clue about it, this makes me root for him and want him to survive. It gives me a sense of danger he is in and how helpless he is with out any clue how much trouble he is going to be in. The way Andy Weir writes it also helps foreshadow that something really bad is going to happen and you don't know when. In the movie Ridley Scott didn't explain anything which doesn't help build up the danger Marl Watney is in. The soundtrack also didn't go well in the film, it made me feel like sometimes Mark Watney was having more fun in space then in danger. I have to say Ridley Scott did a really bad job in turning such a great novel in a movie. Although I was bored out of my mind I have to say there were some beautiful shots of Mars and space in the is movie and Matt Damon did a really job in his role. I am going to give this movie a 2/10."

"lucasversantvoort","6","8","15","18 November 2015"," Commendably slow-paced, but emotionally inert
","I am at a loss. At a loss, I tell you, to understand how a film about an astronaut stranded on Mars can be so emotionally inert, not to mention unfulfilling. And before you say 'well, you just can't appreciate a slow-moving sci-fi film', I'll have you know that Kubrick's 2001 is one of my favorite films. I went into The Martian already with a slight hesitation, because I felt Ridley Scott's Prometheus was kind of a letdown, but nothing prepared me for this. I'm increasingly starting to entertain the notion that Scott's recent work hide their inherent lack of substance with lots of flash and production design. After all, something that looks so good can't be that bad, right...right? Anyway, let's start at the very beginning.<br/><br/>The film opens with that fateful mission that the trailer already told us will fail. Matt Damon ends up stranded on Mars. After briefly contemplating existence, he decides to do what he can to survive and eventually succeeds in making contact with NASA. And so begins the race against time to 'bring him home'.<br/><br/>Let's just start with what The Martian does well: setting. For a film that takes place primarily on Mars, it's in its best interest, of course, to look spectacular. And that The Martian does. From the visual effects to the production design, everything looks great to my layman eyes. Ridley Scott's films have always looked impressive and The Martian is no exception.<br/><br/>Now that we got that out of the way, let's get to the interesting stuff: story, characters, or something resembling these. Bluntly put, I found this film emotionally inert. While there are some great scenes, I found it very hard to care for Watney's predicament. You'd think you'd be rooting for him and while I felt tense, it was only in a general sense: 'gee, I sure hope the main character makes it.' One of the contributing factors is I think the casting of Matt Damon. While Matt Damon's fine, the casting choice itself doesn't exactly make you consider the possibility he might actually die. Combine that with the generally upbeat script and you've got a film that has all the unbridled drama of a high school play. This film has been called a cross between Apollo 13 and Cast Away and that comparison works only when you remove any and all emotional impact out of the equation. Watney talking about his family, his team leader being depressed about leaving him behind; nothing tugs at my heartstrings.<br/><br/>Speaking of the script, I haven't read the original story, but I've read that Watney's knack for humor was already present in the source material...and how could it not be? The film lays such emphasis on his verbal wit that it couldn't possibly have been made up by the writer. So, the film's at least faithful to the source material, but at what cost? We've got a film with an incredibly dramatic setup, but where many scenes involve Watney talking to the camera, while munching on some potatoes. It's fine for the occasional joke and it makes sense given Watney's predicament (jokes reduce stress), but you start including too many jokes and before you know it, all drama and tension have been sucked out of the plot. The comedy itself is horrendous as well, 'sensible chuckle' material at best. What does it say about your film's level of comedy when your most clever joke involves Sean Bean and a Lord of the Rings reference? And what about that last minute romance between what's-her-name (Kate Mara) and her colleague, what's-his-name? Why the need to jam that into your screenplay at the last second? We get one scene where these two inconsequential characters glance at each other and then later she kisses him on the helmet and the movie acts like we're supposed to care about these walking pieces of cardboard. Oh, and we get an epilogue featuring them and their newborn child. The screenwriter must've thought the film needed something to generate some actual emotion. If so, it's a little late for that! So, what do we end up with? What does the script do well? The science, of course. Now, I'm not saying the film is 100% scientifically accurate. All I'm saying is that it usually presents it in a fun way. Watching Watney create water, make contact with NASA and so on is pretty engaging and it involves you in his problem-solving process.<br/><br/>One more thing: the actors. Scott has assembled a talented cast. No question. However, as always, problems present themselves. This is one of those cases where too many familiar faces just hurt the film's intended impact. It wants to paint this realistic portrait of how NASA functions, but it does it with too many stars. It reaches for the stars with too many stars, so to speak. You've got Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, etc. You think that's enough!? Too many familiar faces = less realism, tension and immersion. Oh, and can we also get Donald Glover to play the nerd with the brilliant plan, but who can't walk five meters without tripping over his own feet? Because, you know, this film wasn't unfunny enough. At the time, I was thinking to myself, 'man, this movie is starting to drag. If only it had Donald Glover literally stumbling from one scene to the next. That could really liven up the proceedings and generate some real tension'...<br/><br/>If the novel was intended as a geeky, fun, thrilling read, then I guess The Martian is as faithful an adaptation as we're going to get. The problem is that it tries desperately to make the drama fulfilling as well, but to no avail. Oh well, at least I got some nice visuals and sound design out of it. The sound of screws bobbing against Watney's helmet was pretty cool in a doesn't-add-anything-to-the-story kind of way."
"peterdevries","6","8","15","2 November 2015"," Rushed, shallow but very very pretty
","I was very much looking forward to this movie. I read the book a while ago, and was immediately hooked due to the realistic depictions of technology and science. The book made me truly believe that the survival strategy of James was possible. <br/><br/>I know it is difficult to jam the content density of a book into a movie. Nevertheless I think too much of the book was left out of the film. Events that occurred were not explained properly in the movie and therefore come off as pure chance (e.g. the airlock explosion). The trips that Watney needed to take to get to the Mars Rover and to the final crater seemed like afternoon trips, whereas in reality they were journeys of weeks in length. Never do we get an explanation of what is needed for any of these trips to happen. We see him cutting a hole in the roof of the transporter to make room for something but it is never explained what goes there and why it is significant. In 70% of the movie Damon is clean shaven and muscular, while at some point he gets out of the shower thin and with a long beard. That beard is subsequently shaven off in one of the next scenes. Somehow the editing did not make me believe that everything in this movie did not take place within a few weeks, but in a time frame of about two years. The final rescue by the crew also seems very rushed and overplayed. Where the book made the disasters that happened along the way believable, the absence of any explanation make the disasters in the movie seem a collection of events to make things exciting. <br/><br/>Overall this is a movie that would have been very boring if it would have the realistic pacing of the book. Nevertheless I think the book deserves a more linear translation into the movie and with better editing to make the passage of time more believable. The movie seemed to me to be rushed and shallow. But the landscapes are wonderful."

Half of the movie filling is a lot of American djaba-da-ba-dooo which I don't mind in The Flintstones family saga but not in a serious epic like the this one and Mr. Ridley Scott had bend over her majesty Hollywood to make a soap opera which everybody wanted. Yes, he did not make this movie for himself as he did with Blade Runner and The Alien but for everyone else.I am forgiving him only because the disco choice of music as a soundtrack. Such a choice can make sense only in a family soap opera to soften the edges of the harsh space but will you have the forever remaining epic with a Kubrick's class? I doubt it.<br/><br/>Matt Damon did his job, cut his rare beard, took a metal steel off his tummy to put us on the edge of our seats at the beginning,cried few times over the plants he seeded in martian soil and did not lose his nerves for 982 days! Or it was 1052?! What a hero! What a discipline and what a palavva.The photography was a good advert for NASA and ow yeah, so many facts that you have never heard about the Cosmos that even a documentary like Carl Sagan's Cosmos would sound like a fairy tale. Well, this one is nicely packaged. You can remember it among other ""classics"" such as Armageddon and Space Cowboys. Well, you got it guys. You have your popcorn and your movie. Enjoy!It's a good sale!"

","Why can't we send Matt Damon to Mars and leave him for real? The first movie I saw like this was ""The Old Man and the Sea"", a true classic where our hero (Spencer Tracy) battled the elements and fought for his sense of purpose as a human being. I do agree that the Mars landscape was spectacular. But that's about where the good ends and the bad begins. I never felt any empathy for Watney (Damon). The film never conveys a sense ""emergency"" on Watney's part because of his constant wise-cracking. When he began his survival plan it seemed like a segment from a ""How it's Made"" episode with the same dopey music. The likelihood of him having just enough of this and that to keep him alive for that long seemed incredible and too far-fetched for me. The part that really made my eyes roll up was when he dug up some kind of radioactive contraption, threw it in the back of his ""rover"" and used it as a heater. Really? I wonder what else is playing down the hall of the multiplex."

","Not on par with Ridley Scott's masterpieces (Alien, Blade Runner), but still his best work in years, The Martian is a neat sci-fi movie which (unsurprisingly) looks amazing and (surprisingly) has a strong script (by Cloverfield's Drew Goddard, adapted from a novel by Andy Weir).<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Mark Watney, astronaut / botanist stranded on Mars after his crew left him for dead during a freaky storm. Cast Away meets Apollo 13, Watney must figure out how to communicate with Earth AND survive until a rescue mission.<br/><br/>Cast is great (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean...), with Damon carrying the bulk of the movie with a charismatic performance; visuals are fantastic (Mars has never looked better in movies); Goddard's script is brisk, neither portentous nor dumb, the technological stuff at least *sounds* plausible, and a few clichés are bravely avoided (i.e. no teary-eyed love interest rooting for him at home).<br/><br/>Overall, The Martian feels at times a little too cute and upbeat to achieve true epic (Alien and Blade Runner, again!). Although humor is used well, it could have done with a little more gravitas too - you never get the sense of harrowing psychological drama Watney's ordeal should have. <br/><br/>Still, this is fine entertainment. Let's give Ridley a break - maybe with his first sci-fi masterpieces he just set the bar too high for himself to reach again.<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","In times when Americans sit in bunkers directing drones to kill  Children it's a bit much to see a film about American heroism.  Ridley Scott seems to specialize in this sort of mumbo.

I Think Americans did well in instead turn their vision towards the  homeless around them that are piling up around them and maybe do a film  about true heroism.

"RossRivero99","10","3","4","10 May 2019"," An entertaining thrill ride from start to finish
","Ridley Scott is without a doubt one of the finest film directors of the last 45 years and in that time he directed great movies such as ""Gladiator"" (2000), ""Alien"" (1979), ""American Gangster"" (2007), and ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001), and with ""The Martian"" he has not only added another great film to that elite resume he has also directed one of the finest science fiction movies of the decade. The movie is based on Andy Weir's novel of the same name (which I did not read prior to seeing this movie) and stars Matt Damon in one of the finest performances of his career as Mark Watney who is on a mission to Mars with Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) who is in charge of the mission, Major Rick Martinez (Michael Peña) the mission's pilot, Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara) the mission's systems operator, and Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan) who is a surgeon on the mission. At first everything seems fine on Mars but goes horribly wrong in an instant when a dust storm forces the crew to evacuate and in the process leaves Watney behind after not being able to find him. After Watney finds himself left on Mars he has to resort to his wits in order to survive on Mars for as long as he possibly can until help arrives while also try to figure out a way to tell NASA that he is still alive and well. The movie is not only one of the best sci-fi adventures this decade has to offer but it ranks with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) and ""Apollo 13"" (1995) as one of the greatest movies about space exploration ever put on film. The movie features excellent performances throughout especially from an excellent supporting cast which includes Jeff Daniels as the president of NASA, Chiwetel Ejiofor who plays the man in charge of all of the missions to the red planet, and Sean Bean who plays the flight director for NASA. Scott's direction is on point and Drew Goddard's screenplay places tension at all the right moments to the point where you are actually there with them in this uncomfortable situation. This a very entertaining movie that has some very pulse pounding moments that is sure to be remembered for years to come, and put simply is a must see film."
"walentys","4","3","4","29 August 2018"," Ridley Scott has not crafted a good film in years
","Ridley Scott has not crafted a good film in years. This latest installment is unfortunately no exception to this pattern.<br/><br/>Taking a broader perspective on Scott's career as a director, one can easily see that he loves to depict a humble protagonist, one who displays nobility of heart, stands up for his/her beliefs and has a moral struggle but tends to choose the ""right path"" even if it is the harder one. I do not mean to say that path is necessarily morally sound from a viewer's perspective, or even from Scott's perspective, but instead it is ""right"" for that character and what they believe is right. Scott is quite practiced at this kind of character, as he's done it in several films: American Gangster, Exodus: Gods and Kings, Gladiator, Robin Hood, Body of Lies, and Kingdom of Heaven, to name a few.<br/><br/>In this film, The Martian, Scott attempts to break away from this formula a little bit. We are still centered around one main protagonist who is struggling, but not morally - instead, for his own survival. There's no hard choice to make, no pros and cons to weigh; he is simply fighting for his survival and has to face the reality that he may not get out of it at all and end up dead on Mars.<br/><br/>At first I was relieved that finally Scott is trying something else, as his last several films have been formulaic and tiresome. I was even looking forward a bit to seeing what he would do with such a film. But this film brings almost nothing to the table, almost entirely devoid of substance. It is as if the tried and true formula Ridley Scott is known for is actually all he is capable of as a director. I don't mean to say he should never do anything else, because certainly that formula is getting very tiring. I just mean that it says something disconcerting about his directing when his precious formula is taken away and this is the result: a large forgettable black hole of a film.<br/><br/>The struggle of survival is a theme tackled by many films, and I do not attack this film thematically. The theme indeed has the potential to deliver something very powerful, emotional, gripping, something that jibes with the human experience as a whole, something that, even if we cannot relate to directly, we can feel for the character going through it. 127 Hours is a great example of a survival story which was done well. We feel the brutality of the situation; he is broken down to the point of drinking his own urine and eventually his spirit breaks down enough to the point of severing his own limb off. Things actually happen that show the character's suffering, brutal things that justify the extreme action taken.<br/><br/>Nothing really happens in this film. The plot is virtually null, and the emotional content is non-existent as well. One would expect a survival story to actually contain a bit of struggle, perhaps even some brutality or exploration of extreme states of the human condition, but this films lacks all of those. Almost right away, since he just so conveniently happens to be a botanist, he figures out a way to grow food, and you fully trusted he would do so given his profession. As for water, there is plenty aboard the station. As a viewer, your comfort level in his biological state is very high; he has plenty of food and water to last him quite a while. So that's taken care of promptly. Secondly, the social factor. Loneliness of that scale can be a powerful cinematic element.to take advantage of, but this is also ruined by the film constantly cutting back to Earth, and then he finds a way to start contacting Earth also. So that is also taken care of. Thirdly, missing his friends and family. That just wasn't ever brought up even one time, so that wasn't taken care of so much as it was entirely absent. All this together shows basically zero struggle. Somehow Scott has managed to make a survival story into a cushy, comfortable ride; I never once doubted or was afraid for his life. I don't state this with revere, this kind of contrast is simply baffling and doesn't make sense whatsoever. There were a few occasions where the film tried to throw in a sense of looming doom, like the food supply would reduce or the situation back on Earth would seem hopeless, but these ultimately felt contrived and were tossed in purely superficially; it definitely didn't fool me any.<br/><br/>Right in line with the empty plot, character development is also nil. Our protagonist learns nothing, does not change in any fundamental way, nor does any supporting character. He gets left behind on Mars and gets rescued at the end, going back to normal life afterward. Oh, he starts to teach survivalism in extreme space situations, but this is more of an afterthought than a fundamental character change. Jeff Daniels plays the director of NASA; he honestly could've been completely cut out of the film and no significant difference/loss would've occurred. His role was to be the face to the public, as we constantly see him babbling on and on in press conferences about Damon's current state and what NASA is doing to try to rescue him. In fact, most of the scenes and characters on Earth felt pretty pointless. To some level they were obviously needed, as they are the ones who must rescue him, but that didn't make them enjoyable (not that the Mars scenes were much better).<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure how much can be blamed on the novel the film is based on, as I have not read it, but I do believe a director has full control of a film and if a novel is a bit drab, a director can and should breathe more life into it. I have a hunch the novel is not so bad and it is just that Ridley Scott was assuredly the wrong choice for its adaptation into film. It also might seem appropriate to blame the script writer, Drew Goddard, but the dialogue was not so horrible, aside from the mostly banal attempts at humor - though some lines were funny. While I do not ignore the significant role that source novel material and screenplay have, I'm still placing most responsibility onto Scott's lap. He didn't portray any character change, he didn't use a cinematic eye to communicate any substance.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, nothing is particularly terrible, but not much was required either. As a counterexample, Damon's acting in Interstellar was one of the worst performances to ever appear in motion picture history, but this was because it tried to be a very dramatic scene where he attempts to murder the whole crew. His acting simply wasn't good enough to carry that kind of role, so it came off as simply laughable. This film on the other hand doesn't call for much, so his caliber of acting was just fine for it.<br/><br/>All this said, there is one thing Scott shines at that I cannot deny, and it is present here also. He makes watchable films. It's hard to describe precisely what this means, but I'll try. It means a film that is entertaining enough, moves along quickly enough, is not completely laughably awful in every way, never gets too slow or boring - I should point out that this is completely different than a film having substance, which I've already said this film lacks. But it is watchable, I'll give it that. Entertaining enough in a popcorn sense - you don't need to pay attention much, because there's really nothing to pay attention to. This makes it more of a lighter affair, which completely contradicts its theme as I've already pointed out. So yes, I admit The Martian is not entirely boring as you're watching it, but after you watch it, there's nothing much to reflect on or take home."

","For a director of the stature of Ridley Scott to allow his prodigious talents to be squandered in such a way is a crime. Is this the same man who brought us ""Alien""?? It's as though he HAD to produce a ""summer blockbuster"" to satisfy his corporate masters, at OUR expense. This movie is nothing but a hodgepodge of clips, gags, and dialogue that he felt necessary to cannabalize from not only his own films, but every, single science fiction piece of CGI trash on the market, just to produce a ""marketable product,"" even rescuing a dour-faced Jeff Daniels from unemployment in order to scowl throughout this entire, useless excuse for a scifi epic. It was as though Scott watched endless reruns of an equally tedious ""Gravity"" by which to steal yet MORE ideas and plot points so unbelievably ludicrous as to beggar the imagination. But what is even more obvious is Scott's ripping off Bruce Dern's scifi classic, ""Silent Running, in 1972, which was the first to explore the ""Farmer in Space"" theme, 45-years earlier. The only difference is, he did it better. Perhaps a pre-teen could believe this fabricated piece of space junk, but certainly no discerning adult."

","Maybe my expectations were too high (I watched this right after coming off Interstellar, which I rather enjoyed) but this movie was completely forgettable. The plot is a standard ""save the stranded guy"" story reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan but not executed nearly as well. I could see everything coming from a mile away. Predicting what would happen next was more enjoyable than watching the film itself.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays one of Hollywood's favorite tropes, a tough guy who, when placed in a life-threatening situation, would rather crack jokes and make fun of disco music than portray any kind of emotion a person in the same situation would conceivably show. He's unrealistically knowledgeable about stuff outside of his field and shows no real depth. There are no psychological consequences of being abandoned on a completely different planet to him.<br/><br/>The rest of his crew are a dull group that I can't even remember for anything other than their unlikely decision to spend a ridiculous amount of time in space away from their families just to save the main character because he is, well, the main character.<br/><br/>The science behind the film was also quite unbelievable. Directors stretching things a little for convenience is no problem with me (and a sci-fi film shouldn't be judged solely by its scientific accuracy) but this film had some errors that my nine-year old cousin even noticed.<br/><br/>The only thing I have nothing bad to say about are the visuals. The CGI was some real high-quality stuff, and the visuals of Mars were stunning. Like most movies nowadays, it's a piece of mind-numbing eye candy, all surface and no substance. Overall, it's just one more piece of Hollywood media that will be consumed by the masses and be forgotten as soon at the next space flick comes out."

","I had some reluctance about sitting down to watch ""The Martian"" because it is a movie starring Matt Damon. But finally got around to watching it almost a year after its release.<br/><br/>This movie, despite being a Ridley Scott movie, is as predictable as they come. You know what happens and what is around the corner a mile away. The movie was so predictable that even a blind man could foreseen what would happen next.<br/><br/>With that being said, don't get me wrong, because ""The Martian"" is still an enjoyable enough movie for what it turned out to be. However, it just wasn't a groundbreaking movie in any sense, nor was it a particularly outstanding movie, to be bluntly honest.<br/><br/>And a whole movie with almost nothing but Matt Damon was a serious test on my durability. I am not a fan of him at all, but a friend said that this is a really great movie, and that was the selling point for why I actually sat down and watched ""The Martian"".<br/><br/>The movie was fairly well paced, but running at over two hours and just watching Matt Damon struggling to survive on Mars for the majority of two hours was starting to become a drag.<br/><br/>While ""The Martian"" certainly is entertaining enough in itself and for what it was, then it is hardly a cinematic masterpiece, nor a movie that is likely to become a classic movie. In my opinion, there are far better movies that revolve around the Red Planet compared to ""The Martian"".<br/><br/>While Matt Damon had the majority of the screen time, then there was a handful of good casts to assist him as well. And I think that Jeff Daniels and Sean Bean were doing good jobs, just a shame that they didn't have bigger parts and more time on the screen.<br/><br/>My final score, once the red dust has has settled, comes down to a six out of ten stars.

I think I got used to Damon's fake tears by now, he does it good, so good that you realize he does it exactly the same every time.<br/><br/>Cue in the visual explanation cliché of a complex plot device, complex for you of course.

NASA and crew mates all suffer over how to get him back, but not as much as he suffers himself. The Martian surprises with its emotional range, at times funny, poignant, contemplative and uplifting. It is 'Castaway' in space, but less concerned with existential crisis. It is also not as po-faced. At one point Damon says ""We are going to science the sh*t out of this,'"" his emphasis on 'science' and 'sh*t.' Yes, less rigorous authenticity in the science department, but despite the less than subtle sub-text - Damon practically winks at screen when he says the line - the Internet is full of finger-waggers who have scoured their A-level Physics textbooks to trump the screenwriter. Don't watch this if you want a science lesson, but do come for some great acting, gentle amusement, and a good cry at times. And if mid-70s pop is your musical bag, you are in for a bonus. The last 20 minutes are fairly over-cooked, and they too eagerly chase China box office, but the good elements more than make up for these minor flaws. Entertaining and moving fare."

","Ron Howard famously made audiences fear that the Apollo 13 astronauts would not be able to guide their damaged spacecraft back to earth, a pretty neat trick given the film told the story of a well-publicized event where the fate of Jim Lovell and company was well-known. Ridley Scott maybe on-ups him by translating the science fiction procedural ""The Martian"" into a film that makes you (in your less mindful moments) wonder how much the film reflects the real events (perhaps these are real but future events?). Also credit Scott for making a ""Castaway""-like story of one man isolated and trapped into a compelling narrative. The challenge all the greater than Castaway given the amount of straight up math involved in the book (what's is a hexadecimal anyway and how does one help you communicate?). So no Academy Award nomination for Scott? Well it is up against ""Room"" where Lenny Abrahamson faced the challenge of recreating 2 people stuck in a room. Anyway, Matt Damon does get a best acting nom basically for being a likable guy who is good at math which required Damon to stretch - at least as far as the math part goes. He's favored to win largely as The Academy's way of saying: ""Suck it Leo"". The remainder of the cast is not terribly consequential, the writing is decent if a little math-heavy and the story satisfying.

","Contrary to what you might be thinking, the idea behind ""The Martian"" is not as original as you might believe. Way back in 1964, the movie ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" did the basic idea first. Of course, in the more than fifty years that have passed since that movie was made, special effects have improved greatly and we now know a lot more about Mars - which results in ""The Martian"" being pretty convincing in what it portrays (though I'm not sure if astronauts could hear sound in Mars' atmosphere.) The movie takes its time in showing the details of what one would have to face stranded on Mars, and while this does result in a very long movie (140 minutes in length), the movie is never boring or tedious, even with some predictable touches thrown in now and then. <br/><br/>The movie is certainly not perfect. Besides those predictable touches, there are some flaws with the writing of the title character. We only get to know him for a few minutes before he finds himself stranded on Mars, so it's hard to see how this new challenge changes this character. Also, he seems to take his predicament much better than you might think. The other flaw with the movie is with the climax. I won't reveal what happens, except it's somewhat hard to swallow everything that occurs. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still enjoyable despite these flaws.

","I opted not to see ""The Martian"" when it first hit theaters some months ago. Sure, I heard at the time that it was good, but how good could it possibly be? It looked like someone just took the cast of ""Interstellar"" and mixed that movie's plot with ""Cast Away"".<br/><br/>Well, it turns out that's not quite accurate. Instead someone took the cast of Interstellar and threw them into a plot that is a mix of Cast Away and ""Apollo 13"". Yes, if one is to be quite picky, there's only so much originality here--or at least that's true as far as the overarching narrative of this film is concerned. If you've seen the two latter movies, you basically can figure out the plot of, ""The Martian"".<br/><br/>Still, what I didn't reckon with is that both ""Cast Away"" and ""Apollo 13"" are each extraordinary movies--and as such, this movie, which emulates each of the two in its own way, is a likewise extraordinary film.<br/><br/>Again, it is unfortunate that basically the exact same cast that appeared in the ""2001""-inspired ""Interstellar"" sci fi flick a year or two back are all featured prominently here in this film (Matthew McConaughey the one notable exception). As such, at times it almost feels like you've seen the movie before--Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain get lost in space, we get it.<br/><br/>Still, the reality is that as much as I want to nitpick at this movie, I just can't really throw anything out there that really greatly takes away from the film. It's just simply well made and fun. Yes, the film's climax is a bit overdone (this time channeling ""Gravity"" more so than ""Apollo 13""), but all in all there's just too much to enjoy here to be truly critical. Indeed, having seen all the Oscar nominees for Best Picture now except ""The Revenant"" (saving the best for last, perhaps), I'd have to say that this may be my favorite film out of the lot. <br/><br/>I'm demoting the one star for the reasons listed above, but all in all this movie is fantastic. 9/10 stars!"

","Over the past few years, space has been a subject a few directors have really tried to take on, hoping for a major hit, which can be really hard. Space is tough to master because it has to be somewhat believable, it has to have great visuals and it needs great acting.<br/><br/>Matt Damon does a great job in this movie along with his crew, but that's about it as far as the acting goes, most of the other characters just felt very one dimensional or boring that I didn't really care what they had to say and just wanted to see more of Matt Damon do his thing on Mars.<br/><br/>The visuals are great in this movie, just like most space oriented movies these days, I still think Gravity takes the top prize in terms of visuals in space. <br/><br/>As for the believable factor, I know not everything can be perfect, but cmon, you could read this movie like a book (if you hadn't read the original already). You know going into it to expect a major turn of events somewhere, but not knowing exactly what it could be. The Martian exploits every which way a problem arises and can be solved, after a while you have a feeling of what's going on and ruins the suspense factor which space movies depend on to hook viewers in.<br/><br/>Overall, still a well directed movie, but I feel like out of the space movies it's not the best over the past few years. Gravity was a great movie, Interstellar was intense, even if you count Star Wars that had much better action in it. For me, Matt Damon made this movie good."

","As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully. <br/><br/>Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come. <br/><br/>The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own."

","Matt Damon is left for dead during the rushed evacuation of a small-scale Martian expedition. It's like Apollo 13 on steroids, mixed with short dashes of 127 Hours, MacGyver and Survivorman. Much less of a one-man show than I was expecting, which gives the film a little more spirit but also a more conventional structure. I think it would've been a far more interesting, daring picture if we'd seen more personal video journals from space and less debate around a round table at NASA, if just because we've seen the latter film several times already. Damon is excellent, bringing a blend of hopeless desperation and punchy good humor that gives him credence as both a technical expert and a likable, relatable everyday guy. The supporting cast is scattered with some strange choices, though - Kristen Wiig in a dead-serious role and Sean Bean as a kind-hearted supervisor are particularly out of place - which left me enjoying the scenes with Damon alone in the red landscape much more than the rescue effort. Still, the epic moments far outweigh the sub-standard ones, there's a strong sense of humor beneath all the suspense, and the visuals are really pretty incredible. Bonus points for getting so much of the science right, too. I'm conditioned to expect a lot of flaws when I dig deeper into sci-fi like this, but apart from one notable exception (the weather on Mars), the experts looked at this one and said ""Yeah, that could actually work."" Cool stuff."

","Based on the novel of the same name 'The Martain' failed to meet the expectations and plunged in the hype of promotions.<br/><br/>The novel deploys a fun and hilarious (which the movie makers forgot to take into account) Mark Watney on the journey to Mars where he is stuck for years and uses his brilliance to remain composed and sane and survive in deep space. It seems as if the movie makers were so focused on filming each and every scene of the novel that they neglected the crucial elements of the fiction. It'S a fiction damn it!<br/><br/>Direction was lousy.When it comes to casting I guess the director lost his mind. Actors seemed monotonous and in despair where the novel is based on hope that nothing is impossible. No peeve in the graphics department, they were awesome.<br/><br/>All in all, movie is only a one time watch and that too only if you haven't read the novel like me. If you have, you might get disappointed."

","""The Martian"" is a Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a manned mission to Mars trying to explore and study it.

However Mark Watney survives from the storm and finds himself alone on one of the most hostile planets trying to survive by himself with a few supplies.<br/><br/>I liked this movie very much because of the plot which was very interesting. It remind me the movie ""Interstellar"" at some points which I believe that is an also good movie. The interpretation of Matt Damon who played as Astronaut Mark Watney was simply outstanding. At this point I have to say that the direction which made by Ridley Scott was very good and I did not expect anything less from him. In addition to this I found the combination of some humorist scenes with some more harsh scenes very interesting.<br/><br/>Lastly I have to say that ""The Martian"" is an interesting movie to watch with a well written script and equally good plot. In this movie you can watch the true aspect of survival and the obstacles that a person has to go through in order to survive alone with no help from anywhere and anyone. One mistake of his and everything may finish."

But with no communication and limited supplies he knows that the odds are steeped very much against him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that although it was rather predictable and cheesy it was still quite entertaining. Matt Daman, as usual, performed in an excellent manner and coupled with the beautiful ""Martian"" scenery along with the tension the director (Ridley Scott) managed to maintain even though the film was well over 2 hours kept the film from becoming either dull or boring. In any case, I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average."
"bkoganbing","8","4","6","29 January 2016"," Tasks for your survival
","Although The Martian is set in an indeterminate future I have questions about labeling it science fiction. One of the film's best strengths is that it is based on what we know about the landscape and atmosphere of Mars right at this point in time. It's a desert planet with water and no life as we know it. Compared to what Matt Damon has to go through, Robinson Crusoe was on that tropical isle for a picnic.<br/><br/>They never really say just exactly what year The Martian is set in. The film in that sense avoids a trap like so many others fall into. Just this past year we saw 2015 come and go and it wasn't really anything like the 2015 that Marty McFly experienced. That's just one example.<br/><br/>Of course you can also never predict what popular trends will be there. That's purely speculative. So you can't have Matt Damon's character listening to current music. His captain's taste in music was 70s disco and that really became a running joke. It's all he heard for the months he was on Mars. Personally I'd prefer a selection of 30s and 40s music with Bing Crosby at the top of my list. But if that's all I heard for months on end, I'd grow to hate Der Bingle. <br/><br/>And that's part of the story, the everlasting boredom trying to keep your mind fresh and busy with tasks for your survival. Like Mr. Roberts from tedium to apathy and always boredom.<br/><br/>What happens in The Martian is that Damon is part of an astronaut team and gets left behind when a Martian sand storm erupts and the crew flees on the space ship. Captain Jessica Chastain takes when she thinks Damon was killed. <br/><br/>The future also brings us better communication and NASA learns that Matt's still there. To say that there's a public relations problem is putting it mildly. Just leaving him there is actually an option discussed. But that goes against the code of a decent civilization which while we're not at Star Trek level yet, we look to be heading that way.<br/><br/>Although The Martian splits time evenly with Damon's plight and the efforts to rescue him, Matt's time alone on the screen with the full range of emotions displayed is what got him his Best Actor nomination. Besides the realistic depiction of Mars, his performance is the other pillar on which this fine film rests. I would give mention to Jessica Chastain and her fine performance as a tough and yet humane leader of her team.<br/><br/>Besides Matt Damon, The Martian is also up for Best Picture and for a flock of awards in the technical categories. It should take home deserved statues this year."

","I must start this review with a confession - I LOVED the book that this movie is based on. So it was with some trepidation that I approached the movie - it couldn't possibly match the thrill and joy I experienced while reading the book, could it?<br/><br/>I was right, it couldn't.<br/><br/>But it still was a darn good movie.<br/><br/>THE MARTIAN tells the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded alone on Mars. Can Watney use his wits and knowledge of science to survive on an inhospitable planet until rescue can be completed? Or will he die trying?<br/><br/>Watching Damon, as the charismatic Watney, the answer is not nearly as important as the journey. Damon's self-effacing portrayal of the stranded astronaut gets us instantly rooting for him to succeed and solve problem after problem. We are alone with Watney on Mars, but I never felt ""the stunt"" of him being alone (unlike, say, Tom Hanks in CAST AWAY), so when we finally cut back to Earth, I was somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>But not too much, for the supporting cast is strong and is populated by fine actor after fine actor. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mission Control guy! Jessica Chastain as the Commander of the Mars Mission! Look there's Kristen Wiig and Sean Bean and good ol' Jeff Daniels!!! And, hey...isn't that THE WINTER SOLDIER guy (Sebastian Stan) as another Astronaut?<br/><br/>And I didn't even mention the always fun Michael Pena, or Kate Mara or lesser known actors such as Benedict Wong, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover...<br/><br/>It was fun that all these really strong actors took on smaller roles, it gave the film some heft and importance that it, otherwise, might not have had.<br/><br/>This because director Ridley Scott, did something unusual for him in a space movie - he gave it hope and positivity. Instead of a dystopian future where it is ""each man for himself"", Scott's view of the future (and screenwriter Drew Goddard) mirrored the author of the book (Andy Weir)'s view of the future - hopeful and helpful. Everyone on Earth pulls together to bring their man home from Mars.<br/><br/>It was a nice change of mood for these kinds of pictures, one that I was ready for.<br/><br/>It is a very good time at the cinema and I cannot recommend this picture strongly enough. Though I would recommend the book more.

When I finally saw it I came to the conclusion that this film was decent at best. The humor did not work in my opinion and the audience in my theater seems to agree with me as there was dead silence throughout the films attempt at humor. The acting throughout seemed very wooden and I never really got the sense that Mark was in any sort of danger. He showed very little emotion throughout the film when I feel like any normal person would have had a great deal of despair. I was expecting the film to move at a much faster pace and quite frankly when it was finished I was very relieved. Overall the film was very formulaic and had nothing in it that makes it unique.

","For a movie that aims to be realistic scientifically, it fails terribly at providing an even remotely believable premise. For example, the idea that the government would spend ~$1 billion to save single scientist from starving is simply ludicrous. The film is completely predictable with essentially no character development. It fails to even touch on the psychology of isolation and each character acts in an unbelievably selfless, upbeat manner. It's only saving grace is its reasonable acting and high budget special effects. This appears to be adequate for the mass of consumers, but anyone seeking anything more than a cookie cutter plot line will go home disappointed."
"kunalkhandwala","9","13","28","18 October 2015"," This is the most fun we've had on Mars since the Rover's excursions and the science behind it all, checks right.
","In a not-so-distant future, when NASA is still around to send a 3rd manned mission to Mars for research, a freak storm rips through the station as the crew desperately try to abort and escape its ruthless fury. Blown away by flying debris, one crew member goes missing and is tentatively presumed dead as the Captain makes the call to take off. However, the grieving crew and shocked humans back home are completely unaware of Mark Watney's chance survival. Thereon, science fiction borders reality in a race against time and depleting resources as Ridley Scott ('Aliens', 'Blade Runner', 'Gladiator', 'Hannibal', 'Black Hawk Down', 'American Gangster', 'Prometheus') comes to form after a couple of recent disappointments such as 'Robin Hood' and 'Exodus'. Along with a career best performance by Matt Damon, 'The Martian' descends into a zone that makes it far more entertaining than Michael Bay's space adventures but not as personal and deeply engrossing as Interstellar. It makes for an engaging, funny and credible adventure as it was set out to be in Andy Weir's best-selling novel, adapted here by Drew Goddard;s ('Lost', 'Netflix's Daredevil') entertaining screenplay. This is the most fun we've had on Mars since the Rover's excursions and the science behind it all, checks right. <br/><br/>18 Sols have passed since Mark Watney (Matt Damon) stapled his wound after the storm and his crew's departure. He has calculated his rations, improvised on the limited resources and come up with an survival plan that involves generation of water and cultivation of potatoes - on Mars. Soon enough, the scientists at NASA notice movements around Mark's station through images and reach out to him through the Pathfinder's camera. As the communication links are established, plans are set in motion to rescue Mark even though its execution will challenge several development and launch teams on Earth and himself physically and mentally to survive up to 4 more years. The scientific ideas are comprehensible, making Mark's improvisations with his resources all the more credible. It isn't just about his existence in an inhospitable environment but about pushing one's capabilities and resources to the utmost levels in order to prolong survival. Rescue being an uncertain number of months away, Mark has to keep recalculating provisions while maintaining the constant, entertaining communication. Those lighter moments in such trying times are what make The Martian such a good film compared to the darkness in Prometheus. Time, in essence, is the only villain in this story. <br/><br/>Jessica Chastain plays Captain Lewis, who struggles to get to terms with her decision to abort the mission. She convincingly portrays the compassion for her crew and audacity when she must alter the mission itself. Michael Pena's comic timing is always an asset in a film and as Martinez, he keeps things light and relatable. Kate Mara and the rest of the crew members do an adequate job while some of the stronger performances are by actors back on Earth, including Jeff Daniels as NASA's overly cautious director Sanders, Benedict Wong as the director of JPL who leads a team that is tasked with achieving the impossible, Sean Bean as Mitch who heads the mission with complete dedication to the safety of the crew and of course, Chiwetel Ejiofor's Vincent Kapoor, the engineer whose diligent efforts in tracking Watney led to the agency's serious consideration for launching a rescue mission. His, is perhaps the best performance among the supporting cast. As Watney explains to us, although he is just addressing the camera for recording purposes, the math behind supplies rationing, potato cultivation or simply, the odds of his survival with every changing circumstance, we are completely engaged in his efforts and genuinely want him off the red planet. As an expert botanist whose wit comes in handy in most of the scientific applications on Mars, Matt Damon delivers his most compelling performance that makes science and engineering more entertaining. That is precisely where The Martian succeeds. <br/><br/>The film's ability to convey the scientific and human challenges while being stranded on Mars, but with easy understanding and witty humor that keeps the grip on the audience while they witness a miraculous rescue attempt that is planned and executed to a meticulous degree. Against the backdrop of disco music, Watney gently trudges along the Martian landscape in his rover as the engineers at NASA refer to his rescue mission as Elrond. The nerd quotient here is at a sublime level that doesn't overpower the narrative. The cinematography and visual effects simply make Jordan look more credible as the surface of Mars while the sfx in space are refined enough for certain thrilling scenes. Technically, Ridley Scott has abstained for over-burdening the entertaining narrative with unnecessary special effects. He relies heavily upon Drew Goddard's screenplay of Weir's book and on Matt Damon, whom America has repeatedly sent on missions only to lose him. The Martian is a complete exercise on problem solving. You solve one and another one surfaces. You solve that and there's a new one. Up until you solve enough to just stay alive. A rescue is only a fool's hope or a miracle. In Matt Damon's case, we'd rather keep sending him to faraway places just so we can watch him being rescued again. <br/><br/>9.199 on a scale of 1-10."

","If you are not a fan of MacGyver, this two hour plus movie is going to feel like five hours. Other than some moments taken from Mission to Mars, Apollo 13 and Gravity, Matt Damon plays Robinson Crusoe on Mars. If you believe that millions of devoted fans of NASA would flood Time Square to find out if this movie will have a happy ending, then you can believe anything. If you love the science and math behind space exploration, the Martian is a marvel. If you like your space odyssey to have aliens, laser fights and chase scenes, this movie is not for you. Unlike Sam Rockwell's Moon, Matt Damon is not completely alone. Half the movie is Matt only while the other half is filled with a colorful cast that you often see in comedies. Overall, the movie helps you to smile from time to time but is far from a comedy...or a musical."
"jjsquared-1","2","9","18","18 October 2015"," If I wrote this book, I'd be very upset with how it was handled.
","The author Andy Weir must be very upset with how his incredible book was watered down from a survival story to a vacation on Mars. Since he had no creative control, we can only blame Drew Goddard (screenplay) and Ridley Scott (director).<br/><br/>The book is filled with science, math, intelligence, problem solving, tension, obstacles, survival and wise-ass remarks. Sadly, they decided to keep in the wise-ass comments and cut the rest.<br/><br/>The movie feels like the main character is on a 2 year vacation on Mars, rather than fighting for his life and struggling to survive, like in the book. Day after day, he just waits to be rescued, without having to overcome much. This is my main problem with this film. They removed mostly all of the obstacles that Mark had to overcome to survive, and just glossed over what he did overcome. These obstacles demonstrate the intelligence and resolve of the character, all which is lost in the film. Removing the obstacles also removes the tension, which the book had plenty of.<br/><br/>Here are some major obstacles that were in the book and not in the movie: <br/><br/>-Mark accidentally destroys the Pathfinder communications while drilling holes in the Rover roof. This prevents him from communicating with NASA for his entire journey to the Aries IV site. He's completely in the dark. On his own, trying to prepare for the LONG trip. Keeping this in would have added suspension that the filmed lacked.<br/><br/>-While en route to the Aries IV site, Mark encounters a dust storm that delays his journey. The dust storm prevents the sun from recharging his Rover batteries via the solar panels. Mark has to figure out a way around the storm without dying, and also has time against him. He must avoid the storm and still make it to the Aries site before the MAV launches. This again would have added tension, conflict, and suspense. All missing from the film. In the film he just gets in his rover, and a few days later, arrives 3200km away, exactly where he needs to. It's lazy.<br/><br/>-Mark finally overcomes the storm, figures out a solution, and cheats death. Back on track, just as he's nearing the Aries IV site, he goes off a ridge and flips his rovers and almost dies again. He has to problem solve to get to the MAV site on time before the launch. This would have added more tension, more suspense...all which is lost in the film version.<br/><br/>-The book has Mark deploying a pop-up tent from the Rover Airlock to sleep in on his journey. The movie skips all of this, and instead show him sleeping under the rover...in the freezing mars atmosphere. It was interesting to me in the book how he crafted a custom tent for his bedroom for the journey.<br/><br/>-The book goes into detail on survival on a foreign planet, with numbers to back it up. It explains everything in the HAB, and what it's for. The film merely mentions a few key things, but never explains what they are for. Like how does he have enough oxygen to survive? How is he removing the CO2 from the air so that it doesn't reach toxic levels? This would have been great to show Mark figuring these out on screen in real time. Show how smart he is...that maybe he can get out of this if he puts his mind to it. All skipped. I can't believe they don't mention oxygen supply once. They assume if he's in a suit, he can breath.<br/><br/>""I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this."" ... So much so that you won't even know he used any science at all..<br/><br/>What's so great in the book is how Mark is able to MacGyver everything, and overcome all of the obstacles that come in his way in order to survive. When you remove all of those obstacles, it just feels like Mark is waiting on another planet for his friends to pick him up. It loses all tension, all suspense...they took way too many shortcuts.<br/><br/>You may argue that time was an issue, and that is why those scenes were cut. Nah...I don't need the final celebration scenes in the movie, the post credit roll that highlights the actors, the final scene where Mark is an instructor. Cut all that out and put in the good stuff. The stuff that life is about...obstacles and overcoming them.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it's lazy, and doesn't do the book justice. If you want the real movie experience where you actually care about the characters and what's transpiring, listen to book."
"Quinoa1984","10","22","54","5 October 2015"," a thoughtful, exciting, crowd-pleasing movie about problem-solving
","It's great to see characters think and actively searching for a solution to a problem. That was one of the driving forces of Apollo 13 (remember, ""fit that, with that, using nothing but that""), and other films dealing with survival often have that as a crux of the narrative. But The Martian isn't something where the filmmakers are trying to do a lot with a little dialog, like All is Lost or Cast Away. There are stretches without talking, but not as many as you'd expect; as the audience we're filled in often about what processes are going on and how things keep evolving (or, sometimes, breaking down miserably) in the search for how to keep astronaut/Botanist Mark Watley a) alive and b) bring him back home. It is a splendid piece of big, mainstream entertainment because it really digs in in ways that invite the audience in, while constantly keeping things entertaining and amusing.<br/><br/>The Martian is about a man left behind by his crew (not their fault, they genuinely thought he was a goner), and how he has to find ways to stay alive, to give himself food and, most importantly, send word to NASA that he's alive and well and can they maybe send some supplies and oh does the crew know yet? It's got a lot of science to it - as Damon says in the trailer that most have seen, ""I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this"" - but, more often than not, it's accessible and easy enough to understand. That is, of course, if you're not too scared by science fiction (or, as the filmmaker and actors have talked about in press interviews, science 'fact', as everything, save for us presently going to the moon with men/women on a ship, is plausible). <br/><br/>It's a movie about how to keep humanity in all its dimensions going through the perils of space. And, as we see, space is nothing if not indifferent; it acts, particularly on Mars, as a place where nothing really grows, storms can knock the hell out of things if items or persons aren't fastened tight, and if anything comes loose, watch out for the air and pressure to possibly kill you. On the level of threats, director Ridley Scott and especially screenwriter Drew Goddard (taking, from what I've been told, faithfully from Andy Weir's best-seller), it's high and pretty constant, and there is always that sense even when things are going well that they can break down at any time. While I never thought watching it 'Oh, maybe he won't get back or might die', as the conclusion seems clear since we are meant to like this guy and want to see him live/return, the threats and obstacles are presented expertly, with a lot of excellent pacing giving us breathing room.<br/><br/>The 'breathing room' part is what I mean by this being a crowd- pleasing, entertaining flick. Goddard, previously of Cabin in the Woods, is adept at giving actors funny things to say, and The Martian is just good but basic sci-fi without the wit. Some of it may seem obvious - Watley is saddled with one of the other astronauts' musical selection (disco, which he grows to kind of like in a begrudging sort of way) - but a lot of it is due to personality, from him as well as those at mission control (Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, a very funny Donald Glover, Jessica Chastain and Kate Mara are part of what is actually a giant supporting cast). These are serious scientists and people trying to do their jobs in (mostly) responsible ways, but how they talk is closer to how one might see people talk in, say, the real world; this isn't the tone-deaf wit of Prometheus, and it's funnier than what Gravity previously tried to do. I was surprised how much I was laughing during The Martian.<br/><br/>But it's deep down a drama, and led by Matt Damon in a performance that makes this director-writer-actor triangle complete for the audience. He has to hold down major chunks of the film, albeit there is a lot with NASA and the other ship with Chastain and so on, and without making this man believable in his serious scientific intellect, his ways of making things light (or cursing, which is interesting that they get away with a PG-13 here by the way through bleeps), and real pathos, the movie won't work, or nearly as well. He delivers up to what the script asks, and it, plus Scott's visual scope and control of the pacing, make this an exceptional Hollywood movie. We get to see how process works in a crisis, and that's always character-building and interesting (when written well) in a movie; that it's at this level of A-list makes The Martian a special film, and one of Scott's best."

","An famous (or infamous for it's amazing distillation of emotion) exclamation crept into my mind while taking in Ridley Scott's ""The Martian"": ""oh, the humanity"". Humanity, this is what makes this movie rise above the Sci-Fi norm.. One thing is certain and that is man's humanity is his biggest asset and most vulnerable Achilles heel. Mix in ample helpings of hubris which often sets in motion a chain of events forcing a fierce reckoning - ""The Martian"" is not a bad reflection of mankind's quest for meaning and progress in the untamed world around us.<br/><br/>For the casual viewer this movie fits within a person's reasonable perspective of something that could be real in the not too distant future. The ""real"" science, isn't too much of the story told here - it fades into a non-issue for the most part. So, we get a real compelling struggle with maybe not the absolute reality of movie such as Everest, but certainly enthralling.<br/><br/>The story moves linearly with just a few flashbacks that aid one to invest in the characters, especially Matt Damon. His character is one you immediately feel an attachment for, plus his character supported by a stellar bit of well written characters.. This is a better than just good story with a nicely realized cast of characters. A wonderful humanistic long-shot survival story its brought to life engaging the viewer rapturously. <br/><br/>Speaking of Matt Damon, he really is perfect here. It would be hard to imagine anyone, even a young Tom Hanks, being the combination of likable and all-importantly: believable. The viewer immediately is cast in with astronaut Mark Watney's dilemma. Entertaining, but with profound dialogue such as ""everywhere I go I am the first person who has ever been here"" really bring home the journey of man we are still striving for. In fact, even more than the amazing visuals of a striking Mars a second viewing is likely needed to absorb all the quirks of mankind hidden in plain sight in the dialogue itself. Truly both topical and deep thoughts just as we all experience in this thing called lifeexpertly done as entertainment.<br/><br/>The Martian is not unlike a re-imagining of the Apollo 13 story. It has that unique intersection of the unthinkable, humanity's will to survive, science, and something spiritually up-lifting. It works as entertainment as well as something deeper we all have in our soul. Bravo! Highly recommended."

Often times it's best to be surprised by what happens as a movie progresses, and this film provides a few surprises, but isn't immune to predictability either.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for the plot to thicken and you'll be on the edge of your seat for most of the movie. Humor is injected intermittently and it keeps 'The Martian' from becoming too intense to enjoy. I found the pace to be balanced and just right for viewing, considering it runs just over 2 1/4 hours.<br/><br/>The scenery is simply awesome. 'The Martian' holds it's own when compared to recent and similar Sci-Fi films such as, 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar'. The views are breathtaking and the ones responsible for the visuals in the film should be applauded.<br/><br/>I was pleased with the cast overall. Jessica Chastain puts in a great performance. Matt Damon was at his best throughout the film. In my opinion, it may be his best performance since 'Good Will Hunting'.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I say this. Don't even read the description or watch any trailers. You just may spoil one of the year's finest films."

"MongoLloyd","Null","11","24","5 November 2015"," NO character arc. NO character development.
","Once upon a time, screenwriters exposed the ""inner life"" of the main characters through a thoughtful series of expository scenes in a film preceding the main storyline. In doing so, a viewer would come to an understanding of the character and developed an interest in their well-being and imminent growth.<br/><br/>Flaws and character exposed, the screenplay would feature at its core a protagonist who struggled with obstacles to achieve a goal, and in doing so would experience quantifiable growth by the end of the screen story. This is known as a ""character arc,"" and gives a viewer a resolution in the sense that the protagonist changed for the better by the end of the film, and may very well have achieved a goal (or may not have.) <br/><br/>This film has neither of the above and instead jumps head first into a narrative that while it is compelling, left me with little real interest in the end result of the protagonist. The story is compelling, but I found myself with a feeling genuine dissatisfaction by the end due to distinct lack of partnership with the protagonist and his struggle. <br/><br/>If you like films based on a compelling point of departure that offer little more than production value, A-list acting talent, and special effects, then this is for you."

"dirty_chords","4","9","19","9 October 2015"," Realistic NASA propaganda
","Talking about a realistic film...<br/><br/>When a mission in Mars goes wrong, the astronaut crew hurriedly departs from the planet. A crew member (Mark Watney, played by Matt Damon) has an accident and is left behind. He is presumed dead by everyone. NASA issues a statement about it, while the crew is on its way back. Everything's OK up to this point.<br/><br/>When it is revealed to NASA that Mark Watney is alive, the organization has two options: <br/><br/>1) Let the world know they mistakenly left an astronaut alone in Mars (gain bad publicity) and be forced to launch a multimillion rescue mission with high probability of failure (NASA's budget and reputation at stake). And all these, just for one man.<br/><br/>2) Silence the employee's who know about it (by any means possible) and let Mark Watney die. Nobody will ever know, hence NASA doesn't get bad publicity and saves hundred millions of dollars (to say the least).<br/><br/>Guess what... They went for #1! And the Chinese helped them too! Now, this is what I call PROPAGANDA.<br/><br/>In addition, the film suffers from an extremely bad sense of humour. I honestly found the ""disco"" cue pathetic, but I guess it's a matter of personal taste.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I actually enjoyed this movie. It has great cinematography (not Interstellar standards but still commendable) and overall it is good fun, but obviously it can't be taken seriously."
"PrashunChakraborty","6","9","19","8 October 2015"," Not bad but is it good? Maybe. Great? Nope no way.
","To start off, I will say that I think this movie is quite decent and watchable, it may even be considered good if one's feeling generous, but it's far from being considered even close to great. To know why I think so, continue reading. The things to like about this movie are present on the surface, good acting, good cinematography, decent direction, Matt Damon plays a likable eternal optimist who actually makes a lot of effort to survive and I really was liking the film till the first half, some minor discrepancies here and there but nothing major, then the quality took a significant drop. At one point well into the second half a plan to rescue Mark Watney (Matt Damon) falls apart and the chips are down, NASA is cornered, and suddenly the Chinese step in to help out Watney....this is bad writing 101. What if the Chinese had failed, who else did you have? Russia? India? At that point it was clear that Mark Watney was not going to die because the writer doesn't want him to die; the writer will go to absurd lengths to keep him alive, and warp common sense if need be. Any film that introduces these ""convenient act of god solutions"" loses the faith of the audience; up til that point I was so emotionally invested in the film and suddenly it felt as if the film had betrayed my trust, and when that happened I stopped caring about Watney because what's the point? The film will pull out another ace out of their sleeve the next time the stakes are high. This is the biggest flaw of The Martian, no matter how accurate and scientific it was it was illogical (yes both are exclusive concepts to one another), and whenever the ""shit was about to hit the ceiling"" I knew everything was going to work out and that made this movie painfully predictable. Don't get me wrong I thought it was a decent film, there are a handful of tidbits I enjoyed, I liked that Ridley Scott imitated the surgery scene from his Prometheus but it's not even half as grueling as Prometheus' C-section self surgery, kind of a self appreciation sequence there but I enjoyed it. Also I liked Matt Damon's role he was earnest but don't expect anything at the level of Sandra Bullock in Gravity or Tom Hanks in Castaway (similar situation though not in space). The supporting cast is excellent as well, Chiwetel Ejiofor is the second lead and is fantastic in this film as Vincent Kapoor, a role originally meant for India's Irrfan Khan who had to pass on this because he was committed to multiple other films, that's a shame because he could have really left a mark here. Jessica Chastain is very good in her small role but her screen time is too brief, an actor of her caliber deserves better. Michael Pena played the usual big hearted lovable Mexican like he has done maybe 500 times before? One of the most talented Latino actor in Hollywood and he get's stuck with the same old shtick in every movie. Rest are OK and get the job done. I was also quite irritated by Community' s Donald Glover who is supposed to be a bright physicist but can't join two sentences together and acts like a complete buffoon which was almost physically painful to watch. I also wished the movie gave some screen time to Watney's parents, it was expressly said in the film they were close and it's odd to see the whole world cheering and rooting for Watney and his parents don't show up and their side of the story is not explored. The film also drew a chuckle from me when Sean Bean's character at NASA explains why a certain project was named Elrond (I am huge LOTR nerd). The good news is at least it's better than Exodus which was borderline unwatchable, and a very small improvement over Prometheus. The Martian is a classic example of a movie which has accurate science and still is illogical while some other films may have inaccurate science but are better movies than The Martian because they are logical and play within the rules set in their universe. In conclusion, I would recommend watching Gravity instead, a better film with better editing,acting, direction and tighter run time (91 minutes) compared to The Martian (141 minutes)."
"ericwatkinson","5","9","19","7 October 2015"," It Won't Really Make An Impression On You
","I began to feel somewhat uneasy about the storyline when during the opening sequence of the film, the huge NASA lander was suddenly struck by a violent hurricane force winds on the surface of Mars. The huge multi-story lander ship becomes at-risk for toppling over in the strong winds, and for the next few minutes the camera frantically cuts back and forth between a computer screen indicating the ship's angle of tilt in the wind, and several crewman who are excitedly urging the captain to launch in the middle of the violent wind storm. Presumably the sequence in which the lander nearly topples over in the wind storm was supposed to build suspense, but rather than building suspense it simply came across as a tired sci-fi cliché, reminiscent of the scene in the movie 2012, in which all of the main characters watched a digital clock count down the number of seconds until the monster wave arrived. Come on Hollywood, the audience is smarter than that! <br/><br/>For the most part Matt Damon does a passable job of pretending to be an astronaut stranded on Mars, but his character lacks any of the emotional depth displayed by Tom Hank's character in the movie Cast Away. Although Damon's character eventually looks like he could use a shave and a haircut, he always appears as though he just stepped out of the gym, and his eyes are always twinkling for the camera. (I suspect that middle-aged mothers taking their young sons to see this movie will enjoy Damon's character.) <br/><br/>Additionally, I really wanted to believe that Jeff Daniels was capable of playing the complex role of a NASA bureaucrat, but Daniels' character seems more like a shallow blow dried character from some anti-Wall Street movie, rather than someone with a scientific background.<br/><br/>The rest of the NASA ground crew is made up of the usual predictable quirky nerd characters, and absolutely none of the Earth bound characters seem real, or deliver performances that are memorable or worthwhile. Another annoyance with this film is the fact that Damon's character constantly proclaims that he will use ""Science"" in order to stay alive, but the film itself is absolutely choked full of all sorts of glaring scientific flaws, beginning with the hurricane force storm at the beginning of the movie. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that ""The Martian"" isn't a tense science fiction thriller, with at least some pretense of accuracy (Contact, Deep Impact, or Gravity) but on the other hand the film also lacks any real action or suspense such as ""Mission to Mars"", or ""Red Planet"". It is a very confused film. The only saving grace this film has is the stunning vista shots of Mars, which appear to look absolutely authentic. Go ahead and see it, but a few days later you won't even think about it afterwards."

"MattBrady099","6","10","22","7 October 2015"," The Martian is absolutely worth checking out
","Mark Watney: ""F**k you Mars"".<br/><br/>The story is about astronaut Mark Watney is separated from his party following a fierce storm and left behind after being presumed dead. But he has survived and with few supplies, he will have to rely on his own ingenuity to survive and figure out a way to Earth that he is still alive.<br/><br/>You can slap Ridley Scott's name on anything and everyone (including me) will go see it. It's so awesome that you still can go to the cinema today and see a new film directed by the guy who brought us Alien, now that's freaking awesome. But Ridley can be a hit or miss with the movies that he's releasing recently such as: Robin Hood, The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, but Prometheus (In my opinion) was pretty good and I know a lot of people may not like that movie and that's okay if you didn't like it, but I did. When I first heard about The Martian being directed by Ridley Scott, I was exciting but nervous at the same time, because as I said before about Ridley being a mix bag recently. But I kept a positive and open mind, I mean this might be the film that Ridley Scott finally went back to he's roots from the good old days. <br/><br/>After seeing The Martian on my first viewing I liked it, but I wasn't amazed by it. It's not until the movie actually started to grow on me as I thought about it more and more, and now after thinking about it for awhile now, I can safely say that The Martian is a great movie. Ridley Scott's back everyone.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Mark Watney brilliantly in this movie and this might actually be the best performance I've seen from Damon. He's hilarious, always positive and never gives up even when a lot of things don't go quite as planned, he always finds away. I also love how Damon's character can crack a joke there and then even when he's in this horrible situation; and to me it made he's character more relatable and likable. This is Matt Damon finest work as he was terrific in this movie.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's directing in this movie was absolutely magnificent and this has to be one of he's best films in years. The movie isn't all hilarious as there were some real suspenseful scenes in this movie, but what I thought was so brilliantly well done is that Ridley Scott mixed the humor and the suspense perfectly together. Nicely done Ridley. <br/><br/>The rest of cast: Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ekiofor were all freaking great in this movie. Everyone in this movie was great.<br/><br/>The writing has to be the biggest strength in this whole movie, because it was clever, funny, never lost me attention and it had a fantastic sense of humor to itself. It matched the tone of the movie perfectly as I felt that The Martian needed this type of tone. <br/><br/>Now for the problems: My only flaw in this movie is this 25 minute sequence where it cuts back to earth with the NASA crew talking about different ways of bringing Mark back, but the stuff on Mars was more interesting. I'm not saying it was bad as the earth stuff scene was handled well and it was very well acted, but I was more interested on the stuff that was happening on Mars with Damon's character. <br/><br/>Overall The Martian is absolutely worth checking out. This is Ridley Scott's and Matt Damon's best work in years. It's beautifully shot, well acted and a entertaining movie."

Next to that the film had a lot of humor as well, which was very wise , since the plot at times was kinda slow.... This made sure you were never bored.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was perfect for the role.I also wanna add that it was great for me as a Norwegian to see one of my countrymen star in a Hollywood movie.

","You, lucky guy. One day you got stamped Blade Runner on your forehead and we get distracted by this when there is a new flick with your name showing up on screens. Well, no longer for me. I praise you for the 1982 film, but that will be all. Maybe back then you had a good team, a more flexible budget, or more freedom from the producers. Not going to call you a one wonder hit, only by respect for the quality of the movie that is still linked today to your name.<br/><br/>But ever since, things (movies) were all of the same unnoticeable artistic achievement. Yes there have been some Oscars along the way. But Oscar means more blockbuster vibe than artistic accomplishment.<br/><br/>Nothing new with the Martian either. Except maybe the plot is something more of a theater play. Dry in action, emotions, suspense, novelty. It feels like Mars. Dry and lifeless. As lifeless as this long term traveling space ships interior design.<br/><br/>There are however moments when something seems to be happening. There are some potential powerful emotional moments but they get scrapped. For example, when he gets off Mars and is about to return to the ship that will get him back home, what a potentially powerful and magical moment to catch his emotions as he sees humans for the first time after such a long period. Instead, the film chooses to replace such scene some useless last-moment out of the frame action event. Why? Why replacing such a moment that has built up from the beginning of the movie with some cheap action? It's like throwing in the garbage bin a $500,000 Pre-Columbian statue that you carelessly bough off a garage sale because it didn't match your dining room walls color."

Writers managed to put just enough of that comedy element in a non-comedy movie to make it perfect. Does not get boring for a second, always keeps it interesting.<br/><br/>If you like ""Interstellar"" by Christopher Nolan make sure to go see this movie.

"andycromptonez","6","7","14","7 October 2015"," Sporadically entertaining but slighter than expected.
","Ridley Scott's latest arrived with a significant measure of critical praise, but ultimately left me feeling a little disappointed. It's neither funny enough to be a comedy, nor tense enough to be an edge-of-the-seat thriller. <br/><br/>Opening up with a scene of scientists operating on planet Mars, a storm hits the site and as the astronauts make their escape, Matt Damon's botanist, Mark Watney is left behind when hit by flying debris. <br/><br/>The initial scenes of Watney attending to his wounds, realising he has to survive for potentially years before being rescued, and then setting about his tech- survivalist existence is pretty entertaining. However, as Earth and, later, his former crew on board space station Hermes learn that he has survived, the film starts to unravel. A stellar but unwieldy cast begin planning his rescue, via a series of clichéd press conferences, bizarre skype calls with Bruce Ng, the director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and meetings with Sean Bean's Mitch Henderson, struggling to act his way out of a (now 5p) pound shop bag. <br/><br/>I found that once Watney had solved a few problems, his plight became less and less interesting, when all signs pointed to a successful, against all the odds, rescue by his former crew on Hermes. Don Glover's appearance as, ahem, astrodynamicist Rich Purnell allowed the former Community star to go through his full range of facial gurns, but, in the end, was just yet another character at NASA we didn't need. Add to this Kristen Wiig's pointless turn as a NASA PR guru and we end up with a galaxy of stars fighting for screen time.<br/><br/>On board the Hermes, Michael Pena's Martinez is a fun character and featured in my favourite scene, darkly cajoling Watney for being a botanist. However, the ensuing decision for all to add 500+ days to their mission time to rescue him is slightly preposterous. This would be forgivable if the rescue mission itself wasn't so predictable. I also didn't find Damon's Watney in any way as charming as other people seem to have and was praying vainly he'd suffocate out in space. <br/><br/>I think the recent spate of intelligent sci fi movies has led to a new audience, which can only be a good thing. However, I just feel this has maybe meant a less critical eye is being cast. It's entertaining in parts, but compared to the likes of Interstellar it's far too slight. Compare it to Duncan Jones' Moon and it lacks enough pathos. Compare it to Edge of Tomorrow and it's not enough fun. Wait until it's on DVD."
"bardia-moose","8","52","157","17 September 2015"," I'm going to have to review the sh*t out of this
","THE MARTIAN follows botanist Mark Watney who, during a manned mission to Mars, is hit by a fierce storm and left behind by his crew who presume that he's dead. But little did they know that he's still very much alive, stranded on the hostile planet. With limited resources at hand, Watney must draw upon his ingenuity in order to survive. <br/><br/>Having only seen the trailers, I went into this film unaware of how much humor there would actually be. In that regard, it's quite faithful to the source material; Drew Goddard was able to inherit author Andy Weir's snarky dialogue and translate it from the pages of a novel onto the pages of a screenplay, while Sir Ridley Scott brought it all to life. <br/><br/>Speaking of Ridley Scott, it looked as if the legendary director's best days were behind him, entering a career slump of sorts with The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, both of which were dull and uninspired chapters of his otherwise impressive filmography. THE MARTIAN, however, marks Ridley Scott 's return to form. It's captivating from beginning to end, enjoyable from beginning to end, and is full of personality from, you guessed it, beginning to end.<br/><br/>A lot of that personality, if not all of it, is due to the incredible group of actors that have been rounded up here, most notably Matt Damon. If not for him and the way he charismatically delivers his lines the sarcastic dialogue, which is really just Damon talking to a video recorder, would 've just ended up being really awkward. Chewitel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain both make strong impressions as well, along with the rest of the cast who have small, yet potent moments of their own. <br/><br/>Despite having convincing performances, the film didn't do as good of a job trying to get me to naturally invest in these characters. Sure, you care for Mark Watney's life but that's only because of the situations that the story places him in and forces him to face; there was no real emotional through line for me to grab hold of. <br/><br/>But the thing that stops me from calling THE MARTIAN ""great"" is that it's a very safe, by the numbers, sci-fi film. It doesn't have the technical drive of Gravity or the emotional punch of Interstellar; it's very good, but it could've been so much more."
"smvouriot","6","8","17","5 November 2015"," Good but nothing mind blowing
","The Martian was an entertaining movie, however don't be fooled by the ridiculously high ratings that this is a classic, intense experience that is on par with Gravity. The film underachieves in far too many categories for this to become even a worthy comparison. The film boasts fantastic visual effects and the Mars atmosphere is rendered beautifully, however the main issues inherent with the film reside mostly in the script and tone the filmmakers choose to employ in order to tell this story.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film's mostly light tone cannot compensate for it's sprawling 140 minute length. Throughout the film, astronaut Mark Watney (Likably played by Matt Damon) is relentlessly optimistic about his predicament. So optimistic in fact that, apart from a couple of instances of psychological breakdowns, Mark is portrayed as ultimately a flawless character. This results in the film not being nearly as interesting or engaging as it could be, as the audience rarely gets the sense that Mark's situation could very well end in death. This lack of character depth transcends to the countless other characters on Earth. There are many great actors here, but because of the limitations of the script, none of them ever really rise above the stereotypes or caricatures in their respective characters.<br/><br/>The overall light tone of the film gives off the sense that not much is at stake, therefore resulting in a much less compelling film had it been made as a more serious drama. Despite being released around Oscar season, the film gives off the impression that it would have been more at home during the summer blockbuster season, as the frequent wisecracks, retro soundtrack and jokey tone are far more reminiscent of the Marvel movies than films like Gravity or Interstellar. This means that the film begins to grow slightly tedious in it's latter half, as the 140 minute film begins to drag because of the lack of intensity and urgency.<br/><br/>A curious thing, however, is that despite this length, director Ridley Scott chooses to rush through many defining moments of the film. For example, literally within the first few minutes Mark is left behind on Mars by his crew. While this does make for a fairly riveting and exciting opening, the cost of character development and the chance to really get invested in Mark's relationship with his crewmates is too great. Scott also rushes through Mark's rescue sequence at the end of the film, which is a shame since it's a key moment in the film and what is there is quite enthralling. It's just that the main problem with this scene is that it's a glimmer of what The Martian could have been, intense, life threatening situations dramatically conveyed with atmospheric space visuals.<br/><br/>Overall, The Martian is a disappointment. It is a film that failed to deliver on it's potential. I have not read the book the movie was based on so I can't comment on how faithful to the source material it is, but overall, I was let down by The Martian. The character development was lacking and the choice to tell this story with a light tone just didn't completely work for a 140 minute film, as it rarely feels that nothing is at stake, which resulted in a predictable movie. While it seems that most audiences are embracing the lighter and jokier vibe this film has, it unfortunately becomes the film's undoing, as the comedy robs the story of dramatic tension."
"corindon7","3","8","17","24 October 2015"," What about the ethics of it all?
","As they say, my first IMDb review. I am just surprised (and worried) of the amount of people praising this movie and calling it the best movie ever. It makes me suspect they are either very young, or very ignorant. None of my business, but an 8 for this film is an insult to cinematography. <br/><br/>I will skip the part with the scientific implausibility of it all, since I am no master in Physics/Botany. It's a Hollywood movie, I would have tolerated it. I will also choose to ignore the bad acting, shallow lines and virtually no character development. <br/><br/>What bothered me most was the absence of humanity in it. First, I couldn't see the characters as real humans, with feelings other than Hollywoodian bravery. The main character spends years in complete seclusion, yet we never see him having a breakdown or considering suicide. I understand astronauts have a strong psychological profile and that it might have been ironic to see Matt Damon going crazy again on a foreign planet, but it'd have been way more humanly understandable.<br/><br/>Also, his team has no second thoughts in abandoning their families some months more in order to engage in a dangerous and not very certain rescue operation. I'm no astronaut, obviously, but I'm quite sure they are human too, and must have at least some selfish impulses, if not acts. I also found it funny how they *subtly* let us know the captain is happily married, so that we do not suspect some erotic/love interests in the operation.<br/><br/>Last but not least, what is all this fuss about rescuing Matt Damon and spending zillions of dollars and energy on this mission? I can understand the idealism of it, I just find it is painfully ironic that not even one character in the whole movie mentions the tremendous cost&absurdity of the mission. Thousands of people die daily due to absence of food, water or medical supplies, there are wars storming across the world, diseases, refugee crisis, and all the earth cares for is saving this one person who is very good at growing potatoes using their own poop.<br/><br/>I understand the thing that humanity needs to be evolving, and that space seems to be our next level of discovery. It just seems to me we're forgetting of the humans right next to us in the process.<br/><br/>Ah, and another aspect I did not enjoy at all was the part where the martian gets rid of the extra weight in his spacecraft, leaving it abandoned on Mars. It was just a painful reminder of how people tend to leave mess no matter where they go, as long as it's for their own sake.<br/><br/>All in all, an incredibly superficial and sad movie. I'd have appreciated to have at least one skeptical character in it."

Also, Matt Damon's performance in this is incredible, he was born to play Mark Watney. And not just him, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor and the whole cast was great.

","I enjoyed this movie, but I didn't love it, not like I loved Gravity. That doesn't go to say though that the acting wasn't amazing, the science wasn't well thought out and the graphics and CGI weren't all very well done, because they were!<br/><br/>I think what was missing for me was that complete sense of loneliness and that eerie feeling that I feel being alone on a massive planet, with barely any communication with anyone, and no life besides him and his crops, honestly, that part could have been done better. Think about it, how damn scary would that be, knowing that you won't see anyone or talk to anyone in many many years. I know I would feel pretty scared.<br/><br/>It was a great movie though, and I assume it will be up for some awards. I recommend seeing it at the movies so you can get that atmosphere from watching it on the big screen, and when a movie with space is involved I always recommend seeing it at the movies as it creates that whole sense of a large space, a very large space.<br/><br/>Most viewers will love it!

","The Martian to me is another Hollywood, overcoming all odds, feel good movie, the science isn't exactly at the top of the list and this can be seen (if you know Mars weather patterns) straight from the off ,fortunately for the viewer the suspension of belief is rewarded with some amazing views of the red planet and some actual real life science and applications that could really work on mars. Matt Damon does a pretty solid Job as Mark Watney and I did actually feel myself routing for the character so in my opinion if you wanna go watch a pretty good sci fi movie with no real antagonists that has top notch shots of space and mars and spaceships with no aliens or weird stuff or mind boggling equations etc then watch this if not go watch Interstellar or Contact either way I prefer this a lot more than both them and I thought they were good ."

The schmaltzy ending was nauseating and unnecessary. There was too much scientifically impossible stuff (just as unnecessary).

","Despite some recent missteps Ridley Scott will always be one of my all time favourite directors and The Martian just further solidifies this for me because I believe this stands up there with Gladiator and Blade Runner as his best and was my favourite movie of 2015. Matt Damon is incredible in this movie with out a doubt the best performance in a Ridley Scott movie since Russell Crowe in Gladiator and in my opinion should have took home the Oscar for this movie he's amazing with the comedy and the emotion the little moments where his armour starts to crack no you think he wants to give up but he never does, that's what makes Mark Watney such a great protagonist he's easy to get behind and never bores the audience. While nobody steals the spotlight from Damon, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain both hold their own in supporting roles they're more than able to keep the audience invested while we're not on Mars. Speaking of the Red Planet it looks incredible, life like even. You truly care about Mark Witney getting home because you realise how hard he is fighting to survive every time he succeeds you hope it last but quickly realise that it won't and that makes for some truly heartbreaking scenes. The special effects are also amazing in this film their not overused their used sparingly only to advance the plot and put you more into the situation. The arc on earth, while definitely not as interesting as Mars, is still great to watch your behind them 100% to succeed and you truly believe that everyone is important in the rescue mission and that nobody is expendable and with a cast this big that is truly impressive. <br/><br/>The Martian is a masterpiece it's got amazing performances, direction and production design it's a perfectly balanced movie that never leaves you bored and leaves me hoping that Ridley Scott will keep that up. <br/><br/>A+/100%"

"fabkingcliff","6","4","7","15 January 2016"," Diamond in the rough...
","The Martian is one of those films that we've grown to be accustomed to; an interesting premise, good cast and promising plot with a lot of potential but that fails at delivery. The Martian is like a great business idea that fails to meet practicality. The Martian is like stolen intellectual property whereby the culprit finally realizes he doesn't really know how to make it productive. The Martian is like having a magic wand and not knowing what to do with it.<br/><br/>An astronaut is left for dead by his crew on a desolate hostile planet 50 million kilometers from Earth after a violent storm having only a few days' supply of food, water and oxygen. Any emergency rescue mission to the planet, Mars, to save him would still take 4 years to arrive. He is alone. He cannot communicate with Earth or members of his crew who are now half way through their journey back home, believing him to be dead. Interesting premise isn't it? Indeed, until you see what the storyline does to it.<br/><br/>Here is a cheery Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who learns of his fate and his response is a few lame jokes directed at a camcorder where he practically gives the audience fun facts about Mars, science and Botany. He keeps talking while constantly nibbling on God-knows-what, which was quite annoying IMO, jokes non-stop about the bad disco music that his mission commander left and practically enjoys his solo stay on Mars. Not the reaction one would expect, eh? I guess being stranded alone on planet Mars with 68 sols' (Mars days) provision of food and water isn't such a bummer after all. Mark's attitude toward his situation is as if he merely just woke up and found he had the whole house to himself so he does the Salsa across the living room in his drawers and showers without the curtains.<br/><br/>We expect a lot of tension, drama, panic attacks, agoraphobia, loneliness, fear, hopelessness, bouts of insanitybut no; Mark Watney is quite content with his situation. He might as well build a golf course with all his Botany ingenuity and/or a Holiday Inn. Mark solves every problem one by one as they come to him. Basically nothing bad happens to him. At least HE has a magic wand and he knows how to use it.<br/><br/>The story itself is not very realistic. When the director of NASA learns that the Chinese have agreed to lend them a spacecraft that they've been building in secret to save a man they couldn't care less about, his response over the phone (with the director of the Chinese space agency) is ""oh okay, I understand. Thank you"" then hangs up and says ""yes!"" Like a high school kid whose crush just accepted to be his prom date. He might as well have said ""Oh okay, I understand. Thank you, by the way what music are you currently listening to? Have you tried our Justin Bieber?"" We are also told that messages between Earth and Mars have a 30 minute delay but when Mark Watney finally finds a way to communicate with NASA, the conversations go so smoothly it could have been via KIK or IM.<br/><br/>Matt Damon himself was good but he clearly didn't take the role too seriously. The fact that they had to use a body double to show his weight loss gives an idea of the amount of dedication he gave to the film. Recall what Christian Bale did for The Machinist? And he wasn't even stranded on a planet 100 million miles away; he lived across from a Chick-fil-A and Pizza Hut.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT. If you haven't watched the movie this is where you should stop reading this review.<br/><br/>The ending of the film could very well be the most disappointing part. I comforted myself after the lack of drama with the thought that in the end, when Mark Watney is supposed to leap from his spacecraft towards the returned crew in the vastness of space, all the tension would pour in. It does not. He might as well have gotten to them on a hoverboard with both hands in his pockets. Mark is really one lucky bastard huh?<br/><br/>The Martian is a visual spectacle with very believable Martian landscape, space exploration apparatus and (not so) believable space science, but sadly that is all. It fails to explore all possibilities that the premise offers and instead relies on fratboy humor the likes of ""my balls are frozen!"" and ""take that, Neil Armstrong!"" It is a film about the psychological effects of being stranded alone on an unfriendly planet zillions of miles from home, but it hardly shows any. <br/><br/>I didn't hate the movie, nor do I advise not to see it, but I didn't love it either even though it is signed by the great Ridley Scott. It won't be registered as a classic but it'll surely seduce The Academy who are too often impressed with high production value, familiar leading heads and unnecessarily long running yarns."
"johnplocar","8","4","7","9 January 2016"," Like everyone else has already said...it's Scott's best in a few years now.
","""The Martian"": This was one I wanted to see in the theater because I'm a pretty big Ridley Scott fan, unfortunately never got the opportunity; like most people who got into sci-fi, I can thank Scott for that since he's contributed so much to the genre. I won't claim that this movie is his next big contribution to the sci-fi genre that will change things forever like his past films ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"", but this is pretty good. I thought that this was a good time, I don't know if it needed to be two and a half hours long; when it comes to the length of a movie I would kind of prefer that if a science fiction flick has a runtime over two hours long that it be a little more innovative or provocative than something like this, but it was consistently entertaining so I can totally give it a pass for that.<br/><br/>I don't really want to get much into the story because the plot is pretty simple, rather not spoil what happens. If you have seen the trailers then it's pretty easy to gather what the movie is about; Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is stranded on Mars with very limited amounts of food and somehow has to find ways to survive alone with all these extreme scenarios happening to him until a rescue team hopefully makes it to him in time. This isn't Scott's typical dark sci-fi film though; I mean yes, you can tell he's in the director's chair but this is a bit brighter and a lot more of an optimistic film in comparison to the rest of his filmography. I say more optimistic because the lead character that is stuck on Mars, Mark Watney, stays completely positive for most of the obstacles that come. He does have his occasional moments of despair and even anger, but he keeps his chin up so he can solve the problem and move on so he can survive. It would be so easy to make this character such a downer; not doing much except brooding, which is understandable for the awful situation dealt to this character, but they don't do that and it makes this character a bit of a stand out and more interesting. Makes me like the character easier than if the writing had gone the other route to darken up his character instead because of how his whole being stranded situation starts almost from the very beginning. If he wasn't as likable as he was, then this movie could have been a long drag to watch someone to brood instead of being proactive like he ended up being. Not much else to say really; the acting was really good, the writing was solid, the direction and cinematography were of course great and I was entertained and invested the whole time. I liked it. I don't know if I would say ""best of the year"" like it seems some of the nominations from the various award ceremonies this year are announcing, but I still think it was a really good movie. This was a movie about hope, keeping a positive attitude in harsh times and being as proactive as humanly possiblethis was the anti-""War Room"" movie. If you've seen ""War Room"" then you might know what I'm talking about here, just think about it for a second. ""War Room"" when things get tough it tells you to sit in a closet, don't do anything productive except submit to your verbally abusive husband and pray about him because God will step in to take all of your problems away. Here, he doesn't just sit and wait for something hopefully good to happen or for NASA to rectify the situation. He does what he can, almost right away, to survive and improve on his bad situation. I know they are completely different scenarios, but the message is still the same. Do something yourself if you want things to change for the better, don't expect others to always do it for you. So go see this movie, it is pretty friggin' good!"
"avrylv","9","4","7","6 January 2016"," Great movie, definitely recommended.
","This movie is amazing. In case you don't know what it's about here's a quick rundown: It's about a man named Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who through a series of events is left on Mars, but that's just what the trailer will tell you. This movie obviously had the opportunity to be heartbreakingly sad ""A treacherous tale about a young man abandoned on the red planet"" but it's not. It's actually surprisingly funny. Mark Watney manages to find the humor in the situations. This movie is funny when it wants to be, sad when it wants to be, and breathtaking when it wants to be. It's all of the things you want a movie to be. I would definitely recommend this film."
"ShannonCS","10","7","15","8 January 2016"," The Best Movie I have Seen in a Long Time
","""The Martian"" kept us on the edge our seats the entire time; both with the tension and just sheer delight of this movie and storyline. I can't understand the reviewers who stated that they felt the movie lacked emotion or those who faulted numerous science situations in the story (excluding the sand storm premise).<br/><br/>Regarding emotional and the human element in the film, I think it was very well acted and various strong emotions were all through the film constantly demonstrated by Mark, his crew and the NASA staff. However, it's possible that the reviewers didn't see a reaction like they would have had under the same circumstances. What should be kept in mind is that astronauts are extremely well trained people, they are also literally selected for resiliency, adaptability, curiosity, ability to trust (including yourself) and creativity/resourcefulness. Mental toughness and flexibility is very desired in an astronaut; so although Mark had phases of fear, frustration, anger and depression, he quickly refocused his mind on the most important problem at the time. As he said ""You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next."" For anyone who works (or knows someone who works) in a career with constant problem solving (first responders, ER, most STEM careers, etc) this is the way one thinks and works; deal with the biggest problem first, them move onto the next and the next and the next. As Adam Savage from ""Myth Buster's"" has said ""calm people live"", so with all his training, Mark would know how to handle a crisis without freaking out. In contrast Tom Hank's character Chuck Noland, the FedEx operations executive stranded in ""Cast Away"", was more of an everyman than Astronaut Mark Watney; and thus Mark had a more controlled reaction to things.<br/><br/>As for the science situations, most people are aware the premise of the story, how Mark gets stranded and injured, is not correct for the environment of Mars. However beyond the premise, most science is pretty sound. I watch numerous videos about the science behind ""The Martian"" and the only other thing mentioned as inaccurate was that on Mars the Astronauts would bounce more in their planetary walking, and they would also likely have heavier suits. Due to some director's choices and limitations, Ridley Scott made the decision to bypass these details. Otherwise, what I have found is that Mark might have been pretty lucky but that the Science was pretty good in the movie and better in the book. I suggest everyone review a few Youtube videos on the Science of ""The Martian"" as it's some pretty interesting stuff. The movie put the Science back in Sci Fi and addition made Science cool. The movie shows intelligent men and women solving problem and there is no real 'bad guy', just Mars, which doesn't cooperate well (as Mark says). I you like the scene in ""Apollo 13"" where the engineering team quickly invents a way to make the Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles, you'll probably enjoy ""The Martian"". ""The Martian"" is the best movie I've seen in a long time and it was exciting from beginning to end, despite the fact I figured I knew the story from the previews. It's nice to see intelligent men and women working together for a common goal and using Science to triumph over major obstacles."
"aharmas","10","7","15","17 October 2015"," Scott and Damon Give Mars Back Its Good Name
","Ridley Scott has given us some of the best films ever, tackling every genre from romance to Science Fiction. We will never be able to see Science Fiction the same way after ""Alien"", which blends horror, science, and drama so well that people are still studying the film. Hearts stopped as both technology and outer space biology gave us the best monsters of the 70's. He went on to improve on ""2001"" by taking the mind of artificial intelligence and have them play God. Here, he goes back to the resilience of humans, and with a bit of humour, plenty of heart, and a very intelligent marriage of old fashioned story telling and much respect for the promising future of space travel, he gives us a new cinematic gem.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" creates a universe where a human learns to use his resources to overcome adversity and very unlucky night when he's left behind by his crew. He must find ways to survive, to let the rest of the universe, especially Earth, know that he's alive, but that also means that they must find a way to get him back and save face while dealing with politics, the limits of contemporary space science, and the ability to make a film that refrains from relying too much on special effects, but which has its feet strongly planted on common sense and realism.<br/><br/>Damon is wonderful as the man who keeps up his spirits and uses every bit of knowledge to keep going. His acting hasn't been this good since he gave us the dark leech in ""Ripley"". Here he has a heart, a brain, and plenty of courage as he faces every possible obstacle that he faces. Unlike other films out there where knives have suddenly become less lethal than before, this man is threatened by equipment that pierces his suit and his abdomen, which makes him cringe and shudder with pain and whose body shrivels as he is running out of food. There's a terrific scene where his eyes sink in despair as he is confronted with the loss of his garden, something that signifies his imminent death. He's no superman, just a regular human being who fights to keep both his body and spirit alive.<br/><br/>Almost as good as Damon are the rest of the supporting cast, which work each role to find options to bring him back to Earth. ""Gravity"" gave us plenty of thrills and emotions. Things are subdued most of the time here, but the climax is proof that people like Scott are able to use the best of what is available to them and give us quality film making. We are soon joining the rest of the human community, cheering, holding our breath, wringing our hands as we await for his success. ""Argo"" gave us a taste of what a good old fashioned crowd pleaser can do. ""The Martian"" takes it even higher because we get to bond and identify with this ""Martian"" who happens to be the best scientist on that planet.<br/><br/>Funny, exciting, rewarding, intelligent, and perfectly directed, just the way movies used to be, should be, and hopefully will be in the future.<br/><br/>Thanks Mr. Scott."
"syronth","3","7","15","16 October 2015"," A movie about some astro guy cracking jokes
","I've read the book and it's indeed not about a poor, lonely soul lost on Mars, who becomes a philosopher about death and life and is fighting depressions all the time, only getting some kind of inner relief at the end. It is not like Cast Away"" with Tom Hanks nor anything like Interstellar"" which has a whole different story.<br/><br/>It's about high tech and science, it's about a tough astronaut whose only goal is to solve the next problem, who is absolutely focusing on solutions to survive as long as he can. There are moments where he is hapless and desperate but he's got a kind of stubbornness, a special kind of will to survive that drives him through this misery. He jokes, he thinks of trivial stuff that helps him keeping his mind intact. You could say he actually denies in some way that he's the only guy on an entire planet millions of miles away from home. But the situation forces him to fight against physics and technology all the time, he just has got no time to think about to much.<br/><br/>What you get as the reader then is a spectacular story of how he manages it – against all odds. With his sheer will, his unique personality, the training and knowledge and with the help of smart, brave and very noble people. This makes this story indeed look very positive in the outcome, it describes an almost impossible effort and shows – so do I think personally – the best of us as human beings. Mark Watney survives – with luck, of course, but mainly because neither he ever gave up nor the people on earth. The climax in this plot was the most thrilling thing I've read for years. I had to shed a tear, it just blew my mind. At the end everything went to an extreme fight humans versus the universe"" which will be won by incredible smartness, braveness and by big pumping hearts in the breasts of the protagonists. In the aftermath I think it's even more than just another survival story"", it's about how far we went and how clever we've become in the great struggle of life, especially if you don't forget how much obstacles we are still throwing in our own way. It's a very utopian view, yes, but one who touches your heart if you have one.<br/><br/>The movie captured only a tiny fraction of this, unfortunately. It's a funny movie about some astro guy cracking jokes on a funky planet not far away, uhm, and some of his buddies, who help him out. Of course he survives, what else. It's Matt Damon, our hero. No explanations needed, it's all good. Thank you for watching."
"mariaandzanessa-690-316299","8","7","15","15 October 2015"," The Martian
","One of the most commercialized films this year. I saw adverts almost every day, with Matt Damon's face on the red double decker buses and amazing pictures of Jordan (which is supposed to be the planet Mars in the film) Because of that, I only wanted to see the movie even more. I was anticipating the day it would open in the nearest cinema. I am not the biggest fan of 3D movies, but this one was different. It feels like it demanded 3D. And probably, for the first time, I enjoyed a film in 3D. The scenes on Mars and in space are impeccably shot. Wouldn't expect nothing less from Ridley Scott. Those shots are pure art, a feast for your eyes. As for the story, it may not be that creative, but Matt Damon was unexpectedly funny and I laughed much more than I thought I would in such a movie. The script is well written. I spotted a few mistakes in the storyline, but they weren't that major. If the lead actor wasn't Damon, I don't know if the film would be as good, because it is hard for only one actor to carry the entire story. Film is about survival and never giving up, no matter what. It sends a powerful message. The thing I find strangest is that I heard many people ask if it was a true story. I hope after watching it, people will study Mars a bit and see that, unfortunately, we haven't been there yet. The thing that bothered me most was the fact Damon's crew members lacked enthusiasm and their reactions should have been more natural and enhanced. I gave it a solid eight. Enjoyable film. A good watch, definitely."

Thing is you probably expect plot twist, villains, unexpected moments, unresolved problems, sacrificing lives, do you want to hear which from this things happen? None of them! even in Disney films are more tension, I think we can't avoid comparing this film to Gravity and Interstellar, both are 10 times better than this.

In fact, my friend got me a extra pillow in case I needed it if the film was boring and boy, I was lucky to have that comfy pillow. This film may get the attention of sci-fi lovers but it will certainly not get the attention of those who find sci-fi films extremely boring, Interstellar was way better than this, even though it was a 2 hrs and 40 minutes film.

","First Saving Private Ryan, then Interstellar, and now The Martian. Matt Damon's the one to find. The go to guy. The one worthy of being found thrice over. Damon is Watney, a man stranded on Mars after his crew believe him dead. This film is about his survival. Suspension of disbelief is steady and highly believable, to the point of utter astonishment. It's incredible how Watney's time spent on Mars feels so real. No one has landed on Mars before, and no one probably will in our lifetime. Ridley Scott and the team behind The Martian have kept the physics clean. Watney painfully produces food and water for the long haul. Damon is mesmerising. Open spaces and long/wide angle shots create a feeling of solitude. He's supported by the likes of Sean Bean and Chiwetel Ejiofor, but when the screen's off Damon, it needs to be. We need to know how and what he's doing. Visually stunning effects add a balance of beauty and ambiance. The contrast is definitely felt between Watney on Mars, his crew on their ship back home and the NASA workers on Earth. The Martian is a gripping blockbuster, even if it's a wee bit predictable."

Another good book ransacked for events and bunged on-screen. I must add another five lines of text in order to get this review accepted for some reason, but really there isn't much more to say about it. The 3D was curiously flattened, the landscapes appearing like cardboard cut-out mountains. The rest looked OK I guess, but so does any film these days.

","This movie rocked the house!! What can I say? The only movie I truly was astonished by this year was Ant-Man, and this one is up there with one of the best movies of the year. I recently saw Hotel Transylvania 2, and while the animation was imaginative and there were some really funny scenes, I kind of thought, ""eh, it's not bad, just so much potential wasted"". With The Martian, the potential is realized and fulfilled, and a whole lot more added to that. The main surprise in this movie is the fact that it has more optimism than any other thriller I've seen-and I love it when movies strive to avoid predictability in emotion of the characters. Matt Damon was excellent in this because of his huge amount of likability and charms, but was frightened and tense when he needed to be. Jeff Daniels is definitely the best performance of the movie other than Damon in my opinion. I saw the 3D screening of this movie and the opening scene and the vistas of Mars landscapes and planet overviews immersed me into the intensity of the suspense shown. Awesome 70s soundtrack. I'd recommend this piece of art to any movie buff, Ridley Scott fan, or space movie fan any day. Definitely a Blu-ray collection addition in my book."

","THE MARTIAN (2015) **** Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover. Epic, fun and enthralling science fiction drama with Damon as a botanist left behind on Mars accidentally being believed to be killed on an expedition, resulting in his savvy brain trust (his and NASA's) to get him home in spite of tremendous odds, obstacles and pitfalls. Ridley Scott pulls out all the stops with brio and smartly sprinkles in dollops of self-ware, world-weary humor (thanks to a fine adaptation of Andy Weir's book by Drew Goddard) and a sterling cast including bright-eyed Chastain as his commander hell-bent on the rescue mission, Ejiofor and Daniels as squabbling team pundits and again, Damon in a career high turn as the self-possessed yet vulnerable Mark Watney in a performance ranking up there with Tom Hanks' in CASTAWAY & Sandra Bullock's in GRAVITY ; in other words - Oscar-worthy. A must see in 3-D with some truly amazing visuals and a superb sound track of '70s disco tunes. One of the year's best (and smartest) movies."
"domagoj-vugrinec","10","9","21","10 October 2015"," Another masterpiece from Ridley Scott
","First of all,the review is spoiler free so feel free to read it if you haven't seen the movie yet.<br/><br/>Firstly,the cast. They are all excellent and experienced actors and actresses and they did their job on the level that it should be done.Starting with Matt Damon who plays astronaut Mark Watney.His acting ability is great and he made 100% effort to role.Certainly one of his best roles. Jessica Chastain plays the role of mission commander Melissa Lewis,which suits her just fine,knowing that she has experience with movies about space.She played in the Interstellar last year which was one of the best movie of the year. Not to mention Sean Bean,who is absolutely amazing and most likely one of the best actors in Hollywood.Although he plays a minor role in this movie that hasn't stopped him to act so well. One of the biggest pluses in the movie is surly acting. A bit about the plot(without spoiling anything),most of the time atmosphere is very intense and serious,but there are several scenes with good sense of humor which helps the viewers to relax after very intense scene.<br/><br/>Visual effects and CGI. Mars looks as it should look because of all the CGI effects of the place where movie was shoot and it is really nice to see,especially in 4K resolution and 3D technology.All rocket launches,explosions and martian storms are done perfectly.It really makes you feel they're real.<br/><br/>In conclusion this is definitely Oscar worth movie and one of the best movies of the year,if not the best.Space fanatics(like me) will enjoy the movie all the time and will feel the tension as it is supposed to be felt.If anyone thinks they won't understand a single word in the movie,I can tell they're wrong.The movie is made for everyone,children,teenagers,adults and scientists so everyone will be able to understand what're they talking about."

","Based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel by the same name, 'The Martian' is an Epic Sci-Fi Adventure, that offers solid entertainment. Its a gripping film, about about survival & hope. Legendary Director Sir Ridley Scott & Actors Matt Damon & Jeff Daniels are at their finest!<br/><br/>'The Martian' Synopsis: During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.<br/><br/>'The Martian' is about human willpower. If one has the courage & belief, He/She can conquer any difficulty, even if its beyond planet Earth. Mark Watney (Played by Matt Damon) is a fine, fine protagonist, who's spirit to survive & fight against all odds, makes his unbelievable journey, all the more engrossing. You are with him throughout the turbulence & you never stop rooting for him.<br/><br/>Drew Goddard's Adapted Screenplay is top-notch. Its a challenging, inspiring & throughly entertaining Story, that hardly misses a beat. I was glued to the screen from start to finish. Sir Ridley Scott's Direction is exemplary. 'The Martian' is among his best works, as the Master Storyteller handles the intensity, with precision. Dariusz Wolski's Cinematography is perfect. Pietro Scalia's Editing is razor-crisp, despite a running-time of over 140-minutes! Art & Costume Design are excellent. Graphics & 3D Effects are top-class. Harry Gregson-Williams's Score is soulful. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Matt Damon is at his peak here. Emboding Mark Watney from head to toe, he leads the narrative with a forceful performance. He gives us a protagonist, we'd like to remember for a long time. Supporting him superbly back home is Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders, head of NASA. He's flawless. Of the rest, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor, a NASA mission director, Kristen Wiig as Annie Montrose, NASA spokesperson, Jessica Chastain as Melissa Lewis, Ares III commander, Kate Mara as Beth Johanssen, an astronaut & Sean Bean as Mitch Henderson, a NASA mission director, leave a strong impression.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Martian' is a ride that needs to be experienced! Strongly Recommended!"
"lneil-51-106502","8","5","10","2 January 2016"," A potential Sci-Fi epic with emotional links to the past
","Firstly, I must say that I enjoyed this movie on its own merits and thought the science was adequately explained and believable for all but the most nit-picking nerds and idiots who don't realise that, by definition, science fiction is still fiction! The cinematography was well done and the pacing was good. Damon plays the part of the marooned astronaut well, adding a typical astronaut/pilot get-it-done practicality to the natural circumstantial fear and frustration. I felt that the portrayal of the reactions of the NASA management and Houston technical members was excellent, reflecting the reality of the publicly funded and politically vulnerable agency. My only dis-satisfaction with the film is that I felt the epilogue section after the rescue was unnecessary and detracted from the dramatic impact, which the film-makers had successfully imparted at that point. If it were not for those end sequences I think this movie could have joined the ranks of great movies like 'The Right Stuff' and 'Apollo 13' as a classic favourite of aviation/space enthusiasts like me.<br/><br/>I appreciated the film even more though on a more personal level, as I am old enough to remember well the Apollo era; particularly the gut-wrenching wait as I and virtually the whole world held our collective breaths as the tense and potentially tragic drama of Apollo 13 unfolded. To this day those involved in the space program maintain a reverence for those who have gone before and especially those who have given their lives and to me this film celebrates that type of attitude and culture.<br/><br/>This film references past history, books and films very well too. I loved the Hermes crew's description of the astrophysicist as a 'steely-eyed missile man'. In short, I recommend this movie for any enthusiasts of aviation and the space programme, anyone who enjoys quality sci-fi movies and anyone who enjoys a good but simple tale of triumph over adversity. I therefore do not recommend this film for armchair geek-critics who think the only quality needed for a good movie is perfect scientific exactitude.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way... For all you moronic scientist wannabes, humans actually DO exhale oxygen in significant quantities. Each breath taken only utilises only a small proportion of the O2 available before the remainder is exhaled, along with the CO2 and other unused components. Criticism of this as a supposed scientific 'flaw' in the film illustrates only your own ignorance and inability to research the facts before bursting forth into factually defective, self-important bluster. The dynamics and physics of space travel were also pretty accurate, despite what some 'reviewers' suggest."
"bouwermichael","1","5","10","29 December 2015"," God this was bad
","I know this is not a popular opinion. But for real, a movie of this budget, directorial talent and acting prowess should not have been this average.<br/><br/>Consider these points:<br/><br/>Pace.<br/><br/>The movie starts at 100000 km/h, with snappy banter between characters we know nothing about, a cataclysmic sandstorm, and a confused leader making a massive decision. We are then subjected to Matt Damon fighting against the odds to make it back to medical bay where upon he gut wrenchingly removes a huge piece of steel from his side before sighing the word ""Fuck."" From here, the movie degrades slowly into what can best be described as a tribute to Adam Sandler, with slap stick bumping into things, witty quips between poorly developed characters and odd, intrusive monologues about the meaning of life and the virtue of the human soul. Then, at the end of the film, we have a sudden acceleration back to warp speed with the convenient rocket/tarp/duct tape launch followed by a nail bitingly unrealistic jet pack around Martian near space, all the while two of the astronauts whose names I can't remember because they've had zero character development are falling in love in the background. It honestly felt like the film switched writing team half way through, and then switched back.<br/><br/>Matt Damon.<br/><br/>Was I the only one who felt that Matt Damon was basically walking around saying ""Matt Damon"" for the entire film? (Credit to Sven Axelrad)<br/><br/>Deus Ex Machina<br/><br/>If I had a dollar for every convenient event that miraculously drove The Martian's narrative along, I'd have quite a few dollars. Enough to reimburse the money I wasted watching The Martian. Aforementioned random love story As mentioned in point number one. You can't just introduce a love story in the dying moments of a film, just because. You can't. It shouldn't be allowed. I have no idea who these characters are, and nor do I care. In fact, other than ""Mark Watney"" and ""Childish Gambino"", I don't remember the names of a single character.<br/><br/>The Chinese<br/><br/>See aforementioned deus ex machina.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>This movie sucked so hard."

","The Martian was directed by Ridley Scott and stars Matt Damon,Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels,Kate Mara. First off, I've readied the book before seeing the movie so I had high hopes going into it and I have to say I was not disappointed. The Martian wasn't only a great movie but a great come back from Ridley Scott. He did a fantastic job and handled the big cast great. His last few movie had a big cast too and those movie turned out pretty bad. This wasn't the case, the acting, cinematography, everything was great. You would think a man by himself on a planet would get boring but it didn't at all. Matt Damon played the role of Mark Watney fantastic. Seeing this person surviving was so interesting and at times very funny. Just like the book there's lot humor and it works well. Jeff Daniels did a great job also, he's be doing a lot of movies this year that might get him best supporting actor. Overall was a great movie and a great comeback for amazing director Ridley Scott. Every thing was done right. If your a fan of the book or just trying to see a great book see the Martian in theaters."
"funkyfry","6","5","10","17 October 2015"," solid entertainment but nothing really exceptional
","The audience wasn't bored despite the running time, and Matt Damon does a really good job of holding everybody in just the right amount of tension, but the whole thing is too calculated and manipulative and, like most of Ridley Scott's output, looks like an advertisement. In this case, it's a big propaganda advertisement for the American and Chinese space programs and for various corporations that get prominent screen space -- who wants to bet me that the big ""Forever 21"" logo that looms over half the screen towards the film's climax looks just as stupid as the the bit TDK neon sign at the end of ""Blade Runner""?<br/><br/>It was one of those movies I walked out of with a good feeling, but the bad taste spreads the longer that it sits in my stomach. It's almost too cute, how Matt Damon's character makes these witty statements every 10 minutes or so, and the disco music and all of it. ""I will survive!"" The world is sure ready to put a lot of effort into saving a single white man sitting on some damn planet he has no business being on in the first place. He even brags about being the first colonizer! This movie will really be hilarious to watch in 2040, I'm telling you!<br/><br/>But it wasn't too bad to watch in 2015 with a nice date and a good crowd of people either. Hard to hate it, but impossible for me to love it. Every time I was hoping for a good idea, it delivered sentiment or sardonic wit. At first I was into the way the movie raised intelligence and science up as virtues. But when Matt Damon gets up at the end to deliver a soliloquy about how science can deliver human beings from any problem..... you have to wonder why we can't spend some small part of the energy that we would spend to bring an astronaut home from Mars to, I dunno, save a child from slavery in a mine or a textile factory in the ""third world."" And, yeah, I'm pretty sure Matt Damon wonders the same thing."
"ironhorse_iv","8","5","10","12 October 2015"," The Martian has the alright stuff. However, this movie didn't leave its mark on me, as it should had.
","I know, a lot of people love this science-fiction film based on Andrew Weir's novel of the same name. However this film about an astronaut, Mark Whatney (Matt Damon) being stuck on Mars after a botch mission was just meh to me. Don't get me wrong, I like the film about a man trying to science, the sh*t out of his dilemma in order to survive, yet I can't overlook the film's large jarring blemishes. First off, in comparison to director Ridley Scott's other stabs at Science Fiction, The Martian is considerably more cheery and upbeat than those other films. This overbearing optimistic tone to the film, kinda hurts the film, a bit, because it rarely allows the movie to very suspenseful or intense. Its way, too one-sided idealism. You rarely see the main character remoted any other, type of an emotional, besides his happy go lucky/problem solving persona. I know, astronauts are supposed to be brave, but gees, this man is not realistic at all. The movie doesn't really explore, the depth of his personality, much. I know, very little of the man, besides that he's a botanist and a joker. You don't know, why he's so willing to survive. Does he have love-ones? Does he have big dreams, back at home? Who knows, the movie doesn't exposition that. Also, you rarely see, examples, of scenes, showing his fears and his flaws. You don't know, if this guy has a breaking point? You don't know, if the lack of food, or the pressures of living on Mars is, messing with his body & mind, because the movie never once, investigates it. The man acts the same, from beginning to end. I find the lack of emotion weight from this movie, somewhat bland. Matt Damon is a fine actor, but if he isn't given, much to work with; he comes across, as playing himself. After all, Matt Damon already had the experience of being the only living human on an uninhabitable planet. His role as Dr. Mann in 2014's Interstellar, had more complexity in his personality than this. I really, didn't see, anything in the film that felt like character development. It was, a very featureless performance. Honestly, I can see, anybody playing this character. It's not much of a stretch. I know, that sounds a bit harsh, but the emotional depth in this film is so thin. It reminds me of the Martian's surface. Where are those scenes of Mark Whatney dealing with extreme loneliness, depression, or better yet, his own morality, because it's needed, badly?! While the supporting cast is semi- strong, featuring the likes of Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, & Chiwetel Ejiofor. I didn't like, all their choices. Many of the supporting actors, are playing roles that isn't that new, to them. A Kate Mara's character always working on the computer. No surprised there. Jessica Chastain as a brilliant mathematician/semi-lead character. Saw it, already in 2014. Sean Bean's character, not dying. Never mind, that one is pretty surprising. However, bringing on so many characters with their own part to play in a very unrealistic rescue mission plan, slows things down, unlike in 1995's Apollo 13, which made a more heroic, realistic viewpoint of NASA and what really could be possible. For a movie that says, let's science the sh*t out of this! This movie's events in the terms of scientific possibility is half correct; with the other half, being close-enough. Without going into much detail, the biggest insult to science, besides the large rockets on Mars's thin surface is probably the whole 'Iron Man/bomb' maneuver. You can research, how impractical, that maneuver is, on your free time. Anyways, I really didn't like, how the movie change the ending from the book. The whole 'where are they now' epilogue was very anticlimax, when you think about it. I don't want to sound, so clichés, but sadly, in my opinion, the book's ending is a lot better than this movie. There's just so much more in the novel that is amazing, that they had to cut out for time reasons. Still, author Andy Weir very much approved of the film version. However, there were some minor nitpicking from him. Like, how he wished the movie opened up with Watney already stranded, and more exposition, toward the sciences. I have to say, the movie's visuals/special effects are breath-taking. The movie is kinda worth watching in 3D. The music is alright for the most part. Not a huge fan of Disco, but its works, within the story of the film. Harry Gregson Williams' score is also pretty impressive, with a tone that bounces between intellectual and scientific while also being hopeful and inspiring. The movie has some funny moments, so it's entertaining in that value. Check out, the Council of Elrond scene with Sean Bean for awesomeness. Also, check out the Five In-Universe style promos for the film: 'Farewell"" 'The Right Stuff', 'Our Greatest Adventure', ""Leave Your Mark"" & ""Bring Him Home'. Those are a lot of fun. Overall: Director Ridley Scott did a pretty good job, however, it's no Ron Howard's 1995's masterpiece Apollo 13. There seem to be, something missing in this triumph of science, teamwork, and the human spirit; to make me, really like it. However, if you like films like Apollo 13, Interstellar, or Gravity. I have to say, you probably would like this film. So check it out."

"FormerlyDoh11","Null","6","13","11 December 2015"," Average in Every Way
","There is much hype around The Martian. Ridley Scott, Matt Damon and a dynamite supporting cast that features a story about a man trying to survive on Mars armed only with his intellect and will.<br/><br/>When I heard this, I thought the picture would be similar tonally to Cast Away. An unforgiving environment, brutal conditions, desperation and watching a character grow in order to survive his ordeal.<br/><br/>Instead, Damon is cool under fire the entire time. There is never any sense of desperation, change or arc to speak of (at least that is significant). When things go wrong, they're easily fixed and the tone of this picture is inconsistent with its scenario.<br/><br/>Jokes abound. Whether it's from NASA on Earth, Damon's crew that left him behind or Damon himself, they just keep on rolling with what feels like a three jokes a minute standard screenplay formula in a movie about a man trapped on Mars!<br/><br/>It just doesn't work. It's not bad. The performances are fine, Scott's direction is fine, the writing is fine and it's technically fine. But that's about it. No risks or ingenuity, no real heart or emotion. No stakes. It takes about as unique a scenario as you could conjure and makes it flat, predictable and tonally inconsistent.<br/><br/>Humor here and there is fine, but Drew Goddard's effusive use of humor is tiresome and takes you out of the film.<br/><br/>No characters are really developed here and you sort of just wait around for the inevitable conclusion of the picture. Maybe this would have worked better as a short.<br/><br/>With the last two years, two incredible space pictures (especially technically speaking: Gravity and Interstellar) came out and did some bombastic things. Each had fast moving stories, top notch special effects and were unpredictable in their conclusion. They had their main characters grow and place them in diverse scenarios that kept the tension high at all times. There was a sense of danger regardless of their shortcomings (Interstellar's ending and Gravity's Sandra Bullock).<br/><br/>In this film there's none of that. While the solutions Damon's character comes up with are smart, you don't get a dramatic sense of struggle throughout the film. Lack of struggle equals decreased tension.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why this movie is so revered by movie goers and critics. I feel left out. Maybe it was just my expectations and wanting to see the movie I wish it could have been that left me feeling cold. Still, a tensionless film with such a good cast and crew is a terrible thing to waste.<br/><br/>6/10- Average."
"Sruthi_Me","5","6","13","18 November 2015"," Average. Not worth the hype.
","First of all, the Martian was nothing like Gravity. I guess that was my biggest problem. Having loved movies like Gravity and Interstellar, this one did not come close to the performance bar let alone pass it. Everything about this movie was average. So highly disappointed with Matt Damon.<br/><br/>1. Directing - The director worked with what he was given but there was so much more he could do. For example, there is a scene where Damon is severely undernourished and is skin and bones. His face isn't shown. The very next camera shot shows Damon 'who was supposed to be skin and bones' completely healthy and as muscular as ever. No, the space suit cannot hide a body's figure. <br/><br/>2. Writing - I wasn't impressed with the script. It wasn't very different but the only good thing was it was light, had a lot of humor and the story kept you going. However, every twist and plot was extremely far fetched and close to impossible. A person with common sense just sits there going ""-_- seriously? Whom are you kidding? That is so not possible!""<br/><br/>3. Acting - The acting was top notch. I expected big things from such a promising cast and then delivered. Very pleased.<br/><br/>4. Production design - It was brilliant. The sets, both on Mars and on earth were amazing. I was blown away. The red planet was indeed red and the equipment all looked fancy and expensive. Tick. Tick. Tick for The Martian.<br/><br/>5. Sound - The sound track and background score was average. Neither catchy nor lethargic. <br/><br/>Bottomline - Go watch this if you have nothing better to see. P.s. Forget watching it on the TV."

"doug_park2001","7","6","13","26 October 2015"," ""I'm the first person to be alone on an entire planet""
","I'd heard nothing but great things about this film beforehand. After seeing it, my verdict is ""Good, but far from great."" It certainly keeps your attention, and is an interesting mix of science fiction, survival tale, thriller-diller, and political intrigue. What it shows about NASA's dilemmas in how/when they tell the public what is happening, how they assess the respective risks in their various options, and so forth is pretty convincing. Still, I have to wonder if NASA would really go to all this expense and trouble in trying to save one person whose odds of survival are stacked this high against him.<br/><br/>A few other random points: <br/><br/>*Some breath-taking Martian and outer space scenery. I would have liked more in this department, particularly on Mars-in-general, but I suppose that one of the film's strengths is that it doesn't try too hard to bedazzle us. The primary mission here is to show one fellow's fight to survive in a distant and hostile environment.<br/><br/>*Some real surprises and turnabouts which, particularly toward the end, descend into yeah-right unlikelihoods and too-easies. Many people, it seems, would rather have big stretches and reaches than boring predictabilities, and the whole story is, of course, pretty unlikely, though not impossible. Nevertheless, the makers of this film could have tried a little harder in several key places.<br/><br/>*Though I've never been a huge Matt Damon fan, those who are should enjoy his performance as marooned exobotanist Mark Watney. Jessica Chastain, Sean Bean, and a couple of others steal the show insofar as acting goes: It's just unfortunate that we don't see more of them. Much of the dialogue, particularly Watney's—""In your FACE, Neil Armstrong!"" etc--is rather hokey and not quite as clever as intended.<br/><br/>*While I'm a novice in these areas, some of the science and technology here is obviously implausible, and I would guess that most rocket scientists and physicists would find it downright ludicrous in a number of spots.<br/><br/>*Last but certainly not least, the zero-g scenes are a lot of fun. Trying to leave the stadium-style theater at the end, I was so marvelously disoriented that I walked UP toward the camera portal instead of DOWN toward the exit. (Yes, I mean this in a good way.)"
"semih-c-sezer","6","6","13","11 October 2015"," Disappointment: Human Survival Was Never Taken So Lightly
","I was really looking forward to this film as it had a really good plot that could explore the survival struggle of a human in isolation, loneliness, fear and uncertainty. Unfortunately, the film did not do any of these; we watched a badass who was stuck on Mars get back to earth. <br/><br/>Since the very beginning, it felt as if the hero knew he would survive, and the theme of fear and isolation was never explored by the director. In the first half of the film, the only time we see fear is by an explosion of the artificial farm, there is also the potato counting scene when there is a storm. Both of which are extreme, showy ways of introducing fear; however under isolation like that, every moment would be full of uncertainty, and this can be explored without using explosions. It is difficult to explore these emotions with a single character, but that is what the story requires. ""Cast Away"" does a very good job of this. In Interstellar, one line of Matt Damon very successfully demonstrated this ""You don't know how good it feels to see someone's face again.""; whereas in The Martian, the whole movie was not able to explore the mental state of the character.<br/><br/>I was also expecting to get a better feeling of being space, the dead silence and how small the humans are. This was also not demonstrated well, something which Interstellar did very well, both visually and audio-wise.<br/><br/>The movie is not completely bad though; it was funny and the last scene where he meets the crew built up very well with elements of fear and uncertainty. The way he reached the commander was also very breathtaking.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the film disrespects the human survival struggle by taking it so lightly, poor job from Ridley Scott.

","I thought it was the best movie of 2015! I'm not overrating on this, but it's truly a genius movie. If a friend or someone ask me, ""Do you find this movie is good? Do you recommend it?"" I'll answer a hundred percent yes. Perfect cinematography (why did only r-scott, matt, and the editors who get the nominees, it's should've been the cinematography). I didn't read the book yet, i don't even know that there is the book of The Martian. But i thought it was amazing.<br/><br/>The film is very emotional, and Matt live it perfectly (i cried a lot) so if you guys are a sci-fi fan you have to watch it or you're wasting your time as a sci-fi fan (it's too much :P) It's the combination of drama that will make us like touched but also frightening sci-fi plot. <br/><br/>Yes, it's exactly to pick Ridley Scott, i mean he's a sci-fi 'god' look at his film! I complety NOT disappointed, satisfied, entertained, this is the best movie. One more, damn you R-Scott!<br/><br/>But this movie has one weakness, this movie took a quite long time to make the viewer figure out some thing, like SOL, in the beginning, i didn't understand what is it? It takes a quarter hour to figure out. Or it's just me who has a stinky brain :D<br/><br/>NB: Watch it, take my words, you'll NEVER regret my suggestion. Oh, don't watch it with kids under 13. First, they'll get bored, second, they don't understand, that's what makes them bored, Third, there's some brief scene when Mark Whatney butt shown."
"fabiolpinheiro1993","9","7","16","18 October 2015"," One of the best films ever, you will have to be careful not to become an addict.
","I had huge expectations for The Martian, i just love this kind of movies, and of course the combination of Ridley Scott and an ensemble cast like this is just pure perfection. And it was too bad that the film wasn't in Imax theatres. But, did the film meet my expectations? Well, it sure did!<br/><br/>The film has this feeling, a feeling so unique that it's like nothing i have ever seen, and it's definitely one of the most addictive films i ever saw. From the very first frame, it grabs you with such a force it never lets you go, even when you leave the theatre. It just stays with you. And its impossible to take your eyes off the screen. <br/><br/>The story is just perfect, the setting is unique, the cast is beyond perfect, and i don't know if this can be a spoiler but if it is, **WARNING** SPOILER AHEAD: Sean Bean doesn't die on this one!I Know, its insane! Obviously Matt Damon shines brighter than the sun in here, but the other actors also shine a lot. And Ridley Scott is in top notch, while i would change some camera shots (as usual in his films) i understand his perspective.<br/><br/>Basically this is a film about one man trying to survive in Mars and get back home after it was left there because everyone thought he was dead. And even if we get a lot about the people that are trying to get him back home and a little about his crew that left him there, this is basically a biography about Matt Damon's character, and i really would like to have seen much more of the crew, but i understand what The director and writer did. <br/><br/>This film is unique in every way possible, but i guess ultimately what makes him so unique is the main character, because instead of the usual depressing character in this situations (understandably of course!) here, we get an above normal optimistic character that simply put doesn't want to die and deals with problems with an optimistic way that delivers tons of gold comedy. This makes for a much more different narrative, but of course makes the character feel a little off, because it doesn't have those depressed moments, or looks like his suffering with the loneliness or the problems. While i would enjoy some of these moments, or to know a little more about this character, i also understand the goals here.<br/><br/>And is here that i think the film should have some more complex emotional moments, that explored more and deeper, some themes and characters. And to me this is why after only one view, that the film isn't perfect, even though i probably will give it a 10 because i think i loved the film so much it makes me forget that.<br/><br/>The film has a rushed feeling, that it would be overcomed if the length were bigger, and the ending, particularly, isn't among my favourites because of this. But its nothing that compromises the quality of the film.<br/><br/>The production values are just beyond perfect of course, or this wouldn't be a Ridley Scott film. From the hauntingly beautiful visuals, to the insanely realistic production design to the thrilling score, it's just pure perfection!<br/><br/>This is one of the most original and unique films ever and it is instantly a favorite, it has such a strong force that you are pulled to its orbit right from the beginning. And it will make you think a lot after you leave the theatre. Thrilling moments abound, comic moments to spare, and plenty of drama makes this one of the best films ever, And is insanely realistic you just forget you are watching a film, and think that this is a documentary about a real life event. What more can you ask?"

","The Martian is my second favorite book of all time, so I was very worried Hollywood would find some way to mess this up. While they left out plenty from the book, the character of the book was very faithfully interpreted and the movie actually brought me to tears.<br/><br/>This might be the only time I've ever seen Hollywood reduce the amount of danger, action, and vulgarity to make a movie that appealed to a younger audience. It's really out of character for Hollywood to downplay an explosion, but hey, the movie is already 2 hours and 21 minutes.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is top notch, from the A-list actors, to the special effects, to the soundtrack, to the directing, to the extras. I'm extremely proud of Matt Damon on this one, since he's been successful enough he could have coasted. Instead, he knocked it out of the park, even becoming visibly emaciated at the appropriate point, which goes to show the level of discipline a true professional really has.<br/><br/>Read the book, but don't miss this movie."

","Maybe one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen, the plot is so pedestrian and drudges along at an incredibly slow, and predictable, pace.<br/><br/>If there's one thing in a movie that can make me lose interest faster than anything else, it is when an uncreative lead casting choice is made, and that actor casted simply plays themselves. It is the most cliched and boring type of movie when this happens, like a paint-by-numbers film experience, and Matt Damon is full blown Matt Damon in this. As a whole, and considering the ridiculous length of the movie, he shows no emotional range at all. It's like watching a Saturday Night Live skit where Matt Damon is just hanging out on a fake space rock, being himself.<br/><br/>There are corny, banal, and cliched attempts at humor to really try to make it a commercial hit, but this is stuff that used to be original back in 1990; by now, you've seen and heard it all hundreds if not thousands of times.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm even writing this review is because this movie has an 8.0 rating on here, which should mean it is special or elite, and my cable service provider gave it 4/4 stars. Frankly, I would be more entertained watching paint dry than to sit though this boring, predictable, slog of a movie that feels like it was only made for grade-schoolers.<br/><br/>5/10 (all five for technical and visual effects)"

The most offensive thing about the movie is that its a complete injustice to its source material: ""The Martian"" the book is a book that is telling a genuinely interesting tale exemplified by the realistic, grounded science it is based in. This all important aspect of the book is completely lost on the the movie (and its makers).

","This movie may have been initially popular, but it will fade away. To better imagine being on Mars I had to mute the sound to imagine Watney breathing in his space suit whilst he worked, You do get the impression of being on Mars but this is not sustained because of the comedic overtones and stupendous miscasting. I imagined another version being released in the future - a true space drama- deleting the wisecracks, replacing the soundtrack, and reinforcing the success factors such as the sense of isolation, the science, and the fear. But that's not going to happen. People forget this movie is a comedy, yet it is thoroughly unfunny, but it did win a Golden Globe for comedy. Touché from the accountants! Audiences do love an optimistic fantasy depicting triumph over adversity. And what fantasy! The sandstorm that stranded Watney would be no more fierce than being pelted by talcum powder given Mars thin atmosphere. The storm would barely raise a flag. And then there is Watney. Perpetual optimist, says he's a botanist, but botanists are not farmers nor gardeners. The garden he creates is ridiculous, too shallow with no drainage, and the crop yield fantastical (see one of the reviews below which explores this in detail). Watney doesn't suffer much. He is playful, always strong, optimistic, jovial, confident. I don't see him triumphing over adversity."
"jeanmclark-93059","5","3","5","24 October 2016"," Not Brilliant.
","Surprised it was a Ridley Scott film, very mediocre, emotionless, I couldn't wait for it to end. Matt Damon plays the part of Mark Whitney Astronaut stranded on Planet Mars after a raging storm causes a projectile to hit him and causing the rest of his crew to assume he his dead and therefore leave him behind.. He put in a good enough performance but I can't quite believe his nonchalant attitude in the film about being left on Mars it was like he'd missed a Train but hey ho no problem. Fortuanely his Character is a Botanist, so he plants potatoes and uses his own faeces as fertiliser. Is it that simple - I think not. As expected the crop is a great success and you hear him say that he was once told that if you grew on a planet you had created a Colony therefore he'd Colonised Mars. There's no end to his talents and what he can do with a plastic sheet and duct tape after the air lock was blown needs imagination! It's the usual trials and tribulations before he is rescued. On the plus side the music is good and the landscape authentic looking."

","These stories of isolated individuals -- ""Castaway"", ""Robinson Crusoe,"" ""Jeremiah Johnson"" -- can be difficult to pull off. They can turn banal in a hurry. Poor Thoreau couldn't do a satisfactory job. ""First, I felled the small fir, then adzed the bark and trimmed the mesophyllum into rabbits for the lallies."" <br/><br/>""The Martian"" pulls it off with aplomb, helped greatly by a courageously demanding script from screenwriter Drew Goddard. A cornucopia of plaudits to the guy, and to Ridley Scott for doing a fine job with the direction, and to the performers who are all at the top of their game, especially Chiwetel Ejiofor as a member of the team back on planet earth. The climax is about as tense as it gets. The musical score, alas, is generic.<br/><br/>The story is pretty well-known by now. Matt Damon is a botanist, part of an exploratory team on Mars, who gets accidentally left behind. He sets about providing a habitat for himself, much in the manner of a test pilot who has run into troubles. As Chuck Yeager has pointed out, the pilot in distress doesn't panic. He just asks, ""What do I do next?"" It may sound a little boring but it's not. Damon's Martian doesn't despair. He describes exactly what he's doing to a video recording he intends to leave behind as a record if he dies. We are the video recording device. He's pretty chipper throughout. An experiment goes awry and he presents his injured face to the device and says, ""Okay. I blew myself up."" <br/><br/>About a third of the movie deals with the team back on earth and with the crew of the Hermes, the space craft that left Damon behind. The commander of the Hermes is Jessica Chastain, whom I admire a great deal. It's not just that she's attractive because she's less like a typical Hollywood glamour queen and more like the pretty women ahead of you in the supermarket checkout line. She has a strong jaw but her pale presence suggests fragility, as if one of her long bones might break if she slipped and fell down. I grovel in wonderment at her nose. It assumes a normal tangent from the plane of her face but at its very tip it forms an impudent little outward projection.<br/><br/>Speaking of tangents, that reminds me. Some viewers might find the dialog a little challenging -- velocity in so many meters per second, escape acceleration, ""sols"" instead of days, Schroedinger's cats or whatever. It didn't bother me a bit. It all sailed completely over my head in the most satisfying way."

When i found out that the rescue mission had to take another trip around the sun, which meant at least one more hour in the theater for me, i almost walked out. To top it off, it also became quite annoying with try-hard one-liners like ""I've got to science the s**t out of it"", and silly gags about where for instance excessive use of ketchup is supposed to be funny. I realize that this is done to give the movie a broader appeal, but it also dumbs it down considerably. <br/><br/>From the marketing about how it contains accurate science etc, I expected a more ""hardcore"" science fiction movie, but it felt more like an episode of Iron Man in terms of ""science"" and ""humor""."

","The Martian (2015)<br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>On a mission to Mars a crew of astronauts get caught in a brutal storm when one member, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit with an object and apparently killed. The commander in charge (Jessica Chastain) decide to leave the planet and NASA must announce that Watney has been killed but soon they all discover that he survived. Now Watney must find a way to try and survive on the planet with a lack of food and water.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN is an extremely entertaining movie and it's easy to see why it became such a box office hit. The idea of a man being trapped on a different planet and having to decide whether he wants to live or die is such a simple idea and there's no question that Scott knows how to handle drama and tension in space. The film has a very good story to draw you in but I'm not going to lie and say I didn't have any problems with the movie but more on that in a bit.<br/><br/>A lot of credit certainly goes to Scott who handles the material extremely well and most importantly is the fact that he makes you believe that this man is actually trapped on Mars. If the viewer thought they were just looking at a set or just some fake CGI then it would pretty much kill the story. By Scott creating a real environment you have no problem believing that you're seeing a man trapped on a planet with his closest help millions of miles away. On a technical level the film contains some wonderful cinematography, a great and rousing score and of course brilliant sound effects and set designs.<br/><br/>Damon's excellent performance is another very important factor because we need an actor who we're not only going to believe in the part of a brilliant astronaut but we also must be entertained by him and care for him. Damon certainly makes you believe that he's this brilliant mind and there's no question that his one-man-show is something the actor nails. We get a strong group of supporting players including a very good Chastain plus strong work from Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Donald Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br/><br/>As I said, I did have some major problems with the film including the fact that it just seems like everything happened way too easily. I understand this is a mainstream movie that couldn't get into great detail because it might confuse or bore the viewer but I just thought the film would have worked even better had it been more realistic. Of course, I'm no space expert so perhaps what happens here is 100% believable. I'd also say that the film is also a tad bit too predictable. Either way, THE MARTIAN is certainly a very good movie."

"sandnair87","9","3","5","21 January 2016"," The Martian's Saturated Space Frontier is Far From Cinema's Usual Blank Spaces!
","Space is an endless stretch of deep, unfeeling, obsidian black that swallows up the curious and adventurous and spits them out without remorse. Space is exhilarating, mystifying, and ultimately terrifying - or at least that's what we've been led to believe by space disaster movies. The Martian throws all of that out the window with a wink and a mischievous grin.<br/><br/>Set in the near future, 'The Martian' opens on Mars, where a team led by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) is wrapping up a month-long space mission. Soon, a fierce sandstorm catches the astronauts out in the open, and they barely make it to the Martian lander that will return them to the orbiting mother ship. But one of them, botanist Mark Watney (Damon), gets hit by a rogue piece of debris. Believing him dead, Lewis has no choice but to take off without him before the storm makes liftoff impossible.<br/><br/>But Mark isn't dead. He awakens to a beeping alarm in his helmet telling him he's almost out of air. He struggles out of the sand in which he is half buried and discovers that he has been skewered by a shard of wind-blown metal and barely makes it into the now unoccupied housing module. Meanwhile, back on earth, NASA and the rest of the world are mourning Mark's loss; at least until satellite surveillance of Mars shows signs of activity at the outpost. Faced with the incredible possibility that Mark is alive, the best minds on the planet get to work on an ambitious plan to bring him home before his supplies run out.<br/><br/>At this point, The Martian could have become just another grim, white-knuckle-tense space disaster movies. Instead, The Martian does something unexpected. It embraces comedy - balancing knuckle-biting suspense with dollops of humor. It presents Watney as a fairly cocky, genuinely funny, easygoing everyman who just happens to be the only living thing on this entire planet. This big screen adaptation (by Drew Goddard) of Andy Weir's best-seller has just about everything: laughs, thrills, visual splendor and a rousing endorsement of the brotherhood. Ridley Scott directs with nerve and verve, delivering an almost perfect piece of popular filmmaking. Bringing optimism, nerd-itude and a touch of crazy to his character's solo ordeal, Matt Damon is the key to the movie's exuberance. Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here, millions of miles adrift, shouldering the weight of the role with diligent grace. In the face of incredible odds, he ensures Mark Watney remains an endlessly charming protagonist. The rest of the supporting cast also pitches in noteworthy performances.<br/><br/>But the Martian's greatest asset is that it remains relentlessly, hopefully human. It takes all the romance out of Mars, but substitutes in its place science, cooperation and perseverance – a fair bargain that results in an intimate sci-fi epic that is smart, spectacular and stirring."

On the other I was shaking my head thinking there should be more to this movie. That was a terrible ending.<br/><br/>A few Questions: 1) If Matt Damon's character (Don't remember, don't care) is a botanist, as he states, how does he come to know mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, rocket science, computer software development, advanced mechanic skills, extraordinary navigation ability, piloting skills, and (believe it or not) a master hair stylist...If he knows all that, what was the purpose of the rest of the crew?<br/><br/>Seriously, he could have done the entire mission on his own. Why send so many people when superman , brainiac was already there. What more could they have done, that he wasn't capable of?<br/><br/>2) If the Chinese are concerned about the secrecy of their rocket technology, why give it to a bunch of government rocket scientists from America who understand exactly what you have? Seems like the worst place to keep you tech under wraps.<br/><br/>3) How the heck did Matt Damon get an Oscar nod? Or any other award for that matter. This was a horrible performance. Little to no emotion. No character development all. And that goes for the rest of the cast. Who were these people? Do we care at all about any of them? I would put this just ahead of the Star Wars prequel movies (1-3) as far as acting is concerned.<br/><br/>Do you want to know who should have gotten an Oscar??????.....<br/><br/>The Potatoes.<br/><br/>I found myself caring more about whether or not they lived or died than any character in here.<br/><br/>Snoozefest..."

How exciting do you think it would be to watch 2 hour 40 mins of a man stranded on Mars? Not very exciting. In gravity we had to watch Sandra bullock bounce around for 1 hours 20 min, which is exactly half of the Martian running time, and it is Martian which felt faster and shorter.<br/><br/>The key is the brilliant screenplay of this movie that always keeps the story interesting. When our man(Mat Damon) gets mistaken for dead and left stranded on the red planet by his team. He must use scientific knowledge, training and acumen to survive. This is actually far closer to real science, not your Star Trek ""warp-core- manifold"" variety. He has to use whatever is at his disposal to grow his own food, produce water and to find ingenious way of calling home. To watch him come up with one ingenious idea after the other is a treat to watch and never too unrealistic, as we repeatedly learn he is good at what he does.<br/><br/>Technically, this is a flawless production cinematography, VFX, sound, production design all work. The VFX are seamless and do not draw attention to themselves, making it look as if they really shot the movie on location -- on Mars!<br/><br/>This is a Matt Damon vehicle all the way, supported by an competent supporting class, but their characters barely get the screen time to grow. But that is OK, because Matt Damon is so brilliant and deserves an Oscar for making his lonely stay on Mars so entertaining for the viewer."
"toqtaqiya2","7","3","5","18 January 2016"," The Martian focuses on the triumph of human ingenuity under duress.
","Is The Martian science fiction or science fact? Well, it's set in the near future, in 2035, so it's not easy to call it science fiction, although it's technically science fiction. It's not entirely science fact either because some of the science on display in The Martian is questionable. What matters, however, is that the film is entertaining and memorable. There's no question that Ridley Scott is one of the best directors working in Hollywood. Prometheus (2012) marked his return to the science fiction genre, and now we have The Martian, which is even better. Prometheus is a visually impressive film that, unfortunately, has a confusing plot, poor characterization, and pacing issues. It was an attempt to repeat the formula of Alien (1979) and maybe even Aliens (1986), with mixed results. The Martian, on the other hand, isn't dark and confusing. It's straight-forward and upbeat. It centers around an astronaut (Matt Damon) who gets stranded on Mars and has to survive. His struggle to get in contact with NASA and to return home is what keeps the film running. I was surprised by how entertaining the film is. Firstly, the characters in The Martian make rational decisions. They're not a bunch of degenerates and fools who run around and get into trouble, like in Prometheus. And the performances from the cast are all solid. Leading man Matt Damon did good work playing Mark Watney, someone who's often funny and hardly ever depressed. Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, and Chiwetel Ejiofor are in supporting roles. Secondly, the science that's on display in the film is interesting. Some of what is shown makes viewers think, and wonder what's going to happen. Viewers can actually learn a few things from the film. This is due to the fact that the film is based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel, which was adapted into a screenplay by Drew Goddard. And, of course, The Martian is visually impressive, something that's to be expected from a Ridley Scott film. Some of the scenes set on Mars are stunning. The designs of the suits and vehicles are excellent too. So, The Martian is definitely worth recommending. It's a great example of crowd-pleasing cinema."
"robsta23","9","3","5","13 January 2016"," Unexpected Good Fun
","The Martian was deemed a comedy by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for the Golden Globe awards. It is definitely one of the most fun Ridley Scott films to date, even if it doesn't reach the sophistication of his films Alien and Blade Runner. This film is definitely not trying to be a comedy, however - it is a drama with a fun tone to it.<br/><br/>Contributing to this fun tone is an ensemble made up of actors with great comedic chops such as Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, and Michael Pena. Matt Damon recording his log while on Mars also proves to be funny throughout most of the movie. His character is great and shows a wide range of personality - he is a smart-aleck and sarcastic when he is optimistic, and he is rightfully ticked off the next moment. In both of these situations Damon plays it so perfectly to come across as funny in both instances.<br/><br/>His performance does get more dramatic though. As he spends more and more time on Mars he becomes desperate yet optimistic that he will be rescued. It is also unclear whether Damon had to lose weight for part of the performance, as weight loss in the character was noticeable but seemed almost unnatural upon viewing - heavy chance cgi was involved. Either way, Damon's performance in this film proves to show talent on a wide range of the spectrum.<br/><br/>The shots are constructed very well in this film. The editing proves to be interesting as well. A lot of point of view shots are used and are labeled as such - most notably there are shots that represent directly the video log Damon's character is recording, and shots from inside his helmet and over his shoulder are used and labeled along the lines of ""suit camera - Watney.""<br/><br/>There's also a huge focus on technology - most notably screens - in this film as well. It is how NASA must communicate with Watney - first by satellite images, then by a camera on Mars with Watney, then through what is essentially e-mail. When NASA is communicating with other people on Earth the communication is done through the use of screens as well. It is unclear whether this is simply because technology allows for this way to communicate in our day and age, or if this is a commentary on the way we use technology. Or perhaps this is to compare and contrast to Watney's struggles - he is constantly recording video logs, but those logs are not used for communication.<br/><br/>In the third act of the film it seems very similar to Apollo 13 since the focus is to help an astronaut come home. Since the struggle is to retrieve a lone survivor rather than to figure how to land on Earth safely, it proves to be more interesting and a lot more complex. Looking over the other great films of 2015, this film is amongst them, but not quite towards the top. This was an unexpectedly really fun movie from Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>3.5/4.0"

You do live with the movie. To me that's the essential. Beautiful shots with Matt Damon that proves us again that he is a great actor. So basically if you are not a whiner like some here on IMDb you will probably enjoy the movie like I did."

","This film tells the remarkable story of an astronaut stranded on Mars during a space mission. He does everything he can to survive, while the Earth sets up an unprecedented rescue mission to bring him back home safely.<br/><br/>Many people say ""The Martian"" is a very good film, and I do agree after watching it. The plot is simple but it has all the right elements to capture the viewers' hearts. To see Mark survive against all odds is very engaging and touching. In addition, the Herculean efforts to rescue him back to Earth is even more touching because there are almost insurmountable technical difficulties. The risk of failure is so high, that death seems almost certain. That of course brings about an poignant ending, which surely leaves me in tears. I enjoyed watching ""The Martian""."

","But as a time-pass film it's definitely worth a watch. This is Matt Damon's second science-fiction horror film film following Elysium(2013).<br/><br/>This film is directed by the highly acclaimed director who is best known for the cult science-fiction horror film film Alien(1979) The film is about a stranded astronaut Mark Watney who is left behind on Mars. The first part of film is about how he manages to stay alive while a rescue mission is planned. Mark Watney is a botanist by profession, and as his food source is dwindling he decides to grow some potatoes in Mars's soil.<br/><br/>The second part of the film deals with the planning essential to his rescue. NASA director Theodore ""Teddy"" Sanders(veteran actor Jeff Daniels) debates whether the lives of Mark's fellow astronauts is worth risking to save one life.<br/><br/>Public concern increases as Marks plight is televised back on Earth. Mission commander Melissa Lewis(Jessica Chastain) deliberately disobeys her orders and plots a course to rescue Mark.<br/><br/>Will Mark be rescued or will further disaster ensue? Watch the film to find out what happens next...<br/><br/>Verdict: Cast is decent. The photography is by the acclaimed Dariusz Wolski(The Crow 1994, Crimson Tide 1995, A Perfect Murder 1998, Hide and Seek 2005, Prometheus 2012). Harry Gregson-Williams has directed the music for the film. He has worked in films like The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the Shrek franchise.<br/><br/>Supporting actors Sean Bean, Michael Peña, Chiwetel Ejiofor(Amistad 1997, 12 Years a Slave 2013), Benedict Wong and Donald Glover give professional performances.<br/><br/>There is one more thing I must mention, earlier I saw The Europa Report(2013) which I consider to be the best modern science fiction film ever made. I sincerely recommend you to see this film in theater, online or through DVD/BLU RAY rental.<br/><br/>More films to see: Journey to the Far Side of the Sun a.k.a. Doppelgänger (1969), Mission To Mars(2000), Red Planet(2000), Gravity (2013), The First Men in the Moon (1964) and lastly the superb film based on the true events of Apollo 13 made into a 1995 film directed by the acclaimed Ron Howard.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review, live long and prosper."
"adamscastlevania2","7","3","5","2 November 2015"," A nice rocket ride while it lasts
","(68%) A well made space survival adventure that mixes Apollo 13, Castaway and Interstellar in a very watchable treat that marks a lighter entry into Ridley Scott's filmography. The pacing is sharp, the performances from the strong cast are solid and this never becomes anything other than a likable sit. Unlike something such as Castaway the plot is more required to follow both the captive (Matt Damon) and the rest of the cast who's only objective is to try and help rescue him, so there is a fair amount of switching between the two focal points rather than pure Matt Damon in space trying to get by. Without doubt this is a band apart from the lesser films of the year, but I doubt it will top my list mainly because for me it came and went without hardly any lasting impact. So by the end it is enjoyable while it lasts with plenty of heart and entertainment value, but it didn't send as many shock-waves upon me as it did so many others. Nice throwback soundtrack though."

"jsataluri","9","13","37","4 October 2015"," Visually stunning with excellent acting
","Ridley Scott's The Martian is a straight forward, yet visual alluring movie about a man stranded on Mars and the team effort from Earth to bring him home. From the beginning, it gets straight to the plot and beautifully illustrates Mark Whatney's long, arduous and painstaking tale of survival and the NASA/JPL's (with some help) persistent and tireless team effort to bring him home. <br/><br/>Ridley Scott directs the film with beautiful storytelling and stunning visuals. The plot does not meander and the scenery and visual effects are exemplary. Mars looks and feels real and the satellite imagery is used appropriately. The humor is intoxicating and keeps the audience entertained. Most importantly the human determination and strong spirit is the key to the film's success. We all aspire to be the best we want to be and when we run into trouble, we should always try to remain hopeful of the situation and never ever give up. <br/><br/>An excellent cast consisting of comedic actors like Kristen Wiig, reliable character actors like Jeff Daniels and Michael Peña (the former who doesn't let his character become a caricature and brings a bit of Gregg Popovich in him and the latter who is great as always), Marvel characters like Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan, new names that some of the audience may have never heard before like Aksel Hennie, Benedict Wong, McKenzie Davis and Donald Glover and those in the background elevate the film from being an ordinary film. Jessica Chastain is wonderful as the commanding officer, portraying her character's reactions with great naturalism. Sean Bean is a delight as the Flight Director who eschews PR distractions by using his practicality and common sense to bring the crew home.<br/><br/>But the film belongs to Matt Damon and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Damon is brilliant as the main character Whatney who tries to do the best he can to survive on Mars. Each aspect of his acting does not feel forced and his deadpan is hilarious. Most importantly his will to live drives the film and we feel as if we are with him and we want him to return home. He can add this performance to his personal top 5. In my opinion, Ejiofor is at the peak of his acting prowess and he is fantastic as Vincent Kapoor who is deeply involved about the fate of the crew and will do anything it takes to bring them home. He is to be lauded for making Kapoor a strong willed humanist who is compassionate to everyone and views them as equals and simultaneously as a no nonsense engineer who wants things done at the best of their capabilities in order to save life. To him like Ed Harris's portrayal of Gene Kranz in Apollo 13, failure is and will not be an option. <br/><br/>Background music is good, but the 70s soundtrack is even better much to the annoyance of Whatney.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie with its simple storyline, arresting visuals, and excellent ensemble led Damon and Ejiofor with honorable mentions to Chastain and Bean is something to experience. Most importantly, the human determination and spirit is the most memorable aspect of the movie and will linger with you as you leave the theater.<br/><br/>9/10"

"justinwfirestone","6","7","17","9 October 2015"," No masterpiece here
","(Full disclosure: I was a little torked during the movie due to drinking a whole flask of bourbon rather quickly, but with some popcorn.)<br/><br/>It's hard to watch a movie like The Martian without trying to put yourself in the hero's shoes. I've read some studies about total isolation suggesting everyone goes crazy without some meaningful human interaction. I know people have lived hermetic lives in deserts, so clearly someone with enough mental composure could survive alone for a couple of years, even if being unable to ""science the sh*t"" out of anything in particular. My first reaction to solitude for the first time in months would've been to engage in a masturbatory marathon, but our hero instead spends time thinking about mundane projects like trying to grow enough food to survive until he can be rescued.<br/><br/>Our hero is Mark Watney. He's a hero because he gets hit by some space stuff and everyone else on his team does the French goodbye. I have a hard time hearing ""Watney"" without reminiscing over Watney's Cream Stout, but I did have trusty bourbon at hand. The Martian imagery surely recalls Prometheus, especially the scenes involving roving around in rovers. However, we get horrible running jokes about (bad) disco music, which differentiates it wildly from Prometheus. There's nothing predator gross or alien scary running around Mars (this time).<br/><br/>It's a triumph of the spirit (will, even, if you will), slightly jingoistic and Americanly exceptionalist, until NASA needs help from China. Instead of the annoying just-in-time saves we see all too often in disaster films, the Martian is riddled with just-in-time disasters, much like every episode of Gilligan's Island (except I'm pretty sure there was some later TV movie where they get off the island or go back and start a hotel with the Harlem Globetrotters). The movie is too long, I didn't care whether they saved our hero, and the special effects of space movies still have yet to outperform 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br/><br/>The good: The Martian reminds us that Sean Bean should be in every movie, Matt Damon is in too many movies, and Kristen Wiig can adequately do non-comedy. Michael Peña survives without being too campy or loud, and Jeff Daniels can cash a check with the best of them. Impressively, this might be the first movie I've seen all year that is pro-science."

While one is underway a large, unforecast storm comes up on Mars requiring the crew of 6 to cut the mission short and use the escape rocket to blast off and rendezvous with the main space ship orbiting Mars. But one of the crew, Mark Watney, is hit by a large object and carried away, injured and out of communications. Reluctantly they have to blast off without him after a short search was futile. Mark was presumed dead.<br/><br/>But Matt Damon as Mark Watney didn't give up so easily, he managed to get himself to a base station and using medical tools and staples repaired his wounds and set about trying to figure out how to survive with limited resources. Fortunately with rations for 6 he was able to make food stretch, and as a Botanist even came up with a method to make water and, using his own waste as fertilizer, used a Thanksgiving package of potatoes to grow potatoes in a chamber converted to a greenhouse of sorts.<br/><br/>So much of the movie is about Mark's survival, plus his figuring out a way, using old abandoned Mars exploration robots, to communicate with NASA. The real hard part becomes how to plan and carry out a rescue mission. Mars is far away, it takes a long time, he has limited time to survive.<br/><br/>The cast is varied and good, with Jessica Chastain as Melissa Lewis, the commander of the mission. Kristen Wiig in a serious role as a NASA communications officer, Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders, the NASA chief, Michael Peña as Rick Martinez, the pilot for the mission, Kate Mara as one of the crew, a computer expert, Beth Johanssen, among others.<br/><br/>This is a really good and entertaining movie. It is a serious subject but is treated with appropriate humor. <br/><br/>EDIT: I re-watched it 8 days later and enjoyed it as much the second time!<br/><br/>SPOILERS: When the first rescue approach failed in a faulty rocket launch, a young data nerd calculated, using NASA's super computer, that the crew on their way back to Earth could accelerate and using the Earth slingshot return to Mars, but it would require a risky capture of a re-supply module and a never-rehearsed module take-off from Mars to try to capture Watney in a Mars fly-by. NASA said no to the risk but the crew decided on their own to try the rescue. That whole last scene was very tense and of course it was a success."

"matthewssilverhammer","9","4","8","9 October 2015"," Scott's Best Since Alien
","Ridley Scott has made some of the most enduring classics of all time in his 40-year career (Alien, Gladiator, Blade Runner). On the other hand, he has also managed to totally wet the bed in many of his productions, especially in recent years (The Counselor, Robin Hood). This big-hit-or-big-miss track record keeps him surprisingly vital for a 77-year-old man, with his successes often directly relating to their source material. With his most recent, The Martian, an adaptation of a hugely popular novel, he uses that original story to create a beautiful and spirited stranded-planet adventure that rivals anything Scott has done in decades. The survival tale of a NASA astronaut accidentally stranded on Mars begs comparison to recent space disaster films Gravity and Interstellar. While Martian is comparable to those movies high-points in visuals and sheer thrills, it surpasses both in sheer personality. Even though much of Scott's galactic epic focuses on hard science, botany theories, and public relations problems, it far exceeds its inherent dryness with a lively and sharply funny script, and a wonderfully believable turn by Damon. His brainy and silly performance is backed by a deep sense of fear and awe, as he reconciles and even revels in his newfound heroism while never forgetting its colossal danger. This epic tale is told surprisingly economically, never reaching too far past its focal points and keeping us completely engaged. Martian's parable of ingenuity and the will to survive is a smart and fully entertaining science fiction outing that reminds us what great big movies can be: funny, uplifting, transporting, and exhilarating."

It's absolutely packed full of technical jargon that my eyes glassed over after a while . It's way too long and I was expecting a career defining performance from Matt Damon , having seen other reviews , but it was just Matt Damon being Matt Damon. Nothing new. There is also one of the worst bits of casting I have seen in years and that is Sean Bean as Mitch Henderson . He looks and sounds so out of place , in fact he stumbles through the film looking like he is suffering a massive hangover. This film was definitely not out of this world."

","I have not read the fiction, but the structure is appealing: a survival story with space science authentic details. To me, Gravity is a poet, the Martian movie, well, it is kind of cheesy and mediocre.<br/><br/>Not a bad movie, it is still fun to watch if you do not need philosophy or inspiration; I can tell everyone worked hard on making the movie. But somehow the loneliness, fear, despair, danger, the life-on-a-thread situation are not delivered enough. It's not Matt Damon's problem, I do not feel those emotions and elements because of the choices of dialogue of actors, what and how to be presented, and what are not shown in the screenplay and editing. <br/><br/>The bigger trouble is, some actors who played NASA staff, rather look like staff in a theme park or a mall. In reality, NASA staff may look like ordinary people, but I just cannot believe some of the actors on that screen are NASA staff. <br/><br/>Glad to know that the last scene of Matt Damon was not from the original writer, because it is such a mediocre closure."
"dutchs-1","10","6","14","21 October 2015"," Because I don't have eleven stars
","This film lived up nicely to all the pre-release hype. Matt Damon is stranded on Mars when he's blown away by a Martian windstorm and presumed dead, and the expedition has to abort the mission. But he survived, and fixes his injuries, grows potatoes originally intended as a Thanksgiving treat, burns thruster fuel to create water, uses human wastes as fertilizer (for some reason, only his own) and recovers an old Mars lander to improvise communications with Earth. There are a few scientific quibbles. Martian windstorms are just not that powerful since the air is only 1/1000 as dense as earth's. It seems unlikely that the habitat wouldn't have its own communications with Earth, or at least the ability to communicate through the fleet of satellites orbiting Mars. And the ending piles on problems simply for the sake of piling them on. Really, instead of blowing off one end of the rescue ship to generate thrust to slow down, why not just turn and use the thrusters? That way the whole ship is habitable for the return trip instead of just a few cut-off modules. Matt Damon certainly delivers an effective recruiting pitch for NASA, though Jessica Chastain ""swimming"" in zero-g gives him worthy competition. At a time when many people don't consider characters interesting unless they manifest at least half the conditions in DSM-V, some unapologetic rational behavior is a breath of fresh air. Competence porn? Bring it on."
"gercs","9","6","14","11 October 2015"," Another great sci-fi offering in this decade
","I don't like sci-fi films that much, but these days we have films, which what I thought to have a good combination of creativity and realism such that they are too good to ignore. Both ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"" have been considered iconic films in this genre, and this year, we have another one, albeit not as iconic, under the title of ""The Martian"". Although it doesn't have the technical novelty in the same degree as that of ""Gravity"" or the edgy plot that we have encountered in ""Interstellar""; nonetheless, ""The Martian"" manages to be as amazing. The plot is simple, but yet we are treated with a good, if not impressive, execution of the simple and subtle things in the story. It is simple yet brainy. The story basically deals with the humanity's way of solving problems in order to survive. Solve the bigger problem by decomposing it into smaller problems, and then solve them one by one until you have solved enough problems that will probably enable you to survive.<br/><br/>It revolves around a scientific expedition to Mars, which was unfortunately hampered by the inaccurately predicted Martian storm. That storm was strong enough to destroy their launch pad, and this forced the crew to leave the Martian research unit. However, during the untimely evacuation, a crew member was hit by debris and was left behind. He was presumed dead, but was later discovered alive through the satellite images received by the Earth. The surviving crew was already on their journey back home when they learned that he was still alive. However, they were facing a difficult logistics problem for his rescue, given the expensive space mission and the distance between Earth and Mars. It would take at least a year at best for a supply or rescue to reach the planet, and perhaps, by that time Mark Watney was already dead.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the survival efforts - sounds tedious and depressing for a film to depict - but like the case of other great films, the journey was rather engaging and enjoyable, kudos to the performance of Matt Damon as Mark Watney and the achievement by Ridley Scott as director. Furthermore, the experience was enhanced by the excellent use of visual effects and music. Although, the approach can be considered minimalist, the thrills brought by this film are satisfying. I found the survival process in itself enjoyable, and what makes it even more interesting is that it is not all about the efforts of one man alone, but also the efforts of the people in the Earth to bring Mark Watney back home alive. Matt Damon was surrounded by a compelling supporting cast (to name a few: Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels), and of course a compelling combination of different subject matters: astrophysics, rocket science, botany, chemistry, mathematics, and supercomputers. <br/><br/>However, for those who expect a big dose of action and emotions, they may rather find this film disappointing or a bit unfulfilling. There are lots of powerful scenes wherein the director should have managed to bring the experience into full blast but rather chose to ""soft-pedal"" them. Not bad though, but I thought it could have been more amazing. Moreover, the first two-thirds of the film tried to avoid the cliché often associated with films under this genre, but unfortunately it sort of fell to the ""Hollywoodish"" formula in the end, e.g. the scene with the big crowd in the New York Times Square. However, I still say it was an amazing film. This is one of Ridley Scott's best, and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a lot of attention in the awards season."

"billdyj","10","6","14","8 October 2015"," Blew me away
","This is one of the more memorable movies I have seen, in some ways it is very hard to describe how good I felt it was. Matt Damon shows what I always thought about him, that he is an intelligent actor able to give any role that special touch. He is playing a very intelligent character and he does it seamlessly. He also gives the character a sardonic sense of humor, which means this is not cold or pure hard science. Likewise, when he finally interacts with the rest of the crew of his ship, the interplay is what you would expect.<br/><br/>The movie is a rare thing, it is a hard science fiction movie that has the human touch, the casting was fantastic and you see the humanity.It has touches of Apollo 13 where the nerds with the pocket protectors and slide rules pull off a miracle, but it also has a lot of the human emotion, humor and at times sadness, that make it real. John Campbell, considered the founder of modern SF, said that science fiction was not about the technology, but about how human beings react to it, and that is the core of this movie. The fact that the technology here is not star wars level, but technology that either does or potentially could exist in the near future, and it makes it come off as something that might happen.<br/><br/>It is also nice to see a movie where the heroes are not all white nerdy guys, plenty of those, but plenty of other people, the mission is commanded by a woman, women play major roles, and you have a lot of non white people as scientists and such. I think that helps give the feeling of awe the movie generated in me, that it was a mish mash of people working to have this happen. <br/><br/>The movie is long, yet it didn't seem like that, and where you have a movie where a single character is on the screen most of the time and it doesn't drag, that says something. The filming is well done, and this has elements of a lot of Ridley Scott's work, though I personally think it is his masterpiece, if this is his last movie it is a doozie."

","The Martian is a dyed-in-the-wool Hollywood movie of a grand space adventure. The movie's screen-writing and direction is, true to its subject, like an optimized space-craft, which has exactly those components it requires for its singular objective and absolutely nothing else. The objective of 'The Martian' is to be a good family sci-fi space adventure, following in footsteps of E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Zathura: A Space Adventure, etc. , that is specifically targeted at the sense of humor of kids and young teens of this generation. The movie also has elements of nostalgia targeted specifically at the generation of their parents. The Martian serves as a vessel that carries its entertaining feel-good story to its intended audience and does it well, but carries little else for anybody else.<br/><br/>It is likely that this movie will disappoint several viewers, not so much because it is inherently bad, but more so because it does nothing to satisfy their expectations. In past decade, many PG and G movies have found massive adult following because movie expected to be for kids have turned out to be remarkably deep and rich in story that appeals to grown-ups. The Martian is totally opposite to this trend, in that, it is a movie expected to be for grown-ups with serious space exploration, marooning, desolation, imminent and impending death, existential crisis, nonchalant bureaucratic space administration - an 'Office Space' in space on a Monday... with car keys missing and presentation document lost! The Martian is 'Office Space' that starts on Friday 4 pm with a bit of issues till 5pm, continues through a balmy weekend with well behaved kids, friendly neighbors, BBQ with BYOB, lots of blue clouds and Sun and ends on Sunday night. There are a few instances of trouble with lighter fluid and getting the BBQ going, but nothing that will erase that smile off your face or place the weekend in any real jeopardy. In the end, the kids learn that getting a BBQ requires some patience, and problems of missing charcoal and pickles can be resolved with an indefatigable cheery disposition and lots of banter with your enormously friendly neighbors. So much so that even the, otherwise ignored, Chinese family in the neighborhood can be invited to join the BBQ. Big things can be accomplished when everyone pitches in and works as a team!<br/><br/>Summary: Take your kids and go see this movie as a family in a theater near you. It's good entertainment and inspiration for kids. Every generation of kids should have a movie that inspires them to dream of becoming an astronaut someday. The Martian does this well. Others may want to skip this one or watch it on BluRay on a slow evening."

Based on Andy Weir's scientifically specific source novel and with the official support of NASA, the film adopts a more down-to-earth method to tell the story as realistic as possible, at least meets the basic criterion of today's scientific level.<br/><br/>There are two parallel story lines at first, one is on Mars, concerning, the only man (might not be the only living creature thanks to the recent discovery of water) on a foreign planet, completely alone and how he strives to survive, fortunately he can avail himself of his professional know- how to successfully cultivate potatoes on the Mars' soil (which might not be realistic, then again, no one has ever been to the Mars, so everything can be ascribed to the imagination license) and produce water. Meanwhile, he is seeking a way to contact NASA, to let the earthlings know he is stranded, in hope of a rescue mission. And beyond our imagination, he manages to do that too, through the defunct Pathfinder, the roving probe launched on Mars in 1996. On earth, the narrative is centred on Teddy (Daniels), the Director of NASA, Vincent Kapoor (Ejiofor), the director of Mars mission, once they realise Matt's quandary, how they creatively sustain the communication with Mark and collect their wits to a rescue plan.<br/><br/>But odds are not in favour of Mark, after a failing launch of a space probe aiming to resupply him for sustain until the next mission, and an airlock disaster destroys all his plants, a third party enters the picture, as the only hope is hinged on Hermes, the spacecraft on its way back from Mars to Earth with Matt's fellow astronauts, lead by captain Lewis (Chastain, a female captain!!), Hermes must extend its mission by another year in space, and firstly it must receive a booster proffered by CNSA (China National Space Administration) on the earth orbit, to resupply the Hermes, so they can return to Mars and get Mark back, and But if you expect some discord among its crew members, you will be disappointed, they are as united as ever, to risk their own life for the risky expedition. This is the final attempt, which unfortunately evolves into a public stunt not just for NASA, for America, but for the whole human race, to affirm that every one and single life counts, as in reality, we know it is not the truth.<br/><br/>The film doesn't flaunt its visual grandeur, on the contrary, everything seems subdued for its accuracy, or at least verisimilitude, only the final rescue paragraph, propels us for an adrenalin drive like a less compelling re-take of Sandra Bullock's space yank-and-tossing with George Clooney in GRAVITY, but to an uplifting upshot.<br/><br/>Matt Damon delivers a substantially absorbing one-man-show, generates optimism and gives wisecracks through a series of video logs, not an Oscar-bait performance but if he can get a filler nomination for INVICTUS (2009), it means nothing is impossible for him. Considering Mark's situation, facing his despair and loneliness in a lone planet, the most probable denouement is dying there alone, 220,000,000 km from home, his mental journey is short- changed nevertheless, since the film contends to be a satisfactory tale of a man-made wonder, it is understandable they try to whitewash the sombre facet of the ordeal. All the supporting roles are portrayed level-headedly through their professions other than 3-dimensional characters, a guilt-driven Chastain could have been a potential scene-stealer, but that never gonna happen and her crew is too harmonious to allow the captain to risk any emotional turbulence.<br/><br/>Fairly speaking, THE MARTIAN is less visually-innovate than GRAVITY and less theoretically- sophisticated than INTERSTELLAR, but for a Ridley Scott's vehicle, it hearteningly reaffirms us that sitting at the age of 78, he is not ready for retirement yet. The film is extremely audience- friendly, roundly constructed, and most admirably, with no calculation to cater to audience's rapacious appetite of hollow special effects."

","Once you want to go for a movie, which's evry part is realistic you gotta stick to that.This film might be realistic enough for a tipical dumb American, but anybody who has a little clue about cosmic radiation,or at least physics would laugh while watching this movie.From the beginning to the end.The story had a huge potential,yet this "" 'muricanization"" ruined it completely.And when I say muricanization, I think of it like a ""okay lets make this film watchable for the dumb people of the USA"" who would even ask each other after the film if it was based on a true story.Well Ridley Scott, if this was the plan, you succeeded, but for anybody who literally has some logic and seen/read some stuff about what would it really be like in the space or on the surface of Mars is just laughing at your ""masterpiece"". It doesn't even take a scientist to know about the micro meteors hitting the Mars constantly,but no problem, Matt Damon will just cover the station's entrance with a plastic bag.

"schroeder-gustavo","8","5","11","11 October 2015"," The Martian
","I really do not care what the movie is about, if Ridley Scott is directing, I want to see it. I mean, how cool is it to be able to go to a movie theater and watch a movie directed by the guy who made Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator? It's so awesome. The problem is Ridley Scott has been inconsistent over the years, with some less great films, like Exodus: Gods and Kings. I am happy to say, however, the Martian will probably be another Scott classic.<br/><br/>The Martian is a very intriguing and smart movie, the cinematography is absolutely stunning and I have no idea where they shot the movie, but one could actually believe they are on Mars. The desert wastelands are just breathtaking. The movie is also very funny, surprisingly and features great performances by a huge cast, especially Matt Damon, who is just awesome in this. Chiwetel Ejiofor is also great, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and others do a great job as well.<br/><br/>I love movies like this that incorporate real science into the plot, but it also makes it clear to the audience what it all means. It's a great way to make the plot of the movie believable and it worked great in the Martian.<br/><br/>Now, there are flaws in the movie, particularly for me it was the pacing. Every single Matt Damon scene is great, the movie feels like Castaway on Mars, and I loved that. But sometimes the focus shifts to the people on Earth and NASA trying to solve the problem and bring Damon's character Mark Watney home. I understand the things that happen on Earth have to be explained in order for the movie to make sense. However, the pacing of the movie slows down a lot and we get to see less of Watney's epic quest for survival. Some sequences towards the end feel slow because of this and there is a very long stretch in the movie that doesn't even show the main character of the film. Once you've established who the hero in the movie is, well, we should be able to follow him in his character ark. And the movie doesn't really let us do this, because it shifts focus so many times.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, The Martian looks great, the effects are pretty good, the cinematography is beautiful and the acting is solid. I didn't particularly enjoy that much of the sequences on Earth, but they were necessary. The Martian, I believe and hope, will be regarded in the future as a very funny Ridley Scott classic."

"japamo","10","5","11","7 October 2015"," ""Space Does Not Cooperate"", but That Won't Stop ""The Martian""
","Beyond the spaceship duels and friendly/unfriendly human/alien encounters, outer space films like the ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" franchises (and even TV's ""Futurama"") draw their appeal from their confident assurance that someday humanity will not just ""conquer"" space, it will make it so comfortable and familiar that visiting a new planet will be as easy as taking a walk to the neighborhood grocery store. Perhaps, but that hope is at least decades away. Right now, even now, outer space is cold, dark, and above all, so vast that even visiting a relatively close planet like Mars takes an average of four years. And even when you get to Mars, it's barely more hospitable than the moon. ""The Martian""'s (hereafter ""Martian) protagonist, space botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is absolutely right when he states ""Space Does Not Cooperate"". This becomes a problem when he is stranded alone on Mars like an interplanetary ""Robinson Crusoe"" (somewhat reminiscent of the 1964 film).<br/><br/>Mark is part of the Ares III team also consisting of Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and astronauts Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). While the Ares III team explores Mars, a blinding particle storm forces them to abort their mission and board their ship. The storm violently separates Mark from the rest of the crew who are forced to leave without him, believing Mark dead. The crew is so convinced he's dead that when they communicate that fact to NASA head Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), he almost immediately arranges an honorary funeral for him.<br/><br/>Of course, rumors of Mark's death are premature. Buried in sand, losing oxygen, and suffering a puncture wound, Mark is nevertheless alive. He manages to struggle back to the still-standing planet base, replenish air, equalize pressure, and treat his wound as best he can. However, the obstacles to his survival are just piling up. Can Mark fight Martian weather, radiation, cold, starvation, dehydration, and boredom at least long enough to somehow contact NASA to let them know he's alive, and then stay alive even longer for NASA to mount a rescue mission? Again, given that a one-way Earth-to-Mars trip takes four years, that's a daunting challenge.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back on Earth, Teddy, NASA spokesperson Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig), and NASA mission directors Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) have their own challenges, both urgent and mundane. Besides naturally getting Mitch home safely, Teddy and his team must negotiate the usual treacherous PR protocol to make sure that Mark's inadvertent abandonment does not embarrass, discredit, and eventually defund NASA. And meanwhile, back on Ares III heading back to Earth, the crew, especially guilt- ridden Commander Lewis, must decide, once NASA finally informs them, whether to continue home or return to rescue Mark, depending not only on whether they have enough fuel to do one or the other, but also on coordinating ship/Mars trajectory just right to get Mark.<br/><br/>And so ""Martian"" oscillates among these three scenarios and dilemmas and manages, in my opinion, to do it without boring and, if you'll excuse the expression, alienating the audience. How can a space movie without aliens (even Marvin), laser weapons, or aerial combat hope to do this? I think ""Martian"" succeeds in this by being more knowledgeable than its audience, but in a way that instructs the audience without talking down to them. The movie explains many astrophysical, mechanical, and chemical concepts (including a crucial ""slingshot"" maneuver) that help keep the movie going forward and the audience invested in the characters' fates. It certainly helps that Damon's character Mark, in his daily video journal of his ordeals, explains much of this scientific stuff in largely (and often laugh-out-loud profane) layperson's terms.<br/><br/>Furthermore, ""Martian"" reminds us that no national organization has a monopoly on knowledge. When NASA's attempt to send supplies in a booster rocket explodes into failure, they willingly ignore political tensions to contact chief scientist Guo Ming (Eddy Ko) and deputy chief scientist Zhu Tao (Chen Shu) at Chinese counterpart Chinese National Space Agency (CNSA) to help stabilize the payload. Ah, science rejects borders and embraces diversity. Finally, ""Martian"" uses science to ratchet up the intense suspense as Ares III does decide to go back to get Mark by plotting a trajectory and spacewalk, while Mark plots a rendezvous point and prepares a lightened space capsule and ""spacesuit propulsion"" system to hopefully get close enough to Ares III to grab him before his oxygen runs out.<br/><br/>""Martian""'s intelligence also complements the convincing special effects, believably fallible but professional and determined characters (especially Mark), and the realistic depiction of the problems and triumphs of space agency bureaucracy and more importantly space exploration to make an absorbing and involving movie. Not least, ""Martian"" succeeds because it respects human intelligence and persistence so much, it convinces us that humanity will eventually surmount space's often deadly ""uncooperativeness"".<br/><br/>P.S.: I saw this movie in the theater in 3D? Does 3D enhance the experience? In my opinion, it does to a slight degree, in the depiction of the Martian sandstorms and the flying spaceships. Yet, I felt it was largely unnecessary. Space's grandeur and infinite mystery come through even without the extra dimension.<br/><br/>P.P.S.: I especially appreciated how Mark explained how planting crops (like potatoes on Mars) in a new land effectively colonizes that land, and how the distinction between international law and maritime law technically made him a ""space pirate"". Arrrrgh!"
"Wuchakk","8","2","3","7 May 2019"," Realistic account of trying to survive on Mars while awaiting rescue
","In 2035 an astronaut (Matt Damon) gets stuck on Mars after he is presumed dead and his team departs without him. When NASA eventually finds out that he's alive & well they have to find a way to save him. But can he survive for the next couple of years until they arrive? Jeff Daniels plays the director of NASA while Jessica Chastain plays the leader of the vessel. Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor and several other notables are on hand.<br/><br/>The only way for Ridley Scott's ""The Martian"" (2015) to work is if it can convince you that Damon's character is actually on Mars, which it does spectacularly and realistically (minus a few forced dramatics or stabs at humor here and there). If, like me, you're fascinated by Mars or the potential of living on another planet in the real world, ""The Martian"" is a must.<br/><br/>It's reminiscent of movies like ""Armegeddon"" (1998), ""Mission to Mars"" (2000), ""Gravity"" (2013) and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), albeit without the fantastical elements of some of these. It even brings to mind the first acts of ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968) and ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970).<br/><br/>The movie scores pretty well on the female front with Chastain, Mackenzie Davis, Kate Mara and Kristen Wiig. Davis looks good in tight pants.<br/><br/>The film runs 2 hours, 24 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-/B+"

"caubiz","2","2","3","9 June 2018"," Very disappointed & I love space movies
","I grew up when NASA first started sending people into space and it captivated me so much so that I would build models of the spacecraft and hang them out my window when a mission was on. I'm also a fan of Ridley Scott but this movie missed the mark by a wide margin for me. <br/><br/>First of all, it is WAY TOO LONG and I found my inner child constantly saying ""are we there yet?"" This was the result of a lack of dramatic tension in the screenplay and lack of depth to the characters. I agree with other viewers who say there should have been more angst about being alone on a planet millions of miles from home. If it was me, I would be freaking out! (Then I would pray). Also some great shots of that isolation against the magnificent universe would have been awesome but we were given none of these.<br/><br/>We have seen these movies before done better - my standard is always ""Independence Day"" where you had real character development, dramatic tension, and excellent humor in the script. None of these elements are present in this script. In fact, we know we have been here before, and just like making copies of a tape, successive versions aren't quite as sharp as the original. This movie must have been the 10th copy! <br/><br/>Not good enough for a Ridley Scott movie. Matt Damon does well with what he has but he is not given a whole lot to work with. And was it me, or was that a stand in doing the nude scene of Matt emerging from a shower?<br/><br/>I would have preferred to see Jeff Goldblum do the lead, though I get it that he is not a big enough box office draw. I think he would have done much more with the thin gruel given to the lead. <br/><br/>Waste of talent all around."

He risks the lives of his former crew mates, makes them stay in space more than a year longer than they should have, and I don't even want to think of the financial costs, and all because that egoistic turd decided he wanted to stay alive (and then takes all the credit himself for being alive in the end). If he would have thought about anyone else than himself he would have killed himself! Some of his crew mates had families, for crying out loud, which he obviously did not care one bit about!

After reading the book it was nice to see that almost everything depicted in my mind from the narration was brought to life on the screen. Andy Weir did a fantastic job and he put forth the extra effort to make it close to scientifically accurate. He has said himself that when writing it he would review his work and decide if Neil DeGrasse Tyson would approve, and then modify it accordingly. Truly an excellent job."

","The bad news is that NASA has to effect a high risk rescue of an astronaut from Mars. The even worse news is that this process will take dang near two and a half hours real time and it involves enduring Matt Damon. This has got to be one of the most tedious movies of the 21st century as Damon, playing space cadet Mark Watney, mugs and cracks wise in a seemingly interminable proto-propaganda bureaucracy department feature. Damon is developing a specialty for quasi-governmental roles what with the Bourne stuff, Confessions of a D M, Saving Private Ryan, Syriana, The Good Shepherd et al. The premise of an outer space rescue that takes this long means it can only end successfully,thus quashing the only sliver of suspense that may have existed in the first place. In contrast to Damon for the most part, Ridley Scott at least used to regularly make good movies, but has now apparently joined the pasteurized cheese by-product posse. The disco soundtrack is roundly criticized by the cast throughout the flick yet that's all you're gonna get so apparently the producers wanted to have their cake and eat it too. Jeff Daniels reads his lines authoritatively while Kristen Wiig is little more than a statue, propped up next to the lectern, implying that women are not quite ready to issue NASA p/r convincingly. High production values, solid special effects ( even if technically inaccurate ) and an exciting final ten minutes or so can't keep this slab of cosmic detritus from deserving to be lost in space."
"amesmonde","Null","2","3","31 July 2016"," Tense, humorous and visually rich
","Thought to be dead an astronaut botanist has to live in the dangerous conditions of Mars, relying on his ingenuity to survive until the next mission arrives.<br/><br/>Matt Damon doesn't understand why he was reduced to only saying his name in Team America, maybe it's because the makers were being ironic, never more so in The Martian is this highlighted. Under director Ridley Scott's auteur eye Damon shines here as Watney in Drew Goddard's adaptation of Andy Weir's novel. It's tense, humorous and visually rich including planets, Martian landscapes, space crafts and NASA control rooms. It's also smart and thrillingly realistic as they plan rescue attempts and Damon hones Robinson Crusoe on Mars, Grativy, Apollo 13 and the like. The sets, props, costumes and special effects CGI for the most part are excellent the locations both on Earth and the red planet really sell it.<br/><br/>The acting is aided by Goddard's credible script. Both Jeff Daniels and Kristen Wiig are notable here in serious roles. Memorable are Sean Bean as Mitch - a mission director, Benedict Wong plays Bruce Ng an engineer of the rockets for the rescue mission and Chiwetel Ejiofor is Vincent, a director and the first person to establish contact with Watney. There plenty of disco tracks as that's all Watney has to listen to, but Harry Gregson-Williams' Martian score is solid. Watney's uses all his skills an intellect, stapling a wound, he rations food and grows his own in seemingly impossible conditions and uses different NASA equipment to aid him. Damon's Watney at times is very witty and you warm to dryness and invest in his survival, rooting for him in his highs and lows. Back on Earth Scott offers digestible politics and PR but there's a positive aspect with countries, individuals and departments working together with each other.<br/><br/>Goddard and Weir's offering doesn't contain any sci-fi metaphysical and/or horror tropes with The Martians realism and by default Scott remains focused on a humane elements and visual effects never delving into what made him a household name. It's about human beings tackling problems and the exploration of Mars' barren environment and like similar space disaster movies there's plenty of emotion, even with its long running time it moves along at pace.<br/><br/>Overall, if red planet sandstorms, potato growing and space travel is your thing, it's a must."

Every sequence is well studied in each detail and there were many plots and twists. Matt Damon was magic in his astronaut role and Ridley Scott proofed that he can create other successful films.

"leonblackwood","7","2","3","13 March 2016"," Full of tension but I preferred Moon! 7/10
","Review: Now that I have finally got to watch this movie, after listening to all of the hype and seeing loads of footage, I can actually say that it was quite enjoyable but I personally think that Moon was better. I've tried to watch Gravity again but I get bored after the first few minutes, and I've got a funny feeling that, that might happen if I try and watch this movie again. That doesn't mean that it's a bad film, because I did feel the tension throughout the movie but for some unknown reason, I can't see myself sitting down for 2 and a half hours, watching a film were I know what happens at the end. There isn't any outstanding performances, like Sam Rockwell in Moon, and the storyline is very straight laced, until his potato stash becomes contaminated. The film does look great, and so it should with such a big budget, and the crew was a great variation of characters which brought different elements to the team but I still feel that it lacked a certain something, which would have made this film an all time classic. Matt Damon (Mark Watney), played his part well and he made his character feel real, especially when he used his scientific knowledge to stay alive but I still felt a bit empty when the movie finished. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch, for a tension/drama point of view but I personally was expecting more. Watchable! <br/><br/>Round-Up: Is there anything that Matt Damon, 45, can't do! After his brief roles in Mystic Pizza and Field Of Dreams, during the 80's, he first came to light in Courage Under Fire in 1996 after starring in Glory Daze and School Ties alongside his close friend, Ben Affeck. He then played a lawyer with Danny Devito in the Rainmaker but his career really kicked off when he starred and wrote Good Will Hunting with Ben Affeck, and also won an Oscar for Best Writing. Since then, his career has gone from strength to strength and he has the ability to cover any and every genre with ease. The fact that he doesn't take himself to seriously and he treats people with respect, makes him a liked person in Hollywood, and with his return to the Bourne franchise and a movie about the Great Wall of China in the pipeline, proves that he's not one to be type-casted. Its amazing how a free book, from Andy Wear, which eventually went on Amazon for $0.99, became such a blockbusting success. Ridley Scott's amazing attention to detail, made him plant a real potato farm so the audience could see the different stages of growth. He also got detailed information from NASA which was also used in the film, so a lot of the scenes in the film, are not made up. Anyway, I think I would have appreciated the movie more, if I didn't see it so long after its release but with that aside, it's still a well made film which I found quite entertaining.<br/><br/>Budget: $108million Worldwide Gross: $630million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/drama/sci-fi movies starring Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Aksel Hennie. 7/10"

","I seem to be perhaps the only person in the world who didn't fall in love with Andy Weir's novel ""The Martian."" In fact, I didn't make it through. Partially I was undone by the heaps of technical detail about how to make dirt, breathable air, etc. on Mars. I appreciated the research that went into it, but it felt more like reading a technical paper than a compelling story. But I was equally turned off by the book's tone, which is really the same thing as the narrator's tone since the part of the book I read is comprised completely of his journal entries. It had that painful quality writing has when the author thinks he's funnier than he is, and the whole cocky ""bro"" attitude might have been realistic in a character like this (after all, he does have to have the fortitude and the balls to want to eek out an existence on Mars) but doesn't make him any more pleasant to spend time with.<br/><br/>For the film, director Ridley Scott, writer Drew Goddard, and actor Matt Damon unfortunately for me but fortunately for the millions of others who enjoyed this story as it was told retain that tone. There's a jokey frat boy quality to virtually every scene that's like nails on a chalkboard, and the detailed realism of the books early chapters gives way to increasingly improbable set pieces that end with one character or another working in a witty quip while the director practically winks at his audience. I can imagine fans of this movie giving each other chest bumps as the credits roll.<br/><br/>The film looks marvelous, though, I'll give it that. The effects (at least those on Mars itself) are so seamless that you almost forget they're effects.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"
"LoveIsAStateOfMind","7","2","3","27 February 2016"," Decent adaptation
","The people who watch this film can be classed into two categories: those who have read the book first and those who haven't.<br/><br/>I come in the former category and can honestly say that this was a decent adaptation. However, there were three key events that were missed out from the film: where Watney loses communication with NASA after blowing up the comms system with a drill, the dust storm that prevents him recharging his solar panels and when he is approaching his final destination and the Rover runs into some problems with the sand dunes.<br/><br/>I've seen enough book-to-film adaptations to know that films ALWAYS miss out stuff and are never a word-for-word adaptation but my befuddlement this time around is that the aforementioned three events provide copious amounts of drama in the book and I would have thought they would have wanted to include them in the film. Maybe a case of Hollywood thinking if too many things go wrong for Watney the cinema-going public would lose hope / roll their eyes?? <br/><br/>I think if I hadn't read the book first, I may have found the film a bit boring, especially the first half. The book is definitely more thrilling and it's more exciting to be able to use your own imagination in this setting. So overall a good attempt but needless to say Matt Damon has done much more thrilling stuff."

Being humorous doesn't mean comedy. It's a really well done piece of work and I have to tip my hat to the casting department for the line-up. They all worked well.

Instead it doesn't dwell on morbidity, which lifts the film far beyond my original preconceptions.<br/><br/>It runs for 2hr+ but I think they got the timing just about right, whereas they could have turned this into a real yawn and I'm glad they resisted the temptation.<br/><br/>All-in-all, a very good film and worth a watch."
"jimbo-53-186511","7","2","3","22 February 2016"," Self-sufficiency on the red planet
","During a service mission on Mars astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) finds himself separated from his crew after a fierce storm on Mars. Due to the severity of the storm the crew and personnel at NASA presume that Mark is dead. However, Watney does survive the storm (barely) and must now try to survive on Mars until he is rescued against seemingly impossible odds.<br/><br/>Adapted from the novel by Andy Weir The Martian is another 'big' film which uses space as part of its theme and follows in the footsteps of both Gravity and Interstellar (although the Martian is set mostly on Mars as opposed to being set in space itself). I found both Gravity and Interstellar to be impossibly overrated and not particularly engaging story-wise. Therefore I was pleasantly surprised to discover that The Martian is actually a worthy entry in the science fiction genre.<br/><br/>OK so the concept of one man surviving against the odds isn't particularly ground-breaking or original but sometimes putting a slight twist on an unoriginal idea can have the desired effect. The key thing with an unoriginal idea is that you need to make sure that the narrative is engaging and this is where The Martian does work well. We all know that Watney is forced to try to survive on his own, but it's discovering how he achieves this and what desperate measures he has to take in order to survive this seemingly impossible ordeal - as someone who hadn't read the book I had no idea what to expect.<br/><br/>I also liked the fact that a 'tongue-in-cheek' approach was used in order to deliver the material. I remember there being one moment where one of the NASA crew says something along the lines of 'God knows what sort of hell he's enduring up there'? and then we see Watney dancing and enjoying himself in the next scene. It's the sort of thing that you can see coming a mile off, but it's still funny. Watney's generally positive approach to his ordeal prevents the film from being too depressing and actually makes the picture more enjoyable. Watney's behaviour here is also probably more believable than you may think - sometimes remaining positive in the face of adversity is what keeps people going!!! The picture is quite suspenseful and tense but perhaps not in an 'edge of your seat' way but more in a sense that you're left intrigued as to what Watney will do next? How will they rescue him? Etc. It isn't a particularly exciting film, but the story has enough flesh on it to keep it engaging and considering its generous running time it very rarely hits any lulls.<br/><br/>The only thing that perplexed me a little about this film is the music; whilst some of it is understandable and fits quite well with the film (I think Bowie's Life On Mars played at one point), but then later in the film we had Waterloo by Abba which just seemed rather random. This isn't really a criticism, but I just thought that some of it was a bit strange.<br/><br/>Yes you can pick holes here and there in The Martian but at the end of the day it never tries too hard and seems happy telling a relatively interesting 'one man' survival story with fairly linear delivery and for that I am eternally grateful."

","Rented this movie because I heard that it was fun. I enjoyed this flick and I think that Matt Damon was perfectly cast. I found that some of the dramatic scenes were filled with tension and the lighter scenes filled with humor. This movie, to me, had all the things that ""Gravity"" should have contained. The scenes containing the rocketry were brilliantly filmed and added the necessary element that made this a complete movie. I would recommend this to a friend, and if one were to rent this I would suggest the blue ray option because this movie deserved the crisp sharp benefits that blue ray offers. I thought that Mark Damon's performance was one of his best. I don't know how much of the science this picture contains is in fact authentic, but I really did not expect it to be. What it did contain for me was good castings and great cinematography."

Without spoilers I can only tell you this, this is an amazing and huge production that takes place in more than one situation and environment it may seem predictable but its not, they did a great job in keeping the trill going through the whole movie. I can add this too, the actors did an amazing job, they made us all feel the situation, plus there is a big variety of actors and a big number, which make it ever better. Now comes the bad stuff the movie may be a little overflowed by conflicts I'd licked them to focus on one and give it more time, but sometimes this is a good thing, and i think they should have backed it up with some more science.. Other than that I think this is an amazing movie, in fact one of the best, will definitely recommend did, and finally i leave the rest to you, watch it and you'll know..."

Perhaps the only negative point is that it has a credible time-line for a moment another passes a very long period of time without impact on history or characters. In my opinion the soundtrack is not adequate, the songs do not reflect the feeling of the scene they represent.

","I had some nice expectations with this movie. No too much, in fact, because I have been deceived so many times ...<br/><br/>One of those expectations was: This film is very realistic.<br/><br/>And it is partly true: Some parts of the film are very realistic. For example the way he creates the potato farm inside the martian base. On the other side, the protagonist is perhaps too ... I wouldn't say too smart. After all he is a NASA astronaut, and you don't become a NASA astronaut being stupid. The word is ""lucky"". Matt Damon is just too lucky. Even being the best, things can go terribly wrong when you live a couple of years in Mars because of a million things The problem with Hollywood films is that you know from the beginning that there is gonna be a happy ending. That the main character will probably survive (Or perhaps sacrifice to save the group). And that eliminates most of the thrill. <br/><br/>And that leads to the what I really disliked: Never during the film I felt the anguish of being alone in Mars. The faith of the main character is too strong. He is alone on an alien planet, and he never despairs, not even for a moment. That is simply not how human beings behave. It would be OK for an adventure film, but not for one that pretends to be realistic. In that respect I prefer lower budget films like ""Moon""<br/><br/>Not a bad film. Great landscaped, visually impressive, but lacks real drama."

","Sound: 2/2 Harry Gregson-Williams' effervescent, electronic score evokes the protagonist's diligence, wonderment, and loneliness (perhaps more effectively than the script). <br/><br/>Acting/Characterization: 1/2 Matt Damon takes his snarky act to Mars, where he plays a different kind of Mann. The role of Watney suits him, and everyone else is affable and strong under pressure. Their good humor is of the blockbuster variety, but I like the characters' resolute focus and pragmatism. I am glad the film did not resort to cheap histrionics, which would have undermined the credibility of someone likely trained and selected to withstand great mental and physical stress.<br/><br/>Script/Writing: 1/2 The one-liners are standard Hollywood cheese, but the absence of maudlin backstories and unnecessary romance is refreshing. In The Martian, egalitarian enthusiasm for solving problems apparently prevails over international differences and agency hierarchies, and I suppose I have no reason to reject such a happy fantasy even if some of the flippant exchanges between the scientists and directors at NASA are hokey. Also, the script could have been less obvious by implying rather than dictating the theme via Watney's speech at the end. <br/><br/>Visuals: 2/2 It's a Ridley Scott film; of course Mars is gorgeous.<br/><br/>Concept (Plot/Theme): 1.5/2 I haven't read Weir's book, but I love the ""MacGyver on Mars"" idea, though the film's surprisingly positive tone lowers the stakes. The audience is meant to respect Watney's ingenuity, not worry for him, so survival seems less perilous and uncertain than conditions on Mars might suggest. <br/><br/>Total: 7.5/10<br/><br/>Gut Feeling: 7/10 The Martian is a fun adventure that celebrates science, space exploration, and the collective agency of analytical minds at the cost of dramatic tension and a truer portrait of how difficult such endeavors can be.<br/><br/>Final Average: 7.25"

","This film is about a man who is on a space mission and there is some debris going on and around he gets hit and the crew leave him behind thinking he is dead. Matt Damon plays the lead character. He then realises he has to survive four years in space before they can get back to him. He only has a year's supply of food. So as a botanist he has to use his smarts to grow food for three years. This is a really enjoyable and fun film about a man who uses his humour and smarts to get by in space. Back on earth there a real public relations issue with NASA whether they can get there man home. Matt Damon has never been better, this is probably his best performance on screen. He shows a lot of heart and humour considering the situation he is in. Jessica Chastain is also very good as one of the crew members that left him behind. The cinematography in a space is amazing to look at. Ridley Scott has done an amazing job directing this film. This is one of the best movies of Oscar season. I highly recommend it."

","I hadn't seen anything beyond the first trailer and the movie posters for The Martian. Perhaps this has enabled me to review it through a perspective less jaded that some. For what it's worth, it's a good thing.<br/><br/>The plight of marooned astronaut Mark Watney is portrayed as pretty straight-up dire based on the circumstances. First, stuck on Mars, a lifeless neighbor to Earth. Next, presumed dead with no initial hope of rescue. Then, beset with a finite amount of supplies to sustain him, he must resort to taking vacuum-sealed Thanksgiving potatoes and farming them in the human waste from himself and his colleagues. An attempt to launch an unmanned craft to crash-land into Mars and provide Watney with supplies aborts shortly after liftoff; echoes of the loss of Space Shuttle Columbia arose instantly as Sean Bean's character uttered the dreaded command in mission control, ""Lock the doors"", just as his real-life counterpart LeRoy Cain had on that fateful morning of February 1, 2003.<br/><br/>Then things get really difficult.<br/><br/>All in all a fairly tense, yet overall uplifting look at humanity's investment in a fellow human being whom many might at first glance consider beyond hope. Thanks to numerous deficiencies in the institutional culture of NASA, the space program today is nowhere near that imagined by The Martian.<br/><br/>Manned space exploration has been tainted by the grave losses of Challenger in 1996 and Columbia in 2003. Yet this film serves to prove that given drive, determination, collaboration, and discipline, the best humanity has to offer can be brought forth in a united effort to shake a valiant fist at fate and save someone seemingly beyond all hope.<br/><br/>Let's hope that the driving forces behind these fictitious crew, managers, and bureaucrats will inspire their real-world counterparts to propel our fledgling space program to new heights, rather than wallow in the sorrows of the fallen."

","Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead on Mars when a deadly surprise storm comes upon the crew and they are forced to leave without Watney. However, Watney does survive the storm and must find a way to subsist and contact NASA. <br/><br/>For some unknown reason this is billed as a comedy. This is not a comedy. There are some good lines spouted by the characters but they do not a comedy make. See? This is a drama.<br/><br/>This is okay, a little long perhaps, but the rescue mission near the end is loaded with hopeful anticipation and tension. The visuals including the Mars landscape and inside the ships throughout are spectacular. The cinematography and photography are truly fantastic. Since Mark Watney is a Botonist he is able to feed himself by growing potatoes and he finds a way to communicate with NASA to let the world know he is alive. Everything Watney does is recorded by him for posterity. And it's also a way to keep himself occupied without going mad. His dialogues are concise and logical. The pacing is very good. We don't see Whatney having many ""down moments."" There is always hope and work to be done to survive. Matt Damon as Watney does a very good job in this survival mode and we don't get bored watching him Gerry-rig many things and sometimes making humorous comments. Kudos.<br/><br/>Back on Earth there are plans to rescue Watney. They talk of a future Mars mission that will land the ship 3200 Kilometers away from where he currently is. This part didn't make sense to me. Why not have this Mars mission recalculated to land where he is and not so far away? Huh? Why make Watney make a 3200 kilometer trip when something bad can happen on this planet? Remember the storm that caused all this in the first place? And - by the way - we never see a storm like that again after all the time Watney spends on the planet. Was that one storm an anomaly? A one-time thing? Huh? (it's only a movie, Bob)<br/><br/>Also, the Chinese say they will help with supplies using their new secret super rocket to give the supplies to the Hermes, the rescue ship. However, we never see this exchange between the Chinese ship and the Hermes. The cutting room floor did thisor maybe it was a given and we didn't need to see it. (ya think?)<br/><br/>Dialogues back on Earth debating how to do the rescue are good, real and made sense. <br/><br/>Notables: Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kate Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Jeff Daniels and they all did credible jobs. <br/><br/>Yes, this is somewhat long, but It's the fantastic visuals, Watney's survival work and dialogues and the rescue mission near the end will keep you engaged. (7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: No. (well, the storm). Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, a male backside briefly. Language: Yes, not spoken but written on computer screens and not much of it."

I love how the NASA tried solutions to save Mark and how Mark tried to solve complex problems just trying to stay alive before rescue arrives. <br/><br/>The surprising part is the CNSA's appearance who is actually willing to help NASA to save Mark. Who would have thought of that? Well it just made me feel that the two opposing nations can really work for a common good. I know in reality might be opposite but I'm sure behind the scenes there might cooperation between two agencies. <br/><br/>The Hermes crew went back using slingshot back and forth between Earth and Mars. Crazy as it sounds but that's how they work it out, though there was complication on picking up mark on orbit but they have successfully rescued him.<br/><br/>Well, the worst part is that is the ending. After hrs of watching the ending felt more unsatisfying and inconclusive. Once Mark hop inside the Hermes it then poof the scene instantly back to earth where Mark is already sitting on a bench in a park. It's like what? why rush the scene back to earth. Didn't even see the Hermes traveled back to earth, nor their arrival landing or even welcome party and other sort of scenes to commemorate the mission success. Well, as much as I wanna see that part there's none.

"krisrox","8","2","3","5 January 2016"," The Martian: a Spielbergian take on space
","Greetings from the galaxy, where we get yet another semi-realistic, big-budget space exploration movie from an A-list director - following the very good and very successful Interstellar (2014) and Gravity (2013). So - how does The Martian fit in? There is a bit of overlap, but overall, Ridley Scott has succeeded in adding a completely different perspective.<br/><br/>Where Gravity and Interstellar felt like big leaps forward in movie-making, The Martian does not. It is the least ambitious of the three, lacking a deep philosophical undercurrent or breakthrough visual effects that made the other two so compelling. This is not necessarily a bad thing, however. The Martian features - by far - the most well-developed cast, acting performances and characters, and comes with an unexpected, almost Spielbergian sense of pace and storytelling. The movie and its leads are upbeat, resourceful and have a lightness that prevails in the most trying of times. It is, far more than the others, a people movie, and a popcorn movie at that. It's up to you if you like that, and can stretch your suspension of disbelief accordingly.<br/><br/>Without giving away any plot details - let's say that, in the end, like its two blockbuster predecessors, The Martian is about survival in the face of overwhelming odds. But while Interstellar focuses on the abyss faced by an entire race, and Gravity on the depths faced by one person, The Martian shows us the joy of survival through old-fashioned team spirit. In that sense, it is a very American movie."

Well... where to begin...<br/><br/>The first minutes of the movie I've spent laughing out loud like a maniac. Because I saw some of the stupidest scenes from Prometheus, gobbled with nonstop science mumbo-jumbo and abbreviations and...<br/><br/>Ten minutes in, it's established that... something stupid happened and that the Martian is alive, because... something stupid happened.<br/><br/>Scott probably liked the effect... and the stupidity of what he did in Prometheus, so he had to insert the science and the bloody scene, just to build up suspense. Pro tip, kids: if you get a suit decompression - stick yourself with something sharp, and mix the blood with the sand and voila, you are good to go Gravity style with critical oxygen for as much time as you need.<br/><br/>That's followed by the heroic re-imagination of the Moon, where instead of something interesting... we see the convenient Botanist grow stuff up. Well, when you make it in space and on Mars - I guess it has to be interesting, right?<br/><br/>The plot thickens(c), when our convenient Botanist finds a convenient probe just next to the hab and builds up a pretty convenient chat communication with Houston. It looks like the sole purpose of this communication is to establish that something bad will happen, because the moment it's announced - it happens.<br/><br/>By then the movie straight parodies the tension of Apollo 13, unsuccessfully, to the point of mandatorily blowing up the USA supply probe, just so that we could get the Chinese some credit. I wonder, first Transformers 4, then maybe something I did not watch, now Martian... USA is really trying to get China, what's the tinfoil plot?<br/><br/>That's when some uncredited genius thinks of a solution that somehow nobody working there for a living has thought of and it builds the mutiny and patriotism of Apollo 13.<br/><br/>Then we see some solid BS that gives even Gravity the run for its money, and that's saying something... all because Scott is desperate for an intense resolution.<br/><br/>In the end, we understand that... we have to watch Pirates(any), Iron Man and Lord of the Rings. And that the whole world apparently cares for the one guy who is simply MIA. Enough to risk the lives of other astronauts, millions of dollars... screw it, billions of dollars and the future of NASA - just to get this one guy back.

Although... Jessica Chastain, I worship at the altar of your chin. As for Matt Damon, I did not like him when he was hunting for everybody else's good will and over the years he has failed to capture, kill, necro-hump and mount mine. <br/><br/>It has a so-so script. Mostly because it is always either the minutes of a science convention or Damon talking to himself about potatoes and disco music or a feel good Kumbaya bullshit circus of global teamwork and the implied promise of s'mores. It has a staggeringly tepid pacing, that ruins the otherwise swash-buckling vehemence of its plot. However, its pace is something I predict many will enjoy. The structure of solving one problem after another and then another, and then credits has its strengths... if we are talking about a 1980's arcade game. And why the weird, blooper end credits? <br/><br/>Not withstanding it spends its budget well, and it is better than Gravity. It is entertaining. It is innovative in a 1900 World's Fair kind of way, and there is a hidden masterpiece here. But unfortunately, it's hidden awfully deep. This could have been a fantastic 3 hour epic, but instead it rushes past the foreplay and jabs at you in the dark. In the end it's like... yay... science! And I'm like... okay."

","Yet another movie that has recently become eerily prophetic anticipating life under lockdown is this long but effective remake of 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars' (1964), with Matt Damon forced to endure seventies disco music in confinement the way Roger Livesey had endured nineteenth century French comic opera in 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp'.<br/><br/>It faithfully follows both the look and mood of the original, but with the addition of scenes back on Earth creating a ticking clock to generate suspense of the sort only too familiar to anyone who's ever had to instal a feature on their laptop or iPad while being directed by phone."
"pezpolo","10","1","1","27 April 2020"," The Martian is a must watch
","The Martian (2015) directed by Ridley Scott, is an adaptation of the novel by Andy Weir. The film stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney; Matt Damon's portrayal of the character was excellent as he clearly depicted the mental struggle of being left on a planet alone. You could see how Watney felt, the hope when things went right and the pain when everything was stacked against him, this added to the film by making the character multidimensional and truly adding a human aspect to space. The film also looks at many aspects of space travel, including the political and corporate side of space travel by showing how the commissions and the people at NASA dealt with finding out Watney was alive and how to move forward. This made the film even better as it allowed multiple aspects of the story to be examined and flushed out. The movie was very strong in how it showed the story from all angles, you could see Watney and his struggle, the crews processing the fact that Watney was alive and how NASA and the world dealt with the news of Watney. The film also excelled in its use of humor, the humor provided great contrast to the harsh reality of the film and really helped the film. There were also beautiful cinematic shots of mars that added to the film and provided great imagery as there was stark emptiness to mirror how alone Watney was, but also add a bit of irony as the beautiful place is very treacherous. The use of different camera shots added to the film, from the long cinematic views of mars, then the helmet cams, and the video ""diary"", all of these different techniques made the film come to life. All in all, the Martian features great acting, stunning cinematic work along with an excellent plot and is a must watch."

","I watch this movie often for it's problem solving plot line. However, a few things are missing, like character development. We only see bits of the crew's reaction to Watney's death, and not even a glimpse of Watney's mom and dad, the could have at least been watching on TV with the rest of America, so the movie comes off a little staid. The inner ship Hermes views are really fun to see.<br/><br/>Even in the problem solving, though I find issues. The major one is about the loss of the potato crop. Watney started out with whole potatoes and human waste as fertilizer. The crops and fertilizer were destroyed, but Watney still had potatoes, and tuh, he still had fertilizer in the supply from one human per day (at the least). Therefore he still had the means to build up a potato plant, even one per day until he had a new crop. Do the math, people. 1 potato + one human fertilizer per day x 365 days equals a lot of potatoes! But that wouldn't help a plot line. LOL."

"rooprect","Null","1","1","21 September 2019"," If you don't care about sounds in space, then you might really enjoy this.
","My title sounds sarcastic, but I really mean it. If it doesn't bother you when films depict bangs, crashes, rumbles, booms, and pew-pew ""laser"" beams (add Austin Powers finger quotes) in the vacuum space, then load up your popcorn and get set for a wild ride. If, on the other hand, the aforementioned cinematic gimmicks bother you, then you still might enjoy this film but just be prepared for that and more.<br/><br/>Although The Martian gives us just an occasional low, tasteful rumble when spaceships fly by, that's the least of its scientific transgressions, and things get pretty ""Mars Attacks"" preposterous in the final 20 minutes. Normally I wouldn't even bring this up since basically EVERY space movie in the history of EVER, except for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1969), has sound effects in space. But the problem is that ""The Martian"" takes a very committed, scientific, realistic tone which sets us up for an extremely scientific, realistic story. It falls short on that mark, and rather than bore you and pretentiously inflate my own ego by pointing out every flaw, I'll let you read the other reviews, or better yet: just accept that there are scientific loopholes so big that you can drive a Quasar through it (and I'm not talking about the car made in 1967).<br/><br/>Ok if I haven't lost you, then let's talk about the fun stuff. The special effects are FANTASTIC. Director Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"") outshines himself once again with a truly magnificent feast for the eyes, and especially if you watch it on a large UHD screen, that alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The story itself is riveting. It's a tale of survival on a barren planet where Matt Damon fights a constant battle NOT against little green men or pew-pew ""laser"" beams but against the cold and sterile reality of space. That was my favorite part of the movie, the fact that it can carry our interest for 2 1/2 hours with the only real conflict being how to survive on a planet where nothing works.<br/><br/>Matt Damon does an incredible job of acting, portraying a complex character who realizes he's a dead man but rises to the challenge and pits every brain cell he's got against the universe. Similar to the excellent ""Cast Away"" or even the iconic ""Papillon"", it's a story about never giving up even if it kills you, and that regardless of whether we get a happy ending or a sad one, is the takeaway of this flick.<br/><br/>I would group this film with other modern, minimalistic sci-fi flicks that take a realistic (""boring"" to some) approach but deliver a lot of drama. Flicks like ""Moon"", ""Solaris"", or on the older shelf ""Contact"", ""2010"" and possibly even the grandfather of them all, ""2001"" (though don't get your hopes up too high as I mentioned up front) will give you a taste for what's in store if you decide to watch ""The Martian""."
"betsybirsh","Null","1","1","4 September 2019"," This is science fiction for sophisticated audiences
","I love scifi and I love sci-fi movies, and I love scifi movies made by Sir Ridley Scott so suffice to say I liked the Martian a lot. This is a Matt Damon show and the actor is pretty much in the frame all through the running time as an astronaut stranded on the red planet. This is neither an action-oriented motion picture nor a special effects extravaganza. It's an introspective story about what it might be like to be the sole inhabitant of a distant world and knowing that instant communication isn't possible, and a rescue is at best a year away. It's also an examination of how necessity truly can be the mother of invention - not only for the survivor but for those on Earth seeking to find a way to save him. Those who crave nonstop action and seizure-promoting editing may find this film's pace too deliberate. They may be unable to appreciate its character focus and slow but undeniable build-up of tension."

","The Martian starts off setting high expectations when group of astronauts from NASA go on a Mars mission and while they're on the surface of the planet the atmosphere goes out of control, strong winds start blowing and a useless piece of debris hits our male lead Damon right in the ribs and he is pushed back by several meters. The rest of the crew assumes him to be dead and return to Earth only to find out after some days that he is still alive. Not only this but he has also managed to grow potatoes on the surface of Mars, (I couldn't imagine doing so if I were a BOTANIST you know) I mean there's an example of going out of your comfort zone (Earth). That aside, the middle scenes are pretty dull and you will find yourself forward-ing very often. There is a parallel mission going on Earth too to keep Damon fed till the next Mars mission is up and running and not to emphasize that a different politics is in progress there also and an astronaut's life on Mars basically depends it. 
The performances are average, any actor that manages to make any impact would be Jessica Chastain in the role of Martinez. Although the film picks up a little bit towards the end when Damon improvises with his profound knowledge a way to get himself out of a speedy rocket but it isn't too late to realize that you've wasted your precious time watching an economical version of Gravity."

This longer version reveals what the cast here truly wanted to do, and did. They take a crisis and make it into a comedy film. Worse yet, they then cut the film to make it look more serious than it was filmed at.<br/><br/>Cut is an ending that comedically compares with Slim Pickens riding his bomb down in Dr. Strangelove. The trouble here is that this film is nowhere near as good as it is rated. Maybe Matt Damon and Kristen Wigg have a lot of fans out there, but serious Sci-Fi fans have a whole lot of issues with this one.<br/><br/>Thw science is just not right.

","Warning...food supplies/survival assessment. It's essential to his survival, but when assessing his potato crop, there is no way he could have reaped 400 potato on the first harvest. Also, when they showed shots of his potato crop, there are way too many plants based on what he started with. The bag looked like it had 12...2 potatoes each for a crew of 6, or 12, and 48 plants. If successfully grown, 4 large potatoes from each plant, and smaller ones to replant would give him 194 from first harvest...OR, <br/><br/>Take the Thanksgiving meal...at best, 3 potatoes each times six people would give 18 potatoes. He was quartering them...that would give him about 72 max. The next crop would be bigger, as he used several small potatoes from each plant, so ideally, 72 x 4, or 288 plants. It took roughly 35 'Sol's' to grow and then harvest, so it would still take awhile for him to produce 400 potatoes to eat. He'd need to have 3 or more successful harvests to get enough to last the 3 years needed before the Ares IV mission. Important for the movie, but a bit impossible in real life. Also, potatoes need at least 2 feet of dirt to grow, and he only had a foot or so...it would matter if that last crop was still edible after the surface plants died...since they were underground, they might have survived, which would have given him about 6-8 from each plant, small and large. He should have tried to grown more...somehow, even if it was a smaller operation...and holding a breathable atmosphere in the HAB behind tarps is another question."
"Floated2","9","1","1","3 July 2016"," Great combination of Sci-fi and Entertainment
","The Martian starring Matt Damon. He plays Mark Watney. He's a botanist-astronaut on the crew of what appears to be a workaday mission to Mars, one of many on the NASA schedule. Beginning into the film, where we notice when a massive dust storm descends on their operations base and living quarters. In the chaos, a piece of satellite equipment breaks loose, hits Watney and flies off with him attached. Assuming he's dead, the rest of the crew takes off. Though of course he's not dead. But he knows he will be, and soon, unless he figures out how to survive using only the stuff the crew left behind. His mission now is to solve a series of problems.<br/><br/>What make the film great is how director Ridley Scott makes use of Damon's character. We see him how he records his efforts on video, which he assumes will be found after his death by the next crew to land on Mars. It's a useful and mostly credible narrative device that allows us to follow Watney's thoughts without the deadly intrusions of voice-over. The film is roughly over two hours and twenty minute long, but it is an exciting ride and the pacing is great. Matt Damon certainly delivers one of his finest performances, which gave him an Oscar nomination. The Martian will most definitely be considered a classic and future classic."

","As improbable as the story is, it had a certain resonance to my mind about the capacity of the human spirit to persevere and make the best of one's circumstances under the most intolerable of conditions. Faced with the same situation, how many would simply give up and let fate take it's course? The harder thing to do is stretch one's mind and resources in an effort to stay alive and operate from a position of informed intelligence until help arrives. When Mark Watney (Matt Damon) proclaims ""I'm not gonna die here"", not only do you believe it but you wish there was something you could do to help.<br/><br/>That's not to say I didn't find some elements to be just too unbelievable. The real time communication with the rescue team, and especially the sharing of Watney's comments with the rest of the world defied any sort of credibility. China helping pro-actively - I don't think so, at least not in an official capacity. The cracking wise dialog of the crew members was also a little too forced it seemed. You would think there would be some consternation over the plight of the stranded team member.<br/><br/>But for a sci-fi film offering a once in a lifetime what if scenario, the picture works well enough to be an entertaining diversion.

"CinematicInceptions","7","1","1","23 April 2016"," What science is capable of.
","This felt sort of like it was based on a real event at some points, maybe because there are some stories you hear of in the news that are similar to it. A lot of people have compared the Martian to Castaway, and I was anticipating that it would resemble Castaway, but it really is closer to the Chilean miners that were trapped underground for two months back in 2010. It has some resemblances to certain sports films as well because the hopes of a vast number of people are resting on the success of the mission just as they are in the events of Invictus and Miracle. Saving Watney has significance to other people because it proves to them what an individual and a society can accomplish.<br/><br/>Science and technology are a pretty big part of the story. None of the science felt implausible to me, but of course I don't know that much about it. Considering the budget, I would guess that Ridley Scott was able to hire someone to check all the science, though Andy Weir may not have had that luxury with the book. If nothing else, the science and astrophysics were well explained. You understood why and how each setback was significant without needing a degree in physics. I would say that there is not an invincible character factor in play here, as Watney has several close calls along with things that go his way, but not in an unrealistic way like in 2012 or Furious 7. In some ways, it seems like a miracle that he survives everything, but he doesn't escape without a few bumps and bruises and life-threatening experiences.<br/><br/>There are a lot of characters, and most of them are easy enough to keep track of. You won't probably remember almost any of their names, but the actors are famous enough and the characters are distinct enough that you will remember most of them. I wasn't huge on how some of them were introduced with the superscript name and profession. The name wasn't gonna stick and neither it nor the profession or area of expertise were all that necessary for the audience to know. Also, using superscript is a bit of a cheap way out for introducing a character that I feel like a full-time screenwriter should be able to find alternatives to. There is not a true villain, unless you count the whole situation as the antagonist. So if you had to categorize the conflict, it would probably be man vs. nature and a bit of man vs. technology if you count all of the technological details that NASA had to work through.<br/><br/>The plot mostly consists of all of the different challenges that have to be overcome, which keeps the pace constantly moving with all of the mini-goals. It lacks some of the traditional story structures like end of act turns, which is refreshing in some ways and disappointing in others. Certainly, the classic ultimate goal and plot twists that are so overused that they become predictable become old and annoying, but a movie can still be non-traditional and interesting while using those templates. As Watney says at the end, you have to solve it one problem at a time, which is how the story works. But by the end, I didn't want another scientific miracle, and having him ""fly around like Iron Man"" was just a little too much. It didn't kill the movie per se, but I would have preferred that scene to have played out differently.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, with no one performance standing out over the others. The set designs were cool and impressive, definitely Oscar nom worthy. I didn't feel that it deserved to win any of the categories it was nominated for, but the nominations were in order. Granted, I haven't seen Fury Road, which won several of the technical awards, but it seemed to be more deserving than the Martian based on the trailers.<br/><br/>If you're intimidated by scientific movies, I wouldn't worry too much. Basic high school or maybe even middle school scientific knowledge is all that's needed to comprehend the problems and solutions of each challenge. There is a decent amount of comic relief, some of which could be annoying to those of you that dislike comedy placed in other genres. I would recommend watching it in one sitting, and probably with a group so that you can clarify any questions you may have with each other. In my own opinion, it's a little overrated even if it is pretty entertaining. I preferred Interstellar, which I know has been a popular comparison, but the Martian is for a totally different audience than Interstellar is. If you didn't like Interstellar for reasons other than it's being too much like 2001, definitely try the Martian. Otherwise, I wouldn't be afraid to spend money on renting it if you're interested. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."

","I honestly was quite skeptical before watching this film and i almost missed my opportunity to watch it on the big screen. Anyway i did watch it and the purity of spirit and determination that Matt Damon brought out is something to be admired not only as a work of fiction but also in our personal journey in life. A million miles away, stuck on a foreign planet alone, but he still somehow manages to muster up the strength and will to think his way out of an almost definite damned situation. This was a spectacular performance from him. deserving of awards and praise. absolutely loved it. I think it was an excellent production from the dialogue to the action sequences on the outer atmosphere of mars."
"jb_campo","8","1","1","10 April 2016"," Solid Landing by The Martian
","I had my doubts that a more or less single-actor film would be successful, but The Martian proved me wrong. Matt Damon was terrific in a Hollywood-esque storyline. He plays a botanist who is on the Ares mission to Mars. I guess this was the third mission. Mars is apparently prone to major storms, and one strikes the team, forcing an emergency evacuation. In the midst of the evacuation, Damon gets lost and seemingly is dead. The crew takes off.<br/><br/>The rest is a story of survival against the basic human needs, like food, water, and air. But also a battle to touch the planet he left behind. There was actually a lot of comedy in this film. Damon jokes at being the first for so many different activities there. Well shoot, he's the only living being on the planet.<br/><br/>The scenery / graphics were excellent. The co-actors deliver their roles - space jockey pilot, stoic commander, a-hole mission commander back on Earth. They all fit into a nicely scripted screenplay.<br/><br/>There are some twists and turns as you would expect, and a Hollywood ending that leaves you cheering, despite the improbability. But this is the movies - you want entertainment - the Martian delivers.<br/><br/>Nice job by everyone. Enjoy."
"atlasmb","8","1","1","10 April 2016"," Stranded On Mars
","When a dangerous windstorm threatens, the crew of the Ares 3 mission must quickly abort and leave the surface of Mars. They mistakenly leave behind Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who decides to find a way to survive in the harsh environment with inadequate supplies. Watney is a botanist who uses his problem solving and resource management talents to their best advantage.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, people back on Earth are celebrating Watney's sacrifice with a large memorial and plenty of hoopla. <br/><br/>Matt Damon gets most of the screen time of ""The Martian"". As in other castaway stories, his experience is the focus of the film. Viewers can identify with his everyman qualities and project themselves into his situation, making the film a one-man adventure. As someone who prefers first-person video games, I found this to be very relatable and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Though there are a few (notable) errors of science, this is good science fiction. It also includes enough humor to keep the mood somewhat light.<br/><br/>One running gag is that Watney dislikes disco music, but it's the only music available to him on Mars (after he rifles through the belongings of his fellow crew members). As a viewer, I began to share his opinion by the end of the film, but only because the recordings were all of the pop-disco style (e.g. Gloria Gaynor, Miami Sound Machine), which rely more on their lyrics than the pounding, driving beat that is the hallmark of truly inspiring swing dance disco. It's a distinction few viewers will key on. <br/><br/>Instead, focus on the enchanting story and you will survive."
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","1","1","25 March 2016"," One man can survive on spuds
","It is not a masterpiece but it is a good film though. One man abandoned on Mars because he was wounded in a storm and he was thought dead. Then the film is the discovery on Earth and on the spatial mission where the team that left him behind is that he is alive and then the decision to rescue him, on one hand. On the other hand that man, alone on Mars, takes care of his wound and then is playing Robinson Crusoe on the planet, inventing agriculture on Mars and solving all kinds of problems including communication with earth and with his team on their mission.<br/><br/>Of course such an adventure is highly improbable but the educational dimension is important. It wants to show that when death is in front of you, you can just accept it and find your peace with that, or you start working on and solving problems, one after the other, in order to survive as long as possible because there is always a chance that a rescue of some sort might come, or that you would be intelligent enough to survive by yourself with your own creativity and inventiveness. <br/><br/>It is also educational about the absurdity of different countries, here the USA and China, not working together and sure enough the film heavily suggests that they do and they actually do, which could have saved the marooned man and will have positive consequences on the future. Educational again with the position of women. The commander of the mission is a woman and she is not alone on the mission. At NASA it is less clear since all the main characters are men, particularly the director of NASA who appears as a cold, calculating man who does not accept any disobedience. <br/><br/>It is also educational with the team that has left one man on Mars. We are clearly told that no matter what the consequences may be one person as well as one team have to do what is ethically good, here rescue the man, and not obey orders going the other way. Mutiny is necessary when ethics are on your side. And sure enough they are shown as going on the next mission because the rescue is such an international global effort and success that no one can go into reprisals and penalties.<br/><br/>The Martian landscapes are beautiful though they are not Martian at all. The actors, at least the main actors, or even maybe the main actor in the singular, are good and the heroics are spectacular. Apart from that all the details are far-fetched but one does not check a gift horse in the mouth. We let ourselves go into the action, the suspense (there is none since we know this poor Robinson Crusoe will be rescued just like Robinson Crusoe was because Robinson Crusoe's always are, and that is pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"p-jonsson","7","1","1","4 March 2016"," If you do not think too much while watching it was fairly entertaining.
","This is a movie that I have to say that I have a bit of a difficulty in rating. Quite honestly I was sorely tempted to remove a star, or even two stars. Why? Because it is full of Hollywood nonsense, scientific errors, it is rather predictable and it did feel a bit like a Apollo 13 rip-off. Why did I not remove those stars? Well, it is rather entertaining even if, at times, I squirmed in my seat.<br/><br/>The movie starts of with a somewhat implausible event where a unexpected storm hits the Mars camp which forces the ground crew of the Mars mission to hurry back to the launch vehicle before it tilts over. The launch vehicle gradually tilts a degree at the time. Is it just me finding this strange? Would storms on Mars defy the usual rules of weather dynamics that they would exert a constant pressure which would cause a slow but constant tilt of a construct like that. No gusts, no change in pressure? And why would it gradually tilt at all? Once the force would be enough for the landing struts on one side to leave the ground it would pretty much tilt right away. Okay, I am being picky so lets give that a benefit of a doubt for the time being.<br/><br/>Obviously one guy is lost during the dramatic events. This is equally obviously 100% predictable. The fact that the guy is still alive after the rest of the crew blasted off is obviously also 100% predictable but then, this you should have pretty figured out from the title of the move after all.<br/><br/>A lot of the rest of the movie is following this guys quest for survival on Mars using the left over equipment at his disposal and the NASA crew on Earth trying to rescue him. Yes the NASA crew on Earth does discover that he is alive which, again, is pretty much predictable. Of course this gave Hollywood the opportunity to add a utterly dislikable political bureaucrat that is pretty much in the movie for one reason and one reason aloneto be dislikable. Personally I just found him tiresome. But then, Americans seems to like these kind of people given the kind of trash that we see being pushed towards the upcoming presidential electionsfrom both sides! There are a lot of good stuff in the movie. Even though it is rather predictable there are some suspense in it, there are a lot of good scenery, and even though you pretty much knows what is going to happen you do feel like cheering for the hero. Given the script I think a lot of the actors did a rather good job of their roles.<br/><br/>If the script writers would have brought on some decent scientific advisors I would say this would have been a great movie but it was frequently goofed up with issues that was just stupid. Like digging down a nuclear reactor a few feet in the ground. What the f good was that supposed to do? And the constant use of simple plastic and duct tape to seal the environment. Yeah, right. Sure, Mars do have some atmosphere so it is not vacuum we are talking about but then in other scenes they seemed to assume almost zero atmosphere and made quite a bit use of explosive decompression effects.<br/><br/>Okay, okay I am probably nitpicking quite a bit here but, unlike many Science Fiction movies, this one tries to give an impression of being within the realms of realism and it is just too full of classical Hollywood mishaps for my taste.<br/><br/>As I wrote above I still think it is a movie worth watching. It has some suspense, it is well done from a photographic point of view and the actors are doing a decent job. I think 7 out of 10 stars is a fair rating but it should certainly not have more."
"camordini","6","1","1","27 February 2016"," Enjoyed the scenery, but didn't meet any new friends
","We enjoyed this trip to Mars and hanging out with some folks in the space station, but we really didn't get to know anyone well enough to say it was a great time, or to want to go back and watch it again. This is the primary problem with the Maritan- it is 95% plot with just a nod to character development. We all know that most story lines are recycled, and the Maritan is your classic stranded on a desert island scenario. What makes each story different is who is in this situation and how they respond. Unfortunately the Martian just doesn't reveal the background, thoughts, motivations or emotions of the characters. The sparse dialogue is utterly expected- the least you could say to move the plot along. And for a movie that depends so much on plot, the final solution to the big problem has been done before, even recently. I won't say where- no spoilers from me, but really, was not surprised by it.<br/><br/>There were touches that I enjoyed. The theme of the rule breaking maverick saving the day, or causing the trouble was avoided. Scientists of all sorts were portrayed in their most interesting and exciting light. And I liked that the movie reminded us that space is still worth exploring, lets get our act together and keep being the pioneers that humans are born to be.<br/><br/>I probably would have give this a 7 instead of 6, except as an Oscar nominee, I am holding it to a slightly higher standard. By all means, watch the movie, enjoy the movie, but there are a lot of elements missing for a truly great movie."
"Spondonman","7","1","1","20 February 2016"," Stayin' Alive
","As soon as I saw Jeff Daniels I realised this picture was going to be Dumb And Dumber than I was initially hoping; most of us live in hope. But at least he makes sense paired with Sean Bean. Serious scientist Matt Damon in a life and death situation relishing using naughty adult words doesn't help. I hadn't seen Robinson Crusoe On Mars for decades either and to see him brought up to digital date was the next best thing – although continually and sometimes hopelessly incongruous 70's disco music kept taking me back to the ye olden primitive days when NASA actually had some of their employees cavorting about on the Moon.<br/><br/>Damon is left for dead on Mars after a big storm and disaster and has to survive and fend for himself until death or rescue. It's all extremely well done, with the usual seemingly minute attention to detail looked after, and is sufficiently gripping and entertaining. All of us millions of news-hungry space fans cheer Bravo! from Times Square, Red Square and Trafalgar Square for CNN to cover this opinion as Breaking News. And great that the making of the film gave 15,000 people jobs and purpose (the end credits seemed to be much more populous), and I only wish there could be many sequels to keep them all employed. But now to delete it.<br/><br/>Unlike Damon I'm not going to have to science the poo out of this but – I would rather recommend the equally corny, escapist and similar film but with more honest human characterisation and emotion Mission To Mars instead. And Jeff Daniels wasn't in it either."

","This film is tough to review. Having read the book and listened to the audio book, both of which were excellent, I cannot write an unbiased review of the movie. Simply put, if you read the book, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>I am sure adapting a novel to a movie is hard. The audio book was 10 hours, so they had to cut out 8 hours of content. The movie script kept a lot of the major story points, but cut everything that made the book so great. Almost all of Watney's trials and tribulations were cut out of the movie. All his great log entries, dialog, thoughts, especially the science! Almost none of it is there. The only pieces left of his witticism is shown in the trailer. There were some shreds of subplots in the movie, which stick out if you read the book, but none of it made the final movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, knowing how much better the book was, I cant give this movie more that 6 stars out of 10. It did not live up to expectations."
"gregsrants","9","35","130","20 September 2015"," Sir Ridley at his best
","Ridley Scott knows science fiction. The director of iconic and cult crowned sci-fi flicks Blade Runner and Alien, Scott is no slouch when it comes to futuristic or outerspaceish type scenarios played out through his keen direction.<br/><br/>Scott last dipped his toe into the sci-fi waters in 2012 with the love it or hate it Alien prequel, Prometheus. The film was met with varying degrees of acceptance and disapproval but no one could deny the film was visually spectacular. In 2015, Scott brings Andy Weir's novel of the same name to audiences in the inspiring, The Martian due to hit theatres early October.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays NASA botanist Mark Watney. Watney along with a small group of other scientists are stationed on Mars when a storm prompts their evacuation. Through a series of events, his colleagues believe Watney dead as they execute their evacuation. But Watney is very much alive. Alive and alone on Mars. With little resources and materials, Watney sciences the poop out of his working assets in an effort to survive. He manages to relay a message back to earth but he is very much aware of the realization that any rescue effort or further mission to Mars is years away from actualization. Watney must live on his wits and faith in hopes that he may one day be reunited with species.<br/><br/>The focus is clearly on Damon's character but maybe more interesting are the team of humans back on earth lead by Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels that attempt to science the poop out of things themselves in an attempt to orchestrate a spectacular rescue. Their pooling of minds will draw reference to NASA's brain trusts in Ron Howard's Apollo 13 and is riveting the exciting to watch unfold though the emotion of the colleagues.<br/><br/>We'll leave the final chapters of the film to your viewing pleasure but make no mistake about it, The Martain is Ridley Scott's best film in years. Damon excels in the lonely character left abandoned. He carries the film with remarkable poise and the intelligence of the script by Drew Goddard (Cabin in the Woods, World War Z) is a marvel as to what man has and can accomplish when faced an unfathomable situation.<br/><br/>The 3D imagery is spectacular and the special effects are sometimes toned and other times on the scale of a blockbuster big-budget extravaganza. But the film is rooted in the triumph of the human spirit. It's hard not to cheer or cry when we see a balls-out effort to what it takes, to use what it takes, to work tirelessly in what it takes to save one human life.<br/><br/>The Martian is destined to be box office hit. Smart, funny, tense and drawing on emotion, it is easily one of the best films of the year and it is the type of film that might just have children once again naming 'astronaut' as the profession that they most aspire to. Yes, it's that good.<br/><br/>http://theintestinalfortitude.com/"
"codex-92736","10","6","15","17 October 2015"," Sci-fi at its best
","""It has been seven days since I ran out of Ketchup.""<br/><br/>SPOILER FREE ZONE<br/><br/>The Martian is a book adapted sci-fi adventure about a man being stranded on Mars (the planet not the chocolate) and him trying to survive until NASA can figure out a way to bring him home. It stars Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Jeff Daniels, and is directed by Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of Ridley Scott for a while as have a lot of people who love the sci-fi genre, but his movie list lately isn't impressive mainly due to the lack of emphasis on character. He's always been able to shoot beautifully as he does in The Martian, but maybe due to the material and the screen writer the characters shown on screen stood out. They were all believable in a situation that could possibly happen a few years from now and none of them were one dimensional. Matt Damon is the stand out for me. Not many actors can hold a movie all on their own, and sure Damon had others with him, but without him the movie would never have worked. He entertained and drove the story forward. I'm not one who watches out for the Oscars, but he is pretty much a shoo-in for a nomination.<br/><br/>There was a lot of hype around The Martian due to the book having only come out a few years ago (a book I am a few chapters into currently). The premise behind it was simple; Man stranded waiting for rescue (Wilson!!). But the way all the problems were shown and solved by the main character as well as NASA, are very original. The attention to detail and the thought process as you follow the lone man follow logical sense; something that can't be said for a lot of films. It's fantastically made and written. The Martian will probably go down as one of my favourite movies and easily my best of the year.<br/><br/>GO WATCH THE MARTIAN!!<br/><br/>SCORE: 9.5/10<br/><br/>SPOILERS GALORE<br/><br/>The first time I went to watch The Martian the fire alarm went off midway through so I went back the next day and happily watched it all from the start. What this movie did so well is find the balance between being nerdy science and entertaining. This could have easily been a drama and have straight faces and tears throughout. But it was far from that. Sure it had its more serious moments but they worked well with Mark's hilarious video logs on Mars. He has some of the funniest lines, some I use pretty often now; 'I've got to science the s*** out of this.' From a movie making stand point there isn't many holes you can poke, but scientifically there's a couple. None of these take anything away from the movie what so ever.<br/><br/>I'm going to get a little nerdy in this paragraph so stick with me. I loved the way The Martian started. No need to take 30 minutes to set the scene *cough* Interstellar *cough*. But Mars's atmosphere is very thin as was pointed out towards the end of the movie with the lack of aerodynamics in the escape pod Damon flies to space in. So how was there a huge storm that could blow over the shuttle on Mars? Also, Damon should probably have died a few times but its a movie so its fine. But what took me out of it, was the end sequence of him poking a hole in his suit to thrust him towards the ship. There is no way he controls the release with such ease. This is all just me nit picking the science of a Hollywood movie. Out of all the things, I think the biggest surprise came from Sean Bean actually surviving until the end!<br/><br/>The Martian is ultimately a celebration of problem solving. A lot of movies brush over aspects thinking the audience will be bored by the science and skip to the action. It's what this movie did so well. It explained everything perfectly without making us go, ""That's just stupid."" The Martian has a 140 minute run time but at no moment did I feel it dragging. Its a must watch for all movie fans out there.<br/><br/>Also I think Matt Damon is our most decorated fake astronaut. And um NASA, if you ever read this, please hire me as one of your engineers :)<br/><br/>SCORE: 9.5/10<br/><br/>How many times are we going to save Matt Damon?"

He simply got on with the job, let his knowledge and skills take over, and deals with ever calamity with a smile and humour.<br/><br/>The most awesome scene of the film was yet was its ending scene, the scene where up in the space the crew and Mark meet. A real heart-in- mouth moment and it literally made me say ""Wow!"" sitting in the cinema hall. Also, it was a full house on a Sunday afternoon, something which made the experience somehow even better. It was a rare occasion for me as I usually go in the weekdays when more than two-thirds of the seats are empty.<br/><br/>So all in all, a wonderful film from every possible aspect.

It was a pleasure to watch some science fiction that didn't require me (a scientist for the last 40 years) to suspend disbelief, to not be constantly thinking ""THAT couldn't happen"".

","Oh Dear! Another Multi-Million Dollar movie spoiled by the most trivial aspects which make the whole thing unbelievable. How many more of these Martian-based movies must we endure? I'm not going to bore you with technical details, but those of you with a Scientific background will be aware of how ludicrous many of this plots premises really are. (Minor example:- A Sugar-bomb to blow off a pressure door? Even If It WERE possible, would It really not damage the Spacecraft? Remember, It's an 'open' bomb, not an enclosed one, and so It would not contain and safely direct the blast.) I'd hoped for much more...Instead, we get more of the same. Suffice It to say that a man In the position In which our 'Martian' finds himself - struggling to survive In an every-second-counts matter of life and death and surrounded by multiple obstacles - does not have the time (never mind the Will) to keep himself totally clean shaven! Personal hygiene would be bottom of the list of priorities In such a drastic situation. All those Months and never so much as a tiny bit of bristle on his chin? Can something so obvious really be beyond the common sense of a Director with an enormous budget? A man under stress doesn't shave, period! Oh, but hang on a moment...after about 18 months, bang- a full beard, seemingly overnight! Likewise - and perhaps even more stupid - his hair remains exactly the same style and length. It doesn't even become dirty or disheveled! Some will think I'm being petty, but obvious errors like this utterly spoil the 'believability' of the whole plot and destroy the continuity despite how many 'Sols' have elapsed. I can live with the fact of this plant-studying astronaut managing to grasp the Engineering, Electrical and multitude of other skills required to survive (not to mention the Initial self-surgery...what a Guy!!) but some of the Science(i.e. Pseudo-Science)Is just plain silly. I'd hoped for so much more but sadly It's yet more American flag-waving twaddle of the first order."

","I am a big fan of Ridley Scott. I am a big fan of Matt Damon. ""The Martian"" was always going to be a difficult translation from book to screen. Scott did a good job on the technical side and Damon earned his paycheck but I never really got emotionally involved with his character the way I did in the Bourne movies. There was no ""wow"" factor at any stage in the movie for me. I found it quite watchable but it was not riveting and it felt like ""Apollo 13"" just on a grander special effects scale. Rescue missions don't usually make for exciting entertainment for me even when as in ""Apollo 13"", it was based on a real event and this is just a work of fiction. It would have been better if whilst marooned on Mars Damon had found signs of alien life or something and this had opened up a thought-provoking line to follow. But it was following the book and as a result there are no real scares or shocks in this movie - just a guy and a NASA team overcoming technical problems one by one. As it is I can only give this a 5 and it disappoints me to have to do so because I am a big fan of most science fiction movies."

","I got around to seeing the latest from director Ridley Scott over the weekend, which I may actually have to conclude is the best film I've seen so far this year. Based on the book by Andy Weir, Matt Damon stars as an astronaut stranded on Mars, after his crew believes he died in a storm and leaves him behind. I've noticed this is three years in a row Damon has starred in an amazing piece of sci-fi filmmaking, after 2013's ""Elysium"" and last year's ""Interstellar"". <br/><br/>Damon's character, by luck would have it, is a botanist, and his biggest problem is having enough food to survive on until the next manned space crew comes into town. So he gets to work planting crops using his own s**t! He also has to figure out a way to first of all, let the people back home know he's still alive, and then communicate with them. This movie reminded me of another film- ""Apollo 13"", a survival thriller using ingenuity and good ol' fashioned brainpower to get to each next level, only this movie is much much better I'd say..??<br/><br/>Also, if you're a fan of 1970's disco music, you will be dancing in your seat throughout this movie, since the captain of the crew that left him behind apparently was a big fan, and that was all the music they brought along with them-?? LOL ABBA, Donna Summer, Thelma Houston, the O'Jays, etc.. you name it; they're all there! Except the Bee Gees are noticeably absent-?? Hmmm.... No matter; absolutely LOVED LOVED this movie. I give it the highest rating possible. And I may even go as far as to say this is director Ridley Scott's best film to date, after a forty-year career in the movie business.. The film's all-star cast includes Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, etc.."

","Ridley Scott has returned to form with The Martian due to sticking to the nuts-and-bolts of the story rather than some way-out SF-based theme(as in Prometheus). This is concerned with a space mission to Mars the red planet with a crew who are forced to leave an astronaut(MarkWatney) behind , thinking he's dead, when a dust storm blows up. Think of an Apollo 13 scenario where the astronaut played by Matt Damon has to survive until he is rescued in a very risky return by the retreating space vehicle which has to use the earth as a sling-shot device and pick him up in Martian orbit.<br/><br/>Scott has an ease of manner at dwelling on these space subjects. He's also learned from other films, like Silent Running and Cast Away and Saving Private Ryan. With the Mariner probes we face post-fantasy Mars, where science fact squeezed out science fiction, where a real Mars took over. There are no Martians and the only life on Mars is likely to be more like microbes. Matt Damon plays a plucky individual who ""does the math"" to estimate how long he can spin out his resources, oxygen, water, potatoes which he grows utilizing his own faeces as compost. He establishes a communication link and keeps a video blog .<br/><br/>Meanwhile back at NASA they are all thrilled he's still alive and calculate how many sols he's got before he dies. How soon can they send up another rocket to rescue him?Meanwhile in space we tune into the crew aboard the rocket, who when they discover he's alive have to debate pros/cons of returning to Mars or heading home to Earth. Watney can play Lieutenant Lewis's ( Jessica Chastain) awful 70s pop disco collection. Damon shows ingenuity, guts and chipper humour after his buddies have left him for dead. Classy space procedural getting the science mostly right from the Master Ridley.<br/><br/>Science fact and pseudo-science are the new sci-fi. We are not a million miles away from making this leap of faith to go to Mars and so I found the film plausible. We are like the cave painters projecting what we are going to do in the future. Matt Damon and Scott are the cherry on the cake. A mix of Cast Away and Apollo 13: survival is all. There are fictional parts like the dust storm and the flight back and retrieval. A beautiful use of Jordanian landscapes to simulate the Martian terrain and a feeling for a few local difficulties. No inner angst, but the heady optimism of simply pushing forward for survival. Based on Andy Weir's novel."
"speedy-droid","8","5","12","7 October 2015"," Not Perfect, but a Solid, Enjoyable Story
","First of all... I really enjoyed The Martian, and I think that most people would. It's a long film, but it did manage to pick up the pace a bit, right when I was starting to get a little bored.<br/><br/>Whenever a film like this, which tries to be accurate, is released... Everyone, including me, starts to pick apart the technical inaccuracies, and there are a few. The most commonly mentioned so far is the ""impossible"" sandstorm at the beginning of the film. Such an event is, indeed, quite impossible on Mars, and even the author admits that it was merely a plot device. He should have thought of a better one.<br/><br/>However, there is nothing in The Martian that just screams ""No Way!"" to me. The author and the filmmakers did a very good job of trying to be as accurate as possible, while still allowing the story to proceed. There is some ""artistic license"" but there is no ""deus ex machina"" in The Martian. It's a good movie that doesn't betray anything that is science.<br/><br/>Really, the most unbelievable thing that I saw in the whole movie was the gym on the Hermes -- Huge Windows and 5 times the space and gym equipment needed to accommodate 6 astronauts. It looked like the hotel gym at the Marriott. No Way would NASA or anyone else waste that kind of space, and build such an unrealistic section of the ship.<br/><br/>As long as I'm doing my part in the nit-picking, we are once again faced, as in so many space-travel movies, with a centrifuge that is too small and/or doesn't rotate fast enough. And it doesn't feel like normal gravity either, as is readily apparent if you just gently toss a tennis ball into the air. OK, I'm done with my nit-picking.<br/><br/>As many people already have stated, I was instantly reminded of the movie ""Cast Away"", with Tom Hanks. I liked Cast Away, but it did get boring at times. The Martian solves this problem by injecting a bit more humor and action into the film. Rather than Hanks' downbeat character, Damon's character is far more upbeat and involved in his own rescue throughout the entire film. I definitely did not expect the humor that is present throughout the film. Whether it was script-writing, ad-libbing, or a combination of the two, it worked out quite well.<br/><br/>As with most movies of this type, the ending is poor compared to the rest of the film. The climax is so over-the-top dramatic that I didn't get the least bit excited about it. The thing is... the film didn't even Need a climax. The climax was already built in. A guy has survived on Mars for well over one year. Just being rescued at all is a climax. Instead, we got a bomb set off aboard a spaceship -- intentionally -- and some kind of glove-thruster maneuver.<br/><br/>I think that a much better ending would have been Watney passing out during the launch (which he did in the movie) and then waking up to slowly see the Hermes come into focus, nearby, slowly approaching, and a waiting Hermes crew-member with an outstretched hand. Add a few tears if you like that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Too bad this film didn't get to show on IMAX.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film. It's definitely worth it to see it in on the big screen."
"kevjfarrell","10","10","30","5 October 2015"," Well done!!!!
","I wondered whether this movie would be able to live up to the hype and I'm pleased to say it sure did from my point of view.<br/><br/>I think Matt Damon was perfect as the lead in this sci-fi/sci-fact gem. I did find the story very believable for the most part.<br/><br/>I have some minor concerns over the casting of some roles - in particular Sean Bean. If you need a Brit accent, you can find someone with much better acting skills (and accent too!!!). But as he's in a smaller role, it doesn't detract from the good points of this movie.<br/><br/>It appears to me that a lot of thought went into the geographical locations and probably some input from NASA to give the movie authenticity.<br/><br/>I saw the movie in 3D and was pleased with the effects. If you enjoyed Gravity, I think you will enjoy this even more. It's a long movie, but well worth sitting through. Personally I really enjoyed the whole concept and the well crafted story. The pace was good. It worked for me.<br/><br/>I feel sure this will get a few nominations in the Oscars - I'd vote for Matt Damon as Best Actor."

","So many flaws in this pro American fist pumping monstrosity my brother and myself nearly left the cinema. <br/><br/>I went in using Interstellar as my benchmark which was a mistake as this falls so short of Nolans epic that its not comparable in anyway.<br/><br/>Ill list a few glaring errors here to explain what lack of attention to detail Scott has, so stop reading if you don't want any spoilers:<br/><br/>1: Firstly no-one states in a press release especially NASA and especially if they are not sure that someone has died. He was missing not even confirmed dead so he wouldn't have stated that.<br/><br/>2: NASA scientists don't celebrate halfway through a launch phase like they have won $5000 on the Superbowl only to realise that the next second the whole rocket explodes. They are professionals with a holistic view of what is happening on board a complex space craft. they don't celebrate until they know they are in the clear.<br/><br/>3: Whilst trying to work out where Mark was going the only map of mars they seemed to have in the whole of mission control was a picture wall hanging in the mess room. Surely they have a more detailed map or digitised version to look at. Come on seriously!<br/><br/>4:The whole first 3/4s of the movie is an vague montage style overview of how NASA would (or wouldn't) act in a crisis situation. At one point they tell the JPL to build a rocket in about 4 weeks. Which they do with no representation of how monumental or impossible that task is. Next thing the rocket is flying into space like they have rockets to spare in the closet. Ridiculous!<br/><br/>5: When does 2 world class physicists describe a space crafts velocity in a rescue environment to each other using the terminology ""Its going really fast"". This was a key indication that this film is meant for the dumb and uneducated population.<br/><br/>6: More fist pumping and hurrah American rubbish than i've seen in most movies.<br/><br/>7: Nice play Ridley on the world united together to help each other out bit. China helping America. What a nice gesture. but it didn't last with Sean Bean snide remark to the Chinese space agency in their own mission control that they haven't used their kind of technology since the 90's. Remember Americans if you were worried. WE America ARE STILL THE BEST AND THE COLD WAR IS STILL GOING!!! GO America AND SCREW YOU BACKWARDS CHINA!<br/><br/>8: Ending is a kids movie. Iron man, a man flying uncontrollably through space with no control into the hands of a space walker at X'thousand miles and hour. Absolutely shocking.<br/><br/>9: The soundtrack. ABBA and generic pop disco! The worst soundtrack i've ever heard. However, Not even a decent northern soul soundtrack (which would have been a more tasteful well researched alternative) could have rescued this scientific mumbo jumbo from the pit of eternal nonfactual rubbish.<br/><br/>10. The end montage shows 2 of the crew members casually give their new born child a peck on the forehead and basically ignoring it as whats on the telly is far more important and interesting than the current situation they are just experiencing. Now i'm not an astronaut but science is my religion and i am a father. And any other parent knows that at the point of giving birth, that scene is a sweaty chaotic scene far from the pristine relaxed 'hey darling heres some muffins i just pulled out of the oven' scene that Ridley portrays. Has he seen anyone give birth? Not only that but the mother of said child seems to bear the smallest amount of care and attention to the life that has just emerged from within her. <br/><br/>Female astronaut who would have decent grasp of big life events: ""Hang on darling. Jerry Springers on the telly and two midgets are about to have a proper ding dong. Hold the baby while i finish my bumper pack of cheesy nibbles. Ill kiss her later. This midget battle cant be missed"" What a joke! <br/><br/>Fellow crew member and now father of freshly born son/daughter in the midst of a life changing experience: But darling we have just witnessed one of life's biggest miracles. Do you not care?""<br/><br/>Female astronaut who would have decent grasp of big life events: ""Oh alright one quick peck on the babies head. but only a quick one this is going to be epic. Its not even my baby anyway. its a prop which i'm going to make really clear to the viewers. Im a proper method actor me.""<br/><br/>On a positive the costume department was ace and if you love potatoes go and see this movie now!!!!!!!<br/><br/>No more Ridley Scott for me i'm afraid. Nothing decent has come from this man since Blade Runner and Gladiator."

","Yes of course it is. Frankly I do support that goal. So who is it that fights against that? The bureaucrats of course. This was filled with evil bureaucrats making obviously wrong headed decisions just so the ""space cowboys"" could defy them.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with hackneyed and cliché characters, and anyone who was not blind could see the ending long ahead of time. No, I did not even read the book.<br/><br/>By any standard the cinematography was good, and the Martian set pieces looked too, not especially great mind you but at least good enough. Watching this film in 3D did absolutely nothing for me at all, I recommend saving the extra $3 and seeing it without the special glasses.<br/><br/>My suggestion is to wait until this reaches the discount theaters and see it there."

","The film starts, and within a couple of minutes we are introduced to an astronaut crew where a woman is in command, ordering men around.

"gavin6942","9","4","9","17 January 2016"," Quite Possibly the Best of 2015
","During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.<br/><br/>Although at this point I have only seen three of the eight Best Picture nominees, I feel confident in saying that ""The Martian"" deserves to win. Although Ridley Scott is not nominated for Best Director (odd considering this is his best film in a long time or possibly ever), and the only acting nomination is for Matt Damon (who will likely lose to Leonardo DiCaprio)... this movie nails it on the story alone.<br/><br/>By all means, this can win in the Best Adapted Screenplay category, as well. No, I have not read the original book so I do not know what Drew Goddard put into it. And no, I have not seen all the other nominees yet. I suspect ""Big Short"" is also an excellent script. But again, this film succeeds based on two things: incredible suspense and a strong script. Is all the science strictly accurate? No. Apparently some key things, such as the ""fierce storm"", are not correct. But we believe it. Everyone speaks as though they know what they say, and unlike ""Star Wars"" (or even ""Star Trek"") this is clearly based on reality.<br/><br/>In recent years, it seems that a space movie somehow sneaks into the top Academy nominees. After ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"", we have this. And I dare say they are getting better. ""Gravity"" was a good exploration of visuals, but not a deep film. ""Interstellar"" took everything to the next level, even to the point of being a mind-bender. Here, I think we have the perfect balance: hard science and space danger. What could have been two hours of boring, bland scenes of a man in a desert end up being exciting and you can feel the desperation -- and more importantly the endless optimism and hope.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film's nominations are in production design, sound and other effects. These are well-deserved, and it may take home a few. Not being an expert, it is hard to judge sound editing. But this is the sort of movie where such a thing can make or break the picture. There will be some strong competition, but the designs of the NASA equipment are impressive and the sounds are excellent. The visual effects are a harder sell, with some of the low-gravity moments seeming a bit off somehow.<br/><br/>The takeaway: expect a win or two in the technical categories. Of the bigger awards, Damon is a contender for Best Actor but will not win. Best Adapted Screenplay ought to be a lock, and if it gets nothing else this is the film's strong suit. For my money, ""The Martian"" has Best Picture written all over it, but the experts are leaning more towards ""The Revenant"" or ""Spotlight""... on that, we will have to agree to disagree."

It was quite depressing.<br/><br/>And then, at the end, a diversion from the book around the rescue. Logic logic logic. and yet we have the commander offering to go and do a dangerous task for no good reason. It was the final smack in the mouth to the book.

I'm no rocket scientist but when someone says there was an explosion because he EXHALED too much OXYGEN..and that's just the tip of the iceberg. I'd heard that it was a sci-fi comedy of sorts so was somewhat prepared for Matt Damon's numerous one-liners, but I was really disappointed by the lack of character development not only in his character but in all of them. And Kristin Wiig? Why?? She was SO out of place, as was Jeff Daniels.<br/><br/>Anyway, no spoilers here, just a general 'meh' about the movie's numerous plot holes, its lack of tension due to no empathy created for the characters, and for its completely predictable and anticlimactic (and unrealistic) resolution."

Annoying thing about this is also the moment when the super smart scientist gets an idea but doesn't reveal it because...it's too cool to get right to the director of NASA to tell him off. Because time is of the essence, we have to wait to get to his office to present it. Really? This movie is dumb. Smart, in terms of the science, but really dumb in jamming a story where one didn't exist. It reminded me of those movies that are so intricate, the science geeks go gaga over, and the idiots who don't know science don't want to seem like morons and agree what a great movie it is. It's not. It's a less interesting ""Castaway."" Also, what's the deal with shooting it in Jordan. You know what it looked like? Utah. So, the entire time, I just considered Damon trapped in some godforsaken place on Earth.<br/><br/>This movie is boring. Further, the ridiculous crew of the Hermes.

"peterp-450-298716","8","4","9","13 November 2015"," Robinson Crusoe on Mars. But this time on it's own, without ""Friday"" ...
","""Dear America, remember that astronaut we killed and had a really nice  funeral for? Turns out he's alive, and we left him on Mars. Our bad,  sincerely NASA.""  I hope NASA draws its conclusions after watching this film. Namely  rearranging their budget. First, they can scrap these expensive looking  airlocks and replace them by locks made of cellophane which is attached  with use of duct tape. Now they can use that extra budget for a reserve  communication system in the base station so that any abandoned  crew-member can still contact the control center in Houston if the  initial one fails. They would hear for the first time: ""Houston, I have  a problem"". That was the first thing that flashed through my mind after  watching this otherwise smashing great SF, created by the unsurpassed,  ""my all time favorite"" brilliant director Ridley Scott. The (for me)  blatant misstep ""Exodus"", is hereby forgiven.  Mars is hot. Not literally, of course. But the recent revelations of  NASA about flowing water and solar storms that changed Mars into a  cold, dry planet, made sure Mars came to be the center of attention.  It's not really science fiction anymore, because there are plans  already to built settlements on Mars around 2023. Contrary to what's  shown in ""The Martian"", these settlers will depart with a ""one way  ticket"". Best those volunteers say goodbye thoroughly because their  final destination is the local crematorium on Mars. Initially this  wouldn't happen with the scientists in ""The Martian"". Until there's a  terrible storm showing up which forces them to pack their bags and  catapult themselves from this red planet. But they weren't expecting  debris flying around, causing Mark Watney (Matt Damon) to be impaled  like a delicious souvlaki. And then he sits there alone on that damn  planet, light years away from his home planet. Remi on Mars. Or the new  Robinson Crusoe. But this time without an ocean.  Matt Damon apparently prefers to play the stranded space traveler,  since he also did that in ""Interstellar"". The big difference with  ""Interstellar"" lies in the scientific accuracy. The solutions Mark  comes up with to survive and the circumstances on Mars, are  theoretically possible (only the devastating storm at the beginning is  fiction). This in contrast with ""Interstellar"" where everything is  based on theories which aren't tested in reality. We know about ""black  holes"". They are kind of interstellar hatches. But we still don't know  for sure where you end up, after tumbling in such a hole, and what  effect it has on time. I guess this is still a mystery. Sadly enough,  ""The Martian"" also has some points of comparison with ""Gravity"", that  other space-epic that turns into a survival trip avant la lettre. Just  like in that movie, the setbacks follow in rapid succession. The only  difference, in ""Gravity"" it's grossly exaggerated.  What I liked the most was the perfect balance between scientific  gibberish, the tension and the perfectly dosed humorous moments. The  scientific part was even for a layman like myself perfectly  apprehend-able. Partly thanks to the sometimes reliable explanations  from the video-log which Mark kept from day one. Needless to say the  film is filled with nerve-racking, exciting moments. But especially the  comic moments made this an enjoyable film. A perfect task for Matt  Damon with his charming, boyish smile who solves every problem with a  casual quip and a dose of positivism and perspective. Even the control  center of NASA, which is filled to the brim with humorless, serious  science nerds, made me smile from time to time. I never thought that  the combination of queerly disco music, old episodes of ""Happy Days""  and aluminum-wrapped human excrement's, could amuse me.  Money wasn't an issue for making this blitz film. Not only is this  demonstrated by the used images, but also by the star-cast. Besides  Damon there's also Jeff ""Dumb and Dumber"" Daniels, Sean ""Boromir"" Bean,  Chiwetel ""12 Years a Slave"" Ejiofor, Jessica ""Interstellar"" Chastain  and Sebastian ""Winter Soldier"" Stan. Each and everyone performs  brilliantly. And furthermore, the images of space, the landscape of  Mars and the spacecrafts are beautifully portrayed. Sadly enough at the  apotheosis, the MacGyver-level was extremely high. Let's hope that the  Soviet Union isn't offended in their honor because the Chinese salvaged  the situation. Fortunately we were spared from a mass of waving  American flags in the end. But despite the ""We love NASA"" and ""We will  prevail"" atmosphere, this was a superb movie, worth a re-watch. A top  survival drama."

","The film is NOT called Bring Him Home in case you were wondering. 78 year old Ridley Scott returns to science fiction, the genre he is best known for (Alien/Blade Runner/Prometheus). Though this scifi is much more based on real world science of the near future (2030) than the aforementioned movies. The book on which it's based got a lot of critical acclaim but I didn't read it so I can't say how well the story made the translation to the big screen. The Martian is a rather uplifting -yes dare I say feel good- film despite the apparently grim fate that befalls Mark Whatley (the astronaut stranded on Mars played by Matt Damon). You could say it's a testament to the resourcefulness of humans in dire situations and how you have to keep a positive attitude and not give in in spite of all the hardship that comes your way. Visually the movie is -as most Ridley Scott films are- pure eye-candy. The VFX looks hyperreal and are top of the line and the cinematography is superb. The music is mostly disco music but there is a reason for that in the story and it actually works well as a comedic effect. The film is actually similar to Apollo 13 which was better but was also based on true events. The Martian is a bit long at 141 mins and there is maybe a bit to much problem solving and sometimes not enough character background (e.g. what motivates Whatley to survive?). A very good film and worth the trip to the cinemas. It does however feels like it is lacking something to make it to classic status."
"brianberta","7","4","9","29 October 2015"," This could be Ridley Scott's comeback
","Ridley Scott is definitely one of the most hit or miss directors out there. ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"" are clearly his most praised works. ""Gladiator"" is definitely a classic and it has a pretty big fanbase. Also, some people argue that ""Black Hawk Down"" is even on the same level with ""Apocalypse Now"" and other classic war films (which by the way, I agree with that statement). However, he has also produced many hated films in the 2000's which have been called major disappointments by many. However, I still had hopes for this one because sci-fi tends to be his strongest genre. My anticipation definitely paid off and ""The Martian"" is clearly the best film he's made in a while and it proves that it might be his comeback.<br/><br/>After an astronaut gets stranded on Mars after a storm hits his crewmates, he finds out that he must find a way to signal Earth that he is still alive and he has to figure out how to survive until then.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of comparisons to last years ""Interstellar"". Unlike ""Interstellar"", this film doesn't contain any expositions and it gets right to the inciting incident. Despite this, we never get confused during the film as it doesn't expect us to have read the book. It explains things nicely and the plot flows along smoothly. ""Interstellar"" is also very heavy on science. However, this film doesn't focus too much on intricate science concepts and it is a film which can be enjoyed by more people on the first viewing. Also, it is much less bland and its pacing makes it an easier film to watch. So for this reason, I enjoyed it much more than ""Interstellar"".<br/><br/>Also, I really enjoyed the visuals. The outside shots gave a great feel about how Mars looked and it made it look like a barren and desolate area. The shots from the ship looked very futuristic and it made the living quarters look super advanced and high tech. The atmosphere in the movie couldn't be much better and it really makes you feel that this film actually was filmed in space. It may not be anything new or groundbreaking in terms of space visuals but I usually don't ever mind that as long as the visuals are not underwhelming and this movies visuals are most certainly not underwhelming at all. They interested me greatly and they looked very realistic.<br/><br/>Most of the screen time is focused on Matt Damon in this movie. I felt that he gave a great performance. It may not be anything Oscar-worthy but he still gave a realistic performance. He was the only actor I really noticed for the majority of the movie but that didn't bother me at all because he carried the movie very well by himself.<br/><br/>Like most great movies, however, it isn't flawless. The pacing was a bit too slow for me at times and I felt that it could have been cut to 2 hours instead. I also felt that some scenes carried on longer than they had to. However, this didn't bother me all that much and I still enjoyed it a great deal.<br/><br/>After ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"" grew very popular, it seems that the space survival genre is starting to become popular and we might see more films like this in the next several years. Hopefully, Ridley Scott learns off of what he did right in this movie so he can apply what he learned and make more great films in the future. I'm not completely sure if this is true but I think that this film might be his comeback into fame and he might make good films again as he once did. This is one of my favorite films so far this year and make sure you see it as soon as possible. You will not be disappointed at all."
"MikeyB1793","6","4","9","18 October 2015"," Flat
","Overall this was kind of flat. It lacked dramatic flare. Given the situation of an individual being trapped on Mars I would have expected more intensity. Perhaps the movie was just too long. There were a few times where I was simply bored. The movie tended to overwhelm one with technical details.<br/><br/>The ending could have done without crowds cheering at Times Square/Piccadilly – this seemed contrived.<br/><br/>The cinematography was great – of both Mars and space capsule scenes. Matt Damon was adequate, but I was expecting better. The storyline worked and was rational – with no silly hocus-pocus type scenes – so this kept my rating up."
"LenaKrones","9","4","9","17 October 2015"," Much more than I expected.
","I read the book when it came out in 2011 and I when they announced they where going to do the movie I was thrilled:<br/><br/>The book is not your typical Sci-Fi drama, it has touches of humor I really liked and it was written in a close and relatable way (as wired as it may sound talking about a not so far plausible futuristic scenario)<br/><br/>I think Ridley Scott transferred it brilliantly to the screen with spectacular visuals and special effects ( I recommend you watch the movie in a dolby atmos cinema for the full experience).<br/><br/>Is it the best Ridley Scott movie? Possibly not (considering he did masterpieces like Alien and Blade Runner) but it damn sure will be the highlight of the year."

"lesleyharris30","9","4","9","9 October 2015"," A Combination of Great Intelligence and Surprising Laughs,
","The Martian is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. I was very surprised with how good this film really was, it may look like a clichéd Ridley Scott film at first, but it had a very compelling story that sucks you in almost immediately, you are drawn to these characters and their adventure from start to finish. It is difficult to comprehend how logical it is, even though you may not know whether it is possible to survive on Mars, you can tell that Scott and Goddard did their research and made sure that Mark Watney's methods of survival made sense. One thing that I think could have improved was the sense of losing hope, there is never a moment where Mark or any other NASA employees completely lose hope in succeeding in their journey, no part were all of their plans completely fall apart and there is no sign of their problems being solved, this is an aspect of storytelling that should certainly be evident in all movies, it builds the audiences care for the characters. The films cast is fantastic, Matt Damon shines in the lead role and I could easily say this is one of the greatest performances of his career, Mark is very funny, I was surprised at how much he made me laugh, he was also likable and charming. Damon also has a lot of depth, there's certainly two sides to him, though he always seems confident he will make it home, we can always see doubt and frustration in his eyes, in his voice, the characterization of Watney was phenomenal and he deserves huge praise. He is also joined by an outstanding supporting cast that are just as inspired, I can not possibly name them all but I have to mention Jessica Chastain, a fabulous actress who is slowly becoming one of my favourites, Chiwetel Ejiofor steals every scene he is in as usual and Jeff Daniels really impressed me playing a flawed character who somehow never loses likability, Kristen Wiig also deserves praise, while this movie is funny, she surprisingly never delivers a single humorous piece of dialogue and is a very impressive dramatic actress, I look forward to hopefully seeing her in more dramas in the future. Intriguing, terrific effects, stunning character development and a flawless cast, the Martian is one of the best movies of the year, not to be missed by any fans of Sci-Fi or Adventure. <br/><br/>After being presumed dead while on a manned mission to Mars, Mark Watney tries to get in contact with NASA, shocking his crew and the rest of the world in the process by discovering he is still alive. He must fight for survival on Mars while NASA plans his rescue. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Matt Damon"
"brando647","8","3","6","12 October 2016"," A Fun, Hopeful Piece of Sci-Fi (with Emphasis on the ""Sci"")
","I would describe Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN as ""infectiously hopeful"". Astronaut Matt Watney, played with irresistible charm by Matt Damon, rarely succumbs to the near hopelessness of his situation. I think he only ever loses his composure twice in entire movie. It's hard not to smile along with him, cheering him on as he proceeds to outsmart the red planet at every turn. Damon finds support in an all-star cast in this bright bit of science fiction, including Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, and more. As you've probably figured out, Damon's Watney is the titular MARTIAN. He is stranded when the Mars mission of which he's a member is forced to abort their expedition and evacuate in the face of an enormous wind storm barreling down on them. Believing him dead as a result of some flying debris, his team launches for home and Watney awakens later, injured and alone. He's a little bummed at first but, almost immediately, he becomes determined to ""science the sh*t"" out his situation and survive until the arrival of the next Mars mission. To accomplish this, he will need to overcome his limited food supply and the overwhelming odds stacked against him on a planet unsuitable for human life. Meanwhile, those in charge at NASA become aware of Watney's unexpected survival and immediately start crunching the numbers in hopes of determining the fastest, safest means of bringing him home. It's a race against time and Watney will have to use every ounce of his ingenuity if he's to succeed.<br/><br/>It's always a nice treat when Hollywood gifts us with some real science fiction. So many ""sci-fi"" movies anymore have to deal with alien invasions, epic space battles, or fantastical pseudoscience. THE MARTIAN, based on the novel by Andy Weir, makes an effort to be as grounded in reality as possible. Granted, this is still a big budget Hollywood film and there are time and story constraints that won't let it embrace the full extent of the science behind the action but it goes above and beyond most other films of this nature. Seeing as how Watney is alone on Mars, the filmmakers used a series of video journals that Watney keeps for the duration of his stay as a means of delivering a lot of the exposition and the explanations behind what he's trying to accomplish, whether it be establishing communication with Earth or growing potatoes in a blend of Martian soil and human waste. It also gives Damon, as an actor, someone to talk to, even if it's to the imagined future viewer of his video logs. Damon spends the vast majority of his screen time alone in this movie and it's a credit to his charisma and, again, optimistic nature that he pulls it off so well. Throughout the movie, we intercut between Damon with his latest problem and the NASA staff putting together their own plan to save him before his food supplies run out, with Jeff Daniels' NASA director Teddy Sanders given the rough task of preparing a rescue operation under the watchful eye of the public.<br/><br/>Sanders and his team have a massive endeavor ahead of them, but at least he's got a great crew of minds behind him. Ejiofor is Vincent Kapoor, seemingly the team's voice of reason and the driving force behind the think tank. Kristen Wigg has a minor role as NASA's public relations officer, and Sean Bean is the mission commander who insists on informing Watney's fellow crewmembers (who are currently en route home to Earth) that he survived. That crew, by the way, consists of Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, Sebastian Stan, and Kate Mara. I wasn't kidding about the cast; this movie is packed to the brim with talent. Ridley Scott has created his most entertaining movie in years with THE MARTIAN. It's got everything I love: talented cast and crew, an engaging plot, and the aforementioned sci-fi with an emphasis on the science. If I had one problem with the movie (and unfortunately I do) it's the final act where everything I enjoyed about the movie is set aside for a more traditional thrill-ride climax. It was also the only moment in the film where I wish Damon's character would show a little more fear and uncertainty. The plan to get him off Mars in insane (but just insane enough to work, I suppose) and his continued quipping at that point felt inappropriate. But a stumble at the finish line isn't enough to ruin the fun everything that preceded it. As much as THE MARTIAN is great sci-fi, it's also a real good time and that's what's important."

"apooos","3","3","6","14 March 2016"," Not even close to the expectations
","After watching Apollo 13, I decided to watch The Martian and I was expecting a lot from this movie. But unfortunately, it was nowhere near to what I was expecting or in fact, ""reality"".<br/><br/>Apart from the red planet surface of mars and perhaps the mars rover, nothing in this movie seems realistic. The gravity of mars is about 1/3rd of the earth but Matt Damon seems to walk exactly like on earth. Even after being left alone on an uninhabitable planet, no feeling of being alone or even being scared to die seemed to emerge.<br/><br/>Above all, disco music in the background made the matter worse. It seemed like being alone on mars is like a weekend party?!<br/><br/>And why everything seemed to be so ""High Tech"". So many things looked unrealistic. Even the main control room of NASA was too dark to even work at? What was that about? It was very well depicted in Apollo 13. <br/><br/>And out of nowhere, Chinese people decide to help NASA by revealing their secret space mission? It is even hard to think of China working along with USA, let alone revealing a secret mission.<br/><br/>Then the whole team of astronauts just decide to go for the rescue mission right away even after knowing all the risks and time it will take? Seriously, it takes me more time to decide which burger I wanna eat at a restaurant.<br/><br/>In the end, after 561 SOL, eating only potatoes and a piece of bread, Matt doesn't seem to lose as much weight as he should have..<br/><br/>And the whole mission was being telecast on big screens like it was an Olympic game or something. Really? Since when NASA is so open about their missions -.-'<br/><br/>Overall experience, I just liked the Visual effects/CGI used to create the surface of mars, ships, and other things. But otherwise, very disappointed by the movie. I still haven't watched Gravity yet, I hope that will help me recover from my headache given by ""The Martian""."

","The story had all the ingredients required for making a great movie. But by pandering to political correctness it lost the plot even before the movie got started. The film is too predictable, with audience able to guess almost every next move. As part of politically correct movies, the characters are right mix of women, blacks and other minorities in important roles such as scientists, commanders etc. Which leads to question with young men and women together for such prolonged periods what can happen between them? Which is ignored here. Matt Damon is the only saving grace of the movie. The special effects are good. But other than the special effects and some desperate attempts by Matt Damon to save the movie, everything else fall flat on the face."

It had some good special effects that were fun to see in the theatre which is why I didn't give it a 1/10. I definitely didn't need to witness Matt Damon's bad comic timing or his gross naked butt. I was told that this movie was like ""interstellar injected with joss whedon"" but boy oh boy was that a lie. It was more like a nature documentary injected with open mic night at the ucb. The writing was lazy and as far as the acting goes all I can say is that they made the most with what they were given. Except for Matt Damon. They definitely should have cast someone funnier for his role. Believe the bad reviews. Don't see this movie."
"nicolechan916","Null","3","6","2 January 2016"," Impressive
","Movies about space seem to be the new 'dystopia' movie with its rising popularity. We had Interstellar and Gravity, and both were very heavy and intense films. So it was a nice change for The Martian to have a lighter mood while still having space complications. The humour of Watney's character complements the film nicely and helps to lift the mood of the seriousness of his situation.<br/><br/>Damon plays his role superbly and delivers his lines perfectly. His delivery is very natural and the vlogs that he does (which ultimately speaks directly to us) is informative without being too obvious of a tell. The chemistry between him and the rest of the crew members are well formed, especially with Chastain and Pena. There was even a hint of something else going on with Chastain and Damon's characters but that might just have been too much of Hollywood's influence that made me think that. Glover does a fantastic job as a sort of 'mad scientist' of the computer generation, and there is a hint of Troy (from Community) in there too. Ejiofor too does a great job as the communication link between NASA and Watney. Pretty much all actors and actresses held their own. The inclusion of so many characters with quite equal screen time (save for Damon) shows how the people working in NASA all need to collaborate in this highly sensitive atmosphere.<br/><br/>The visuals of Mars are impressive, and according to my friend those Mars scenes were shot in The Grand Canyon. The desolate landscape and reddish brown colour of the dirt is convincing as an alien planet and the structures and equipment used there seems quite realistic. The design of everything is great, down to the visual effects and soundtrack.<br/><br/>I am not really concerned about the physics and mathematics of the film, and choose to believe that what happened in the film can be done. The collaboration between NASA to help Watney figure out ways to survive is also shown in a montage which was cool to watch. What was not realistic was Watney's body transformation. I realize that weight loss would have been tremendous, but there are a few shots of a very skinny body with the face hidden which was definitely not Matt Damon and that bothers me.<br/><br/>Overall, an impressive film with an engaging story, great acting and cool visuals that will transport you away.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
"anthonyagee-63868","4","3","6","22 December 2015"," Soulless, boring, uninspired, and predictable
","I'm not going to go into all of the implausible science in the film; that's been well-covered by every other review here.<br/><br/>In many years I have never seen a movie receive such undeserving critical praise. It is clear from the reviews here that many people found this film to be the boring and slow slog that I did.<br/><br/>Simply put: this movie doesn't matter. Matt Damon stars as another marooned astronaut, the second time in two years he's played such a role. The difference is, of course, that his character in Interstellar is far more interesting and has more depth than the astronaut he plays in The Martian. <br/><br/>Every single character is cookie cutter. Every single line of dialogue is written as it were for a TV character, meant for an unsophisticated audience that mentally fist-pumps when they're exposed to such gripping dialogue as, 'I'm gonna have to science the sh*t out of this"" and ""let's go get our boy"". Delivered as flatly as it does here through actors like Damon (barely passable) and Jeff Daniels (wholly insufferable and cringe-inducing), it makes you want to slap your hands to your ears to make the pain stop.<br/><br/>After 2 hours goes by and you realize that the most interesting and exciting part of this movie occurs is its first 4 minutes irritation sets in. I don't know whether to blame Andy Weir or Drew Goddard, but putting a self-aggrandizing clown at the center of a movie about being alone in an alien world completely saps all electricity and tension from the proceedings. <br/><br/>So yeah, while things like putting a tarp over a spaceship bothers me, that's not what makes me think this movie is trash; instead, it's the way it uses hackneyed ""feel good"" human moments to prick a thousand holes in a balloon of tension it should have been building.<br/><br/>What a waste of time. How did the critics screw this up so bad? AVOID!"
"meeza","8","3","6","13 December 2015"," Close to marsvelous!
","Ridley Scott's ""The Martian"" is pretty much a marginally great movie, but I would rather insert it in the ""marginally really good movie"" category. This sci-fi light comedy focuses on astronaut Mark Watney. Poor Mark was left for dead in Mars by his fellow astronaut crew members when a mission to Mars had an accidental explosion. However, NASA eventually found a mark that revealed that Mark is really alive, and now their challenger, I mean challenging mission is to bring Mark back safely. A good chunk of ""The Martian"" resembles the ""Castaway"" makeup: a man stranded alone and fighting for not just physical survival but psychological survival; differences: one is an island, and the other one is in a planet, and also one talks to a volleyball named Wilson, and the other one talks to a video screen named... wait Mark did not give the video screen a name, maybe he should have called it Screenie. Anyways, Scott's directorial vision is out-of- this-world and is deservant of Best Director nomination love; it really moved me how he was able to incorporate disco music in a sci-fi flick. Drew Goddard's screenplay worked on the comedic fare, but lost me a bit with the way-too-much scientific technical verbose. Matt Damon was excellent as Watney. The supporting acting was also not spaced-out in acting proficiency; which included outstanding work from Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Michael Peña, and Sean Bean. You Should Be Dancing, I mean seeing ""The Martian""; there is some really cool hot (yes, I am disco oxymoron)stuff for you to discover. **** Good"
"fil-nik09","8","3","6","12 December 2015"," Not bad
","So, as I am writing this, the rating of the movie is 8.2 and I agree with it.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining. The story is interesting and grabs your attention. I think there are not many scenes which are boring and the time of the movie ( which is more than two hours) does pass fast. However, although I like disco music and those Gloria Estefan and Gloria Gaynor songs are cute in the movie, somehow, I feel that those uplifting songs are a bit misplaced in the movie. Don't know what kind of a soundtrack would fit better, but this one is ...<br/><br/>It was kinda strange to me that the Martian did not start to look thiner sooner considering the lack of food and all... Yes, there is the scene after shower where we see him very thin and bruised, but, I think it is kinda too late. OK, I can imagine someone being determined to stay alive, but I also believe that all the tasks would not look so easy. So, that kind of plausibility was a bit off for me.<br/><br/>I read this is a low budget and all ... I did not know that or noticed. But I did wonder where they shot the movie... Moroccan desert or Arizona? It did not look very Mars to me.<br/><br/>Anyway, not bad. Certainly better than many of the space movies I have seen."
"Vartiainen","Null","3","6","12 November 2015"," Apollo 13 meets Robinson Crusoe
","Set in the not so distant future, The Martian tells about one of the first manned missions to Mars and how one of the astronauts gets left behind when an enormous sandstorm forces the crew to abort the mission. The story is about him trying to survive with extremely limited resources until help can arrive. For it takes about four years to get from Earth to Mars - they have to build the spaceship from scratch and all that - yet he only has food for a few months.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays the lead role here and even though he has been in many good movies previously, I'd still claim that this is one of his finest yet. His range and his skill for acting out complex emotions without verbalizing them is what keeps us grounded, what keeps us with him throughout his ordeal. A nuanced, brilliant performance, deserving of the highest praise. Yet the film also has a very good supporting cast and I like that they focus on the happenings on Earth as well. NASA has rarely looked better on film than it does here.<br/><br/>I was also pleasantly surprised how captivating the movie was, given its style and story. Much of the film is really nothing more than constant, endless problem solving, with Damon's character Mark Watney having to overcome problem after another, likewise with NASA. It's a great movie about science and for science. Studying engineering or getting a Ph.D. in something else has never looked more inviting. Yet the movie is never boring, like some of you might think based on what I just said. The emotions are always there, the atmosphere is without a flaw brilliant and the characters feel so real that they will pull you in without a doubt.<br/><br/>If I had to name one problem with the film itself it's that you can definitely see that they had to cram a long, long novel full of detail into a single film. Because it really is nothing more than problem after another. So much so that it starts to feel a bit unrealistic. Sure, Mars is a hostile environment, but come on. Even Murphy of the famous Murphy's Law would say that this is a tad extreme.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a very good movie. It has a clear identity, excellent story, fantastic cast, good music and is at its core exactly what cinema is all about."
"mattiasflgrtll6","8","3","6","31 October 2015"," Pretty good movie, a few flaws
","Who doesn't want to go see a space movie at the cinema, am I right?<br/><br/>Matt Damon was a great fit in the lead role. He suitably captured the wit, optimism and (sometimes) frustration of Mark Watney. Very strong acting there. I liked Chiwetel Ejiofor as well, his character was likable and did a pretty good job. Kristen Wiig was good too, always nice to see her. I can understand some comments remarking that she was an odd choice for this movie, but I thought she was solid.<br/><br/>The story is interesting. How would someone actually be able to survive if stranded on Mars? Well, Watney shows us. Now, to actually be this lucky is damn near impossible, but his solutions seemed realistic enough for this kind of movie. It worked. We were also offered a good look into how the people at NASA (and outside of NASA too actually) try to figure out how to get Watney home once they find out he's still alive. Oh this is not a spoiler, don't worry. The trailer almost gave away the whole f'ucking thing.<br/><br/>There is enough scientific jargon and calculations to please anyone who's a fan of space movies, so there is fun to be had there.<br/><br/>Some of the humor was funny. I laughed a couple times at some of Watney's lines and behavior, and Rich Purnell was an entertaining guy too ""I'm gonna need more coffee...!""<br/><br/>All right, let's get into a couple qualms I had. Not ALL of the humor worked. Some jokes were repeated more than once, only really laugh-out-loud the first time. Some of the other jokes also felt pretty out-of-place (someone naming a plan after, uuhh... Lord Of The Rings). The music wasn't the best either. I don't like when a whole bunch of pop songs is used in place of a score, which occurred several times. The PG-13 rating made for some kinda jarring censorship too, I would have liked if Watney could swear more freely. And finally, maybe one or two actors were kinda ""eh"" in their roles.<br/><br/>Those are my only significant complaints though, I had a good time with this movie. Don't expect the next 2001 and I think you will like it too."
"uditsriram","7","3","6","30 October 2015"," Saving Matt Damon
","This is the third movie in which Matt Damon has acted in where he is stranded in another place and needs to be saved. Maybe it is not a coincidence. I guess he fits the role well. With his Impressive talent, I think there will be more movies in the future where Matt Damon stars in these kind of roles. Matt Damon's character in this movie is a brilliant Engineer and a Biologist. A little too arrogant for his own good, He portrays how any educated person can survive just by applying their knowledge. <br/><br/>'The Martian' is a brilliant adaptation from the Novel. The Movie has incredible Scientific accuracy right from the Laws of thermodynamics to simple botanical processes. Well, that is what you expect from a Ridley Scott movie. However, 'The Martian' is unlike Ridley Scott. It is quite different from 'Alien' and 'Prometheus', although there are massive references to his former movies. The movie is all about the basic human instinct of survival with a touch of Science coupled with genius minds at work. The film is surprisingly humorous and brought out some good laughs. <br/><br/>What I liked about this movie was the heavy applications of space flight dynamics and mathematics relevant to it. Additionally, the botanist's fantasy to grow plants in extreme conditions another planet is well depicted here.Likewise, as mentioned in the trivia, I liked the Idea of the planet Mars being an antagonist metaphorically. It signifies humans against the massive powers of the natural world and how humans can tackle it together.<br/><br/>Compared to recent Science Fiction movies like 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar', there were no brilliant cinematic scenes showing the landscape of Mars or the awe-inducing visuals of space. Nonetheless, it can be forgiven because the movie focuses on how humans use their machines to survive. <br/><br/>Overall, I would say that it is a brilliant movie with some amount of acceptable humour. It idealizes gender equality by having a woman commander of the 'hermes'. It also includes an International cooperation with China."

","Poor Matt Damon. In movie history, there's never been an actor to have built a career around needing rescuing. In fact – hey, wait a moment, didn't we just watch some space movie last year about him being abandoned on a distant planet? What's the point of another one so soon? What a rip off! Grumble grumble, get off my lawn. <br/><br/>Okay, granted – the proximity to Damon's space marooning in Interstellar is a bizarre and unfortunate coincidence. But that's about where the similarities end between Nolan's space odyssey and Ridley Scott's The Martian. Yes, really. I promise. As Damon's astronaut Mark Watney might quip – ""Trust me – I'm a botanist. We're well-versed in sh*t"". <br/><br/>Quip is the operative word - considering the 'man down' premise and Scott's space pedigree, there is nary an ounce of Alien's claustrophobic astro-terror here. The Martian, is, quite surprisingly, one of the funniest films of the year. Thank Drew Goddard, as his masterfully nimble adaptation of Andy Weir's bestseller practically sparkles in not only making thorough scientific exposition thrilling, but systematically using it as set-up for some pricelessly memorable punchlines (there are countless such examples, but Watney's unpacking of how he qualifies as a space pirate is arguably the best). While the creator of Cabin in the Woods might seem an odd bedfellow for legendary classicist Scott, it's really quite thrilling to see their respective sensibilities click into place like the Canadarm - unorthodox, but as complimentary and effective as can be. Goddard circumvents Watney's isolation by motivating his dialogue through regular video log entries – a genius and surprisingly uncontrived touch – while Scott, master of spectacular setpieces, employs every trick in the book to tremendous effect. The film's immaculate editing paces with supremely satisfying steadiness, always gunning forward yet never rushing, allowing the tense bits to speak for themselves. The Mars storm which maroons Watney is a masterpiece of tension, but just wait until you see the climax which, in true Goddard fashion, is anchored on an Iron Man joke. Flawless. Throw in a soundtrack full of gleefully obnoxious disco songs peppering Harry Gregson-Williams' spectacularly playful yet lonely score, and we have liftoff, Major Tom.<br/><br/>That's not to say all is postmodern riffing here. Like many of its contemporaries, The Martian isn't afraid to go big with idea or emotions, meriting every second of the film's expansive running time. Thematically, apart from the obvious moral of every human life having worth (rousing in itself), the film is equally a love-letter to the adventurous spirit of scientific exploration, and space travel in particular (science hasn't looked this cool since Bill Nye). The film's release right after NASA's announcement of more space travel ventures being greenlit couldn't be better – between this, Interstellar, and Gravity, disasters and all, it's impossible to imagine being more pumped for space exploration. This is largely thanks to The Martian's exquisite, jaw-dropping visual effects and Mars scenery, so rich it's almost a character in itself, which gives the film (ironically) a far 'earthier' aesthetic than most planet-jaunting sci- fi. Even the 3D – normally extraneous – demonstrates painstakingly crafted depth of field for artistry, making The Martian one of the best looking films in many a recent year. And I'm not just talking about the cast. <br/><br/>Okay, okay - speaking of, we're blessed with a treasure trove of performers here. Leading the pack, as the eponymous 'Captain Blondebeard', Damon, gives arguably a career-best performance. His 'gee whiz' charm is counterbalanced by a perfectly honed wry wit and stoic confidence muscling through an underbelly of utter despair, of which we get only tasteful glimpses. In a film full of aforementioned bigness, Damon dedicatedly farms for small moments – see the infectious delight of his growing potatoes in his own feces in Martian soil, or his grim righteous indignation that having nothing but disco music to listen to is the worst part of his isolation, while his quiet ""nah, I'm not gonna die here"" may be the most emotionally pure moment of the year. There's never a moment of disbelief at NASA dropping and risking everything to bring home such a triumphant character. <br/><br/>Supporting Damon, each ensemble member are practically bursting at the seams to excel in their given moments. Chiwetel Ejiofor finds every scrap of warmth, humanity, and passion as NASA's Mars mission director, while Jessica Chastain infuses unseen reservoirs of dignity and moralism into her mission commander without descending into archetype. Jeff Daniels was born to chew on the grim, deadpan dialogue he is even here (his icy ""I'm the director of NASA"" is unforgettable), while Sean Bean is so ruggedly dignified and credible he even stomachs a Lord of the Rings gag without the screen imploding in a farcical meta overload. Michael Peña is pristinely funny while tastefully stopping short of the boorish mugging he is subjected to in Ant-Man, while Donald Glover (doing what Community fans will dub his best 'Abed impression') gives a hysterical cameo as a loopy and potentially genius astrophysicist. Kristen Wiig is unobtrusively effective in a rare dramatic role as NASA's PR director, while Sebastian Stan and Benedict Wong (whose entire career seems comprised of space movies) each give resonant performances. Even the normally intolerable Kate Mara's sulk is channelled well into the role of a snarky astroprogrammer – arguably the film's loftiest feat. <br/><br/>Space movies are a vast and intimidating genre, and The Martian isn't perfect therein – there's just an ounce of predictability a dash too much Hollywood polish for Scott and Goddard's work to reach the realm of the Kubrickian greats. Nonetheless, work this vibrant, visually gorgeous, and hugely entertaining is still necessary viewing. In terms of standing the test of time, The Martian, just like its concluding musical number, will survive. <br/><br/>-9/10"

","I had WIld Tales, Ex Machina, and Mississippi Grind at the top of the 2015 list until I hit the BigD the other night and caught this in 3D - which I usually don't care for but man o man it was sweet for this flick. LATE EDIT.. have since moved back to #4.<br/><br/>Visually, the film absolutely knocks it out of the park. A colossal homerun. Damon is good in the lead, and the supporting cast is great too. UNlike Castaway, which I did enjoy thoroughly, the castaway segment of this film is quite eventful, funny, and paced evenly.. the film is a quick 2:20... for me I wish this was more like 3 hrs long because some of the subplots were jettison because of the running time.<br/><br/>I suggest seeing it in 3D because the spaceship scenes are great in 3d as is the early 'storm' scene. I don't care for the format. I only saw it because the time suited my mother and I's schedule... by the way she absolutely loved the film too. SOmetimes it darkens the overall film and makes it a little more blurry for me, but not the case here. I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>There's only one major problem with the film, and I say major because it stands out like a sore thumb even though I guess it shouldn't be that big of a deal... it's just an idea that was used in a late scene that seemed a little stupid(canopy). That idea and the fact they packed a 3hr movie into 2:20 are the only things keeping this from being a 10, and that's saying something.<br/><br/>Ridley took the only good aspects of Prometheus(some of the visual aspects:suits, planet, etc), and only enhanced them here. The plot is the opposite(not rocket science pun intended). <br/><br/>Martian may drive up the middle of the road, but the acting, script, and visuals are so good that it literally elevates the film to another level. Ridley is back with a bang.<br/><br/>Very good film. Dunno if it will hold onto the top spot, after all I'm just 30 films into my 85 film watchlist for 2015, but I don't see any chance that it doesn't stay in the top 5 when all is said and done next spring. Highly recommend this. 88/100<br/><br/>You might like this if you like:Castaway(about even or ever-so- slightly below), Hunter Prey(not as good - b-movie rec), Prometheus(not nearly as good), or Gravity(not quite as good as this but pretty close).<br/><br/>cya<br/><br/>PS the reasons I late edited this down froM 9 TO 8 and from #1 for '15 to #4(FURTHER NOW WITH OTHER FLICKS MOVING AHEAD) was a rethinking about the cliché'd supporting roles, predictability, and the other small issues, but overall it's a very good film.... may go back up to 9 torn on this. 8.5!"
"KristianZacc","8","3","6","20 October 2015"," A return to form for Ridley Scott?
","Minor/Vague Spoilers<br/><br/>Ever since Sir Ridley Scott broke through with his feature film debut, Alien (1979) he has been a force in the film industry with other major successes in Blade Runner (1982), Thelma & Louise (1991), and Black Hawk Down (2001) just to name a few. Most people, myself included, would say that he has been in a bit of a slump with a few of his previous movies including, Prometheus (2012), The Counselor (2013), and Exodus: Gods & Kings (2014). So, because of that I was really hoping that his latest film, The Martian, would be a return to form for Ridley Scott. <br/><br/>The advertising for this movie was everywhere; anytime I went to the cinemas a trailer for this film would play which was preceded by Matt Damon introducing it. When I saw the trailers the first thought that came to my head was that it could be ""Cast Away on Mars"" mixed with Apollo 13. There was also a tiny bit of similarities to Interstellar 2 for obvious reasons when looking at Matt Damon's character as well as Jessica Chastain also starring in the film. While the small parallels were there, they disappeared quickly once I got over that novelty.<br/><br/>The film, which is based on Andy Weir's novel, The Martian, is about astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who is mistakenly presumed dead and left behind on Mars after a storm, who then has to try and fight to survive and signal Earth to come and rescue him. <br/><br/>This movie brings a lot of comedic moments that I wasn't really expecting just based on the premise of the film. It was very well done, mostly by Damon and even Donald Glover in a smaller role. Damon's character is very much an optimist when the situation would probably call for anything but that emotion. Damon takes what the writers of the film created and plays the character extremely well and had me laughing much more than I thought. <br/><br/>All of the supporting cast, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, and Chiwetel Ejiofor really make, what could have otherwise been just pointless secondary characters, necessary and they add to the overall story that make the stakes even higher because of how well they all play to the situation that is presented in the film. <br/><br/>Halfway through this film I came to the conclusion that the trailer didn't give away as much as I thought when going into this movie as I was a little afraid that I might have already seen half of what the story had to tell. <br/><br/>The way the film is shot could only be described as beautiful and breathtaking. It really captures the landscape and there are no flaws that I could see in anything that we saw on Mars. Scott made what could have been just a simple, desolate landscape come to life. This also adds to the fact that it could be somewhat believable that this may have been a real story, even though it isn't. <br/><br/>Something that my friend said to me as we were walking out of the theatre was that there wasn't a real bad guy that a traditional Hollywood movie would have. I really didn't notice this as I was watching and couldn't have agreed with him more once I thought back on the story. This makes the film much more impressive because it didn't have to rely on the use one of the biggest Hollywood tropes and make it extremely suspenseful and enjoyable.<br/><br/>The only problem that I had with the film was that sometimes when they were explaining the science behind what they were about to implement they did it a few too many times. They had the people on Earth explain and discuss how they would pick Watney up on their way past Mars and then it would immediately switch over to Watney and he would once again explain the scene we just saw. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a very strong return to form for Ridley Scott where everything, acting, writing, and cinematography comes together and is wrapped up in a neat little package that is meant for the big screen."
"jmillerdp","7","3","6","17 October 2015"," Better Beginning Than Ending
","I just saw both ""The Martian"" and ""Jurassic World"" this week. And, here are two movies whose first halves are better than their second halves.<br/><br/>The setup of ""The Martian"" is very good! Stranded on Mars, Matt Damon must use his science background to engineer his way out of dying on the red planet before a return mission can come and get him.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS BEGIN) His plan goes well, and he meets with setbacks, which you would expect. Meanwhile, everyone on Earth tries to figure on a way to come and rescue him. Everything goes well, in that respect. But, the ending gets a little crazy, including a space- based ""Gravity""-type action sequence that defeated the decidedly better science-based opening. (END SPOILERS)<br/><br/>Ridley Scott does have a return to form here, after the muddled ""Prometheus."" Scott has always seemed at home with science-fiction, and I hope that he continues making more sci fi.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, especially by Damon, who must carry the film by design. The film score is pretty routine, which like ""Prometheus"" doesn't help the film like it should.<br/><br/>The cinematography is fine. I did have a problem with the visual effects. Those set on Mars are okay enough, even though they occasionally lack polish. But, the space-based ones look worse than those in the superior 2000 entry ""Red Planet."" That's odd, and might be a reflection of budgetary restrictions. ILM is on board here, but is a minor player. The effects seem more suited to a higher-budget Science Channel program.<br/><br/>With Scott Kelly doing his year in space at the moment on the International Space Station, it is especially odd to not see The Milky Way in the background while the ships are moving though space. As seen from Kelly's photographs, our galaxy should be very prominent, and really impossible to miss. Instead, we just get black, with a few scattered stars.<br/><br/>So, a good, but mixed entry. I am going to listen to the audiobook, and it should be interesting to see how that turns out compared to the film.<br/><br/>******* (7 Out of 10 Stars)"
"timdalton007","9","3","6","17 October 2015"," Faithful To The Novel & A Fantastic Film
","Hollywood seems to have a strong affinity for adaptations, some good and some not so much. It was with some interest then that I came to The Martian then. Adapted from the novel by Andy Weir, featuring an all-star cast and directed by Alien and Blade Runner director Ridley Scott, it certainly promised to be interesting and potentially good as well. Did it live up to those expectations? <br/><br/>Oh yes it did. <br/><br/>Part of the film's success lies in its casting. Matt Damon was well cast as astronaut Mark Watney, the botanist on NASA's Ares Three mission who, thought dead by his crew members when a dust storm forces them to abort their mission, finds himself in a struggle to survive with minimal supplies and little chance for rescue. Damon perfectly captures Watney: determined, ingenious and good humored, but not a perfect human being by any means. It's something that's endearing as we see him become frustrated, angry at himself for his mistakes while also being aware that he has little time (or anything else for that matter) to waste if he's going to survive. The humor leads to some of the film's best moments while also getting across in some of the film's quieter moments the sometimes sheer loneliness of being the only human on an entire planet. It's an effective performance and one that anchors the film.<br/><br/>Backing Damon up is a strong supporting cast. Highlights includes the ever excellent Jessica Chastain as Ares Three's mission commander Lewis, Jeff Daniels as the NASA administrator, Sean Bean as mission control flight director and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor who is overseeing the Ares missions. Even smaller roles are well cast including Kristen Wigg as NASA spokeswoman Annie Montrose as well as Benedict Wong and Donald Glover as scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Together they bring the Earth-based and non-Mars space sections of the film to life and do so rather nicely which helps the film immensely.<br/><br/>It also helps that there are some stunning production values on display as well. The highlight of the film visually is one of the best cinematic renderings of Mars yet produced through a combination of filming in one of the most Mars like locations here on Earth (Wadi Rum in Jordan) as well as a combination of special effects. The special effects in general are a highlight of the film including striking visuals of Mars from space as well as some impressive looking space hardware including the Hermes which transports the crew to Mars and back again. The production design and costume work extrapolates on current NASA plans and technology and comes with realistic takes on what might actually be used in a mission like the one portrayed in the film. All of this falls under the direction of Ridley Scott who presents, like he did with Blade Runner, a fascinating vision of the near-future though one that is perhaps more likely to come to pass. Together, they bring the film to life.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake though may well be the script which, as I hoped, stayed pretty faithful to Andy Weir's novel. The tone, humor and the overwhelming majority of major events from the novel are all reproduced here though in some cases incidents are simplified due to screen-time, often I suspect due to the lack of time for the some technical exposition that Weir used in the novel. In other places, the script enhances the drama of events, especially in its final sequences, all of which is forgivable as they do add to the drama as well as changing things up just a little bit for those who've read the novel. Rarely has a film captured its source material as well as this film does, especially its aforementioned climax which reproduced all of the tension and excitement of its prose counterpart.<br/><br/>What's important though is that it captures the heart of Weir's novel. At its heart, The Martian is the tale of one human being on a desolate world in a struggle to survive. This is a tale of how we are capable of surmounting the seemingly impossible with a little know how and MacGyver like ingenuity and creativity. Yet, and perhaps just as importantly, this is also a story of human fallibility as often Watney's decisions and actions lead to unexpected consequences that he has to deal with. The result of all this is that, as cinematic adaptations go, it's one of the most successful efforts in recent memory.<br/><br/>The Martian then is a success by almost every measurement. It features a strong performance from its lead actor backed up by a strong supporting cast, features equally strong production values that bring near-future space exploration to life wonderfully while also remaining largely faithful to the events and soul of its source material. As both an adaptation and as a film on its own, it stands up very well indeed. What more can you ask of it?"

",". . . believe that the Apollo ""Moon Landings"" were shot on a Hollywood film stage. I would like to argue that the REAL hoax is the claim that THE MARTIAN is just a movie--NOT a documentary largely shot on Mars. There are dozens of dead-giveaways to prove my contention. I have space to list these few. First, all of Matt Damon's public appearances for at least the several years of the Ares III Mission were performed by photo doubles. I personally saw one of these next to the Visitor's (Yankee's) dugout in Detroit during a 2006 American League Division Series Game, and it wasn't very convincing. Second, releasing this space exploration documentary in the guise of a fictional feature flick spares NASA the embarrassment of owning up to a Real Life crew mutiny. Third, the backgrounds amid which Astronaut Damon maneuvers are NOT fake-looking (like STAR WARS and STAR TREK); they're clearly REAL--just not anywhere on Earth. Finally, Americans have been dying to know why we haven't nuked China already, given its shenanigans in Tibet, Africa, and on International Waters. THE MARTIAN shows WHY we've given China such wide latitude to assault the World: it's simply our way of saying ""Thank you,"" since they played such a huge role in rescuing Astronaut Damon."
"PWNYCNY","2","10","33","6 October 2015"," Ridiculous story. Growing potatoes on Mars?
","This movie opens with a group of persons in space suits collecting rocks in desert-like terrain that purportedly is Mars. Apparently this is a scientific mission. Then a hurricane like wind storm blows and the mission has to be aborted, quickly. One of the crew is struck with flying debris and is left behind. He is presumed (erroneously and without confirmation) to have died. The crew member's death is reported to NASA, which is in charge of the mission. NASA accepts the report as final and announces that the crew member had died. The crew member is given an elaborate funeral. Then, by sheer accident, a NASA technician monitoring a satellite orbiting Mars discovers that the crew member is alive and is actually moving about on the surface. What is NASA supposed to do? Attempt a recovery which could put the rest of crew at risk? A NASA mission has left one of their own on Mars to die. He was abandoned. The moral, legal and political implications are obvious. This build up offers almost unlimited dramatic potential. At this point the movie tanks, badly. Instead of tapping into the dramatic potential to further increase the tension, the movie becomes formalistic, predictable and boring. The abandoned crew man remains affable, still a team player. That he was left behind by his comrades as dead generates at most slight annoyance. Instead of being overwhelmed with despair and engulfed by terror, which would have been exceedingly dramatic, he is listening to disco music, and, even more amazingly, growing food under conditions that defy all known science. Much of this is amusing, but only because it is so unrealistic and contrived as to generate unintended laughter. On earth the NASA administrator, played by Jeff Daniels who gives the only solid performance in the movie (which is why the movie is rated a 2 instead of ""awful""), does not want to order a rescue mission. Thus he becomes the ""heavy"" or the ""bad guy"" when actually the real ""bad guy"" is the commander of the mission who stupidly, and without any corroborating evidence, presumes that her crew member was killed and instead of telling the truth, that the crew member was missing, then compounds the lie and the political fallout by passing it on to her superiors who later are forced to eat their words when the truth finally emerges. Such a scenario, if depicted with sufficient dramatic power, would have been a pivotal point in the story. Instead, the commander's poor judgment is never fully explained, her irresponsibility and lack of common sense glossed over. True, the commander is shown having pangs of guilt, but she remains quiet until such time that she is informed of her error, which by that point is anticlimactic. Then the rest of the movie is about her wanting to go back to Mars to save her crew man, the same man she abandoned. Ridiculous. She goofed, big time, and nobody demands that she account for her decision, not the one to leave a crew member behind, but to officially report him as dead. From that point on, the story devolves into just another formalistic potboiler with lots of overblown special effects that do nothing to make up for the huge holes in the plot, the inane dialogue, the wholesale jettisoning of scientific plausibility (Growing potatoes on Mars? Hurricane force winds on a planet with an atmosphere that is practically a vacuum? Terrain that looks surprisingly like Monument Valley? De-compressing an entire space craft without it completely crumbling? The crewman not bleeding to death after being impaled in the abdomen by a long sharp piece of metal?) or the spotty acting. As for the last item, sometimes a great actor can take mediocre material and raise it to a higher artistic level. Suffice it to say, in this movie that does not happen. Damon cannot save this movie nor does he seem to make an effort to try. No great dramatic scenes. No sense of crisis. No recriminations. No nothing."

","This is a curious trend going on: each year the space movie comes out on October. Gravity in 2013, Interstellar in 2014, and this year, The Martian.<br/><br/>This year, like in 2013, I wasn't disappointed. The Martian begins quite fast, without any cliché exposure, but directly in the action. So fast, actually, that I wondered how the movie was going to last its 140 minutes without being boring at some point. When the screening was over, I realized that I never encountered any second of boredom thanks to a great storytelling and a perfectly managed rhythm.<br/><br/>The Martian is kind of a humble movie. The pitch is quite simple as is its development. If the movie doesn't hesitate to explain and vulgarize the science used by the main character to survive, it never slips in psychodrama nor philosophy. It is very down to earth (I mean, down on mars) and only references current knowledge. This is quite refreshing when compared to some other space movies heavily loaded with speculations and vast reflections.<br/><br/>The cast is massive and impressive. I never thought I was going to see Sean Bean and Donald Glover (Troy from Community) in the same scene in some movie some day. Matt Damon deliver a solid performance which illustrates very well the emotional roller-coaster that its character is living.<br/><br/>What I liked very much with The Martian is how it promotes science. Basically any character in the movie is a scientist or an engineer or an astronaut, and they're all cool, fashionable or charismatic. This is one of the few movies with Apollo 13 which really put the scientists and engineers as the heroes and science and rationality as the true way to solve problems. Even though The Martian goes a little wild with the realism at the end, the rest of the movie convinced me to forgive and even enjoy these final elements. I read that it was a liberty that the movie took with the book, and I'm glad they did so. Another good difference with the book is the lack of exposition (cf. §2). While I didn't read the book, these two known differences make me think it's a great adaptation overall."

","Ridley Scott is one talented AND versatile director. He directed several great films in many genres including science fiction films like 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' while also directing historical epics like 'Kingdom of Heaven' and 'Gladiator', with the latter being my second favorite Best Picture Oscar winner of all time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, since 'American Gangster', Scott seems to have lost hi directing sense, with a lot of films getting rather underwhelming receptions especially with 'The Counselor' and 'Exodus: Gods and Kings', which considered as some of the worst films he ever directed. Only 'Prometheus' gained good reception with still highly polarizing reception from the audience. It's quite obvious why a lot of people were worried about this film since his records hasn't been very good for last 7 to 8 years.<br/><br/>Well, guess what guys. Ridley Scott is BACK! 'The Martian' is not only one of his best films of all time, but also one of the best of 2015. All the actors in this film, regardless of their roles, have showed great performances overall, especially Matt Damon, who plays Mark Watney, the astronaut who is stranded on Mars.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is about this stranded astronaut who is trying to survive on Mars alone while people in NASA are trying to get him back.<br/><br/>It might sound boring, but it really isn't. It shows you his survival method on Mars and his journey to return home. Not only that, even the bombardment of scientific explanations aren't boring at all. As a matter of fact, they actually kept me interested throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>I'm not going to talk about visuals, cinematography, and production values, because they're simply brilliant and no need of further mentions.<br/><br/>It's also surprisingly a lot of fun. Mark Watney manages to keep the film from going into gloom-and-doom territory by using his humor and wit and mention of his hatred towards disco songs (which, by the way, are brilliantly used in this film). I could tell that these actors had a lot of fun themselves while working on this film.<br/><br/>The only thing comes off as closest to my only gripe is when Watney seems not appearing for 25 minutes, which didn't bother me a lot since they still managed that time very well.<br/><br/>But the best part was the epilogue, where Mark Watney becomes a survival instructor and tells his story to his students. What he says to his student really made me think about living through the hardships you face in the future.<br/><br/>Overall, 'The Martian' uses its great acting and script, directing, disco songs, scores composed by Harry Gregson-Williams (welcome back too, Gregson-Williams!), sciences, and 3D cinematography to make itself into one of the best films of 2015 and one of my favorite films of the year."

","I had moderate expectations for ""The Martian"" and the film exceeded them. It wasn't a perfect movie by any means but, at least for me, it was entertaining and worth-watching. The scrip is fairly well-written and the direction is quite good too (specially in the Habitat/Mars set scenes) but what really stood out to me were the delivered performances.<br/><br/>Starting with Matt Damon. He is an excellent actor! He was a so-so for me(I never completely saw the Bourne trilogy nor Good Will Hunting) until yesterday. I knew he had the chops but I didn't relate to him as much as I relate to other actors and actresses. He is so good playing the part of Mark Watney. You believe in him and you care for the character and you feel the sense of desperation when everything seems to go wrong. Above all, I related to him. I don't know if any other actor could pull this specific role off and I believe Damon was the perfect casting choice.<br/><br/>Then we have Jessica Chastain. She is having a meteoric rise since 2010/2011, specially after Zero Dark Thirty. I find her to be an amazing actress, from ""Mama"" to ""The Help"" she is just superb. Whatever role she plays, we know we're in for a treat. <br/><br/>Aside from these two we have an ensemble cast filled with A-plus performers. Jeff Daniels as NASA director turns to a more serious and darker role, Michael Peña is the film's comic relief and he does it extremely well, Chiwetel Ejiofor is as good as always, Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan, take a huge part in the movie climax and they're performances are flawless. Aksel Hennie is also quite good, washing away his performance on ""Last Knights"",<br/><br/>Despite having less screen time is always amazing to see Kristen Wiig and Sean Bean. I was not aware Bean had a role in the film until I saw him sitting at a desk and it was a lovely surprise.<br/><br/>The technical effects are well-achieved, at least for me, although Matt 's body near the end seems really CGI and wasn't as polished as I think it should have been. The end to me was a bit ""fairy-tally"" but I'm good with it.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" shines due to the performances of its cast and through some breathtaking scenes in Mars (Watney's performing surgery on himself was gasp-taking). An good effort from Ridley Scott on the sci-fi genre but I don't quite know if it should be recognized as an Oscar Contender."
"cafescott","8","4","10","17 October 2015"," Intense but Fun Ride
","""The Martian (2015, Ridley Scott)"" is pretty good overall, but riddled with enough flaws you want to warn people about.<br/><br/>It is occasionally more intense than pleasurable. (For example, Matt Damon's injured astronaut performing desperate surgery on himself. We get prolonged looks at the bleeding gut.). Also, it is often a tepid music video, particularly during the schmaltzy sequence when David Bowie's ""Starman"" is heard. <br/><br/>The propaganda elements are also all over the place. The head of NASA (played by Jeff Daniels) actually cares about whether a lone astronaut stranded on Mars lives or not. What a nice guy. Also, nearly every woman working at NASA is really hot. I also get a kick out of the plot turn where an odd, reclusive wonder kind uses a supercomputer to verify a gravity assist algorithm--and he's the only person at NASA who had thought of using what would seem to be a common maneuver.<br/><br/>The science is interesting but dumb in crucial places. What confuses me the most is how initially it takes hours to communicate to Astronaut Matt Damon on Mars, when later that communication is instantaneous. (As evident by the Times Square euphoria.) Did Matt build a new Internet?<br/><br/>However...the good side is The Martian shows us a doomed character using his wits to postpone his fate. There is also a lot of admirable teamwork, and resistance to authority when necessary.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain really show up. They both are larger than life; just what we expect in movie stars. (But isn't Matt Damon a bit old to be an astronaut assigned a Mars mission?) I wasn't keen on Ridley Scott's direction, but the Martian landscape is always enjoyable.<br/><br/>If you can handle the shocks and intensity of a modern US movie, you will like this. Otherwise, avoid."

","Lovely idea, always love films of this theme/genre. <br/><br/>However, I found that the dialogue was very very flat and lacked any kind of depth.

"autisticreviewers","10","4","10","17 October 2015"," A very hard film to watch. A story of a man who fought to survive!
","Sorry for the late posting of this review, but The Martian is one of this year's unexpected best films for this year. Directed by veteran director Ridley Scott, the film mixes with sci-fi, comedy and drama elements as it explores how far man could survive in space.<br/><br/>The plot follows a manned mission to Mars, astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.<br/><br/>Scott is back in the director's chair and in top form after his previous films (The Counselor, Prometheus and Exodus: Gods and Kings) weren't as successful and failed to grab attention and critical reviews. There are no aliens in this film, but he chooses to explore the humanistic elements that drive us to survive in the world, but in this case on an isolated planet.<br/><br/>The casting here is stellar and all actors and actresses involved give 5 star performances, but it's Matt Damon who steals the show as the sole survivor Mark. He gives humour, emotion and will to make his character likable and the supporting talents from Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wigg, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena and more all prove to be Oscar worthy candidates in the upcoming award season.<br/><br/>The music score is great and it's soundtrack of 70's and 80's music provides an uplifting mood for the film. Not too mention as well, the film isn't as heavy or dark as the great films Gravity and Interstellar carry but manages to juggle adventure, comedy and character development all at once and the result is really impressive. Cinematography and the locations are all beautiful and captivating and it's bound to get Oscar and various award nominations.<br/><br/>Overall, The Martian for me is an unexpected great film that deserves the hype and attention. No faults to say but I will say it runs at an 2 and 1/2 hour running time but it goes smoothly and keeps all plot holes closed and sealed. If you have loved 127 Hours, Cast Away, Gravity and Interstellar, this is for your 'To Watch' list.<br/><br/>10/10"

","It was a last minute decision to watch this movie with my friends. And to say the least, I was not thrilled about watching a sci-fi movie, a genre I don't usually enjoy. I did not have any expectations for this movie whatsoever, but boy was I wrong about everything I thought this movie would be like. The Martian makes you feel everything: it keeps you on the edge of your seat, it constantly awes you with the intellectual aspects of the movie, it gives you a good laugh time to time, and it impresses you with the amazing graphics. I watched this at 11pm, and I didn't get tired even once although that's the time I usually sleep at. After watching the movie, all I could think was, ""Wow, did I really just watch that?"" Seriously, I could not get over how amazing it was. I did not expect this movie to have a lasting effect on me. The Martian is one of those movies that you will always remember and wouldn't mind watching over and over again (at least for me)! Thank God I agreed to watch this with my friends - hands down one of the most excellent movies I've ever watched."
"bschultz_the_pally","8","4","10","12 October 2015"," Catch this one on the big screen
","Initial trailers did not stir my interest in Ridley Scott's latest endeavor, especially considering his string of misfires in recent years (although I did like the generally sloppy Prometheus) but the early word-of-mouth bested my lack of curiosity and got me excited. Turns out everyone was right.<br/><br/>The Martian appropriately begins on Mars, where it spends most of its runtime. A group of astronauts are attempting to take off from the planet in the midst of a terrible storm, which knocks out Mark Watney (Matt Damon), and the crew leaves him, believing he is dead and unable to find his body in the storm. As we all know from the trailers, however, Mark Watney is alive and he intends to keep things that way. But things look pretty dismal; he is on a planet where nothing grows, has only enough supplies to last him a few months at best, and has no way to communicate with NASA or anyone else on Earth. But he does not give up hope in the face of adversity.<br/><br/>Putting his experience in botany to use, Mark successfully begins to grow food and increases his chances of living. He also develops a system of communication using only the still camera available to him. He doesn't have many resources, but he puts each of them to the best of use. Mark Watney's early success can be chalked up to high intelligence, resourcefulness, and a little bit of luck.<br/><br/>Such is the case with the film. Drew Goddard's script, based on the book by Andy Weir, takes every factor into consideration to make life on Mars seem plausible, albeit extremely challenging. Despite it's high level of scientific exposition, The Martian also doesn't forget to have a sense of humor. Mark Watney is the type of person NASA would want in space (unlike Sandra Bullock's character in Gravity), and he seems like the type of guy almost anyone would want to hang out with.<br/><br/>So it comes as a surprise that Watney is unmarried, without children, leaving no real emotional connection to Earth. Yet all of the other members of the Hermes ship have family, so it begs the question; shouldn't they have written Watney to have a family, or should they have made someone else the main character? The movie only scratches the surface of loneliness, yet it's tagline is ""Help is only 140 million miles away."" The Martian might feel real in its scientific approach, its blend of humor and action, but it lacks much drama beneath the main plot.<br/><br/>Still, The Martian's script is carried well by an excellent performance from Matt Damon, who feels fresher in this film than he has in years; he has an energy that most actors would not have been able to carry on screen. Its supporting cast is full of big-name surprises, most who perform well (Jeff Daniels is great, for example, while Donald Glover is a touch too comedic all things considered). Ridley Scott has always been a director to summon impassioned performances, but doesn't always have the right material, but the stars line up here, and it's a spectacle to behold.<br/><br/>Other great things about the film include:  The Martian landscape; extremely picturesque and rich in color  The pacing; at 140 minutes, The Martian never feels overlong or boring, thanks to snappy editing and a tight script  The soundtrack is selective and fun<br/><br/>Things that don't work:  The CGI; the VFX looks a few years behind in design  The final action sequence; the movie loses some of its scientific credibility in the final moments  It's standard Hollywood formula and it doesn't really break the mold in any way<br/><br/>The Martian might suffer a little from emotional depth and its conventional structure, but the movie is extremely entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat even if you know what to expect. It is a fun Hollywood blockbuster full in its development, and it's a great comeback for director Ridley Scott. I highly recommend catching this one on the big screen before it's gone; the screen on your laptop won't do it justice."

","Ridley Scott's latest thrilling sci-fi blockbuster ""The Martian"", blew the box office away, But did the film live up to the long-awaited expectations?<br/><br/>""The Martian"" was based upon a self-published bestselling novel by Andy Weir. And, unlike most movies adapted from books, ""The Martian"" mostly stuck to it's original material. <br/><br/>Matt Damon stars as Mark Watney, an astronaut/botanist with a huge sense of humour which proves to be his greatest strength, stranded by himself on the vast rocky planet Mars. You watch in awe as he fights against all odds to survive the harsh environments of the red planet. He (Matt Damon) portrayed the role very well, which struck a lot of people, including myself, by surprise. As the film rolls foreword, the audience becomes attached to the character and you'll find yourself sitting at the end of your chair, rooting for him to solve each problem he must face. The side characters (scientists, crew mates) were played wonderfully, each one speaking with a hint of dazzle in there voices or body language that makes their characters unique.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully filmed, the rocky landscapes are shot from unique angles and the cinematography was spectacular. The soundtrack was odd, but kept the film upbeat. The dialogue was filled humour, which makes a slight chuckle wash over the theater, making film much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, if you plan on seeing this movie in 3D, save your money and don't. There were hardly any great 3D effects. The story was also predictable and a bit corny at the end, and at some points the film seemed unrealistic.<br/><br/>Overall, ""the Martian"" is a thrilling, beautiful journey about survival, willpower, perseverance, and hope. With humorous dialogue and believable characters, ""the Martian"" is an amazing science-fiction thrill-ride you do not want to miss out on.<br/><br/>My overall rating: 8.6 / 10.0<br/><br/>-Jacob McDonald<br/><br/>By the way, this was my first review, so I hope you liked it."
"Screen_Blitz","9","4","10","12 October 2015"," Amazing, visually stunning gift from Ridley Scott
","From director Ridley Scott, the amazing visionary behind the sci-fi classics such as Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), and Promtheus (2012), comes any visual stunning science fiction survival flick with splendid visuals and superb storytelling. Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney whose team is sent on a mission to Mars. The mission goes terribly wrong when an intense dust storm hits and Watney is hit with debris and presumed dead by his team. Before too long, Watney wakes up and reveals to be alive, but is now stranded alone on a deserted planet . Watney must put his skills and intelligence to the test in order to survive, while NASA and his team work together to rescue him and bring him back home. This involves planting crops with Mars soil to grow a yearly supply of food. This film features the talented cast of Jessica Chastain, Kristin Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br/><br/>Upon seeing the trailer, I was quite excited for this movie. This is the best science-fiction I've seen since last year's Interstellar. This film runs for two hours and 21 minutes, but Ridley Scott always keeps it captivating from start to finish. There is very rarely a dull moment if any. Matt Damon's character Mark Watney manages to reduce the intense atmosphere with his optimistic and sarcastic attitude, spitting out hilarious one-liners here and there. In the trailer, he presented some of the most clever one-liners such as ""I'm gonna need to science the s**t out of this"" and ""In your face Neil Armstrong"", probably some of the best lines I've heard in a long time. So the film carries a comedic undertone to it in the amidst of the seriousness. The supporting characters have their witty moments of hilarity as well. The performances by Damon and the rest of the cast were pretty solid and deserve big thumbs up.<br/><br/>The visual effects and cinematography are the biggest attention grabbers here. With Wadi Rum Valley in Jordan serving as a backdrop of Mars, audience are treated with the most realistic depiction of Mars ever shown in cinema. With the red-tinted saturation and lighting, it gives them the look like the film is actually shot in The scenes set in outer space are quite eye-popping. Another delightful aspect is the storytelling. Unlike most sci-fi films where there is a frequent sense of urgency, this film carries a very hopeful tone and the characters remain optimistic about their goals to save the main character after he gets stranded on a planet where no life exists (yet!). While it may disappoint some due to the lack of surprise elements, it stays very human-like and engrossing to where it keep the audience glued to their seats.<br/><br/>The Martian is a must-see for all sci-fi fans, and perhaps everyone else. Matt Damon is amazing in this and the story never disappoints. I believe this film has some Oscars on the way for Best Visual Effects and Best Cinematopgraphy (possibly Best Sound editing). Have a theater near you? Go see this!"
"Benkenobi510","7","4","10","12 October 2015"," The Martian
","Ridley Scott is one of the greatest directors of his generation, often elevating a bland script to something far better if it were in the hands of a lesser filmmaker. While this is Scott's best film since Kingdom of Heaven, it is severely flawed none-the-less. <br/><br/>The true highlight of the film is the visual aesthetic. Mars looks great and remarkably not like the Jordan desert, where it was filmed. But it's not the David Lean-esque look of mars which is the most impressive, it's the scenes down on earth which are more majestic. Any director can make Mars look cinematic, but the harder task is to make a group of people talking in a room look cinematic. And Scott succeeds at this immensely. Each scene is staged in a unique way, which is interesting to look at. You understand the relationships and thoughts of the characters simply by the way the camera is positioned. <br/><br/>The performances are also good. Regular comedy performers Kristen Wiig and Jeff Daniels give wonderfully restrained performances and Matt Damon grabs your attention simply by planting potatoes. No one truly stood out though as an attention grabber which is nice to see, but ultimately unrewarding and sometimes bland. <br/><br/>The screenplay is honestly dull. While there is a good amount of humour added, the majority of it is complex science jargon which is engaging to listen to and hard to understand or care for. The number one priority for a screenwriter is to humanize the characters. The science exposition gets in the way for that to happen so there aren't that many characters you can relate to. The film never truly gets deep with it's struggle to get Mark Watney back home, probably because it is painfully obvious that he will. <br/><br/>The Martian is not a bad film but sometimes you think it could have been better, had the screenplay been better. Despite that, it is refreshing to see a sci-fi film that doesn't have the mind-boggling pretentiousness of something like 'Interstellar'."
"DanielRobertRoss","9","4","10","11 October 2015"," Ridley Scott's best film in years
","I've been a huge fan of Ridley Scott's for years, counting Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, and American Gangster as some of my favorite films. But after the disappointing Robin Hood, Prometheus and Exodus I was hoping for a return to form. So his latest film comes as a welcome surprise, mostly because it doesn't come with the baggage of expectation like Prometheus. It is easily Ridley Scott's best film since American Gangster. Unlike recent space adventures, the film keeps the melodrama to a minimum, which was welcome, because so many films of this genre start out promising but eventually devolve into episodic ""How do we fix this problem?"". As usual, Scott's visual style is breathtaking, the effects are amazing and the acting is excellent. Highly recommended."
"tiinamalm","8","4","10","11 October 2015"," A positive movie but forget about science
","I liked the movie, much more than Prometheus or Interstellar. A big fan of Ridley Scott, I would possibly watch anything directed by him. And the pluses are for this movie: a lot of humor, which you have seldom seen in latest sci-fi movies. Also, the very active and strong character played well by Matt Damon (I really liked him) was a plus.<br/><br/>However, if only some ground rules of biology were present: as a Scandinavian, many of us still grow our own potatoes, at least find out how to grow them: they are certainly not cut in half and just placed in soil. As well, after several hundred days of non-gravity (space) or low gravity (Mars) and all the cosmic radiation, people will have substantial loss of muscle and bone tissue and probably will not be able to conceive any more, rather develop carcinomas. This really could have been brought up in the end of this film or at least as an ethical issue at the part where the mother ship people decide to spend 900 days in space. I don't care if the original book did not mention it,this should be common knowledge by now. OK, maybe it would not have suited the script but movies really could do more for science."

"andersonarnold","4","11","40","4 October 2015"," A Space movie, not an adaptation of the book
","I read the book, ""The Martian"" by Andy Weir and so hoped the movie would be good or at least interesting. The scenery in the movie was great, and the film covered the large concepts of the book. But overall it was lacking. The movie overlooked large segments of the book, especially some of the more emotional pieces, like the conversation between Johnson and her father right before the resupply is sent up. The chemical resin, that saved Mark's life countless times in the book, was absent. Scenes where Mark has to struggle to survive and does some daring escapes were left out of the film. Also, he doesn't walk right out of the airlock, he has to find a way to get the airlock to the Hab.<br/><br/>The humor was also lacking, the Watney character was much funnier in the book.<br/><br/>The book contained science, math calculations, fully explained concepts and ideas. The book explained how to create the ideal conditions to grow potatoes. There was a lengthy process of preparing the soil in the book - the movie just showed him planting potatoes. Frankly, the movie was a dumbed down version of the book.<br/><br/>Then there is that annoying 'artistic freedom' that directors use. In this case they kept communication between Watney and NASA open and functioning normally. They added a Iron Man like scene in the end and they made the secret meetings between the higher ups - not secret. The emotion the crew feels as they extend their journey is absent, partly because the film doesn't show any issues with Hermes malfunctioning on its extended journey.<br/><br/>For a movie about space it's not bad, but for an adaptation of the book, it's lacking."

","The Martian quickly begins with the crew aborting their mission and abandoning Mark Watney after being hit by a debris during a storm on Mars, presuming he was dead. And for this impression, this introduction seems sort of contrived, but this film happens to be one of those that gets better and better. As we see this lone astronaut stand up and try to grow plants on this lifeless planet. Everything comes to life when it's just scrutinizing the protagonist's survival on Mars and NASA's rescue mission for him with a delightful dose of science and humor. People might be bragging for more atmosphere of oblivion around this environment, but apparently, it's actually not needed. The upbeat tone of the film is a terrific choice. Not everything has to be a tragedy, The Martian aims to make science look fun and it triumphs from top to bottom.<br/><br/>Survival films like this tend to be about self-discovery, life regrets or other personal ordeals, but how this astronaut deals with his own situation is applying his skills; which is botany. So he strategically find ways to grow plants out of potatoes which were stored in their base for food, by collecting soil and fertilizer, even producing water out of chemistry. It's gripping stuff. But the science doesn't stop there; the plot shifts to NASA finding out Watney is still alive and trying to gain contact to rescue him. This rescue plan also consists plenty of scientific strategies; you still won't find any villain in this point, either. Because they're facing the same conflict as the stranded astronaut, which is the probability of failing, even if they carefully planned their ideas. Because every experiment could go wrong, even in something as simple as planting potatoes in a foreign planet.<br/><br/>While much of it is discussing their plans and studies, the movie never becomes boring, mostly because it establishes its own personality; especially with its main character. Maybe if the movie is only about Mark Watney surviving on Mars, it would still be a pretty good film, because this character is given a real down-to-earth charisma and Matt Damon justifies all of it. Even when he is just talking for his log explaining his experiments or just driving a rover, it's already a quite entertaining movie to sit through. But having the full story is just equally as important as the Mars alone, because even outside the planet, the other characters are also given enough humor and witty dialogue to make their scientific explanations entertaining to watch. The supporting cast is filled with excellent talents as well that definitely helped making their every moment quite engrossing as Damon's.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie doesn't lack impressive visuals, and this merit now comes from Ridley Scott's direction. We've come across with some ambitious space movies in the last two years; either it showcases amazing CGI or amazing practical craftsmanship, but here, those technical methods don't matter. It could be just balance. The simple exterior of Mars already looks impressive in detail, even the scenes in space where how it breathtakingly shoots the interior of the spaceship, it creates an exciting scale of adventure with these angles. There's many to be dazzled here visually, even without acting like an ambitious technical magnum opus. The direction also sharply displays their practicalities which makes every detail easy to comprehend from the fast pace. And the chaotic results of their plan can either be depicted with realism or just a thrilling ride.<br/><br/>The Martian's straightforwardness is what made it utterly interesting and supremely entertaining. There is no personal life dilemmas involved in the Mars scenes or any cynical commentary at the NASA side. They're all seeking for the same goal, facing the same problem; they just want the crew to come home. And this doesn't need anything more than their knowledge. Some people might be looking for any sense of humanity in this realm of scientific jargon, and luckily, this movie has plenty of it: isn't Watney's determination of surviving enough? Or his constant sense of humor? How about his loyalty to his crew or everyone's longing of having them return to Earth and reunite with their loved ones; even if the latter is only briefly explained, it's already crystal clear, even without putting up any inspiring monologues or pickup lines. How these characters do their work is already uplifting, anyway. And of course, the soundtrack! Everything else, it's just human beings dealing with nature and time outside their own atmosphere. Their deliberately scrutinized plans are fifty-fifty in this cruel world. It's everything you would ask for in a smart Sci-Fi movie. Its flavor just made it more exciting."

The director had the Mars landscape, night sky at his disposal, but failed to exploit it.<br/><br/>The bad : The screenplay failed to capture the books brilliant portrayal of science and the tension it created in its reader. Matt Damon would literally spell out what the next 10 minutes of scenes would be , this happened every 15 minutes. Thus taking out the element of surprise. A good movie keeps the viewer guessing and feeds information slowly in bits and pieces, leaving the audience to solve the mystery. This was too predictable. The sound editing wasn't great either.<br/><br/>I would put this in the league of movies like - Day after tomorrow, 2012..<br/><br/>I'm a big Ridley Scott fan, that's why this was a big disappointment.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched the movie, get the book first. If you Still watch it after reading this, then at least you won't feel that bad as your expectations will be low. You might just be amazed after all."

After being told, his original mission colleagues led by commanding officer Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) are more than ready and able to join in the rescue watched around the world.<br/><br/>This film is held together with a soundtrack a bit better than astronaut Watney prefers.

However, the most questionable thing is how Nasa handles the situation. The first contact they have with Mark is broad casted live to the public, really? Nasa's engineers can't come up with any way to rescue him before a flimsy young guy explains it with a stapler, really?

","This movie can be summed up with Disney goes to Mars, or something along those lines. The visuals were great, as was the exciting intro where Watney becomes stranded. It simply falls apart after. You have Watney, who miraculously survives decompression in his suit from an antenna going through him, and carries out the rest of the film essentially enjoying himself. Think of this, you go to Mars, there is bugger all there and you are left there. Would you think to yourself ""Cool! Just gotta colonize this planet with the complete lack of resources.""? I'm quite certain most would freak out being lost in a forest here on Earth, but here is this astronaut just walking around, enjoying himself, knowing exactly what to do. Even when things go bad and he loses his crops, he's relatively fine. Even Watney escapes with little difficultly (yet when a rocket is sent from earth with less planning than needed, it blows up). This all suggests that such a situation would be a walk in the park, from survival, to escape. It's all like a Disney cartoon, where no one dies, and the story ends happily ever after. There is no notion of helplessness, fear, and the aura of the emptiness of Mars or space. These concepts are much better in Gravity, and even in Interstellar, even though Interstellar abandons realism. Not sure what Ridley Scott is thinking as he is getting older, but even the far fetched Alien films bestow more emotion and plot to the viewer."

","While I appreciate the need to condense all the material found in the book into a 130-minute film, I feel that too much has been left out to the effect that much of the badassery of Mark Watney has been lost. <br/><br/>Important details that highlight Watney's genius, defiance and more importantly autonomy as the sole occupant of Mars should have been kept intact. The ways in which he's encountered and eventually cheated death should have been preserved, or even headlined. Also, we should not forget moments where Mark cherishes and celebrates the simplest things in life (e.g. a good night's sleep). <br/><br/>Examples: <br/><br/>Airlock 1 ripping and the aftermath (i.e. tumbling the Airlock to within walking range of the Hab); The impact of communications - killing the Pathfinder which should have rendered him completely helpless; The modifications to the rover (including trailer, bedroom), and his eventual emotional attachment to it; The entire drive towards Ares 4, including the sandstorm/air days/rover+trailer tumbling - culminating in the discovery of the MAV that should have been a dramatic revelation. <br/><br/>That being said, the film does well in shortening various sequences effectively (potato farming, burning water), and Matt Damon does put up a commendable effort, showing great range of emotions, somewhat let down only by the overall bland tone of the film. In contrast, the book portrays a much darker/grimmer outlook, and a more engaging backdrop, which again highlights the protagonist's resourcefulness, resilience and most importantly, humanity. <br/><br/>Did not care too much for the Ironman heroics nor the epilogue.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a decent film that lacks the impact and suspense that the book excels at building."

"maurice_yacowar","8","3","7","7 December 2015"," Abandoned astronaut rescued from Mars
","The Martian centers on a triangulation. <br/><br/>One point is the vastness of the cosmos. Hence the astronomical distances and calculations and the recurring shot of Mark Watney (Matt Damon) as a minuscule dot moving across the red landscape of Mars. <br/><br/>The other immensity is the astonishing achievement of human technology. This works on two levels: (i) the science demonstrated in the mechanics of space travel and communication and (ii) the equally impressive scientific effects in the composition of the film itself. Cinema as well as science is celebrated in the film's dramatic visuals. When Martinez jokes that Mark is ""just a botanist, not a real scientist,"" the gag makes all of science an index of mankind's achievement. Of course, it's Watney's savvy as a botanist that enables him to grow potatoes in his own excrement on Mars and thus to survive. Botany is the science of earth, here the balance against the science of space. <br/><br/>The third pole, in tension with these two immensities, is the worth of the individual human life. However impressive the realization of space travel and man's new technology, the film's essential value is one person's life. The team members vote unanimously to risk their own lives to save their colleague. In the rescue's climax two space-suited bodies float through space, clinging to a slender sash until they can clutch each other. <br/><br/>That teamwork extends outward to the national community — when all America (i.e., CNN and Times Square) gathers to root for Watney's rescue — and internationally, when China volunteers its advanced propulsion system to save him. For the latter to happen, humanity has to transcend politics. Both countries' scientists have to do an end run around their respective governments. <br/><br/>In the more conventional version of teamwork, two of the astronauts end up marrying and having a baby. All the examples of connection, teamwork, community, are based on the value of the individual life, which should — but does not always, or even often, OK, maybe ever — transcend considerations of the collective. Fiction reminds us what we should make our reality. <br/><br/>The film draws on earlier fiction forms as well. Watney's ingenuity recalls Robinson Crusoe and the Tom Hanks and Spalding affair. Pillaging the unclaimed seas, Watney styles himself Blondbeard the Pirate. The individual life is what traditional fiction has celebrated and it remains the primary value even amid the impressiveness of ultramodern science and the newly fathomed reaches of the universe. Watney recites his log as a reminder that all the splendours we're seeing are at least balanced and usually trumped by the value of the individual consciousness."

It almost behaves like a documentary at times as their are parts where Mark talks to the camera giving the status of his situation. We also see all the drama in Washington, DC with NASA officials trying to bring Mark back home. The acting is good. Damon is really good in the role and it's really not easy to imagine anyone else in his place. The story is great.

","The Martian is simply put, a phenomenal film. The story follows Matt Damon as astronaut Mark Watney, who while during a violent dust storm on a mission to Mars, gets separated from his crew on the way to their ship. They believe him to be dead and leave him on Mars as they return home to Earth. Now stranded, Watney has to find a way to survive till he can contact NASA and coordinate a return home. You might think I just spoiled the whole movie for you, but this is literally the first 5-10 minutes! Now, I wouldn't blame anyone thinking that a movie like this might be a downer, but it is not. The Martian is a movie that balances all of the intensity of the situation with humor and heart. Matt Damon's performance is comforting even when things get rough and the character personalities are all so great from every actor involved, that you care what happens. In short, The Martian is a movie about the triumph of the human spirit (I know, a cliché), and the ability of the human spirit to problem solve in order to survive.<br/><br/>I give The Martian a 10 out of 10!"

","It seems in recent years that there is maybe one really good sci-fi epic each year. 2012 was Prometheus; 2013 had Gravity; last year saw Interstellar; and this year has The Martian. Each movie has their own distinct style and can be enjoyed for different reasons. Of the four, The Martian is probably the most light-hearted and fun to watch, but don't let my words fool you. There are some insanely intense scenes to be found here. Based on the novel of the same name, The Martian is about astronaut Mark Watney who is presumed dead after a violent storm and left behind by the crew. He actually lives and must survive on Mars for months with meager supplies and his own ingenuity. Ridley Scott directed this film, and he was desperately in need of a success after the financial and commercial disappointments of Exodus: Gods and Kings and The Counsler. Luckily, he delivers one of his most spectacular movies to date that's capable of making you laugh and putting you on the edge of your seat. The final act of the film is particularly nail-biting, drawing comparisons to some of Gravity's most terrifying scenes. But what makes The Martian such a hit is its heart. Besides its great humor and amazing characters, it emphasizes the value and integrity of the human spirit. It may not go into the more philosophical implications of those themes too much, but when a movie is this well crafted, that hardly matters. The Martian is up there with the other great sci-fi epics of recent years, and it's certainly one of the best films of the year."

It wasn't even ""gallows humor"" more like ""trying to appeal to the mainstream"" humor. Oh well, not like it was a bad film, it just wasn't up to par for Matt Damon.

","""I admit it's fatally dangerous, but I'd get to fly around like Iron Man."" Mark Watney (Matt Damon)<br/><br/>The above quote encapsulates the qualities of The Martian that allow it to be spoken about in the same breath as Arthur C. Clarke's 2001. Not only is Ridley Scott's sci-fi adventure filled with humor and pop cult (wait till you hear Gloria Gaynor's ""I will Survive""), but it also has enough smart but accessible science to please the geekiest fan.<br/><br/>In other words, in some respects it trumps the great sci-fi icon by overcoming the cold Hal as a bad-guy computer and creating space as the formidable opponent: ""This is space. It does not cooperate."" (Watney) <br/><br/>Gone are Scott's desolate landscapes of decaying cities and dripping monsters-- it's an entertaining and uplifting film that exalts human ingenuity and the need to be humane. Mars is merely a dry, rock and sand stage for mankind to do its scientific and cooperative best stuff. And it serves to remind the world of the necessity to adventure despite the danger: ""Every time something goes wrong, the world forgets why we fly."" Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels)<br/><br/>That the world is engrossed in the drama of bringing back stranded astronaut Watney from Mars is a testimony to the need for human connection to its great enterprises and the glory of team effort both on the ground (even China gets to play) and in space. Scott's achievement that goes himself one better from Blade Runner and Alien is depicting the inherent drama in people working together for a common goal, ready to make the sacrifices so that mankind can survive.<br/><br/>Watney's formula for survival:<br/><br/>""You just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next. And if you solve enough problems, you get to come home."""
"tomimt","7","3","7","22 October 2015"," A tale of survivalist
","I have an idea of why the Martian has been so successful at the box office. It's not because it's a remarkable movie, but because of the times we live in. See, the Martian is a success story. It's a story about a man who is placed against insurmountable challenges, which he beats. It's a story of how other people are doing their best to safe the man in trouble as well, going as far as showing how other nations, which might normally have cold relations, are willing to help each other in order to safe one of us in need. Simply put, the Martian makes it easier to feel good about humanity and the state of the world, while in the real life we life in a world where we are not threatened only by political unrest, but terrorism and continuously freezing relations of modern superpowers. What I want to say is, that the Martian stands out for its own benefit from among the movies that try to be more grim and bleak.<br/><br/>So let's tackle the basics. The Martian tells a story of how an astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left stranded on Mars after a hasty evacuation the Mars team has to make due to a storm. Believing that Mark is dead the rest of the crew blasts off, only for Mark to wake up to find that he's now the only human in Mars, with very limited means of making a contact back to NASA or his crew mates. But with some scientific ingenuity he doesn't only manage to solve his food problems, but also establish a new contact to Earth. The Martian is not a complex story. It's a kind of a take on Robinson Crusoe, but with people knowing where they can contact him, while planning his rescue.<br/><br/>As the Martian is directed by Ridley Scott, it's also technically well made. The plot, while simple, works well under the steady direction of Scott and as usual his style looks very nice and the actors perform well. So all around it's just as steady of a movie you'd expect a director of Scott's caliber to do.<br/><br/>So that's the Martian. It's a feel good movie and that's pretty much it. It's probably not a contender in the category of future classics, but it is a nice movie none the less."
"davidgee","8","3","7","22 October 2015"," Robinson Crusoe on Mars
","The plot of THE MARTIAN, unlike SPECTRE's, is not a closely guarded secret. We know the storyline: space botanist Matt Damon is left for dead on Mars when his fellow astronauts evacuate during a vicious storm. But Matt's not dead. Will he survive? Will they they rescue him?<br/><br/>You kind of know the answer to these key questions, so director Ridley Scott has to work extra hard to generate suspense. Matt's survival skills are given some stringent challenges, and a lot can (and does) go wrong with the rescue mission. Damon's powerful screen presence manages to hold our interest during the Robinson Crusoe parts of the story - even better, I would say, than Tom Hanks in CASTAWAY, one of the many films that are unavoidably echoed here (GRAVITY being the most obvious).<br/><br/>Despite all the CGI I found Ridley Scott's Mars less visually enthralling than Paul Verhoeven's in the original TOTAL RECALL; it looks like (which it is) a rose-tinted version of the Jordan valleys where LAWRENCE OF ARABIA was filmed. The space scenes are awesome and possess some of the pure magic of Kubrick's 2001. Hugely enjoyable as THE MARTIAN is, it's one of those movies that you realise afterwards reminded you of other fine movies. GLADIATOR's magnificence dims when you take note of how much it borrowed from BEN HUR. ALIEN wasn't actually all that original, but what a great movie it still is whenever you remember it! (PROMETHEUS was epic but disappointing somehow.) THE MARTIAN is a good movie, even a very good movie, but it falls short of being a great movie."

","In 1979, Ridley Scott made the quintessential space film with Alien, and he hasn't topped it since, though he ventured back into space earlier this decade with the intriguing prequel Prometheus. It didn't scratch that itch. Just 3 short years later, that itch is now thoroughly scratched with The Martian. Uninterested in indulging in mysteries, The Martian is focused on a series of compelling obstacles and just as fascinating solutions. It's much more of a procedural picture than conventional sci-fi, more in line with Apollo 13 than Gravity. Despite its length, the pacing never dulls. It's not too far from the derided The Counselor in tone, but this benefits from a more lightweight approach. <br/><br/>Sometimes we'll leave a set of characters for a long time, the film just trusts that we can imagine what they're thinking and feeling and it results in a much fuller picture. This is clean and refreshing filmmaking. It utilises some very American themes of redemption and the idea that everyone can be saved and it's wonderfully cathartic. It's rock and roll science with sharp wit and and sharper brains. Matt Damon gives one of the best performances of his career bringing effortless gravitas where it may have otherwise been neglected along with an easy- going sense of humour. The quality of the production itself is stellar, thriving on having few locations to deal with. The Martian is far better than I expected, and maybe Scott's best since Blade Runner.<br/><br/>8/10"

The five most recent sagas about Mars—""Mission to Mars"" (2000), ""Red Planet"" (2000), ""Doom"" (2005), ""John Carter"" (2012), and The Last Days on Mars (2013)—failed to recoup their budgets. Among the notable films about Mars that most moviegoers may remember are the four-minute silent film ""A Trip to Mars"" (1910), the Soviet silent epic ""Aelita"" (1924), ""Flight to Mars"" (1951), ""Conquest of Space"" (1955), ""The Angry Red Planet"" (1956), ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"" (1957), ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1962), ""Total Recall"" (1990) and its' remake ""Total Recall"" (2012). ""Mission to Mars"" surpassed ""Red Planet"" while ""John Carter"" wasn't abominably bad. Halloween"" helmer John Carpenter has probably made one of the least compelling pulp movies about Mars entitled ""Ghosts of Mars."" Happily, the latest movie about Mars appropriately entitled ""The Martian"" ranks as probably the best movie ever made about the fourth rock from the sun. Apart from its unwieldy 141 minutes that starts to drag about three-fourths of the way through, ""The Martian"" is a believable sci-fi film. Anybody who has read Andrew Weir's bestseller will be pleased with director Ridley Scott's largely faithful adaptation penned by Drew Goddard who wrote the abysmal ""Cloverfield"" but the brilliant ""The Cabin in the Woods."" Ostensibly, Scott and Goddard only saw fit to omit two major complications from Weir's fascinating first novel: the short-circuit drill scene when our hero is modifying the second Rover and the tumbling Rover scene on the journey to the Schiaparelli crater. The predominantly first-person narrated novel contains more of astronaut Mark Watney's acerbic, R-rated personality than the PG-13 film could afford. For example, read the first sentence in ""The Martian."" If either it or subsequent sentences with the F-word don't offend you, you can probably make it through this entertaining book rather rapidly.<br/><br/>When a devastating Martian sandstorm threatens NASA's Ares III manned mission, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain of ""Interstellar"") orders the six-person crew to abandon their work and lift off for their ship, the Hermes, in orbit around the red planet. During their hasty evacuation, one of the astronauts, botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon of ""Interstellar""), is separated from the crew. Actually, he is struck by an antenna on a communication dish that skewers him in the stomach and knocks him unconscious. Lewis struggles without success to find Watney in the blinding sandstorm. Meanwhile, the sandstorm grows even more treacherous, and Lewis gives up her search because the high winds are tilting the ship that will launch the crew into orbit. Basically, the crew of the Ares III leaves Mark behind to save itself. NASA Chief Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels of ""My Favorite Martian"") reports the news of Watney's demise, and a funeral is held for him. What nobody knows at the time is that Watney is still alive. After he extracts the spear of the antenna from his stomach, Watney embarks on an ambitious scheme to keep himself alive for the next four years until Ares IV arrives. A major part of Watney's plan to keep from starving involves the planting of potatoes inside the mission's artificial habitat. Eventually, one of NASA's employees, Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis of ""That Awkward Moment""), who monitors the satellites around Mars, spots something suspicious in the photos of the Ares III mission site. She alerts Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor of ""American Gangster"") about these curious occurrences. Everybody is suddenly elated when they discover that Watney managed to survive the savage sandstorm. Sanders brainstorms and convenes various NASA experts to work on a rescue plan for Watney, but NASA has no way of contacting our tenacious hero. At the same time, Watney behaves like the ingenious television character MacGuyer. He improvises a way to communicate with NASA that involves cruising in the Mars rover off to the distant site of the Mars Pathfinder probe. Meanwhile, Sanders refuses to notify the Hermes crew because he fears the revelation of Watney's survival may imperil the mission. Initially, NASA crew supervisor Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean of ""GoldenEye"") and JPL director Bruce Ng (Benedict Wong of ""Prometheus"") launch a space probe to resupply Watney until the Ares IV mission gets off the ground. The probe blows up not long after launch. If this were not bad enough for Watney, the habitat where he is raising his potato plants explodes when the airlock decompresses. Naturally, nothing goes right for either Watney or NASA, but salvation comes from the least expected place.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner"" director Ridley Scott keeps things compelling throughout most of ""The Martian"" as Watney and NASA encounter one invincible setback after another. Indeed, ""The Martian"" surpasses the similarly-themed Sandra Bullock & George Clooney outer space epic ""Gravity"" because the story is related from a number of different perspectives. While Watney is struggling to survive on Mars, Sanders is under incredible pressure to concoct a foolproof plan to rescue him. Every plan that he comes up with requires his team to work so quickly that they cannot take their usual precautions. ""The Martian"" shifts back and forth between Watney and the various NASA officials working around the clock to save him. Eventually, Sanders allows Henderson to inform the Hermes crew about Watney's survival. Production values are generally stellar and nothing appears to have been spared. The craggy scenery of Jordan substitutes persuasively for the inhospitable Martian terrain. The part of the action transpires within the massive Hermes spaceship, and the five person crew weigh in on Watney's fate. Happily, ""The Martian"" isn't a dry, straightforward, documentary style sci-fi thriller. Although he doesn't appear on screen every minute, Matt Damon dominates ""The Martian"" and Watney's irreverent sense of humor. The inspirational finale when Watney decides to imitate Iron Man is amusing. Not only did NASA embrace author Andrew Weir, but the space agency also reportedly cooperated with Ridley Scott more than it had on previous movies to ensure accuracy. Altogether, ""The Martian"" qualifies as a gripping intergalactic spectacle."
"rich-fuller06","8","3","7","13 October 2015"," It's a good movie, but it's a great book.
","(Very minor comparisons to the book- no direct reference to scenes)<br/><br/>I recently read 'The Martian'. It's a book I had wanted to pick up for a long time and when I saw the film was soon to arrive, in the usually capable hands of Ridley Scott and Matt Damon, it seemed like the perfect time to pick it up.<br/><br/>I'll start by saying the book is incredible, and quite possibly the best book I've read in years. Once you pick it up it's impossible to put back down and I was finished in a couple of days.<br/><br/>The detail that Andy Weir goes into in describing the surroundings and Mark Watney's predicament are so detailed it makes for a compelling read.<br/><br/>What makes the book strong eventually becomes the film's downfall. There is just too much in the book to include in a film. As a result a lot of detail is chopped to keep the film from becoming too complicated...and it's already running at 2hours 20minutes.<br/><br/>Changes have been made to the original story, for what can only be deemed 'Hollywood reasons' although whilst creating a slight frown on the face of anyone who has read the book, doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>I am sure there is a Ridley cut of this film out there which will run to over 3 hours and no doubt cover off some of my gripes.<br/><br/>All in all, if you want to see this film, read the book first."
"winnychapel","7","3","7","12 October 2015"," This is basically a modern version of Apollo 13 for a broader audience
","The setup is a little bit different (stranded on mars instead of drifting in space) but the plot is basically the same. Staying productive / positive facing fearful odds. Matt D. character seems to be partly based on Professor Randy Pausch (The last lecture - google it!). His jokes, his almost naive stay positive attitude and the few scenes where you can see his fear overcoming him, make him somewhat boring to me, but this a personal taste thing. This movie has nothing you haven't seen before, but it is a nice blend of working concepts. You will forget this movie in a few month or even a few weeks, but you will enjoy watching this movie never the less."
"patsworld","9","3","7","11 October 2015"," Well Worth Watching
","Wasn't sure I wanted to see The Martian all that much, but after viewing it, was glad I did. There was not the horrid sense of doom and gloom I had anticipated, in fact, there was hope, humor, suspense, and for me, although gripping, the occasional feeling of being so isolated, so alone that it was momentarily stunning. This is a good movie to show the ingenuity of man when the chips are down, for those of us positive people, the proof that we can, indeed, do whatever it takes to survive when called on to do so. Matt Damon, as the left behind for dead astronaut, was wonderful in this role, portraying fear, despair, humor, hope, determinationall of the emotions the role demanded. And in 3-D, the view of the heavens was spectacular as was the feeling of being one person so alone on such a large, stark, basically unfriendly planet. I do recommend this film as one to see that will leave you feeling secure that there are people – not merely MacGyver– for those who remember the I-can-do-it-all-with-only-a-paper-clip-and-a-rubber-band kind of guy that was on TV years ago – out there. To imagine that our astronauts are so able leaves the audience feeling good about the program and the people involved. And in this case, with world cooperation when needed. It's solid entertainment."
"GeorgeRoots","8","3","7","7 October 2015"," Not Destined To Be One Of His Best, But Another Strong Movie From Sir Ridley Scott And Matt Damon.
","Ah ""The Martian"", you kind of crept up on me. The last big must sees for the end of the year is the next James Bond feature ""Spectre"", and of course a return to the great long running space opera ""Star Wars Episode 7"". It's been kind of nice just to have the first trailer peak my interest enough to go see it, and now all I want to do is read the book and see any differences between them. Upon leaving the theatre a few reactions I heard from the audience were ""On the edge of my seat, but way too technical for me to understand it"". Really? I am in no means a scientist at all and have no deep knowledge on NASA protocols, but I feel Drew Goddard's script did justice in simplifying it well enough therefore keeping it fairly smarter than the average blockbuster overall. <br/><br/>Matt Damon stars as an astronaut who in a sand storm is presumed dead and left behind on Mars, and then has to fight to survive on a planet where nothing grows (Luckily he's a botanist). What proceeds is a fun 2 and a half hours of you either die or just get on with it, and luckily everyone in the movie has something to get on with. Even though there really is quite the ensemble cast Damon's character and scenario is the only stuff I really cared for, so much so his positivity is sickening (In a good way). Just to say we've seen Matt surprisingly pop up in many space movies recently such as Neill Blomkamp's ""Elysium"" (2013), and Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" (2014). All have been visually stunning and again it has been nice to have him in a strong lead role again.<br/><br/>If anything I was particularly overwhelmed at the production quality and just how well Mars had been portrayed. Apparently Wadi Rum in Jordan has been used in many movies set on Mars, and the fact that Ridley Scott used only 20 sets and filmed it all in just 70 days just shows how effortlessly the man still produces great quality movies after making so many. Other than that, the space suits had a bit of ""Prometheus"" (2012) nostalgia to me, and the music by composer Harry Gregson-Williams (Known mostly for the Metal Gear Solid video game series) led itself to many great moments of character reflections that didn't include famous disco hits (Not that I think anyone will complain).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Just to extend the review out a little longer, it is nice to see some of these movies are somewhat encouraging peoples interest in NASA again, especially since the recent discovery of water on Mars has led to the debate of some real exploration going on. I enjoyed the movie a lot, but I'll possibly find the movie harder again to watch a second time. The stuff on earth is nowhere near as appealing as the stuff happening on Mars, and Matt Damon's character is so infinitely resourceful I found no real conflict in the scenarios as he has this infectious ""MacGyver"" can do attitude. Maybe the film would have benefited with a little more desperation or isolation I don't know, but I'm sure in the future it will enjoy a ""Silent Running"" (1972) level of cult classic. If you care for a level of real science with your entertainment it's certainly more than worth your time. 8/10."
"ryan-fotheringham","9","24","109","27 September 2015"," Here's the rub: this is one of the most enjoyable films of 2015.
","Ridley Scott is truly back to form with this fun, intellectual, charming, well-constructed picture. Admittedly I advent read the book so this review will, unlike others, be of the movie as opposed to an essay on how it contradicts the book or isn't faithful to the source material or whatever. <br/><br/>Matt Damon brings the perfect blend of charm and emotion to this unique character. It's hard to imagine how any human would react in the situation our protagonist Mark Watney is put in - being stranded on a deserted planet 140 million miles away - yet he is able to put in a performance which is heartfelt at times and emotionally driven yet enjoyable and entertaining to observe. The support cast for this flick encompasses overkill in the best way possible. Daniels, Wiig, Ejifor, Bean, Glover, Chastain, Stan... I've undoubtedly left a supreme acting talent out and how sure I am of this is a testament to how many strong performances assured that the audience's interest, when the story was not focusing on Watney's survival, was not squandered.<br/><br/>The story is what is promised in the trailer. A male astronaut is stranded on Mars after a mission goes awry and the aftermath regarding how, when and why he should be rescued is the backdrop of the film. Switching between how NASA deals with the situation and how Watney is processing his situation, mixed in with excellent pacing due to brilliant editing and directing allows for a dull moment to be nowhere in sight. <br/><br/>Finding a gripe in this film is difficult. It hits all the right notes and it's charm especially is what will surprise and ultimately please the majority of audiences. The occasional slow moment exists but does not bog down the film by any means. I personally have a slight issue with the final scene but all reviews are subjective and it's highly possible that i'm in the minority in thinking this. <br/><br/>The cinematography and visuals are breathtaking. I would highly recommend seeing this film on the biggest screen possible in 3D.<br/><br/>The only thing I can think of being more difficult than NASA actually pulling off a mission such as this would be thinking of someone I couldn't recommend this film to. It ticked all the right boxes and was most definitely one of the most well paced, intellectually stimulating, charming and enjoyable films this year."
"sap_chick","9","13","52","4 October 2015"," The power of great storytelling, and the magic of real science
","When was the last time you knew the ending of a movie, but still found yourself gasping with anticipation, clenching your teeth in fear, and generally being in lock-step emotionally with the main character. Not talking sympathy - feeling for them, but empathy... experiencing the ride along with them? <br/><br/>I can't even remember. But what's more, being a geek myself I was totally thrilled with a movie that treats science not as something magical, but something absolutely pedestrian - something accessible to everyone. Science is a tool that lets humans do amazing things. <br/><br/>By refusing to create fantastical tools or solutions to routine difficult problems, the book The Martian and the movie challenge us to think about the concept of a 'super power' differently. Try to convince me that the ability to make water out of non-liquid elements isn't a super power - it keeps you alive, and makes food grow! How cool is that?<br/><br/>Rated PG-13, I think easily this is a movie that even a 9 year old will appreciate, though of course there's a bit of course language and a bit of blood, but compared to most video games there's nothing to concern yourself with. And the 'brief nudity' mentioned is not going to be a problem for younger children, please trust me.<br/><br/>This is a movie that reminds ALL of us, children and adults, to not just look up from our iPhones and game consoles once in awhile, but to look UP... all the way to the stars, and consider our place in the world, and to marvel at the capacity of humans to not just destroy things, but to MAKE things, too. <br/><br/>I loved Interstellar - but this is fundamentally a more intimate and personal movie, and I cannot recommend any movie more highly. <br/><br/>BTW - skip 3D... it doesn't need it. Sit closer to the screen than you normally do, and that's enough."
"CherryBlossomBoy","2","25","115","1 October 2015"," Leave... Him... There
","Instead of reviewing the film I'm probably about to never see, I'll just discuss a quote from ""Martian"" that I've read in ""Quotes"" section that took me right out of my desire to see it. That makes it a dishonest film review but a very honest voice against politics behind this film.<br/><br/>The quote goes as this: ""Every human being has a basic instinct: to help each other out. If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that it's found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just don't care, but they're massively outnumbered by the people who do."" Spoken by Matt Damon's title character, an astronaut stranded on Mars.<br/><br/>Out of the context of the film, it's horrible enough. It's tendentious and coercive and I feel called upon personally. Helping others is not, and should not be, the World Religion. There are a few people in this world that I do want to help, there are countless others that I don't, not in a million years. I don't mind being called an asshole, but it has to be for the right reasons. Refusing to be an altruist isn't one of them. If helping others is a ""basic instinct"", you know what else is? Killing others! That's right. And I don't do that either. Guess things are not that ""basic"" and I'm not such an asshole after all. Neither are other people who ""don't care"". Minding one's own business has become an extremely underrated discipline.<br/><br/>Besides, while other examples mentioned might hold *some* water, coordinating a help for a lost hiker certainly doesn't, because it's not altruism. It's paid work done by public servants, which makes it no less noble and is in fact greater because the best help you can get is by people who do it for a living. It's a damn shame to see lives of these people risked and resources wasted because of some fool who got himself in a situation way over his head. Which brings me right to the context of the film.<br/><br/>The fool in question is not even in some reachable mountain, he's on bloody Mars! He chose to go there, knowing if things go rough there may be no way out. Things went rough and now he expects to be helped. He expects that people on Earth pull massive resources, that could be diverted to helping other people on Earth, and risk countless lives just to bring some arrogant dick back from where nobody forced him to go in the first place. Just leave the fool there! Let him be an altruist himself and take one for the team!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as I hear, he's brought back by the end of the film, and instead of ridiculed as a fool he becomes celebrated as a hero.<br/><br/>You, dear reader, must feel cheated by me by being handed a political rant while thinking you were reading a film review. Well, you were not - I pretty much announced it in the header, which is more than this film will do for you. You'll go see ""The Martian"" hoping to see a good Sci-Fi flick. I'm sure the cinematography and effects will be great, it's Ridley Scott's after all (and I'm giving it a grade above ""awful"" just for that anticipation). What you will, in fact, be handed is a terribly misplaced celebration of a morally bankrupt leftist philosophy, and be left short of some hard-earned money in the process. When you find yourself stranded in that chair in the middle of the theater, gasping for mercy, don't expect the filmmakers to give you that money back. They're no altruists.<br/><br/>I'm no altruist either, but, aside from now, I'm a pretty honest reviewer. Ridley Scott has been kind of a staple of my reviewing efforts and it appears I've been, in that capacity, chronicling the gradual decline of his merits and ability to choose good projects. Heck, even George Lucas knew when to pack it in."
"FloodClearwater","7","4","11","2 November 2015"," This Martian Feels Off the Trajectory
","Having read Andy Weir's masterful novel of the same name, Ridley Scott's 2015 film adaptation of The Martian was something I anticipated viewing with a certain frisson of excitement. <br/><br/>I watched and re-watched the film several times in a theater before deciding on my view of it. Which is simply this, The Martian is a serviceable and not at all exciting space action or science fiction film. One that boasts a (pardon me) stellar cast marooned (again, please) with a ho hum adapted screenplay and directing that recalls (one more time) the droning inexorability of a NASA launch countdown. <br/><br/>In Weir's story, none of the characters, beginning with protagonist Mark Watney, are cocksure about anything.The book hammers home the massive, mind-numbing fact of the distance from Earth to Mars, and how anyone stranded there is more or less done for, by simple virtue of the length of time, measured in years, it would take for any rescuers to (a) leave Earth and (b) arrive anywhere at Mars, much less at the castaway's position. This is a fact of geography and science that Weir's writing uses to create wonderful dramatic tension in the book. The movie, somehow, more or less dispenses with the feel of that terrible fact, the tyranny of distance, and this, along with most of Matt Damon's choices in his monologues and soliloquies during his screen portrayal of Watney, creates the creeping feeling that only grows throughout the film that, ""don't worry, everyone, just give another 90 minutes and this will all turn out peachy.' <br/><br/>Damon's portrayal of Watney is too cocksure. Jessica Chastain as the mission commander of the 'Aresnauts' is too cocksure. Sean Bean as the NASA flight director with-a-brogue(?) is too cocksure. <br/><br/>Just take these three characters in the film, and compare them with their counterparts in the closest film facsimile to The Martian, which is Apollo 13, and it begins to dawn like a red sun (oops, again please) that this cast is chiefly concerned with looking awesome, and ""delivering the red hell"" (yikes, I know) out of the rather limited number of lines everyone gets. <br/><br/>There is in The Martian none of the sweaty shock, the gnawing self- doubt, the glimpses of facial near-terror at the prospect of a delicate human being being millimeters or milliseconds of miscalculation away from the sheer brutality of the black and starry void they have dared to tempt. This is what Hanks, Ed Harris, et al gave us in Apollo 13. Damon, Chastain, and the others give us none of that and too much 'nah, it'be a'ight.' <br/><br/>A director and cast can get away with cocksure triumphalism in a space shoot 'em up or blow 'em up like Armageddon. But in a documentary (Apollo 13) or speculative fictional documentary (The Martian) there is no shooting and bombing, and there are no villains. So there is nothing but the acting to supply drama. <br/><br/>In a film like The Martian, the only possible rocket fuel (oh boy) is human emotion, accurately conveyed."
"lubegiant","6","4","11","13 October 2015"," 'Armageddon' meets 'Cast Away' with better CGI
","I thought that by the time Robert Zemekis yelled 'Cut!"" after the final scene of ""Cast Away"" fifteen years ago we were done with ""I'm- left-for-dead-but-the-power-of-my-spirit-and-the-high-school-science- classes-will-get-me-home"" dramas. Nope. For some reason, my lifetime hero Ridley Scott decided to step on that same track that's been beaten so many times before him. As a result we have an attempt at an exciting story supposedly brimming with thrilling potential turn into a Bond movie, only without the body count. To me it's just silly to spend two hours sitting on the edge of the seat, motionless, while knowing more or less what all the lead-ins are going to be and what the grand finale will look like. So, I fast-forwarded a lot and something tells me, I didn't miss a whole a lot of twists and turns: and Astronaut (Damon) is left alone on Mars as a result of a mission gone bad but he survives against all odds and is eventually brought back home. That's it in a nutshell (I feel silly retelling this story, it was pretty easy to surmise even from the very first trailer). The rest is just 'Armageddon' with better CGI, constant disco in the background and the foreseeable Damon's own brand of humor. For Scott this is a first (meaning, first by-the-book drama), I even went back and looked at his resume to be sure. Not gonna ask myself why has he done it, just another feel good candidate for the Oscars? I guess. Oh, and the spoiler, of course. Ready? Everything is going to be fine. Enjoy the disco!"
"jrarichards","8","4","11","7 October 2015"," Courageously gimmick-free and measured look at deep-space exploration
","Given the ambition of the ""Star Trek"" universe and other film and TV space genres, sci-fi fans may well need pinching from time to time if they are to recall correctly that no human being has yet been further than 401,000 km from the Earth, while Mars lies out there at a minimum distance of 55 MILLION km. Thus - in real life - even unmanned missions to our external neighbour continue to push our species to the limits of its abilities. The fact that that might be a shame, given humankind's basic drive to explore, and the way that our species really might unify to swing behind such an effort are clearly among the aims of this film, whose mainly-supportive portrayal of the space agencies and what they stand for is nevertheless (one feels rightly) an eclectic mix of the awe-inspiring and the Heath Robinson. This is a film that clearly qualifies as sci-fi in some way, but is nevertheless no ""Mission to Mars"" or ""Red Planet"". Rather this is a space-mission story told straight, relying a lot on technological details, and (mostly) accurately encapsulating some of the real-life difficulties that operating manned missions at the limits of our range might really bring; and even slowing the pace at many points to strengthen our awareness of those distances, and the loneliness and apparent helplessness they denote. Ridley Scott's love of detail comes into its own in such a context, while Matt Damon handles the starring role well enough, injecting the sceptical and humorous notes we have come to expect from real-life astronauts, as well as the toughness and resourcefulness. The Mars his character has reached is as staggeringly impressive and beautiful as it is utterly hostile, yet still - in some way at least, as ""The Martian"" makes clear - ""out there waiting for us"", should we prove up to the challenge of near-limitless flexibility and adaptability."

","Firstly, I watched this yesterday and the nearly 2 1/2 hours went past in a instant. Secondly, I have to agree with the previous review about the science but disagree about the one star they gave. My background is arts, not science but even I knew they were talking gibberish most of the time. Here's the minor spoiler. Damon's astronaut doubled the battery life on his ""rover"", the moon walker thing, despite being a botanist. So, a guy who grows plants can do that, but NASA can't? I didn't bother really with the science.<br/><br/>What we do have, is a wonderful story about an astronaut left alone on Mars as he is presumed dead. Leaving aside his Stephen Hawking science, we see his determination to survive despite overwhelming odds. His tenacity and dry humour against insanity and slow death. <br/><br/>It could be a one-man show for Damon and he totally steps up to the part. But, we also see the corporate/NASA element back on Earth with strong actors like Sean Bean and Jeff Daniels. Full credit to the actors playing Damon's crew as they return to Earth from Mars.<br/><br/>This film doesn't have the obvious signature of Ridley Scott, he just lets his actors get on with it.

The crew leaves for Earth only to later find out that their colleague is still alive, struggling in a desperate attempt to survive until a rescue mission is sent back to get him.<br/><br/>It's a very emotional story of a man, stranded on Mars, which must survive way over his current resources allow, in a desperate hope that someone will hear his cry for help and come to save him. It's very interesting how he manages to overcome many difficulties in order to obtain food and, at the same time, also fix or upgrade his devices, vital for the many days which are to come. It's intriguing, sad, funny and also thrilling, making it addictive to watch most of the time.<br/><br/>The main actor does an incredible job in describing the efforts of his character, making the whole plot very credible. As a downside, it is way too long for my taste, especially when the action is very static as it is in this film.

This is a movie not about fancy effects but about *science.* It's a movie about a smart guy stranded on an alien planet who has to use his considerable knowledge to solve life- or-death problems. <br/><br/>The movie makes its science quite interesting; I found myself totally invested in the problems of growing potatoes on Mars or getting a rover to go further than it's supposed to.<br/><br/>While Matt Damon is doing his science, a bunch of people on earth are doing their science, and it's just as fascinating. <br/><br/>While there are no shootouts or romances, there is some suspense and a good deal of humor, as well as a bit less concern about the probable versus the possible towards the end. <br/><br/>When I saw the trailer for this, it didn't interest me; I really only watched it because my girlfriend wanted to (she liked the trailer). But this is a first-rate movie."
"Marwan-Bob","9","2","4","12 February 2017"," In Space no One Can Hear You Scream
","This movie is a triumph on almost every level; script, acting, directing, cinematography and special effects are all top notch. It's one of Ridley Scott's best films in years as well as a career high performance from Matt Damon who commands the screen and bring so much charisma and a surprising amount of humor to his character. The story revolves around an astronaut being stuck on Mars and having to fight to stay alive while NASA works to bring him home. The 2 1/2 hour running time goes by almost too fast as the film is full of scenes of intensity, thrills but most of all plenty of laughs. It's an all round crowd pleaser the whole family should enjoy."

","At one point in The Martian, Matt Damon's character mentions that he hasn't bathed in quite a while. My wife turned to me and said, ""He must stink!"" I replied, ""Almost as much as this movie.""<br/><br/>I've seen worst movies to be sure. But I would have expected more from director Ridley Scott and certainly a great deal more from one of the better known planets in our solar system.<br/><br/>Damon plays astro-botanist and electromechanical whiz Mark Whatney. This guy makes McGyver look like a five-year-old dealing with an incomplete Tinker Toy set.<br/><br/>As far as the acting and directing go, I suspect that Mr. Scott, while screen testing Jessica Chastain, said something to the effect of, ""Yes! That's it! That's the kind of acting I want in this film! I want everyone to simper and smirk and give me that ""can-do"" attitude. We'll do over two hours of just that! As well, we'll pepper the film with crummy pop music from the seventies. And we'll have none of that four-letter language that I've used in my superior films such as American Gangster. This is going to be a movie that the whole family can suffer through!""<br/><br/>The effects are great. And although I haven't been there yet, the Mars landscape looks real enough. But this is typically overblown Hollywood schmaltz (and you just KNOW how it's going to end).<br/><br/>I should finally mention another notable scene in this film where Damon is sitting in his Martian abode watching a video of a Happy Days episode. It raises the question, ""Would I rather be 225 million kilometers away on a cold and barren planet watching Happy Days, or subject myself to another movie like The Martian in the comfort of my living room?""<br/><br/>Tough call."

","In this film, the crew of a Mars expedition mistakenly believes that a member of their crew is dead and leaves him behind on the surface of Mars. The marooned astronaut must find a way to let people on Earth know that he is still alive. With limited resources, he is forced to use his ingenuity to find a way to survive long enough to be rescued.<br/><br/>This film was reported to have been one of the most scientifically accurate space dramas ever created. Although the depiction of the Martian storm was exaggerated for dramatic effect, the means by which the stranded astronaut survived were based on research. The only question is whether or not an astronaut would have the knowledge to do all of those things without communications with Earth.<br/><br/>This film was riveting from start to finish. The notion of an astronaut being able to change his own fortunes through unrelenting hard work was inspiring. The visuals of the Martian setting gave movie goers a realistic feel for what it would be like to be on Mars. The 1970's music used in the film captured the mood of the various scenes perfectly. At times, the movie was uplifting and exhilarating. This was easily one of the best Mars exploration dramas ever made. This was one film which should not be missed. It is highly recommended!"
"SaibalBandopadhyay","Null","2","4","9 December 2016"," Terrific visualization of a true rescue mission where everyone played their part.
","First of all, it got nominated for 7 Oscars, so it must have something special in it right? It starts on the middle of a mission. Everything is going great and according to plan, when suddenly a storm hits the astronauts and Mark Watney (Matt Damon) gets separated from his crew. They did attempt a search for him but the situation prohibited them from spending too much time on it and so they presumed him to be dead and they returned home. But, he wasn't dead yet and he started making efforts to survive and he was doing great, occasionally hit by one or two bumps. When NASA finally got to know about his survival, they did all they can to put forward a rescue mission for him. The rescue mission is thrilling and it involves some intense decision making and unified cooperation. The last 20 minutes was particularly very intense. The scene when commander Lewis went out herself to rescue Watney and when he was coming to her and there was this anxiety that one single mistake could make him lost forever into nothingness could literally get goosebumps. A great film and brilliant acting by Matt Damon. He is just a treat to watch"

","I was completely amazed by this movie! I don't usually like Sci-Fi movies or TV series, but I really enjoyed this one, I guess that there are some exceptions... Probably it was because not everything in the film is placed in Mars, they come back constantly to Earth, so having that change was nice; it was half the Sci-Fi part and half the realistic part. Matt Damon's performance was really good, he expressed many feelings: happiness, loneliness, nervousness, excitement.His character went to a lot and he expressed it just perfectly. Scott Ridley did an incredible job, I'm speechless. Was absolutely magnificent. I loved the screenplay, actually most of the performances called a lot my attention. The production was just enough, it wasn't an extravagant weird thing. Everything seemed so real for me (possibly why I don't like much Sci-Fi is because is so unrealistic to me, and I like things that can be real) but what Mr. Ridley did to this movie was so fantastic, is really awesome. Likely is one of the best Sci-Fi movies I have ever seen. <br/><br/>9.0/10"

","Yes. Indeed.... Though I have numerous beefs regarding this latest offering from director Ridley Scott (who, believe it, or not, has got yet another ""Alien"" sequel lined up for release in 2017.... Ho-hum!) - Here are 2 of my biggest grumbles against ""The Martian"".<br/><br/>(1) - With ""The Martian"" having a PG-13 rating - I'd say that, as an adult, director Scott has short-changed me, big-time, with this one.<br/><br/>I mean - Here was a story that was so full of plot-holes, implausibilities, and annoying loose-ends that only someone with a mindset of an adolescent could appreciate it and not question its endless ""science fiction"" inconsistencies.<br/><br/>(2) - (This is just a personal observation) - But - (From where I was sitting) - I was sure hoping that after all the time he spent on Mars, the Mark Watney character (once back on Earth) would slowly-but-surely start to morph into an actual ""Martian"".<br/><br/>Now, I'm not talking about Watney turning into a hideous-looking monster, or anything like that. No.... But because of Watney's long exposure to this alien environment, he would somehow subtly change and, yes, maybe find that he had to return to Mars in order to continue to survive.<br/><br/>Yeah.

","The reason why I got to watch this movie was because my family really wanted to see it badly so I decided to join them! I usually don't watch Astronaut movies since the disappointment of unfortunately watching the film ""Gravity"" with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. Even I rarely watch movies with Matt Damon in them so this has to be the proper movie I've entirely began concentrating on. <br/><br/>It was interesting to see how Damon's character to have survived in a planet with thin air. Like Christ, thank god I'm not an astronaut because I wouldn't want to go explore space in case anything could happen. Omg the scene where the first rocket trying to rescue Mark was blown up and it honestly terrified me. I don't know how these people would be so brave, I'm more afraid of getting killed then worrying about space! <br/><br/>I'm glad NASA managed to rescue Mark from Mars and that everything was happily ever after! What a nice ending for a very intense story. Although the only disappointment was that the movie was long enough. Some bits bored me but the whole movie would keep you interested to find out what happens yknow! <br/><br/>I definitely would consider this as Damon's best film projects hes ever done.

","Cold, emotionless sci fi/ adventure, about years-long attempts to rescue an astronaut, stranded on Mars following a freak accident. <br/><br/>We (or at least, I) never feel as though Damon's character is in any peril or danger, despite being stranded for several years on a foreign planet, with almost no resources. He never loses weight, or even needs a shave, except in one later scene. The plot does address that issue briefly, explaining Damon's character realises that one integral part part of his survival is keeping his sense of humour, to avoid depression, and hopelessness, but it's just too upbeat for its own good. <br/><br/>Most problems are solved relatively quickly, and too easily overcome by Damon, without hardly any signs of fatigue.<br/><br/>The cinematography (with Jordan substituting for the unforgiving Martian landscape) is well done, and that, in and of itself, makes this worth watching, but for me, this is a fairly hollow, empty shell."

","Movie: The Martian(2015) Director: Ridley Scott<br/><br/>Left for dead on the red planet following a windstorm, botanist Mark Watney(Matt Damon) must hunker down for the long haul, knowing that any rescue mission is years away. Luckily, he is quite literally ""the best botanist on the planet"", and after declaring that he'll have to ""science the s**t"" out of his Robinson Crusoe situation, he discovers that it is indeed possible to grow potatoes in his own poo. This is just the first of many self-help survivalist discoveries that find Watney entertainingly facing up to the challenge of ""not dying"". Armed only with recordings of Happy Days and his captain's collection of old-school floor-fillers, this lonely guy pitches his skills against the inhospitable elements, counting the solar days (""sols"") until help arrives even as mission control fight their own battles, practical and geopolitical.<br/><br/>The cinematography is so beautifully done that it provides the film with a fundamental documentary reality while also making a thing of great beauty. Extra attention is amply on display in all creative departments. The most fascinating thing about the film is how it leans into predictability rather than make a show of fighting it. Of all the stories you've seen about astronauts coping with the aftermath of disaster— including ""Mission to Mars"" and the visually superior and more aggressively melodramatic ""Gravity,"" which is more of a self-help parable with religious overtones—""The Martian"" is the most relaxed and funny, and maybe the warmest. <br/><br/>This science fiction is for sophisticated audiences and, as such, a fulfilling and satisfying experience.

","Poor old NASA, no ones heard a whole lot from them lately. Indeed, it seems the Chinese are getting more attention. <br/><br/>Not to worry, The Martian, offers up a few spoonfuls of feel good, cinematic hope, for forlorn US astro-nuts out there. The film presents a very optimistic view of a high tech, future NASA. A NASA populated by super science types, like Matt Daemons character, who can solve all problems and overcome any situation. Even being stranded, Robinson Crusoe style, on planet Mars. <br/><br/>This film is over the top but, for all that, quite entertaining. Daemon is his pleasant, laid back, jokery, folksy self, fitting like a homemade spacesuit into this role. <br/><br/>What is surprising, is how the writers and director, Ridley Scott, managed to make, what is on the surface, a not so exciting premise, a guy stranded on a barren planet, quite engaging and enjoyable. On that basis, this film is to be commended. <br/><br/>That said, this film has, in my opinion, been chronically over hyped, especially in the pre-release marketing and as such, has created an expectation, I feel, it could never really live up to. <br/><br/>The Martian is a good film. Its well cast, employs engaging and amusing narrative and surprisingly, given what appears initially, to be, bland material, its never boring. Just keep in mind, its not the super, fantastic, life changing, inspiring, proposition its sold as, either. Seven out of ten from me."
"Robert_duder","9","2","4","23 March 2016"," Definitely lives up to the hype and provides something unique
","The Martian is brilliant in the way its presented. Compared to something like Gravity it buries it because it blends a real feeling science fiction adventure with tons of scientific exploration but includes fun, crazy stunts and special effects and a script that is actually very mainstream with humour and plain dialogue which some fans apparently find off-putting. Some reviews said everything was great but the dialogue was silly and it is in a way but I liked that it was plain speak among this insane survival story that is ridiculous and plausible all at once. The performances and the direction of the film make you feel this could have happened.<br/><br/>The cast is very good and the starring role of the film is so well done that it carries the movie. I will say honestly that Matt Damon should have been Oscar nominated for his role just because he makes it believable and fun and scary and takes you on this adventure. Yes he gives the role a lot of different tones but I thought it worked perfectly. The supporting cast are really a lot of A-Listers playing his team that want to rescue him and those working to save him for different reasons including Jeff Daniels, Kristen Whig (who actually does a great job in a small but serious role), Jessica Chastain (one of my least favourite actresses but she was very tolerable in this), Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kata Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover (really liked his small but important role), Benedict Wong, and Aksel Hennie are the roles I thought were best performed in small doses. They kept the supporting characters unassuming but with enough charisma that they made a difference so they didn't feel underused but also didn't get in the way either.<br/><br/>The Martian is also so good due to the extreme talent of legendary Science Fiction directly Ridley Scott who really seems to work on pure passion. When he loves something he just completely immerses himself in it and brings it to life. You will feel like you are on Mars surviving with this guy and you will become so attached to him. Considering how long the movie covers the pacing is practically perfect and despite essentially being science fiction the special effects are fantastic and don't feel CGI heavy which is an accomplishment. The Martian is easily one of the best movies of 2015 and is unique considering it could have felt like rehashed material from films like Interstellar and Gravity but those both underwhelmed me whereas The Martian met and exceed my expectations so check it out and ""science the sh%t out of this planet!!"" 9/10"
"aperisic","5","2","4","7 March 2016"," Did not like it much
","I did not like it. The message of the movie that you can just go around the Universe and solve one problem after another using the current science and survive is a serious hit bellow the belt. The problem for me is that I do not like diluting science to this degree. It is not only this movie that suffers from this problem, but this is the one that has had 7 nominations. Special effects are wonderful and all that, but this is where it all stops. <br/><br/>For example, Sunshine (2007) is a movie that does not abuse the science to this degree because it starts with the premise that we have found the way of reigniting the Sun. That is quite advanced from what we have at the moment. Even when it refuses to explain some scientifically strange elements, it is turning into something else, it simply envelopes that part of the movie with elements from another genre, like adding horror elements. In the Martian, there is nothing even close to that, the science is more or less what we have today, and the story is told word for word, action taken word for word, and this is not sufficient and it is very painful for me to accept. <br/><br/>A movie works on the childish level and constantly fails. Only if I forget all that and watch the movie as if it is an episode of Star Trek then it is watchable. But the science is way to close to what we have today for this to be a Star Trek. This movie looks like a campaign for Mars exploration. A naive, childish attempt to persuade general public that it is worth it. We are far from doing any of that which is depicted in the movie. I would expect more some sort of poetic elements, but the movie is just brutal, yet not even nearly brutal as it is on the Mars. You cannot survive on the Mars in any form if you have the situation that is displayed in the movie. Period. From that point, a documentary attempt is a total miss. It remains fake and there is nothing added. Not a thing. No personal introspection, no questions, no confusions. If there is pain, it is mostly physical apart from few moments by the end of the movie that are detached from the rest of the movie. It is kind of Indiana Jones in space, but there is no hint of adventure, it is all so serious all along.<br/><br/>The scenery from the Mars is beautiful. Special effects, beautiful. Anything else is artificial and bad.<br/><br/>I have no idea why this has 7 nominations and is so highly praised. I truly wish people were not getting used to the movies made like this."
"neibrad","8","2","4","4 March 2016"," Robbed of awards
","For me the combination of Riddley Scott and Matt Damon sounds like the recipe for the best movie ever. But there are several 'However's. Some of the concepts are a little far fetched and let's be brutally honest: I was expecting Matt to find a basketball and paint a face on it. Those negatives aside, it was robbed of awards by that straight to DVD abomination of Crap Max. The Martian keeps one gripped with the isolation and desperation of trying to cling on to life. Predictibale. Done before. But why change something if it isn't broken. I'd give it 10 if they had just made it a bit less fluffy and more dark. Plus why can I never seem to be able to write a review that is 10 lines long?"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","2","4","4 March 2016"," Matt Damon leads the way as an astronaut in a typical Hollywood blockbuster.
","Blockbusters are only good once in a while. ""The Martian"" adds its name to the list of boring Hollywood adventures for its lack of creativity, its huge cast who give dull performances, and its weak attempt at giving the eyes something spectacular to look at. During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. How cliché is that? Not to mention its based off of a bestselling novel. ""The Martian"" is poorly executed by old-time director Ridley Scott, who hasn't achieved anything much in his career in a while. He guides his effects crew to do just the bare minimum, and instructs his production team to barely make us feel on mars. Shot in a big studio, this film fails at every level to bring any ingenuity to the screen. Instead, we hear Matt Damon reading from a lame script and finding his way through a predictable plot."
"deacon_blues-3","7","2","4","29 February 2016"," Should have been a survival movie, not a ""skin of your teeth"" rescue movie.
","As good a film as this is, it was not the film I wanted to watch. I think this did contribute to my lowered opinion of it. Admittedly this is not really a fair criticism, but I do think that a film about someone actually surviving on Mars for an extended period without assistance from earth would have been a more interesting story. <br/><br/>Anyway, there were a few key things that just didn't sit well with me about this film. <br/><br/>Foremost, I suppose, was the ever heightening complications and ever increasing risk factors that just kept being heaped upon the story until I felt it just got beyond what is credible. I thought the final stripping of the MAV unit to gain altitude was just too far-fetched. At some point the film crosses the line from telling a good story to just showing off one's knowledge of science and engineering. At that point I was just ready to give up any connection with real-life probabilities. In short, everything got to the point where the whole thing just seemed too contrived to be believed.<br/><br/>Next, the New Year's Eve size gatherings all over the world to await the outcome with bated breath just did not seem realistic at all. The only reason people gather in those numbers on New Year's Eve is for the prospect of massive substance abuse and illicit sexual encounters. It is extremely doubtful whether the fate of one astronaut would motivate such gatherings throughout the world. We have had astronauts in danger before, and no such gatherings took place. Taking into account the current increased apathy toward the space program, I find this likewise far-fetched.<br/><br/>Finally, the unabashed worship of science as religion. ""Trust in Science, and lean not on faith in any other God. In all thy trials, rest assured that if you do the math, it will save your soul!"" Throughout the film this message is beaten like a dead horse. Reality has taught us that such an assurance about science is both inappropriate and unrealistic. Even our best scientific efforts often end in tragedy and death. No amount of Pollyanna-ish optimism is going to unite the world in peace and harmony. This pervasively näive positivism descends to the level of nausea. <br/><br/>In addition, there's something creepy about Ridley Scott making an upbeat, optimistic film. He should stick to more barrenly realistic narratives. These have always been his best efforts."
"emorr","6","2","4","29 February 2016"," Disappointed
","Best picture? Really? It was average. What's worse is I've come to expect so much from Ridley Scott. The acting was pretty good, but it's just such a run-of-the-mill story: man gets stranded, but survives, people come to rescue him. Yawn.<br/><br/>It just seems to me Matt Damon could do this type of role in his sleep. And Ridley Scott could do the same in his sleep.<br/><br/>There was really no tension in the flick. You knew how it was going to turn out. <br/><br/>Not recommended.<br/><br/>ed"
"jtindahouse","8","2","4","25 February 2016"," More humour than I expected in a fine film
","There was controversy at the Golden Globes last month when 'The Martian' was nominated in the 'Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical' category, and in fact went on to win it. By that stage I hadn't seen it but had been told by many people (host Ricky Gervais included) that this was an absurd category for it to be placed in. So I went into the film expecting to find a deadly serious tone, however what I found was instead justification for it being put in that category. Amost all of Matt Damon's scenes are like a little comedy skit on his part. The rest of the cast play it very seriously but he is undoubtedly the star and if his scenes are all that way I see no issue with labeling it, at least partly, as a comedy. <br/><br/>Damon has in fact been nominated for an Academy Award for Actor in a Lead Role for his performance here. He was personally helped by the category choice at the Golden Globes when he was able to take home the award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. On that occasion his competition was almost non-existent. Sadly at the Oscars it will be a different story, no one is taking that award off Leonardo DiCaprio. Damon is impressive in his role though, he has an ability to be charming without ever coming across cocky or arrogant. He's the guy you want to root for and thus was perfectly cast in 'The Martian'.<br/><br/>The film has also been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Again I would call it almost a 0% chance of winning but that shouldn't take away from a well deserved nomination. For a film about a guy on a distant planet all by himself there is never a dull moment. Director Ridley Scott does a terrific job of pacing the film and the above average runtime of 144 minutes never drags. To me it felt like a cross between 'Armegaddon' and 'Cast Away'. All the elements of an epic blockbuster are there, while never forgetting about the emotional side of the characters and story. A well executed film that will be enjoyable for the entire spectrum of audience members."

"ElMaruecan82","8","2","4","19 February 2016"," A little less ""Apollo 13"", a little more ""Cast Away""...
","I read many critics calling ""The Martian"" formulaic but I think it's a half-empty glass way to look at it. In fact, like many great movies, its plot is driven by two great concepts borrowed from other movies, but put together making a greater concept with a novelty as the cherry on the cake. Basically, ""The Martian"" is ""Apollo 13"" and ""Cast Away"" on Mars, and it's so obvious I just read other reviews mentioning this combo, so I think we're reaching a general consensus here.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""The Martian"" has the crisis-management and triumph-of-human-brain-over-natural-adversity theme that usually inspire entertaining, pedagogical and inspirational stories, and it has the inevitable 'stranded in a desert island' vibe only this time, in a more exotic landscape, if exotic also means hostile, hellish... and reddish, well you can't get worse than being left alone in Mars, like Mark Watney. It's not the first film set on Mars, so not quite a novelty, but still, the first by Ridley Scott, so in terms of production designs and recreation of an extra-terrestrial setting, we have a director who mastered the Sci-fi genre at a time where half ""The Martian"" cast was watching 'Sesame Street'.<br/><br/>On that level, ""The Martian"" is perfect to a documentary-like level.<br/><br/>Now, let's get back to our combo. In ""Apollo 13"" department, the film delivers exactly what we expect with the whole brainstorming moments, the internal tensions and conflicts within the NASA operators, the ethical dilemmas, the last-minute solutions, the decisions to make fast, and all these moments are served by terrific performances, especially from a trio of great actors Sean Bean, Chiwetel Efigogor and Jeff Daniels (whom I suspect is promised to play many authoritarian figures in the future given how natural bossy charisma he exudes). ""The Martian"" isn't just a thrilling race against the Martian clock, it's also a great film about management. And that's where my criticism starts; the film should've been an ever better one about self-management.<br/><br/>I think ""The Martian"" lacked a little something on this aspect. We have a man, who's trapped in a planet, alone, with no one to help him light-years around, and for some reason, there's no real moment where Damon 'feels' alone, starting with the fact that he talks to his audience (in fact, a camera installed in the base, where he can leave information and messages 'for the record') it's the first departure from the usual 'desert island' silent discoveries, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. Actually, it was quite a pleasant surprise, not to have the character immediately desperate or scared, here's a guy who's trained to resist the pressure whether in a vessel or a stressful situation. Besides, he strikes as a very optimistic nature, capable to throw a few hilarious one-liners and it's like the situation is critical enough not to inject some extra level of pathos, and that's fine at first.<br/><br/>Not only it's fine, but it's also realistic. Mark has the oxygen (available thanks to the oxygenator), but he's got to find out how to make food and water and water to make food, so there's no time to waste. And that's why the beginning is so promising in ""The Martian"", it doesn't waste time, as if it was governed by the very urgency of the situation. Noland in ""Cast Away"" was alone, but he had food and water, the real struggle was to cope with loneliness and accept his nihilistic future. Watney has no alternative, he does something or he dies, it's pure survival instinct. Do or do not, there's no try. And then, we see him, working for his life, growing plants, eating, drinking, exploring the planet, step by step, making first rudimentary contacts with the NASA, and then being able to communicate. But after one hour, he 'chats' with his NASA colleagues and, he's just like the child trapped in a well.<br/><br/>My personal regret is that we never get a true emotional impression on his loneliness, it's physical, but the film is so in a rush to get to the rescue part that it doesn't allow itself at least ten or fifteen minutes for the main character. And I mean that because he was a fascinating, well-acted and intriguing one, so they could afford a little extra time for moments where basically 'nothing' happens, and where we try to find out what's going up in his mind. I understand Watney is supposed to be a sort of wisecracking guy, who's not probably the type of man to directly express his feelings, it's part of his nature, but that's what would have made a real breakdown, an emotionally rewarding moment. I waited desperately to see him reach a breaking point, to throw the potatoes all over the place, to cry of pain, hunger, exhaustion, but we never get that moment and it's a pity.<br/><br/>It's a pity because I think it's precisely for this reason some perceived the film as formulaic, because it didn't take more chances with Damon. I don't mean to 'intellectualize' the film that much, it's a matter of emotions more than analysis, ""The Martian"" had the entertainment valued so locked up that it could allow us to get deeper in the character, a sort of character study, without cheap emotional moments, just the nice amount. Not that it prevented Damon from getting his Oscar nomination, I guess he showed a few signs of vulnerability here and there, behind his restrained facade, but I wish there could be more ""Oscar-baity"" moments, and be a real threat to Di Caprio this year, who had a flashier 'survivor' role in ""The Revenant"".<br/><br/>But again, the designs were impeccable, the landscapes breath-taking, the special effects spectacular (once again, old-school Ridley Scott) and the acting good with a honorable mention to Jessica Chastain I forgot to mention. ""The Martian"" is great entertainment, I wish it was just less about the rescue than the rescued."

And here is what happened: He lift 400 Kg rocket top (Yes that technical I am), eating just a third of the food portion initially initially as healthy, for I don't know how many months; and He also was as good in the head as everybody else after isolation far away from his planet with the potential risk of dying from anything. And this just made the whole thing BORING to watch very soon from the beginning. Why should he be saved if he was so OK? Can you just take off your helmet and die?<br/><br/>I didn't feel anything... No tension, no sympathy, no anticipation... He just went from situation to situation without breaking, without nothing... nada. <br/><br/>This also made the movie terribly paced, went it was supposed to be the peak of all trouble you were already tired of it and couldn't care less, cause he'd be fine anyway, with incredible ease... as every single time before.<br/><br/>All and all, I'm not disappointed.

As long of a run time ""The Martian"" had, I didn't notice until it was wrapping up and I saw that two hours had lapsed.<br/><br/>Much like ""Cast Away"" had to be held up by Tom Hanks, ""The Martian"" needed Matt Damon to be good. Matt Damon more than held his own as the stranded botanist Mark Watney.<br/><br/>The acting was great and so was the story.

I gave the movie a 5/10, it's far from a bad movie, but everything about it felt average and I thought Interstellar and Gravity were more entertaining as far as recent space movies go.

","I first watched The Martian soon after it came out in theaters in October 2015 with some friends after classes were over for the day. I thought, ""Oh hey, it's another sci-fi movie, this will be great,"" but I had no idea what was in store. Mark Watney is stranded alone on Mars after a mission gone wrong. His methods of survival will leave viewers feeling inspired and also laughing a bit, too. From the minute the film began, it had me hooked. I felt like I was really there with the other astronauts. There were times during the movie when data about little detailed things like the oxygen level and alerts would come up inside the astronauts' helmets. It made the experience very real. I was impressed by the way this movie juxtaposed many things: from feeling big because of achievements to feeling small in the grand scheme of things, feeling like you've conquered to feeling like you've been conquered by a foreign planet, feeling like you've been left behind to feeling unbridled joy. If I could choose my career all over again, I would want to become an astronaut because of this movie. It is very powerful, amazingly designed, and reminds you that with some quick thinking, anything is possible."

At the end I have no idea who he is; apparently he is good at plants and has parents. <br/><br/>The second half of the movie involving the rescue, was simply a montage of all the Hollywood blockbuster disaster movies.

Sure everyone likes a cocky James Bond, but a botanist stranded on Mars with a cavalier attitude who shows little to no emotion? Sorry, not working. This was partly the writer directors fault and not the actors, I am not sure they gave him the opportunity to add a human element to this story. The biggest conflict was from a minor character on earth and that was not played out well. ""Yeah the boss says no but I have feelings here and I am going to do what is right gosh darn it"". Of course it is from someone you have idea who they are because there was no character development. Now comes the science flaws. First of all, your suit gets punctured, death is imminent and fairly quick, Damon's suite gets breached three times, once on purpose in the alleged dramatic rescue, I cry BS. Second, if you have a need to accelerate a space craft by using the gravity of earth or Mars, you cannot send a space craft off the surface and hook-up, if you could you would not need the slingshot maneuver. This film deserves a remake but not by Ridley Scott. This is an old story updated but dejavu all over again."

","While not an extremely bad movie the direction this movie takes seems to disappoint. Survival movies always work well but when a survival movie turns into an obvious rescue drama, well the outcome can be somewhat predictable. For the first 40 minutes or so the audience is treated to the angst ridden fear of death but the protagonist pulls himself together and designs a way to eat and live. It would have been far more dramatic had he survived to the point where he possibly would never need to be rescued. Imagine how much better this movie would have been when after several attempts at almost making contact with Earth he resigns himself to the inevitable life on Mars. Fade to a rear image of him staring out into the blankness of space as the credits roll. Now that would be a true Martian! But no unfortunately (or fortunately) the makers of this movie decide that there should at least be an attempt to rescue the poor sod. Did they get him off the Red planet? Well you will just have to watch to find out wont you?"
"starstacked","9","2","4","16 January 2016"," Mark Watney; Space Pirate!
","The Martian is a movie adaptation by Ridley Scott (Exodus: Gods and Kings, Before I Go to Sleep), based on the self-published book of the same name by Andy Weir.<br/><br/>Mark Watney's crew - Melissa Lewis; Jessica Chastain (The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby, Zero Dark Thirty), and Rick Martinez; Michael Peña (End of Watch, 30 Minutes or Less) among others, have to leave Mars during a Martian storm. Thinking Mark is dead, they leave him behind. However, after the crew has left the planet, Mark regains consciousness and is now faced with a race against time for survival. Knowing he has only a quarter of the supplies needed until the next mission to Mars, he has to ration and find ways to survive on a planet that is seen as uninhabitable.<br/><br/>As the main actor, Mark; Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity, The Adjustment Bureau), does a thoroughly good job in keeping you hooked. The dialogue is mainly one sided, with Mark communicating through his web-cam, over a chat program and aloud to himself, or even in his head.<br/><br/>Obviously, never having visited Mars, but having seen the images in the news sent back from the Mars Rover amongst others. The terrain in the film looks surprisingly real, and makes you believe you really are on Mars when watching it.<br/><br/>But, lovers of Comedy, don't be fooled by The Martian's recent win of a Golden Globe for 'Best Comedy'! This film has some funny moments, (Spoiler alert!:) when, for example, Mark almost sets his crop and himself on fire when trying to grow food. However, The Martian is by no means a comedy film."
"rehams","9","2","4","16 January 2016"," Best commercial made for NASA and space travel made in years
","Let it be said up front, I am a huge fan of science-fiction to the point where I've watched just about every classic and non-classic. Ridley Scott of course is a master of the genre with Blade Runner, Alien and Prometheus. With such an outstanding resume, one expects a lot from a new sci-fi movie from Scott.<br/><br/>About that, The Martian barely seems like sci-fi, the technology shown and the 'modest' scope of the mission, sets this film within the next 20-30 years (my guess). As such it is as film that feels present day and I think that is what Ridley Scott set out to achieve.<br/><br/>It is no secret that space travel and NASA enthusiasm isn't what it used to be. The sci-fi optimism of the 70s and 80s has been almost fully replaced with doom scenarios of zombie apocalypse or broken futures. Ridley Scott has at least done his part with The Martian, to bring back excitement and relevance to the NASA mission. Honestly, no government bureaucrat or PR firm could devise a better advertisement for NASA than this film. The Martian will undoubtedly make clever 12 year olds sit glued to the screen and plant the dream of space travel in their minds. The result we will see in the next decades.<br/><br/>I haven't touched on the actual cinematic experience, which has been reviewed by many others, but it's a great looking film, stunning visuals as always with Scott and it always feels real. Matt Damon brings an A+ performance, most of the time making me forget that this is Jason Bourne or Matt Damon at all and that I suppose is the greatest compliment to an acting performance.<br/><br/>The film is somewhat short on personal drama and development although the cast does an excellent job. There's no romance, no family drama back home, in fact Damon's character doesn't seem to have a family except parents. The actors are well cast in their roles and do not suffer from needless Hollywood 'cool and pretty' standard (like in Promethus) though Kate Mara could never not be stunning, even if she tried.<br/><br/>The film is nerdy in that way. It really is as much about the great and almost supernatural feats of science needed to make something as a Mars mission work. As such it is again a great advocate for STEM fields and undoubtedly will inspire many young boys and girls to go into those.<br/><br/>All in all, this was one of the best and most gripping sci-fi movies made in a long time. Ridley Scott remains the uncontested heavyweight champ of Sci-Fi."

I thought I would watch this movie from a Sci-Fi perspective and was surprised too look at more from a humanistic perspective as the movie progressed. I think it was well done and sure some of the supporting cast was more than predictive but what big movie these days isn't. I think Matt came off as more of person than a action figure, some of his snide remarks made think of his early days such as ""Good Will Hunting"" or my favorite ""Dogma"". there were some definite plot holes but you write a movie that sends a man too mars and laves him there for that long."

","'Every human being has a basic instinct: to help each other out' Odd that everyone is raving about the acting in this film. Yes, it is a good idea to watch the survival of a lone man on another planet, but the acting and the dialogue are so flat line and the actors seem so uninvolved with this read-through of a script that after a while all the fancy special effects even get more interesting than the story. Some are remarking how far better Andy Weir's book is in comparison, but even Ridley Scott has slow moments in trying to keep this space venture airborne.<br/><br/>The story (brief as it is) – 'During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring ""the Martian"" home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible, rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney's safe return.'<br/><br/>The cast includes such winning actors as Michael Peña, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and others but there is little to no development of their characters until the very end. Jump on if you must see every movie that is nominated for best film/actor but be aware this tale goes on for well past 2 hours in length."
"mgnrai","10","2","4","14 January 2016"," Awesome movie
","The Martian is a new Ridley Scott classic, featuring his best work in years, the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, an outstanding supporting cast, a surprisingly funny screenplay from Daredevil creator Drew Goddard, and a great narrative that ties the film together beautifully. <br/><br/>As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully. <br/><br/>Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come. <br/><br/>The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own. <br/><br/>I have nothing bad to say about The Martian. It's the best film I've seen all year."

","Walking into this my only expectation was to see a NASA space drama about a man stranded on Mars that was better (and more realistic) than Mission To Mars & a survival drama that wasn't as boring as Cast Away. To say those expectations were exceeded is an understatement as it is, IMO, the 3rd funniest movie of 2015 (behind Spy and Sisters) and the 2nd best overall of 2015 (behind Mad Max).<br/><br/>Ridley Scott, a master of the sci-fi genre has crafted a truly unique movie with all the dramatic excitement and realism of Apollo 13, the dramatic struggle to survive of Cast Away and, with witty dialogue and jokes all the laugh out loud humor of Joss Whedon(in that the humor comes from (side) dialogue. Scott is able to depict the will to survive while simultaneously making you laugh which adds a humanizing level to the film. And the cinematography is beautiful and overall direction top notch.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is superb as Mark Watney, proving once again that anyone who says he can't act, just doesn't like him, cause this guy can act the crap out of a role. Personally I think he deserves the best actor Oscar for this more than DiCaprio for The Revenant(although Leo is way past due). Not only is Watney someone you want to see survive and come home, but he's a guy you'd want to hang out with. A cumulative portion of the movie is Damon talking to himself via video diary and his performance was still funnier than Rogen in The Night Before, Schumer in Trainwreck, Helms in Vacation, Sandler in Pixels or Hart in The Wedding Ringer.<br/><br/>The insanely talented ensemble cast of dramatic and comedic heavyweights and newcomers is impressive and add so much to the film. You not only laugh at what they say but you want to see them succeed in bringing Watney home because you like them and want them to accomplish their goal. Actors such as Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Donald Glover, and MacKenzie Davis all add something funny, different, and and satisfying to the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, a fantastic 8 star movie that effortlessly blends genres and proves both Ridley Scott and Matt Damon still ""have it"". Highly highly recommended for fans of Sci-Fi, Drama, Comedy or GREAT movies in general."

"memoriesvideography","9","2","4","12 January 2016"," The Martian is a rare Science Fiction film that focuses on human connection above all else.
","Most Science Fiction movies focus so much on the narrative and scientific elements that they tend to lose focus on the key ingredient; human connection. This however, is where the Martian thrives. Director Ridley Scott has put together a (mostly) feel good experience that has been missing from his most recent films. The character Mark Watney from Andy Weir's best selling novel has been brought to life in a thoroughly entertaining performance by Matt Damon. The film gives you a hero to root for throughout this tremendous ride hitting you with highs and lows until the final scene plays out.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film drops us into a Mars mission named Ares III where Watney and his crew are in the middle of a massive dust storm. During an effort to evacuate, Watney is hit with flying debris sending him airborne away from his crew. When his vital readings go offline, the crew assumes his death and are forced to evacuate without him. As the world mourns his death, Watney wakes on the red planet abandoned and alone. His only means of survival are his wits and the limited resources left behind. Luckily for him, the mission was cut short, leaving him a months supply of food. The only issue; He doesn't have a chance at rescue for 4 years. Once NASA becomes alerted of his survival, they and Watney are tasked with not only plotting a rescue mission, but figuring out how to keep him alive in the process.<br/><br/>Even though the film revolves around the audiences connection with Watney, the special effects and visuals still take center stage. Filmed in Jordan to simulate Mars, the setting is breathtaking. Vast red deserts covered in rocky sculptures give the illusion that Watney is somewhere other then our home planet. The seemingly absurd situation that our main character is in creates a lot of sarcastic humor that goes along way in balancing the mood. Watney is left with a laptop full of disco music as his only means of entertainment which creates a unique way to use the soundtrack of the film as a comedic outlet as well. Matt Damon gives a heroic performance in illustrating the emotional limits Watney has to endure. His dry humor is perfect in brightening the mood and his resolve in such a dire situation is impossible not to root for. The snappy dialogue, great performances and a few heart stopping action scenes highlight the Martian but what the film does best is touch on your emotions while pulling for the hero."

"alishawow","9","2","4","7 January 2016"," If you solve enough problems, you get to come home
","Directed by Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner, Alien) from a screenplay by Drew Goddard (World War Z, The Cabin in the Woods) based on the best-selling novel by Andy Weir, The Martian is one of the best hard-science scifi films to hit the screen in decades. Remarkably faithful to the novel and thoroughly engaging for its entire 144 minute length, this film is definitely worth taking in. It's also worth seeing on the big screen for the cinematography - courtesy of Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean, Prometheus) - particularly the vast Martian landscapes (Wadi Rum in Jordan) and the later scenes that take place up in space.<br/><br/>The film opens on Mars where we see the third manned Mars mission crew carrying out their duties. Their activities however are cut short by a sudden Martian sandstorm that shows up, a storm so severe that the mission is scrubbed and the crew must leave the planet. In the process of heading to the MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle) though, one of the mission crew, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by a piece of flying debris and blown away from the others, the debris piercing his suit in such a way that it damages the part of the suit that gives out his biometric readings and his location. Believing Watney to be dead and his body lost, and with the storm threatening to tip the MAV over at any moment, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) reluctantly gives the order to take off. But, as Watney later gamely says in the film, ""Surprise!"" He's not dead. Seriously banged up, but very much alive. And very determined to stay that way.<br/><br/>That, however, is going to take a lot of doing. In his daily video log, Watney sums up his situation thusly: ""If the oxygenator breaks down, I'll suffocate. If the water reclaimer breaks down, I'll die of thirst. If the Hab beaches, I'll just kind of implode. If none of those things happen. I'll eventually run out of food and starve to death."" On top of all that, his only hope of rescue is the next Mars mission, which isn't scheduled to reach Mars for three years. And he needs to find a way to let NASA - and the rest of Earth - know that he's still alive. ""In the face of overwhelming odds,"" he concludes, ""I'm left with only one option: I'm gonna have to science the _sh*t_ out of this."" And that's what makes the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>There are of course scenes where the action jumps to NASA on Earth as they discover first that Watney might have survived, then confirm that he is alive, and then start to figure out what they can do to get him home. And other scenes where the action jumps to the spaceship Hermes where the other members of the Ares 3 mission are making their way back to Earth, still thinking that Watney died on Mars.<br/><br/>Aside from Scott's smooth, sure-handed direction and Goddard's nicely-paced screenplay, it's the excellent cast of actors that really make The Martian work. Some valid questions have been raised about certain casting decisions where the ethnicity of the actor doesn't match the character, but in truth the choices made don't get in the way of the how the film comes across as the actors in question were all fine actors. Jeff Daniels (The Newsroom, Gettysburg) is in fine dry form as Teddy Sanders, the Director of NASA who has to balance the life of one lone astronaut against the safety and morale of the returning Ares 3 crew, while figuring out how best to accomplish the seemingly impossible task of mounting an actual rescue and keeping Watney alive long enough for it to reach him. Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) is quietly convincing as Commander Lewis who has to make a lot of hard choices to do what she feels is needed, and more than anyone else, to carry the weight of those decisions on her shoulders. Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids) hits just the right tone as Annie Montrose, NASA's official spokesperson, who has to publicly keep things positive while personally knowing just how long the odds are. And Sean Bean (Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings) is suitably stubborn as Mitch Henderson, the Hermes flight director who knows his people better than anyone and knows what they'd want to be told.<br/><br/>And of course there's Matt Damon (Invictus, Good Will Hunting) who manages the doubly difficult task of carrying fully half of the film's screen time while conveying both Watney's desperate situation and the quirky sense of humor that is a big part of what enables Watney to keep dealing with his situation without giving in to despair. This is no small thing. The humor in the book is a big part of what makes it such a good read, but reading and seeing on the big screen are two different things, and to make it work Damon has to bring out Watney's humor but keep the audience always aware of how vulnerable his situation is and never let things slip into outright comedy. I'm happy to say that Damon pulls off this delicate balance with a superb yet subtle performance, making Watney's quirky but resolute determination to survive the true heart of the film.<br/><br/>The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams (Shrek, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe) has just the right touch, adding to the http://www.rlsscene.com/category/movies/ feel of what's unfolding on the screen but never overpowering or distracting from it.<br/><br/>Highly, highly recommended for anyone who likes action/adventure/scifi in general and especially for anyone who likes their scifi realistic and believable. And for anyone who remembers what it was like when the space program captivated the world with Neil Armstrong taking ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"" and Apollo 13's ""Houston, we've had a problem."""
"carlos37andre","9","2","4","1 January 2016"," Beautiful, engaging and funny
","A great movie, scenery and clean effects, very good actors, especially the excellent performance Matt Damon, and lean and coherent script. The Martian might seem just another science fiction film, well, it is rather a film genre, however, is not ""just another"", he gets all the credit for innovating in the approach to the subject, differing quite recent successes in this category, rather than trying to follow the realistic mold and serious Interstellar or even the tension and paranoia of gravity, the film is based on completely different bases and behind an engaging story of sci-fi with an excellent mood and that is embedded incredible way within the script, by the way, this is perhaps the greatest asset of the film, it does not come as a comedy, but the good mood prevails throughout most of history which makes it much more engaging to the audience. About the same, the film shows no innovative plot, may be even classified as simple, but even that makes it all even better job, even with a story that you basically know how it will end, you still yes hooks you - you know going back to rescue him, but how? - And in all other respects it never seems forced or without cohesion. The visual effects are excellent as well, leaving the film as a whole extremely ""beautiful."" Matt Damon is fine, giving his charisma character, a sardonic air at various times, dramatic when it is necessary, in addition to appearance changes that show a huge commitment. In short, The Martian is more of a science fiction movie at a time of re-popularization of the genre, but innovating in the approach of its proposal, out of default, has an indisputable success, avoids saturation of this kind of movie and shows that science fiction has much more to give, certainly one of the best 2015 productions."

","This movie is about three brothers sent to Mars. Two die, and one, James Francis Ryan, is left stranded. NASA doesn't want to have to tell the mother it lost all three of her sons so it plans a dangerous rescue mission to save Ryan and bring him home. Well not exactly.<br/><br/>The actor and premise may bring back memories of a certain Spielberg film but this movie is actually more like a combination of Cast Away and Apollo 13. (Others have mentioned this.) Throw in a bit of Gravity, Mission To Mars, and Interstellar you have The Martian.<br/><br/>Does the feeling of familiarity make this movie bad? In this case, definitely not. Fortunately the Mars setting provides enough new elements to make this film interesting. The science is believable and, according to real scientists, fairly accurate. Matt Damon brings his usual likable, everyman charm. <br/><br/>Thinking of films about Mars released over the past couple decades like Mission To Mars, Red Planet, Ghost of Mars, and Mars Needs Moms, this movie is easily the best movie about Mars since Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall. Still, I can't shake the feeling that Ridley Scott must've watched Matt Damon's part in Interstellar and thought to himself, ""Gee, I could turn this into a 2-hour movie"" and did. But whatever the inspiration, this film was well done."

","If Matt Damon is stranded on Mars and is called a 'Martian,' why was E.T. an alien and not an 'Earthling?'<br/><br/>Where Cameron is obsessed with the deep, Scott is lost in space. In good way, that is. Though I love Alien, It was thoroughly interesting to see a more realistic approach to space travel. (Oh, and take THAT, InterstellarTHIS was much more real.)<br/><br/>While I wasn't a fan of the length – it really could've been trimmed a ton, or the Time Square crowds that would never happen in this case, The Martian was very captivating, inventive and engaging for the most part. Damon always impresses me and the twists to keep this simple idea of a castaway did motivate me to the end.<br/><br/>But, as the memes go, why does Damon keep needing rescuing? From Saving Private Ryan to aforementioned Interstellar to this, Damon's constantly in need of saving? Was it Team America that showed the world this Daaay- mon is worth it?<br/><br/>Overall, it's completely recommended, though some suspension of disbelief and patience is required.

","This science fiction movie seems to be same like intersellar and Gravity but its not. Matt Damon fights for survival in Oscar worthy performance and he nailed it completely. I don't think any one would have done this better than he did. An astronaut who is leaved behind on Mars due to an escalated storm survives on his own. He is an astronaut but a hell of botanist as well because definitely he just grew potatoes on a planet where it seems impossible to grow anything at all. The movie seems kind of same like gravity but that's one aspect of this film what we haven't seen is, his will to survive. He decides to live and fights for it. The most surprising element of this movie is that it has some hilarious parts as well and in fact its quite better than any comedy movies out there.

","I went into the screening of The Martian disappointed that Bridge of Spies was sold out and I'd have to settle for what I thought would be a lame sci-fi action flick. Boy was I surprised at how good this movie was. There is a lot going on with the story throughout the movie – yes, ""rescue Matt Damon"" is always the main plot, but the story went in unexpected and even complex directions that I didn't expect. There are the expected themes of loneliness, sacrifice, perseverance, etc., but also some really interesting scenes about corporate management, the purpose of space exploration, even about the value of a single human life. This is a movie that can serve as an entertaining popcorn flick, but it also has enough substance to be quite thought-provoking for those paying attention closely.<br/><br/>Matt Damon gives an excellent performance, especially in the most intense scenes. Supporting actors are good as well – this is definitely a film where Jeff Daniel's ""stoic harass boss"" character fits really well as the leader of NASA. I didn't find the visuals to be as stunning as many did, but maybe that's just because I had a crappy seat in the theater off to the side.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great sci-fi film that actually has a lot of, well, science. It's actually pretty nerdy at times, with some cool nerd jokes thrown in. I did find some of the humor to be too forced, seemingly present simply to keep the popcorn audience watching. Bad jokes and a ridiculous but forgivable ending aside, I have no major complaints about this movie. It's a wholly satisfying 2.5 hours of entertainment."

","This is a very, very good movie. It is good because it gives us Mark Watney. This man is a real superhero because he has the best attitude a human being can have. Immature people think of him as boring and one dimensional as they cannot distinguish lack of narcissism from lack of personality.<br/><br/>The super power of Mark Watney is optimism. He has lots of it and that's why he survives. And he survives good. It adds him and everyone else value cause we all get experience and knowledge out of it. He isn't handed super powers because he was victimized by evil forces and it's payback time. He isn't winning because he is the good one against evil forces. He isn't solving problems because he is magically so much better than anyone else. He isn't going insane from being victimized and expose us to a cringe show of pityfull weirdness. He isn't shining over and exploiting secondary characters that we agree to be so invaluable to just fit in the role of collateral damage. He, by himself, take the circumstances as they are and manages to work with them. He gets help from other people, not sucking their power away. Because he is optimistic.<br/><br/>This movie is so generous that it not only gives us the power of optimism but the source of it too. You don't get it out of positive thinking, self love, regular meditation or deep cynicism that you confuse with realism. You get it out of curiosity. Because you are someone who can see the tiny plant with tiny leaves on the ground and understand that it is something special. You even became a botanist to know more about it. So in essence, it is that tiny plant and your dedication to it, is what saves you.<br/><br/>This whole movie is a lesson on how to tell an actually good and meaningful story."

1. The costume and set design are are incredible and intricately designed.
2. The futuristic score and Disco soundtrack does a great job at suiting the space setting, as well as helping the film a lift when needed.
3. Matt Damon (Mark Watney) gives a fantastic performance.
4. The comedy is inserted well, and does an amazing job at preventing the movie from becoming too dark.
5. The cinematography is really eye-catching, especially the stunning and breathtaking shots of Mars.
6. All of the characters make intelligent and deep character decisions, which makes every decision hit harder, in addition to fully empathising with the characters and their ordeal.
7. When Mark Watney is finally reunited with Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), it is a genuinely emotional scene.<br/><br/>Cons:
1. There is some dodgy shaky cam in the beginning.
2. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, If NASA hates fire (including items that can contribute to fire), how come they let Rick Martinez (Michael Peña) bring a wooden crucifix to Mars? Surely they would check personal items taken by the astronauts? Another example would be the Chinese choosing to sacrifice their technology secrets to save an American astronaut; they would never do this in the real world.
3. The movie doesn't focus enough on the psychological impacts that being left alone, with very little hope of escape, on a strange planet would do to a person.
4. When narrating messages, the film bizarrely has the receiver and the sender both read out the message. You only need one.
5. Some of the characters are given very little, if anything, to do. This includes both Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) and Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig)."
"cathylr","3","0","0","11 May 2020"," Space made in Hollywood
","I watched amused at first as Matt Damon is interpreting an astronaut who has a great sense of humour, seems to be capable of many things, including growing plants on Mars. I was finding the visual excellent, a good pace and a great soundtrack. Having had a look at the bad critics, I preferred to ignore them and just enjoy. This was up to one hour and 20 minutes.
Then, not to give any spoiler, comes a subplot about a plot that made my brain scream ´What???´. From then, I started becoming very sceptical about the basis of this story. It is based on a book that I haven´t read and I don´t know if it is based on a real event but I hardly believe it would be.
As I am not a scientist, I had taken for granted that what was on the screen was plausible but this subplot was so improbable, it made me question the past hour and 20 minutes that I had watched.
Matt Damon is having a lot of fun alone, doing some experiments, listening to pop music, growing plants, talking to the camera like the man on the street. Would an astronaut actually act like that?
Would the film have stopped after one hour and 20 minutes, I would have thought ´great entertainment´ but because of the subplot that comes out of the blue, I watched the last hour from a very different perspective.
I appreciated the visual and the music but the characters are not believeable. Matt Damon is funny, even touching at times, but the other characters are nearly inexistant. And the end is definitely made in Hollywood, not on Mars.
Have a look but make sure that you don´t go beyond the 80th minute or you will get very disappointed."

","The Martian movie is a dream come true, a faithful elucidation of the central technical dramas that made the Andy Weir novel it's based on the surprise 'space geek hit' of the decade. The tale is something of a Robinson Crusoe in space: Astronaut Mark Watney is stranded on the surface of Mars when his crew mates are forced to evacuate their habitat and blast off for Earth. Watney must improvise ways to eke out his limited resources, as the next mission to the red planet isn't scheduled to land for another four years. Like the book, the movie's rhythm is a steady cycle of crisis, recovery, humor, determination, and new crisis. On screen, directed by Ridley Scott, these cycles are delivered with satisfying characterization and eye-grabbing visuals of Martian landscapes and mouth-gaping zero-G gymnastics in space.<br/><br/>As a backdrop to the human drama (and comedy), the movie's hardware is based on real engineering, not magical miracle machines. The Hermes mother ship, for example, is a modified version of the sound design strategy of a 'cycling spacecraft' that repeatedly makes the Earth-Mars-Earth loop with crew and small landing craft. (Buzz Aldrin and I wrote up the concept for Scientific American a decade ago.)<br/><br/>
As the left-for-dead Watney, played by Matt Damon, faces doom in a dozen guises, he defiantly boosts his courage through styling himself as everything from the ""best botanist on Mars"" (as he ingeniously grows potatoes in carefully-created garden soil) to a ""space pirate"" (for his goal of commandeering a rescue rocket emplaced automatically elsewhere on the planet). He expresses his thoughts to his laptop log and later in messages to people on earth campaigning to rescue him. When humans finally reach other planets, we will need real ""Watneys""-those smart enough to repurpose on-hand assets in an emergency, and lucky enough not to be killed by their own inevitable oversights.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Space geeks will enjoy identifying and debating technical flaws in the film. The Martian follows its source material remarkably closely, but unlike say, certain installments in the Harry Potter movie franchise, it will still make perfect sense to those who haven't read the book. Aside from the monster sandstorm that sets up the crisis (Andy Weir, the author of The Martian, is very upfront about choosing to gloss over the realities of Martian atmospheric pressure in favor of a dramatic opening), there are few noticeable factual flubs in the plot. Unlike 2013's Gravity and its magical space maneuvers, or 2014's Interstellar with its mystical time continuum tricks, this movie is a remarkably authentic exposition of what space travelers need to be able to do under crisis conditions.<br/><br/>Run time constraints forced the movie's producers to condense and combine characters, with no real detriment to the story-although viewers might be surprised to see the same set of key NASA experts showing up at every launch or space center on the planet as the action shifts between continents. Similar story-telling imperatives probably compelled the most striking departure (spoiler alert!) from the book-changing who actually goes to rescue Watney in the end-but again, without any significant detour from the plot.<br/><br/>There's no cheating on even highly-technical spaceflight topics, as shown in the treatment of the so-called ""Rich Purnell maneuver,"" wherein the Hermes slingshots past Earth back to Mars for a desperate pickup attempt. NASA's navigation geek Purnell-played with effective nervous energy by Donald Glover- demonstrates the ""orbitology"" of his maneuver, with two NASA officials as the planets, and a stapler and pens as spacecraft. The result is coherent, comprehensive, and surprisingly comic. The basic strategy of the Rich Purnell maneuver is not fictional-a crippled Japanese Mars probe named Nozomi actually used a similar Earth-flyby scheme to set up a second chance for its own faltering unmanned Mars mission a dozen years ago.<br/><br/>There's one cringeworthy trope in The Martian that has apparently become an unavoidable cultural myth: the scenes where teams in Mission Control erupt into leaping cheers a few seconds after a rocket blasts off. This imaginary practice would not only be utterly unprofessional but also an indicator of near-criminal negligence. In the screening that I attended following an event at NASA's Johnson Space Center, these scenes were negatively noticed by many NASA folks in the audience. But I only can suppose it was sympathetically meant to humanize the rocket scientists, and it was the only exception to the admiration shown for all the other portrayals. (It's also possible this trope has been influenced by footage of the controllers of deep space unmanned missions in recent years, where data about events can take hours to cross the solar system, leaving controllers mostly in the position of spectators during key mission milestones.)<br/><br/>After faithfully reproducing technically-sound crises and responses for two hours, the movie did briefly run off the track into fantasy mode at the very end, by by violating the physics of action-reaction in portraying an over-dramatized dramatic rescue attempt that really didn't need any such cheating. But if that was the price to pay for producing this otherwise magnificent space adventure story, the math checked out. Mother Nature is relentlessly unforgiving in space, but a movie audience can show a lot more mercy to one major technical transgression. I do."

I love that the film thinks people would be interested in space travel. I love the film's technical aspects creating a believable series of engineering feats that even look good to the eye. But I love the film as a light piece of scientific romance. It is not an intense exploration of the issues. It is not a drama.<br/><br/>The film sort of infamously won the best picture-comedy at the Golden Globes. I saw it after that happened and I was really surprised anyone had the problem with the classification. The film is extremely funny. It has running gags. It has puns. It has multiply asides that are only in the film because they are funny. Most of the actors have comedic backgrounds. But most of all the central plot largely exists to hang wonderment and scientific romance on.<br/><br/>Watney's death was only ever theoretical in the film. It was never a real possibility. The film repeatedly undermines the central tension with jokes. I think the film does this to focus the viewer on the engineering/science issues. The plot is faintly a little absurd in how the developments happen. Watney experiences all manners of set backs but, critically, they never ever seem more than he can handle; they are solved in fun ways. There's even a duck tape joke. This is a wonderful structure for a movie having fun with the engineering and the speculation of how a mars mission would work. Even in the film's darkest moments are tempered with optimism. Even as Watney fears his death and he is still at peace with it because he loves what he does. This tone works and the film is lovely as a result. But if you say the film is a drama it is too detached from Watney's possible death to work. The tension is never on if Watney will survive. It is on *how* Watney will survive and that makes it a scientific romance, not a drama.<br/><br/>Damon is wonderful in this film. Indeed this is such a well put together and everything works so well that it is a personal favorite of mine."

","Ridley Scott's film ""The Martian"" is a movie about a group of astronauts who go to Mars on a mission. Everything is going well until a storm hits, everyone gets out safe except for Mark Watney played by actor Matt Damon. Mark is struck by an object flying through the air during a catastrophic storm. The crew decides to leave Mark behind as they believe he has died. Turns out... He's alive. The rest of the movie is about Marks journey alone in mars and learning how to fight many obstacles in his attempt to get back home.
Ridley Scott and the screenwriter Drew Goddard do a very good job of answering your questions throughout the film. For example, there are many times in the film where us as viewers may be confused because of physics or some other common fact. Like, what if he runs out of food, or what if he runs out of normal air. They answer those questions. Throughout the rest of the movie Matt Damon plays his part as mark exceptionally well. His part is to play a lonely Botanist on a deserted planet, with many movies such as... Star Wars you can tell they aren't actually on some sort of odd planet, but with the Martian you almost forget that he isn't on Mars he's actually in Wadi Rum, Jordan. Mark keeps you intrigued, because when he does come across an obstacle he's is very comedic about it. He not only shows how intelligent he is by conquering a nearly impossible task, but he does it in a humorous way which gives us a sense of reality.
Many will say that the Martian is predictable, I agree with them. Instead of choosing to fight predictability, the film The Martian chooses to let it happen and lean into it. The Martian does seem like a very scripted movie when it comes to knowing what is coming next, but I don't believe that it takes away from the heart touching plotline of it. Much like the new film Ford VS Ferrari that Matt damon also plays a lead role in. In the movie we can see what is about to happen. When he is told to cross the finish line with the rest of the Ford cars it was very predictable and obvious that one singular person was going to win. Matt Damon gives off the vibe and aroma that ""everything will be ok"". In Many of the films that Matt stars in we know that everything tends to work out in his favor just because we want it to.
During all of this crazy nonsense up in Mars, Back on earth NASA is trying to beat the clock and get Mark food and supplies in time. They also just decided to tell the team that Mark is in fact still alive. NASA proposed 2 ideas, Wait for the next mission to send supplies, or the team goes back for him. In a heartbeat every team member decided to lengthen their trip greatly and go back for their friend. Mark was given the exciting news and nearly broke down. He then started his plan for take off. Although he was getting saved it was a very complicated rescue mission. Mark was supposed to launch himself in space and then connect to the large spaceship that the crew was on. Everything seemed to be in order until Physics isn't lining up, the velocity was way too high and the distance from Mark to the crew was way too large. Mark came up with the idea while flying through space that he should leave his aircraft and proppell himself by cutting a hole in his air filled suit to navigate himself. Everyone thought this was stupid, but mark did it anyways without thinking twice. In a very nerve wracking travel through space ****Mark returned home safely.*****
Overall I think the Martian is a very well produced, heartwarming film about an astronaut Mark Watney who is stranded on Mars. Although the movie is very predictable I don't believe it takes away from the film in any sort of impacting way. I will definitely continue to watch this movie ritually as i believe it is one of the greatest films."

","Despite the isolation of the protagonist from the rest of the characters, action that is stretched out far too long, and the lack of more atmospheric shots, ""The Martian's"" witty script keeps the audience's interest alive in every scene. Space may be dangerous and intimidating, but the joy of scientific discovery and when things just work is addictive.<br/><br/>When a freak sandstorm injures him and forces his crew to evacuate, protagonist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) must use his resourcefulness and his persistence to his advantage and work on a way to get back home. The wittiness of this movie is brought about by Watney himself, and occasional remarks from Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who are back on earth. With the many remarks and jokes he makes throughout the film, despite the possibility that he will die alone on Mars, he keeps the audience entertained and willing to watch more. The soundtrack is also a definite plus, with ABBA's ""Waterloo"" and Donna Summer's ""Hot Stuff"" giving the tone a slight facelift after some poor delivery of lines.<br/><br/>And back on earth, with the crew at NASA leading the charge, the world is setting their sights on helping Watney succeed and bringing him home alive.<br/><br/>As there's nobody there to talk to (because he's alone on an entire planet), Watney adapts to the way of constantly talking to himself or to multiple cameras that are constantly filming around the small space station. This eliminates what could have been lacking from the entire film by leaving the protagonist alone by himself for a long period of time without communicating with any other characters. By constantly glancing up at the central camera that was filmed with, Damon gives the audience the feeling that he's talking specifically to them and it gives this film a personal touch that's impossible to pass up.<br/><br/>Of course, not all movies are perfect. And there are definitely examples of flaws in this movie. One of them, the most noticeable and most detrimental to the movie as a whole, is how the action is played out. It's very dragged out and seems like it takes 15 minutes to get through a 5 minute scene of action. But I bet that Matt had a ton of fun flipping around for hours on end. Another flaw that's noticeable in this movie is the lack of shots in actual space. Compared to the classic space movie, like the movie ""Gravity"" and even movies like ""Apollo 13"", this movie barely has any shots of space; and the only ones are near the end of it. Most of the shots take place on a planet, whether it be Mars or Earth. This doesn't necessarily take anything away from the film as a whole. But, for a space movie, I would have loved to see more shots of space or at least something more atmospheric that would add something to the feel of this film. The formula of switching back and forth between three types of setting makes the film a little stale and slightly predictable. Every time I saw the scene on Earth wrapping up, I would always think: ""I wonder what Mark's doing back on Mars? Farming some potatoes? Oh, ok.""<br/><br/>Overall, I really liked this movie and would encourage you to go watch it."

","What a brilliant movie. It is one of those films you can watch on repeat over and over and still enjoy just as much each time.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is in his element here. Combining good humour and some clever one liners with the sense of hopelessness and loneliness that comes with living on an entire planet on your own. His performance helps you believe you are there with him struggling in those harsh Martian conditions.<br/><br/>I personally love Interstellar when it comes to my favourite space related sci-fi movie of all time. But if Interstellar is a 10/10 the Martian is a 9.999999999/10. Terri would not agree with this statement as it is tough to split the two.<br/><br/>Decent book too if you have the time to read it.

"S-Hite-Forbranes","3","0","0","17 December 2019"," The Martian - Scientific Accuracy is Lost in Space.
","Ridley Scott's late career nosedive into banal mediocrity continues unchecked. Thinking back on it, the last Ridley Scott film I actually enjoyed was Black Hawk Down, which is now seventeen years old. After being disappointed with Kingdom of Heaven (I thought a movie about the Crusades might feature some actual Crusading, wanton slaughter and pillaging, but there wasn't really very much at all, the Christians and Muslims all seem to be getting along fairly well in this one. I almost expected them to all hold hands and sing ""Give Peace a Chance"" at the end), along with American Gangster, Prometheus, and not to mention the absolutely awful Alien: Covenant, it appears that Ridley Scott is losing it in his old age. You can't blame him for it, I mean the dude's gotta be nearly eighty years old. You have to give him some respect for the fact that he is still a prolific director at his age, even if his 21st century films can't measure up to his classics. Methinks time may be nigh for him to step away from the camera.<br/><br/>Henceforth let it be proclaimed that Sir Ridley of Scott shalt retire forthwith, and spare the kingdom of Hollywoodland and its subjects the tribulations and vexations thou doth suffer from the pestilential miasma of his heretical, blasphemous, and thrice damned Alien prequels, lest a plague afflicts his peasants with unsightly boils. (I knew I really shouldn't have watched the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven).<br/><br/>And so, on to The Martian. It seems like Matt Damon is now Hollywood's go to guy when it comes to portraying astronauts stranded on distant planets, but at least his character in this one is a bit more heroic than the cowardly Dr. Mann from Interstellar.<br/><br/>Even though my expectations were quite low, I was still prepared to give The Martian a look. A realistic, near future science fiction film that was marketed as a scientifically accurate depiction of a manned mission to Mars, based on a best-selling novel. Surely Sir Ridley couldn't stuff this one up too badly could he? With a sinking feeling I realised that it sure seemed like it, when the incident that leaves Matt Damon's character stranded on Mars was based on total horse manure ""Hollywood Science.""<br/><br/>I have three questions regarding the ""Scientific Accuracy"" of The Martian.
Who was the scientific adviser? What were they smoking when they read the script? Where can I get some?<br/><br/>I am not an astrophysicist, I flunked physics in High School, yet even I could have done a better job advising the film-makers on scientific accuracy than the so-called ""Scientific Adviser"" they used. I wonder what this individual actually did to earn their paycheck? Nothing at all as far as I can tell. Here's the thing: Due to the low atmospheric pressure on Mars, the most powerful dust storm possible would be comparable to nothing more than a light breeze on Earth. It would barely have the power to mess up your hair, let alone topple the ascent vehicle or blow heavy equipment around like projectiles. The only danger such a storm would pose would be due to low visibility, you could potentially trip over and tear your suit, smash your visor, or fall into a deep crater. It really wouldn't have been too difficult for the author to devise a scientifically accurate reason for Watney's stranding on Mars, it's just lazy writing and a lack of research.<br/><br/>Suspension of Disbelief rogered senseless and thrown right out the window. There are many more plot-holes and scientific inaccuracies in The Martian, which I won't bother to list. They sure as hell didn't ""Science the "" out of the screenplay, that's for sure. Although to be fair I haven't read the novel, and I don't know if the reason for the astronaut's stranding was the same as the film, so it might not be Ridley Scott's fault, but then again why bother hiring a scientific adviser?<br/><br/>Why would a botanist even be included on a mission to Mars? There sure ain't no plant life to study, and considering they have found Martian meteorites that contain fossilised bacteria a micro-biologist would make more sense.<br/><br/>Oh well, at least Ridley Scott knows how to ramp up the tension and suspense I thought, and the tale of Watney's efforts to survive would at least be satisfying on that level, but it seems Scott has forgotten how to achieve this (maybe he should go back and watch Alien again to remind himself), as there was no suspense generated at all, and I found the whole thing pretty underwhelming and rather boring. And to top it all off the ending blatantly rips off Red Planet. What is it with movies about Mars? Mission to Mars, Red Planet, John Carter of Mars, all very bad films. One day someone will make a good science fiction film about Mars, but The Martian sure as hell ain't it. I must admit though that The Martian looked great, the production design and cinematography were good, and the cast weren't bad so it gets three out of ten. A Ridley Scott film is always going to be visually impressive that's a given, but his choice of mediocre scripts and screenwriters ensures that his modern films are very underwhelming dramatically and thematically"

","Fun movie with bad science. Even the premise is bad. Read about Mars dust storms if you would like to know but don't get me wrong, I love the science fiction genre for both entertainment and implication. I don't even mind bad science if there is decent character development example, Ad Astra, Gravity, etc. With that being said, the martian is a film that leans toward entertainment and carries an overall optimistic tone despite events that would likely bear great emotional, psychological affects on any realistic main character. I believe it to be a blockbuster geared to make money. I do think Matt Damon is a decent actor but I could think of better actors to portray a stranded astronaut but hey, excellent acting was not the films intended purpose. There is little character development. The film is fun to look at but it's a generic rescue story that little to chew on intellectually afterward."

","3 October 2015. This is a survival story about a stranded astronaut on Mars starring Matt Damon. Surprisingly this movie doesn't seem like one that Ridley Scott directed. It has much more of a popular, mainstream undertone to it much like what Clint Eastwood accomplished with his Space Cowboys (2000). Two minor weaknesses seem to occur in the movie where like Alfonso Cauron's Gravity (2013) the opening scene appears too theatrically cute instead of a more serio-comically compelling and authentic sharp realism like that directed by Stanley Kubrick as with his 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Gravity at least transforms into a more serious dramatic and intimate performance unlike The Martian which seems to retain more of a space opera format and hoping the use of hard technology throughout would somehow make this movie superlative. The mainstream, popularity flourish that Ridley Scott incorporates into this movie permeates most of the dialogue and performances that takes away from the visceral immediacy of the moment. A smaller problem occurs with Ridley Scott's use of oral narrative between Watney and others as the text messages are being typed to simply inform audience of what is being said. I imagine that by the time a real Mar's mission is underway a redundant system of both visual and audio communication will be common place. Even today with the Dragon Program, it's possible to provide text and oral computer communication simultaneously. A computer synthesized voice instead of the actor's speaking their own lines would have had much more of a sensory impact. At the very least a computer program could have been downloaded to Watney's base station to allow for this oral/text transmission.<br/><br/>In the end what Ridley Scott seems to have accomplished is a photographically gorgeous setting and set design that, however, still can't be sufficiently enhanced into perfect reality with today's 3-D imaging technology. Other more powerful, visually dramatic and appealing, and intense performances having space as its primary subject matter include:<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's Alien (1979). Tom Hank's Apollo 13 (1995). Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). Maria Lidon's Stranded (2001). Duncan Jones' Moon (2009). Defying Gravity (2009 television series). Gonzalo Lopez-Gallegos' Apollo 18 (2011). Alfonso Cauron's Gravity (2013) Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014).<br/><br/>What would have been spectacular would have been whether or not Ridley Scott could have followed in the approach of William Eubank's Love (2011) about an abandoned astronaut aboard the International Space Station or William Eubank had an opportunity to try to direct The Martian."

","'The Martian (2015)' is neither a musical nor a comedy, though it's definitely a film with Matt Damon's face on the poster (behind a wall of text, of course, so that it fits in with all the other Damon/ Text-wall marketing). This space-based survival story strands its hero as far away from Earth as is plausibly possible in a pseudo science-fiction, but apparently more 'science-fact', picture and focuses on the ingenuity of humanity - or, rather, of a specific human - as good old-fashioned agriculture combines with modern day technology to bring life to even the most barren of places. The piece is pretty entertaining throughout, even if it is predictable and becomes downright silly towards its overblown finale. These issues dampen the sense of stakes somewhat, though individual sequences are still suspenseful, and reduce possible audience investment. Still, they don't eliminate the enjoyment that comes from the snappy dialogue, aesthetically-pleasing visuals and 'inspiring' central story. 7/10"

","The Martian is a film about an astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who is inadvertently left stranded on Mars. There was a very bad storm and the crew thinks that Mark died in the storm. They perform an emergency take off to get out of the storm and consequently Mark is left behind. With limited rations to keep himself alive, until he can be rescued, Mark must get created to survive. His role in the crew was as a botanist and it comes in handy for Mark's survival. 
I believe there are two general themes in The Martian. First off, the isolation Mark has to endure while on Mars completely alone is a test in itself. Mark does not directly discuss the hardships of being alone but he displays several emotions surrounding the fact that he is alone and scared. For example, when he first makes contact with Earth and realizes they are aware of his survival he breaks down in tears of joy. Mark also copes with being alone by speaking to his diary camera and he using these to make jokes regarding his situation. The other theme of this movie is perseverance. The perseverance of Mark Watney is display in this film over and over again. One example of Mark's perseverance is when he realizes he does not have enough food rations to survive long enough to get rescued. Instead of giving up, Mark decides to pull together all of his scientific knowledge and figure out a solution. Mark gets very creative and finds a way to grow potatoes on Mars. During his process of discovering a process to grow potatoes, Mark nearly blows himself up and learned from this mistake. He perseveres through this mistake and keeps going on. Mark's persaverence reminds me of the strong perserverance of Andy Dufresne in The Shawshank Redemption where the never give up attitude is on display. 
One scene where the director used visual techniques to interpret the action was when Mark was re-entering the Hab and it exploded. There was a small hole in the side of the airlock that caused a breach in the air pressure, resulting in an explosion. During this scene it rapidly switches from a first person view to a third person view. By shooting from the point of view of Mark, the director utilizes a subjective point of view in order to emotionally intensify the scene for the viewer. I believe this was a very effective way to shoot the scene because switching from third and first person makes the action more chaotic and intense for the viewer. This scene is another excellent example of Mark's perseverance because he could have just gave up and left the Hab in its wrecked condition. Instead Mark chose to repair it and continue his fight for survival."

","Set in the near future, a NASA astronaut (Matt Damon) is stranded on Mars. NASA attempts to bring him home.<br/><br/>It's easy to compare ""The Martian"" to other popular science-fiction films. The Damon character is like the earthling version of ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"". His situation is also similar to that of the Sandra Bullock character in ""Gravity"".<br/><br/>""The Martian"" is entertaining even if it doesn't meet the higher level of the other films mentioned nor of many other well loved sci-fi films such as ""Apollo 13"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". There is a lot of scientific jargon that is difficult to understand for the average viewer and the movie seems a bit long. There is also a fair share of cheesy, sentimental jingoism that is cringeworthy at times. Just one more grudge: the main character seems to reflect the writers in holding a 30-plus year grudge against the fact that some people like disco music of the 70s. (Get over it, man-boys.)<br/><br/>But overall, ""The Martian"" is enjoyable. Damon (like Bullock in ""Gravity"") is more than able to live up to the difficult task of keeping the viewer interested in long scenes while being the only person on screen. The NASA staff also seemed to reflect a solid gender and racial diversity. (Hollywood is finally catching up here.) And the very talented director Ridley Scott shows his able hands are at work once again as he did in other great sci-fi flicks ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" and his best work ""Thelma and Louise"".<br/><br/>Despite the flaws, it's still entertaining."

 Living in isolation I feel should have been one of the biggest issues in this movie. He never seems to be hugely effected by it in any way you'd expect.

","The subject of the movie is very good, a man who tries to survive in Mars in isolation and tries to make a connection with the world, again in order to survive. The unbearable thing about the movie is too much melodrama. There is melodrama in every scene, even at the cheerful ones. Music, shooting and acting are so overwhelmingly dramatic that movie does not even let you experience its drama; it goes through all emotions by itself. In other words, the events and their reflection on us are shadowed by the over dramatization in the movie. Additionally, the structure of the scenerio is also overwhelming, as there are many peaks of it, presented through the very dramatic music. That degree of melodrama is bearable when the world is attacked by aliens or zombies, and there are actions scenes. Stay away from this movie if you do not like melodrama, but you may like it if you LOVE the subject or fan of the book or any actor in the movie."

Ditto the choice of music - as if 2001 A Space Odyssey had used Priscilla Queen of the Desert for its soundtrack. Ultimately, this film seems to be confused about what it wants to be. It starts out as a gripping thriller but then turns into something weirdly light-hearted. A pity, it showed promise but didn't deliver."

","There's so much that works in this motion picture you have to hand the biggest laurel wreath to the great Ridley Scott - director extraordinaire - top of the podium. Then next of prominence is the charisma of Matt Damon, even though he's not given a great deal to work with and who's head's inside a goldfish bowl half the time - but hey that's all in a great actor's stride. Damon's like the plucky astronaut - he manages his lengthy confinement with a cocky smile. There's a suite of good actors supporting - Jessica Chastain is great as the sinewy redheaded mission commander, there a side-line in pathos and earthiness from the great Yorkshireman Sean Bean. I've just seen him doing a great working class parish priest in the drama Broken - he's doing similar here as a lonely voice of conscience. There's the energy of Michael Peña, vulnerability of boss Jeff Daniels, anyway lots of talent. There's funky music that works perfectly. The story is science-based and quite technical and the visual effects stunning so it's got a realism and credibility to it. It's just short of the 10/10 I just gave The Informants! where Matt Daman was given more of a blank cheque to strut his stuff. Ultimately there's just a tad of a lack of a certain depth and drama, a gap in a certain something that was perhaps sacrificed for that overall broadly entertaining package. It's no Tarkovsky's Solaris and no existentialist masterpiece, but its a darn-well executed sci-fi yarn that covers a fair demographic spread of appeal. It's one to recommend to anyone even vaguely interested in space and technology, and well, who isn't?"

"bowmanblue","7","0","0","20 June 2017"," Matt on Mars
","Okay, I'll admit it – I'm not a huge Matt Damon fan. I can't get that impression of him from 'Team America: World Police' out of my head (if you've seen the film you'll know the one I mean!). Therefore, when I heard that 'The Martian' was about him being an astronaut stranded on Mars, my initial reaction was oh, well, never mind. However, after watching the film, I'm still no real convert for Matt himself, but I can say that the film is actually pretty good.<br/><br/>It's been getting quite a lot of praise heaped upon it and, although I did enjoy it, I'd hardly liken it to the classic that some people are hailing it as. As I've said, Matt Damon is part of the first manned mission to Mars and, when a freak sandstorm hits, his crew are forced to perform an emergency evacuation, stranding him there in the process. I knew that going into the film and actually expected it to be only about Matt Damon, hardly ever featuring anyone else. I was pleased to say that the scenes on the red planet are constantly interspersed with those back on Earth as the rest of the world (well, Nasa mainly) is tasked with the solution to finding him a way back home. But, ultimately, it's Matt's show and it's mainly about him. And, I'm pleased to say he comes across as a likable guy to be stuck on – technically – an alien planet with (at least from an audience's perspective anyway!).<br/><br/>So, he goes about his business doing his best to survive with the limited resources he has to hand. It's nice to see a film where it's actually quite dramatic without the need for all those other – apparent – nasties that Mars has spawned. Matt Damon's life is difficult enough staying warm, without worrying about green bug-headed aliens in flying saucers, ghosts who possess your body and force you to self-mutilate, or borderline fascist corporate men in suits who want to keep the air for themselves in order to stay in power.<br/><br/>I should probably mention that it's directed by Ridley Scott who, when he's not doing weird things to the 'Alien' franchise, still has it when it comes to directing epic landscapes and beautiful scenery. Also, it's originally based on a book of the same name; I haven't read that (I barely have time to watch a two hours film, let alone read words!) so I can't really comment on how faithful this adaptation really is.<br/><br/>It's hard to say too much more about this film. It's a nicely-simply affair and the threat comes from the harsh environment Matt Damon is stranded in, rather than the afore-mentioned other filmic nasties from Mars. Okay, so there's a little conflict with the other characters back on Earth with how they deal with the 'political' fallout that stems from effectively blasting off from orbit and not bothering to check whether one of your people was still planting potatoes! Plus, when I saw the run-time was over two hours I did wonder whether it would hold my attention and I'm pleased to say that it did. I'd definitely watch this again, maybe not soon, but it's worth a second watch at some point."

","This movie was different from what I expected from watching all the other futuristic space-sci-fi movies. I would say it is more realistic than other space movies, but still, its science fiction. This movie does focus more on the humanly aspects of survival and isolation than technical and scientific aspects. And this also does make the plot a little contrived and the heroic behavior of the characters and the happy ending is pretty predictable. (Although its also allows it to have some amusing scenes that I enjoyed.) However, it is entertaining to see how he survives in such harsh conditions of the huge planet of mars, and how the contact with another human lets his life go on. This movie also illustrates the importance of a single human life. The visuals of this movie is very clean and grand like all futuristic movies, and it's fun to see the huge spaceships and the planet Mars."

The Martian has humor and charm that brings a kind of levity and watchability to a film that would otherwise feel emotionally exhausting to watch. <br/><br/>The film features an incredibly strong performance by Matt Damon as well as the rest of the cast. Visual effects are top notch and cinematography is a wonder to behold. The Martian is groundbreaking in its technical and storytelling achievements and is overall paced nearly perfectly. There are a few 3rd act inconsistencies but these feel minor since the 1st and 3rd act are incredibly strong. <br/><br/>Despite the story probably feeling familiar and a few pacing issues, The Martian is an excellent film that will attract casual movie goers and critical audiences alike.

","The Martian captured the fears and dangers of every space adventure while keeping the tone light-hearted and humorous. At times almost too funny, the drama could never be fully embraced by the audience but still acknowledged in the worst moments. The Martian also managed to involve the crew's personal lives without pulling emotion away from Watney. The bureaucratic conversations were at times stale but mostly understandably necessary. Matt Damon carried his scenes beautifully with his support staff of disco music and potatoes, enough so that I, at times, missed him and his sarcastic self- deprecation in other scenes that were easily forgettable. Wiig's character, though, was unnecessary and superficial, spending her time making blatantly obvious statements rather than doing any actual work to appease the public or bring Watney home. She was almost pathetic when compared to other, much stronger, female characters. There was also the bit with Glover's character that was dragged on way longer than it needed to be. Getting to the point faster wouldn't have taken away any of the story in this case. Also, that part of the story line seemed completely unrealistic in terms of the extent Glover's character had to explain his idea for it to make sense to the others in the room and the stealth that had to occur for it to happen. Sometimes, it was like the filmmakers felt obligated to make a space movie longer than two hours because most are. In the end, the story was almost too predictable and a bit more surprise would've been appreciated but the action scenes were enough to tide me over in terms of dramatic content. However, it was a space movie that effectively used math and science without oversimplifying or having to drone on and on to explain. Also, it was a gorgeous movie. The Mars depicted in this movie was not the most scientifically accurate, considering the sandstorm that occurred in the beginning, but it was an awfully pretty sight. Most space movies are easily given good notes for their cinematography because it's difficult to go wrong with twinkling stars and sweeping shots of floating spaceships but The Martian deserves special kudos for its work."

","Matt Damon, the star in The Martian, took the main role of the movie and with his humor and sarcasm, created one of the most thought-provoking science films of the century. Even as a person who normally finds the idea of space a bit boring, the amount of science applications in the movie made it an absolute fascination to watch. When the astronauts experience a storm on Mars and are forced to leave because their base is threatened, they have to leave Mark Watney (Matt Damon) behind with the thought that he was killed by flying debris. When Watney wakes later, with metal impaled in his stomach, he finds himself completely alone on the planet, with minimum food, no way to communicate with Earth and about every possible thing that could be wrong with being alone on a planet. Watney figures out that he needs to grow food by using his and the others excrement's as a fertilizer and while the idea of it is absolutely disgusting, it gives way for all things that science can do. Watney's fight to get off the planet and back home alive and in one piece, is inspiring and shows all that science can do. The next to impossible fight to be able to communicate with Earth shows just what kinda limits can be broken with faith and science. About every possible thing that could go wrong with Watney's mission does exactly that. When his pod blew, which held his food and necessities, it seemed like the absolute end for Watney. His humor even when death was right around the corner made the edge of your seat a permanent place to sit and hope for the best. The constant and tireless work of the scientists and NASA members to try and get Watney home is inspiring not only to an audience but also to all of science."

This film is directed at the older generation with songs that are already overplayed enough. Soundtrack ripped straight off heart radio. The OST is good (Harry Gregson-Williams is my favourite composer) but add in the cheesy 'waterloo' and all is lost.

"BRYN-26","7","0","0","31 July 2016"," Could have been a classic
","The book The Martian is essentially a journal, making a movie of such a book is often very difficult, however, in this respect the movies succeeds, almost admirably. It does cut out a fair bit of the story, but not too much and the movies follows the narrative of the book quite closely. Having really enjoyed the book (apart from the ending – more on that later) I was keen to see the movie, mainly for the Mars vistas and for the spaceships. I was not disappointed, these two elements were simply stunning, and it is worth watching the movie for these elements alone. As mentioned, the story is conveyed well and the acting is on the whole good (with the exception of one atrociously bad character – more on that later), Mat Damon is as watchable as ever.<br/><br/>So, why isn't this movie a classic? In some places it comes very close. The obvious comparison is Apollo 13, in terms of story and visuals. And it is against this yardstick that the movie fails. In fact there is really only one failure, but it is such a big one in a space movie that I just can't let it go. In Apollo 13 (1995) the zero gravity environment (floating astronauts in the spaceship) is done perfectly. In The Martian, using CGI that's had 21yrs to improve upon Apollo 13, it fails miserably and painfully. In some shots I could see (almost literally) the harness and the guiderails upon which the actors were clearly whizzing along, this was almost forgivable, but then after floating badly along a corridor the astronaut transitioned to the rotating section of the spaceship whereupon they were ""sucked by gravity"" (presumably this was the idea) into the corridor at 90 degrees to their original direction of motion. This was painful on the eye (as gravity due to rotation doesn't work like that), but to make matters worse they showed the same transition twice, as if they were proud of this effect! This one scene (or one scene twice) ruined the movie for the same reason that George Clooney's ""falling away from the spaceship after letting go of the strap"" did in Gravity. In a space movie these things are fundamental, when they are wrong we are taken from the moment and left wondering who the much vaunted ""scientific advisors"" are?<br/><br/>It is a shame to focus on the negatives, but here are two more. Firstly, the character of Rich Purnell played by Donald Glover. I don't think this was Donald Glover's fault, I expect he played him as directed. The character was an abomination! We have seen the same ""nerdy clumsy forgetful insightful bumbling"" scientist character over and over again in Hollywood movies, and here he is, back again. This particular variant could have been lifted wholesale from Terminator 2, he was the guy in the computer lab, ""Mr Dyson.., er, Mr Dyson.."" (drops coffee, drops pencil, trips up..) ""Mr Dyson.."". Did I mention that Rich Purnell drops his coffee? Then trips up getting more coffee (think Jeff Goldblum here if you like). He eventually makes it back to his computer where he has dinosaurs along the top of the screen ""vegisaurus Lex, vegisaurus"" (sorry, different movie). Because all physics nerds are naturally also anthropologists.<br/><br/>Okay, nearly the end of the moaning (did I mention that the movie is actually pretty good! – more on that to finish). The second let down is the ending, which is sadly also in the book. Apart from a few Hollywood adjustments the ending of the movie is the same as the book, which is a shame, as it's rubbish. Here I think Andy Weir deliberately wrote a ""Hollywood ending"" with the eventual movie firmly in his mind. He would have been better off just focusing on the rendezvous (without the bomb malarkey) as that would have been exciting enough. Instead it was clearly a case of how can we make something that's already nerve bitingly exciting and enthralling even better? With fireworks! Yey! No!! This lets the book and the movie down. This is a Transformers finale in a 2001-esqu movie, painful and unnecessary.<br/><br/>To finish on a high, or on a song, there are good songs in the movie! I would recommend the movie, apart from the gripes (above) the movie is well made and the visuals are simply stunning. I look forward to the day when what is portrayed in the movie is made real, it all looks plausible! C'mon NASA!"

","Ridley Scott has given us some of the best films ever, tackling every genre from romance to Science Fiction.

Hearts stopped as both technology and outer space biology gave us the best monsters of the 70's. He went on to improve on ""2001"" by taking the mind of artificial intelligence and have them play God. Here, he goes back to the resilience of humans, and with a bit of humour, plenty of heart, and a very intelligent marriage of old fashioned story telling and much respect for the promising future of space travel, he gives us a new cinematic gem.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" creates a universe where a human learns to use his resources to overcome adversity and very unlucky night when he's left behind by his crew. He must find ways to survive, to let the rest of the universe, especially Earth, know that he's alive, but that also means that they must find a way to get him back and save face while dealing with politics, the limits of contemporary space science, and the ability to make a film that refrains from relying too much on special effects, but which has its feet strongly planted on common sense and realism.<br/><br/>Damon is wonderful as the man who keeps up his spirits and uses every bit of knowledge to keep going. His acting hasn't been this good since he gave us the dark leech in ""Ripley"". Here he has a heart, a brain, and plenty of courage as he faces every possible obstacle that he faces. Unlike other films out there where knives have suddenly become less lethal than before, this man is threatened by equipment that pierces his suit and his abdomen, which makes him cringe and shudder with pain and whose body shrivels as he is running out of food. There's a terrific scene where his eyes sink in despair as he is confronted with the loss of his garden, something that signifies his imminent death. He's no superman, just a regular human being who fights to keep both his body and spirit alive.<br/><br/>Almost as good as Damon are the rest of the supporting cast, which work each role to find options to bring him back to Earth. ""Gravity"" gave us plenty of thrills and emotions. Things are subdued most of the time here, but the climax is proof that people like Scott are able to use the best of what is available to them and give us quality film making. We are soon joining the rest of the human community, cheering, holding our breath, wringing our hands as we await for his success. ""Argo"" gave us a taste of what a good old fashioned crowd pleaser can do. ""The Martian"" takes it even higher because we get to bond and identify with this ""Martian"" who happens to be the best scientist on that planet.<br/><br/>Funny, exciting, rewarding, intelligent, and perfectly directed, just the way movies used to be, should be, and hopefully will be in the future.<br/><br/>Thanks Mr. Scott."

But not this time this time it's different, and that is surprising, because I'm impossible to please. You could say that I'm a very tough critic. So here is what I thought of The Martian. Oh and POSSIBLE SPOILR ALERT.. (1= The Picture is sharp so sharp that it already looks like it's in 4K, and I watched it off my PVR. <br/><br/>(2=This movie kind of reminds me of 'Moon' which is also a great movie except without the A.I. Computer HAL. And what I mean by that is that is that is that both movies have someone being left alone on a planet or moon that has no atmosphere and both wanted to go home to earth and both also are forced to make do on what they have. The only deference is that in this movie he has the ability to communicate back to earth, and not rely on old recordings. And of course the only other deference is that one of is trying to get off a moon and the other is trying to get off mars.<br/><br/>(3=The Sound Track in this movie is among one of the best that I have heard in any movie that I have heard in any movie in a long time. I might even try to hunt down the actual Sound Track for the movie itself and by it. The Sound Track is that good, the only song that I wasn't really impressed with was the song by Frank Sinatra 'I Well Survive' during the end credits. Don't get me wrong I loved that song, and there lays the problem. I don't know why they did it? For one reason or another they trimmed that song down to only about a minute and a half to two minutes. I wished they would have found a way to fit that song in and the rest of the songs they choose. Spectrally in uncomfortable situations or scenes. <br/><br/>(4= The story is so good it literally sucks you in mentally, and at the same time makes you feel like you are part of the movie, and it gives you the chance to actually not only care about the characters and the rescue mission, but it also makes you care on how they try to rescue Matt Damon. Soin other words it gets you invested in itself. <br/><br/>(5=he science in the movie actually feels real world accurate. <br/><br/>(6= There are some funny moments in the movie that you know aren't supposed to be but they end up being any ways. But in a good way. <br/><br/>(7=This movie not only reminds me of Moon but somehow it also for me anyways feels like the movie Castaway in space. Well the plot of it does anyways. (8=Don't let the PG13 Rating fool you, because for a PG13 movies there is a lot of cursing in it. So this one is not for the kiddys despite its PG13 Rating. <br/><br/>(CP=This is a true triumph of a movie not only because. SPOILR ALERT: You truly feel triumphant in the end. And as I have said before I'm not usually impressed by movies like this, I seem to be more drawn to movies with Explosions and Comic Heroes, or at least something with a Sci-Fi group.

","The film I will be discussing today is Ridley Scott's 2015 The Martian. The Martian is an action/drama film starring Matt Damon as Mark Whatney. Mark Whatney is an astronaut stranding on Mars after his crew aborted their mission because of inclement weather. Whatney was hit with debris during the storm and the crew thought he was killed because he was not responding to them when they tried to make contact to him. Whatney is then forced to make 31 days of food last four years if he is able to make contact with NASA. Fortunately Mark is a botanist and is able to make potatoes grow on a ""planet where nothing grows."" Being 52 million miles away from Earth a lot can grow wrong and Mark has his fair of setbacks. From the hob malfunctioning to blowing himself up to his crops dying. He is able to make contact with NASA and which in turns figures out a way to keep Mark alive until a crew can reach him. When the launch to get food to Mark fails they turn to an unlikely hero Rich Purnell played by Donald Glover for an idea so send Whatney's original crew back to get him. This comes with dangers as NASA does not support this dangerous mission it is then left up to the crew to make the decision whether to risk their lives to save him. His crew consisted of Commander Melissa Lewis played by Jessica Chastain, Rick Martinez played by Michael Pena, Beth Johannsen played by Kate Mara, Chris Beck played by Sabastian Stan, and Alex Vogel played by Askel Hennie. The theme to The Martian is survival against all odds. The whole point to the film is for Mark to find a way to survive on Mars, without sufficient food, water, or even human contact. Mark using his knowledge of botany was able to grow potatoes on Mars using surface dirt, human waste, and potatoes he already had until the hob malfunctioned and he lost his crops. Before that he had plenty of potatoes. This was Mark's way to survive against all odds, he was even able to control fire on the planet where controlling elements does not exist. <br/><br/>Mark was also able to use what was left behind to contact NASA a feat that was against him and failure after failure he did not give up when most people would. His thirst to live kept him alive and he was able to make contact with them. Survival against all odds. In the end Mark was able to sling shot himself into space to intercept with the crew's ship. When he launched there was no promise that this would work and no second chances would be given. How many people would live out the rest of their days on a different planet and would risk their life in an instant to be saved and make it back home? Survival against all odds. That's what Whatney chose.<br/><br/>A film with another plot line but same thing was 127 Hours. Aron Ralston played by James Franco was a mountain climber trapped alone on a hike. He took it to cutting off a limb in order to have a chance to survive. During moments like these in films you have to ask yourself if you would be willing to go to these limits to survive, if dying would not be easier than finding a way to survive.<br/><br/>A couple techniques used in the film to enhance the scenes were angles and lighting. One scene in particular I can think of where the angles were on point was when Whatney awoke from being struck during the storm. The camera was close enough to see his helmet in the dirt and how his body landed. You then see him awaken, camera in his face to see his emotion and distress. The lighting was impeccable showing how it would look on Mars and in space in comparison to how the atmosphere looks on Earth. <br/><br/>A film like this that is set on another planet, the director had to make Mars on Earth. He did a very good job at this and you could feel the emotions of all the characters. All the actors did an amazing job capturing the moments they were acting out. It is human instinct to want to survive but when the chances are so low the easiest thing is to let go and except. The hard part is to try. Surviving against all odds is a task not all people can manage. It is a great feet to overcome and even just seeing someone able to this on film gives a wonderful feeling of humanity and what one person is capable of doing is amazing."

","There's so much to this movie that it's difficult to zero in on a solid reason why The Martian is the year's best movie. <br/><br/>Is it due to Drew Goddard's pitch-perfect screenplay which captures the soul and essence of the very difficult to adapt source material? Is it due to the fact that the film is of high importance in modern times when we seem to have exhausted Earth's resources and need to explore space in collaboration with other countries for human survival? Or is it because this film is Ridley Scott's one of many masterpieces which have shaped the dimensions of world cinema in almost each decade since 70's? <br/><br/>I think it's all of these reasons and more. From meticulous attention on each production aspect to the exotic and haunting landscapes of Wadi Rum, Scott just captures your mind, heart, soul and consumes your existence in only the opening few seconds. It's like he grabs you from your collar and drags you into the canvas to tell a story with a perfect balance of humor, heart, emotions and drama. <br/><br/>Never has Scott let himself go so free in terms of storytelling. This is something this legendary director has never made before, and may never make any film as tenderly affective as The Martian. <br/><br/>Matt Damon was born to play Mark Watney. This is his career's best turn as an actor. He lives in and breathes life in his character with sensitivity and appears to be totally in sync with the character. The huge ensemble cast is perfectly chosen and turns in first-rate performances. Each actor leaves his/her indelible mark.<br/><br/>All in all, The Martian is a wholesome experience that is simply perfect."

","The Martian is, despite its harsh premise, a relatively fun movie, but as the title suggests, the fun is well countered by doses of good old fashioned deadly peril. <br/><br/>Acting wise, the parts are very well played. Matt Damon's character takes up most of the screen time, especially because about half of the movie's scenes depict him alone. These characters tend to be very static. They stay the same throughout the course of the film rarely undergoing any change to their personality. This sounds like a negative characteristic, but it actually works to the film's advantage. The story is significantly driven by realism, despite its classification as science fiction. Accordingly, just as the events are realistic, so are the characters and their actions.<br/><br/>The Cinematography is also quite spectacular. The camera alternates between regular shots, helmet cams, and various other surveillance devices. This is by no means a new or innovative concept, but it is used in such a way, to advance the experience very nicely. The shots of space are also fantastic, though there is little majesty to be found in the landscape, as there was in Interstellar, a movie that draws many obvious comparisons, especially because they both involve Matt Damon being lost in space. <br/><br/>The Martian, despite its lack of a military presence is very reminiscent of a story by the late Tom Clancy. I haven't read the book, (namely because after the movie, I feel as though it would put me to sleep)but the unchanging characters and realism of the plot do work together to make an interesting product. The main events of the story are built not so much around human emotions, but around complicated scientific processes which are conveniently explained for people like myself who can scarcely understand a lick of chemistrian. <br/><br/>Where this movie succeeds the most is when it lulls the viewer into a sense of relaxation. The movie becomes almost fun to watch as you witness these ingenious happenstances playing out before you. And then, BAM!!! The unsuspecting viewer is launched into a suddenly suspenseful situation. Thrust out of a reclining state, back to the edge of their seat. It is this wonderful juxtaposition that makes The Martian the well rounded masterpiece that it is."

","The movie The Martian is about a group of astronauts who are on a mission to Mars known as the Ares 3. The main character is crew member Mark Watney, a botanist played by Matt Damon. Watney is accidentally left on the planet during a violent storm because he is thought to be dead. Jessica Chastain, who plays Melissa Lewis the commander of the Ares 3 mission, is plagued with guilt after learning Mark has survived and fears he will die on the planet since he does not have enough food or water to survive. Kristen Wiig gives an uncharacteristic serious performance as Annie Montrose a lead player for NASA. Jeff Daniels also delivers an outstanding performance as the Director of NASA, Teddy Sanders. Sanders is faced with tough calls throughout the film for the survival of the rest of the crew and the space program as a whole. However, he is met with resistance and mutiny like most authoritative figures in films. I felt the overall theme of the film was survival. From the first few minutes of viewing you realize that the crew is trying to survive the storm and make it off the planet alive. Then, Mark Watney, once left on Mars, realizes that he will have to use all his resources in order to survive. He is able to keep calm and decides he must try to make contact with NASA so that they will help plan his rescue. At a certain point, things go from bad to worse and all hope is lost. Watney, however, seemingly will not be broken and we see the cleverness of the botanist thrive and collapse throughout the film. Glancing rhythms are used in the film to invoke suspense in us as viewers. The editor is also successful in transitions in the film taking us from seeing the broadcast of Mark Watney's death announcement by NASA on the television screen to the live broadcast of it by zooming in on the screen. The film is definitely able to manipulate camera angles to convey the desperate situation Watney is faced with. Aerial views of Mars show us just how alone he really is on this desolate planet. The roller coaster ride for viewers of The Martian is as thrilling as Cast Away was in 2000. The question is will Mark Watney be able to survive without a volleyball named Wilson to help him through?"

","QUICK REVIEW:<br/><br/>I liked this movie. A lot. However, when the first 2 hours of the film is good, you kind of expect the last 24 minutes to be as good, or close enough to good. Unfortunately, the movie failed an ending. But, that still doesn't make the movie bad, as this film could still become a classic, or at least a cult one. Ridley Scott brings us a brilliant film that makes you want more in this stunning movie that will capture your attention and not bore you at any scenes. This movie doesn't deserve to get a thousand Academy Awards, but it does deserve good reviews, and I don't really get what people mean when they said that they expected more. The film was very good, and barely overrated. I would of probably preferred this movie if it was just Mark's perspective and not the government's, however all things are forgiven, and as I really enjoyed this movie, I don't think I need to bother complaining about the flaws in this film. The ending was bad, but that doesn't make the film horrible! Overall, a 7.7/10!"

","The martian kind of feels like the third chapter in a trilogy together with Gravity and Interstellar. While the three movies are quite different, they all feel very close to each other. I absolutely enjoyed both the others, and this was no exception. With no action, and much science, it was enoyable despite its 2h20m lenght, which to some people is already a huge lenght. Wonderful visual depictions of Mars made it excel. Compared to ""Mission to Mars"" and ""The Red Planet"", the other two Mars films, it is just waaaaay more enjoyable (Even though I'll admit that I enjoyeb myself Mission to Mars). The cast choice seemed perfect, and next to it the great direction of Ridley Scott worked out. As ""The Martian"" is also based on a novel, a compare to the novel is needed. They managed to show almost everything that happened in the novel, with the difference that in the novel Mark Watney would explain every single thing he did scientifically. Another thing that worked well was the music. It fitted in well. For the scientific aspect of the film, yes. They got everything right. That's been told unanimously by any phisician asked upon the film. Stop reading reviews, and go to watch The Martian to spend great 2hrs20mins"

","This movie really surpassed any expectation I had for it. The previews made it seem like an incredibly plain movie on survival. But the previews were deceiving.<br/><br/>Mark Watney, played by Matt Damon, is the world's leading botanist (plant scientist) and also a mechanical engineer that works for NASA. Watney was a part of a team that took on a mission to planet Mars. While the team was conducting their studies on Mars, a fierce storm clashed upon them. Unfortunately for Watney, he was victim to the storm's powerful thrusts and the team was not successful in finding him. Watney was announced dead due to his vital readings showing that he was dead. The team left Mars and returned to Earth.<br/><br/>But to everyone's surprise, Watney was not dead. During the storm, his suit was damaged in the area where it reads a person's vitals, and that is what gave the impression that he was dead. With no way of getting back to Earth or communicating with anyone on Earth, Watney had to use his skill set and training to survive. He managed to grow potatoes on Mars, and he was also successful in creating water.<br/><br/>So Watney is alive, and he has found a way to survive; however, eventually he was going to run out of supplies. As hope was slowly thinning, members of NASA had noticed shifts in equipment that was left on Mars. After a closer look, NASA was able to verify that Watney had indeed survived. Communication was established, and a plan was created to rescue the abandoned astronaut.<br/><br/>This movie did an exceptional job with telling the story of survival of a single human on another planet. It was different from the usual survival movies out there."

","This film was so interesting I am now starting the book. <br/><br/>Allow me to say first, if you're hesitant to see it, I totally get it. I was hesitant as well, and waited till the film was out on pay-per-view, because I had heard that certain characters written as Asian in the book were played by non-Asians, and deliberate exclusion of Asians is a real issue in Hollywood, though people scoff and say ""not so"" because it is an uncomfortable topic (or an invisible one...if you're not directly affected it's very easy to say it's not a problem). Plus, lately I've been bored with the Hollywood archetype and am thus gravitating toward movies and shows where the main character is not a white male. However, I am a huge Matt Damon fan and a friend convinced me to see it. <br/><br/>I loved how smart this film was (though still somehow comprehensible to a lay person or non-scientist/non-engineer). I did find the soundtrack a bit contrived and wish they'd gone another direction, rather than disco (pop would've been just as funny and a refreshing change of pace). Other than that, this film held my absolute interest from minute one till when the credits began to roll. And that's the most important thing (and very hard to achieve). One final caveat: this movie will make you want to eat potatoes. Make sure you have some on hand. <br/><br/>A wonderful story."

There is a little science in this picture of NASA's contingencies against failed conquest of Mars. Biology, chemistry, and agriculture are the three main staples for the star studded cast of The Martian. No light speed warp drives, thugs with advanced arms, or black holes makes this survival story felicitous to the contemporary science fan. Matt Damon, the familiar brainy underdog since Goodwill Hunting, returns as an astronaut lost just a planet away from Earth.

","'The Martian' is a generally entertaining survival story following the ""Murphy's Law in Space"" formula established in 'Gravity' (2013). Unlike 'Gravity' no great effort is made to give the characters any real depth and there is no philosophy. It was obviously written by a science nerd and no doubt some of the solutions to the main protagonist's problems were better explained in the novel. The movie features amazing and believable realizations of Martian landscapes achieved by the special effects team.

It is a film that explains the courage of a person to try to survive and go back home, in this case he must go back from other planet. <br/><br/>Maybe one of my favorites and memorable scenes is when he finally see how the seed is growing up.

As a 'Prepper', I enjoyed the tactics that ""The Martian"" (Matt Damon) used to survive, as they were inside the realm of possibility, or very near to it. Another film very close in nature, ""Interstellar"", was a very good film, but relied too heavily on the viewers emotions for lost and found relationships, between characters. Conversely, ""The Martian"" sprinkled this aspect lightly. There is very little that I would change about the film, including character(s) momentarily slipping, seemingly, out of character.

","I'm somewhat divided on the merits of ""The Martian"". As entertainment, it's smashing, particularly since it was directed by the master Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiator"", etc.) with fine acting by Matt Damon playing an American astronaut who survives a disastrous manned mission to Mars and must figure out a way to survive on Mars until he can be rescued.<br/><br/>I'm split on this film because in spite of the film's excellent production, it lacks much that could be considered either depth, ideas to ponder, or even resonance, things Scott's lesser films usually provide. It actually resembles more of a lightweight pre-Schindler Spielberg film because it seems to settle into merely being a 'crowd pleaser,' much closer to ""Rocky"" than to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", though many might think that preferable. I also feel ""The Martian"" has weaknesses as drama: it seems astonishing that our astronaut appears to work things out too easily with little going wrong (until the final rather unlikely 'rescue'), and he never exhibits any emotional or psychological problems, something rather unrealistic as well as dramatically sophomoric. Frankly, it needed a harder edge, even toward the 'darkly realistic', and I can't understand why Scott didn't flesh this out in the script unless its production was, at some point, rushed. Nevertheless, it is excellently made, a spectacular piece of movie entertainment that I thoroughly enjoyed, even if I didn't carry much away with me afterward."

","In truth, The Martian's sentiments may come across as old-fashioned and impossibly conservative. The film's notions subsist in a territory less explored in the ever expanding immensity of the space sci-fiction genre, somehow deviating from the category's more standardized form, but it makes a clear point, one that strongly testifies to humanity's incredible capacity to survive.<br/><br/>The hero is Matt Damon's Mark Watney, who, after presumed dead by the rest of NASA's Ares 3 crew, was left in Mars, alone in the hostile red planet. He has at least four years to endure before a possible rescue mission arrives. But with limited rations left that may be good for only a few months, and persistent fatal conditions around him ever present, the witty Watney decides to ""science the sh!t out of it"" for him to survive, declaring he is the planet's greatest botanist, after all.<br/><br/>For most of his chunk of the screen time, Watney shares his daily struggle in seemingly endless monologues through a confessional Vlog, running through diverse subjects that go from things as random and simple as Donna Summers to those of unfathomable scientific and mathematical depths, like thermodynamics and hexadecimals. And if you're not really into such stuff, you would thank him for throwing punchlines every now and then, which sometimes may be corny and flat, but nonetheless enough to keep us away from getting bored. And with the rest of the cast mostly standing in front of screens monitoring him,y Damon singularly shines throughout the picture. That's not to say the rest of the frame is invaluable, but Watney's struggle itself creates an emotional connection between the worlds, relaying a cathartic sentiment that the audience would impossibly not relate to.<br/><br/>This may not be your no.1 sci-fi film, no thanks to a not- so- impressive finale, a bunch of supports whose functions mostly never go past just being stare-at-the- monitor standees, and some persistent logical leaps in the narrative, but it should be enough to shake up your list. Not only it pays with utmost reverence to science, it also explores its endless possibilities, which may not be within our grasp at the moment, but still scientifically possible.<br/><br/>With all that said, 'The Martian' is an exquisite cinematic gem, its sentiments reminiscent of familiar campaigns pulled off by countless previous films aiming to enforce humanity and its miraculous capacity. It's a celebration of human spirit and our species' ingenuity. And while everybody's abuzz about the recent discovery of existence of water in the red planet and the possibility it might be capable of supporting life, 'The Martian' has somehow delivered a compelling argument about how the planet probably can, one I believe, is worth checking out."

","The Martian sees Matt Damon play astronaut / botanist Mark Watney as he survives stranded on Mars after an accident during a mission leaves him presumed dead. The Martian is a sci-fi thriller and adventure, showing a return to form for Ridley Scott. This shows space is what he does best.<br/><br/>As soon as the film begins you are just immersed by the scenery. Some of the wide shots and the detail put into the setting of Mars is phenomenal. It is honestly stunning and almost makes you think ""how did they film on Mars?!"". Mars' rich red and stark desert is captured in beautifully composed shots and polished cinematography. The 3D adds a layer of depth that really stood out for me.<br/><br/>The cast is spectacular. Great performances all round. Some examples that stood out in particular was Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor and even Kristin Wiig who obviously comes from a comedic background naturally fell into her character and gave a solid performance. But overall this movie would be no where without the leading man Matt Damon who is exceptional. He drives this film. When he's on screen you are with him surviving Mars. When the film cuts back from Mars to Nasa back to Mars to Nasa again it doesn't feel boring or that you like a certain plot better, the film meshes and blends well because these characters and actors deliver stellar performances.<br/><br/>Which brings into the writing. The writing is witty, smart and without a doubt hilarious. This movie could have been mopey and very emotion-driven throughout, the film has time to fit in humour here are there and it works! Watney seems to find the funny side in his situations and I had numerous good laughs. I did not expect the film to be this funny and it'll come as a pleasant surprise to people.<br/><br/>You are rooting for Watney the entire film. Damon's performance accompanied by witty writing makes for a likable protagonist. The supporting cast elevate the emotion of this event and how it effects everyone and all can relate. Beautiful CGI and directing makes for the aesthetic that is the Mars landscape is really one of the main reasons this movie is so good. A classic and unexpectedly groovy soundtrack too make one of the most entertaining and well-rounded cinema experiences this year. You will be cheering in your seat praying for Watney to make it home!"

","Highly satisfying movie watching experience! Everything is laid out neat and perfectly executed.It beats Gravity if not Interstellar in all aspects.Actually it does beat Interstellar as far as entertainment factor(humor) is concerned as Interstellar doesn't have humor but still Interstellar is a next level stuff. The Martian has a good repeat value. The surprise package of movie is the humor factor as it goes very well with the film. Will surely be hot favourite of upcoming Oscar awards now i am looking forward to the bluray release which will supposedly contain an extended cut which will be 20 minutes longer Overall i conclude by saying The Martian is a Must have theatrical experience."

","I just saw the Martian today at the cinema and i must say i really enjoyed it!<br/><br/>I thought it would be a really sad, depressing movie, but i was pleasantly surprised at how uplifting, and at times funny the movie was.<br/><br/>I truly believe, this is the sci fi movie, along with Alien that will define Ridley Scott for many years to come.<br/><br/>The imagery in the movie is absolutely amazing. Mars actually looks like Mars!<br/><br/>Everyone in the movie does a great job, but i think Matt Damon steals the movie with his performance. His character could so easily just be a sour-puss and give up and let the planet take his life, but he does the opposite. He pretty much tells the planet that he's stuck on, that he won't fold up his tent but instead stay strong and on top of that be proactive and find solutions to his problems.<br/><br/>I am almost tempted to see it again, and i don't think i've ever felt that way about a movie before. Put it this way, i saw Avengers Age of Ultron, and once was more than enough for me.<br/><br/>I truly hope this film gets the good reviews it deserved and help cement Scot's place in movie history as one of the great directors of all time.<br/><br/>I give it 10 out of 10 and would be more than happy to recommended anybody to go see it. You will not be disappointed!! 10/10"

","I watched The Martian last night and just had to take 10 minutes to tell you how awful it was. It was like a remake of Home Alone, but on Mars. It felt like the script was written in about 3 hours, it had no structure and probably not even three acts – No intensity, no urgency. So predictable. Not one great performance, just two good ones from Benedict Wong & Chiwetel Ejiofor. Kristen Wiig was a joke. I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters. There were more attempts at comedy than drama. If anyone ever mentions this film in the same breath as 2001, Contact, Apollo 13, Interstellar, or Gravity – I will slap them in the face. And if Matt Damon wins Best Actor, I'll never watch another movie ever again. How this movie got nominated for Best Picture is beyond my level of comprehension. Even the special effects we're average! It's like they used the same footage from Red Planet with Val Kilmer for cryin' out loud! If you care about film and consider yourself a critic, watch it just to say you saw it, but that's all it's worth."
"superheromoviequestions","10","3","8","20 December 2015"," Future Best Picture Winner
","First off, it gets you right into it. The movie starts off on Mars, and introduces the plot immediately. The story is good, although Screen Junkies on Movie Science were able to prove that it's not accurate. Regardless, I almost feel like they could've used a minute to set up, even though it is a 2 and a half hour movie. Matt Damon pretty much carries the film, and honestly, as good as some actors are, NOBODY could've made this as good as he did. Not Tom Hanks. Not Leonardo DiCaprio, not James Franco. Damon is so likable, and makes all of these jokes while remaining serious about what's actually going on. The rest of his crew are all very well performed as well. Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Aksel Hennie, or even Sebastian Stan - nobody is miscast! The real amazing performance was Jeff Daniels, the head of NASA. And he absolutely breaks your heart and should definitely get Oscar nominated. And while Donald Glover and Benedict Wong are all good, Chiwetel Ejiofor is phenomenal. Really impressed from a guy I've never heard of. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and the visual effects help a lot, because I felt like I was on Mars with him. The music is very well chosen too. Loved the LOTR name drops too. My friends all tease me and tell me this is predictable, but some parts, I was actually thinking the opposite way. I said a few weeks ago that Everest should just take the Best Picture award right now, but I take that back! My money is on The Martian to take it all home!"

","The Martian (2015)........ wow such an amazing film directed by Ridley Scott! Matt Damon, Kate Mara, and all of the cast performed perfectly in what is quite possibly the best space travel based film to date. The Martian displays a perfect story that shows bravery, heroism, inspiration while at the same time pointing how mankind can achieve anything if they all work together without compromising persons which focus on their own financial greeds and public relations focuses. I loved this movie very much and was quite impressed as it come to be a much better film than I had anticipated.<br/><br/>I loved The Martian for many reasons, one of which is the story shown, and second is the messages within or that are mildly displayed. This film shows how much more mankind can accomplish if everyone worked together with true and real reasons for doing things versus only doing things to have a better face in the world or to financially benefit for it. This is a great movie, everything about it is perfect, the script, the acting, the directing, the cinematics; wow it was just perfect!"
"paolopuharic","10","3","8","19 November 2015"," Brilliant movie, must see.
","Great movie, great plot! The Martian is a story about a mission on Mars gone wrong when a powerful storm hits forcing the crew to leave the planet. During the escape Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris and presumed dead and therefore left of the deserted planet.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Watney is still alive and is left with two options, die, or ""get to work"". The movie shows a battle between life and death. The character's positive attitude and intelligence (as well as some humor on the side) towards the situation that keeps us motivated to keep watching. In a situation where anything can go wrong it truly had me at the edge of my seat."
"cristydelane","10","3","8","12 November 2015"," Excellent!
","This movie exceeded expectations. When a movie is set in space, and there's mainly 1 character, I usually assume that it will be a very LONG movie with very little action. That was not the case here. There are so many witty lines, plenty of plot, and action going on other than just on Mars. Other than a few curse words (which were appropriate for the situation), and 1 nude back scene (to show the weight he lost), it was also movie that is appropriate for older children. The Martian is different from any other ""Lost in Space"" type movies. The characters all have great chemistry together. It includes romance, jaw-dropping suspense, and ends beautifully."
"prabhatrayal","8","3","8","1 November 2015"," Captivating and Thrilling
","Every cinephile is familiar with Ridley Scott's name. He has made two of the greatest Sci-Fi films we have ever seen i.e. Blade Runner, and Alien. He also made the historical drama film Gladiator, which was a critical and financial success. His filmography is filled with great and awful films. He is a great director, but he hasn't done anything great for years now. He made Prometheus but it wasn't that good and we all know how mediocre Exodus was. He needed a good film and The Martian is just that, a film that Ridley needed to revive his career and put him back on track. It is a well-made film with great visuals and fantastic story.<br/><br/>Plot - Imagine a planet, where you are the only being alive. There is no water and the land is not fertile. Your supplies won't last for more than 60-70 days. You know that you can escape the planet only after 800-900 days, but you have to stay alive. There are so many things you have to take care of –<br/><br/>If you run out of food, you die. If you run out of the water, you die. If you go outside, you die. If you don't do something, you die. If you lose hope, you die. Most importantly, the feeling of loneliness will definitely kill you. We all have seen what loneliness can do to people. If you haven't, then watch Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>Now, what would you do? Would you lose hope and die even before the supplies end or will you start finding ways to solve the problems? Does your mind work or does your body become numb? How would you keep your mind in control? How would you live? Well, that's What happens in The Martian.<br/><br/>""The Martian is a story about some astronauts working on NASA's ARES III mission on Mars. They are hit by a storm and one of their team members (Mark Watney) gets lost. Presuming that he is dead, the remaining team members leave the planet. Mark Watney was not dead, he was hit by an antenna. He wakes up to find himself alone and stranded on this red planet. He has supplies that could last for a few days. He tries to communicate to NASA, but the communication system was destroyed by the storm. Now he has to face all the odds, find a way to communicate back to earth and survive until someone comes and saves him. Does he make it back to earth?""<br/><br/>The film is based on a novel by ""Andy Weir"". It is a simple story but works on multiple levels. Drew Goddard (The Screenwriter) did a fantastic job of converting words into action. The screenplay is simple and doesn't hold many surprises. The runtime is 141 minutes, but the pace is so perfect that you don't feel that something is being dragged. As the plot drives forward, the protagonist is presented with more and more problems which present threats to his life, He tries to overcome these hurdles by using his wits, spirit, and skills. The whole process is very exciting, exhilarating and thrilling. This is a perfect example of smart and witty writing supported by good filmmaking. The Martian is a character-driven film where out protagonist is in a bad situation, but he does not lose hope and makes full use of his skills and wits. This is a film about hope, fighting the odds, Optimism, courage and willpower.<br/><br/>There is only one shortcoming that I could think of. I wanted to see more of Watney's (Matt Damon) character. He was such a fascinating character and always a delight to watch. I would have loved it more if they had explored more depths of his character. The used the humor really well, but all his emotional conflicts were not shown. His internal struggles, pessimistic and optimistic character shifts and emotional conflicts would have added more depth to his character. But you can't really complain as it would have added another 20-30 minutes to the runtime.<br/><br/>Performances/Cinematography/Visuals - This has to be one of the best acting performances of Matt Damon's career. He is an excellent actor and he did a fantastic job in The Martian. He portrayed every emotion perfectly and effortlessly.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is equally good. Jessica Chastain didn't have much to do, but she did complete justice to her role. Sean Bean was good, but I was disappointed because he didn't die.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous and some of the shots are spectacular, especially the climax scene. If you are going to watch this film, make sure you go for the 3D as it adds more depth to the scenes. You can feel the atmosphere created by the Cinematographer.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts - The Martian is a must watch. Go and watch it as soon as you can because it is one of the top 3 movies of 2015. Some people might be put off by the Sci-Fi tag but believe me, it's The Shawshank Redemption set in space. It is the journey of a man who tries to survive against, all odds, using his wits, willpower and courage."
"kieranbattams","9","3","8","29 October 2015"," The best sci-fi movie for years!
","The Martian follows the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut left behind on a place where nothing lives or grows, Mars. For most of the runtime (this is quite a long film at 2 and a half hours) we spend time on this planet with Watney, and with such a brilliant performance from Matt Damon it is a pleasure to do so.<br/><br/>As soon as the film starts we are thrown straight into the action and feel what it's like to be in Watney's shoes. What we are given is an incredibly intense and realistic portrayal of loneliness and desperation from Damon and director Ridley Scott. It is also fascinating to watch Watney do his ""sciency stuff"" where he actually creates his own water and grows his own food, which is thought to be impossible on Mars. It is ironic that the film shows us this in the same week water actually was discovered on Mars, but even so it is so interesting to see these aspects. The supporting cast also do a great job, especially Watney's crew who just want to get him back to earth. Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara.. the list goes on and they all shine as well as Jeff Daniels who we really don't know whether he is one of the good guys or not. The standout however comes from my man Donald Glover, i love the guy and he steals every scene he is in even if it is only for a short time. <br/><br/>Overall, see this film. It is one if the best 2015 has to offer and remains in my top 5 of the year so far. It was like Interstellar meets castaway with less fantasy and more realism. One question though.. why does Hollywood keep letting Matt Damon get lost?! Have they not learnt by now?"

This is one of the best films I have seen all year, and I have seen a lot of films this year including Ant-Man, Avengers Age of Ultron and The Dark Knight. Overall this film is amazing and, without spoiling anything, the climax is awesome. This is also, even though it is a 12A, quite rude. I don't recommend children under 12 being taken to it, because it is also quite gruesome, like in the beginning the main character pulls some shrapnel out of his torso, there is quite a lot of blood and he ties his wound up with medical staples. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves science fiction, or who just wants to see a great and entertaining film in the cinema."

Easily the best movie I've seen in a long time, storyline was great and Matt Damon would probably win an award because of this movie.

"troestrup","8","3","8","24 October 2015"," Excellent story with a good focus and spectacular space drama
","I had already been looking forward to this movie for quite a while, because I am already very fascinated with astronomy and the universe. After re-watching 'Interstellar', which was a fantastic movie, this space movie, depicting Astronaut Mark Watney being stranded alone on mars while trying to grow crops and finding a way to communicate with NASA and the rest of the familiar normal world in a hostile environment far away from earth, just has an absolutely optimal change between the fight for survival of Mark (exquisitely portrayed by Matt Damon who, in my opinion, is finally worthy of an Oscar) and the desperate, yet obviously controlled try to put a rescue plan together at NASA. The movie keeps a wonderful focus on the political and sociological issues without getting too entangled in it, so you feel that some fresh story is happening all the time. There is no need to be a super genius or a physicist to understand the complex language, which is used in the movie, because this is covered in a good deal of very humorous situations, featuring Matt Damon's character uttering jokes and sarcastic comments about his current situation. In my opinion, this movie has what 'Gravity' didn't have: Namely, the focus on, what's happening on earth as well as in space. Although, this comparison may seem a little far-fetched, it is only meant as a comparison of the space genre, not the fact that 'Gravity' was made to be sort of a ""lonely"" movie. So, naturally, since 'Gravity' was the harvester of several Oscars last year it would only be more than fair, if 'The Martian' also took home at least The Best Actor title."
"ndnapo","9","3","8","21 October 2015"," Finding A Way Home
","The fact that four days before the release of Ridley Scott's new sci-fi drama, The Martian, NASA announced they had found evidence of water on Mars fed into the zeitgeist moment which this film so eloquently captures. Ridley Scott, well-known for directing the Alien series of films, has returned with an edge-of-your-seat feature which confronts the lone human against space storyline in a refreshing way. <br/><br/>In The Martian, based on the best-selling book by Andy Weir, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left for dead on Mars after his fellow astronauts lose contact with him in a storm. The five crew members, led by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), abandon their mission on Mars and make their return journey to earth on the Hermes.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Watney is declared dead by NASA, only to be discovered alive several months later. The key dramatic turn is that Watney has no way of contacting NASA, and vice versa. From here it is Watney's never give up attitude, science, and both NASA's and the crew's desire to bring him home that drives the plot.<br/><br/>Instead of the fear of aliens on distant planets, Ridley takes the audience on a visceral journey with Watney as he faces his fear of dying alone on Mars, a cold, waterless (as we understood at the time) wasteland. Survival is the name of the game. With the help of some disco music ""I Will Survive"" gets a spin, of course, and Watney's irrepressible wit, the botanist finds innovative ways to stay alive - all the while making botany look cool. Damon puts in a performance that is nuanced and understated, and along with a tight plot and humour, the character carries the viewer along on his journey. Documentary style video journal entries help draw us in to the triumphs and tribulations of the lone Martian's experience, while sweeping cinematography (shot in the deserts of Jordan) show us the extent of his vulnerability, alone on this vast, red planet.<br/><br/>For those of us who grew up watching the space shuttle missions NASA introduced us to the innovative, exciting possibilities of science. So, in the film when Watney declares, to survive Mars, ""I'm going to have to science the sh*t out of this!"" it's a punch the air moment. Although science buffs will notice a few mistakes in The Martian - all for the sake of storytelling - NASA was consulted extensively during the scriptwriting process. The space agency's efforts to bring Watney home help move the plot forward, and introduce some plot-twisting tension, especially when the - almost forgotten - Hermes crew members become involved.<br/><br/>The Martian sits comfortably as a companion piece to Cuaron's Gravity; both films strip their characters down to their bare essence, using space as a metaphor for the fragility of human life, and a backdrop for the triumph of the human spirit. What The Martian displays is Scott's skill as a storyteller who understands the strongest and most base of human feelings; fear, the will to survive, the depths of loneliness and the inexplicable pull to return home. All the while revealing the possibilities which space exploration ignites in the human imagination."

The thing I am not sure if I loved or disliked is that he is so positive all the time. He was taking pictures with a big smile, telling jokes and being sure that he will survive and was saying with a smile on his face: ""F**k you, Mars!"". This is definitely a thing that i liked, but it seems a little bit weird. I mean, he is stranded on Mars, but he is acting all fine, but I liked that, but I am surprised.

"Cathex","4","3","8","12 October 2015"," Matt Damon or Iron Man?
","This film seemed to have all the right ingredients - Ridley Scott, Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, together with a classic Sci-Fi premise - isolation on an uninhabitable planet. Maybe it would provide the suspense and anguish of Moon? Maybe the consciousness bending intensity of Intersetllar? Or perhaps it would be something totally unexpected? Well, turns out it WAS something totally unexpected. It was a bad re-make of Apollo 13, apparently sponsored by all of America's favourite clichés. Despite being rated higher than 2001 Space Odyssey on IMDb (thanks to the ever enlightened opinion de publique) the Martian is little more than just another blockbuster feel-good fest.<br/><br/>There are some exciting moments and on the whole the film is well directed, except perhaps for a bizarre obsession Scott seems to have with getting an astronaut in zero gravity to float backwards diagonally between two rooms, which was as confusing as it was pointless. But after a good start, an interesting premise and an hour and a half of the same series of events repeating themselves over and over, I began to empathise strongly with Damon's feelings of perpetual boredom.<br/><br/>After the plot comes around for about the third circle of the same thing the movie shifts gears, as if it realised it was going nowhere, and instead becomes something reminiscent of a 'GO-USA!' cheer-leading squad provided to you by coca-cola.<br/><br/>Then, finally, after what seems like a year on Mars we are handed a big slice of USA self-congratulatory indulgence, based on the idea that science can solve everything and the human spirit of ingenuity conquers all and stereo-typical genius geeks are always socially awkward and even China loves America and blah, blah, blah, etc.<br/><br/>Damon's character is left largely in the realm of a two dimensional marvel comic hero, with some almost funny quips, and the other characters seem little more than simply 'home of the brave' slogan spouting vehicles. Even during the end credits we're served yet more feel good factor melodrama, just in case we didn't get it yet.<br/><br/>From the man who directed Blade Runner this is a huge disappointment, but if you want some light entertainment that's over 2 hours long then go see The Martian."

","I don't think I have any spoilers here, but now I'm worried because people see things differently, so I'm marking this with at least one possible spoiler. My review is best for those who read the book & are curious about how the movie compares. The movie did a good job of condensing the book so many challenges Watney faced could be felt/seen, even if all the details couldn't be told as in the book. As a science geek, I loved the book. Luckily the movie also did a good job of feeling like it could actually happen - a neat trick for sci-fi. All the tension can be felt in the action of Matt Damon & the direction of Ridley Scott. The great scale of things is well portrayed. (Possible spoiler ahead.) It's Watney's sense of humor that keeps him from going bonkers & Damon did a great job of showing this. But as someone who read the book, I missed some of the tension built by knowing just how dire things really were for Watney on Mars - how little he had to work with & how much mental work/physical exertion he had to expend for the smallest victories. Many of those details were lost in the movie - they must be for the sake of time and story- telling. Overall -Enjoyable!"

Thank goodness she had a small part. Luckily the movie is so good it barely distracted the audience. Other then that I found the movie to be great. It held my interests and kept me on the edge of my seat. The special effects were tremendous. I thought I was on Mars with the actors. I found the scenery to be realistic and not on a set. It set the mood for someone being alone and so far from home. When the scene started with a far away shot as if it was from a probe orbiting Mars, you felt marooned.

","The Martian is a thrilling journey into the deep space anchored by amazing visuals and great acting. In the recent past Ridley Scott had been struggling to make a great movie, but he went back to his basics, and churned out one of the better Sci-Fi movies not just of this year, but of the past few years. While all actors are good, this movie is the Matt Damon show, and he shines as a desperate man stranded millions of miles from home. The film will undeniably be compared to Interstellar, because the cast and some of the premise are similar, but these are two very different movies. The amazing special effects, and constant obstacles make this movie truly thrilling. The Martian is my favorite of the Space Sci-Fi movies in the recent years, more than Gravity or Interstellar. The Martian is truly a theater experience, so see it on the biggest screen you can."
"greatpaintart","5","7","29","5 October 2015"," Underwhelming
","I'm so sorry I didn't like this movie more. It had long boring stretches, and in one part I actually fell asleep for a couple of minutes. Not a lot happened until the end. We all knew how it would end, we all knew the plot from the advertisements and videos, so this movie just embellished that a bit and filled it out and what you are left with is a very unsatisfying movie for the enormous $COST$ of going to the movies for real these days. Worst of all is the soundtrack. I know this is in the book (so I have read) but the director is in charge, right? Ridley Scott had the power to change the music and he didn't. So what we get along with this somewhat boring movie are several segments where loud, annoying, ancient DISCO MUSIC is played. The worst of the worst. It's not funny, it does not add to the plot, it's just old awful 1970s music. Including ""Starman"" by Bowie which goes on and on and on and on and even drowns out some of the character dialogue. I was so annoyed by it. Then the ending came, which was good, and the credits start over a nice shot of the Earth, and again starts this horrendous DISCO music from the 1970s. WTF??? Ridley Scott blew it with this movie. It could have been so much better."

","The recent influx in movies like Interstellar, the Star Trek revamp, and, the most recent release, The Martian, has left audiences wondering if space really is the final frontier for Hollywood. The Martian manages to set itself apart from its predecessors, though, by looking at space with a little less science fiction and a little more comedy. The writers managed to base the movie on surprisingly accurate science, which makes the movie seem more realistic. The actors are relatable and do an excellent job portraying their roles. The Martian has received glowing reviews across the board, and it is well deserved. <br/><br/>The Martian does an excellent job of pulling the audience in. I was pleasantly surprised when the action began immediately rather than having to sit through 45 minutes of unnecessary exposition. The scenery was breathtaking, and the special effects made you feel like you were actually going through the same struggles as Mark Watney. Though many have argued that the theme is cliché; The Martian was more enjoyable than I would have anticipated. The creators gave us a movie that beautifully merges all of the important aspects of a movie—plot, setting, casting, and special effects—to create the newest cinematic masterpiece.

","I love Ridley Scott and I love Matt Damon, so it's no surprise that I love The Martian.<br/><br/>First off, it's not a movie about aliens. In fact, zero aliens appear (sorry, spoiler?!!). But it is a film about humanity.<br/><br/>It's not earth shattering or mind-blowing (or any of those Oscar- deserving adjectives), but it is a beautifully shot, well acted and thought-provoking film. It brought up some questions that I think hit at the heart of what society is now questioning, following the technology revolution: how far will we go to survive? What is the value of human life now? (Well, OK, those were the thoughts that I took away.)<br/><br/>Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is faultlessly left behind on Mars when his crew evacuates during a storm. Somehow he miraculously survives, and then gets to work trying to ensure he survives long enough to be rescued On a planet where there is no water source, no plant life. <br/><br/>A little emotional at times, but with a surprising amount of humor and charm. If you see it, make sure you see it in 3D! (I promise, it's gotten way better and 3D was worth it.) Alongside Damon, the move stars Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, and Chiwetel Ejiofor (he's always amazing – remember 12 Years A Slave ?)."

","This is a remake of a sort. The year was 1964. The film was Robinson Crusoe on Mars. We didn't know much about Mars then and there was still some fantasy that the atmosphere on the Red Planet would be thick enough for water to be found.The passage of time has made it a classic of the science fiction genre. Fifty years later, we'd think a remake would be atrocious by comparison, like it was for The Day the Earth Stood Still or War of the Worlds and many other classics of the fifties. But this is not so. The Martian is magnificent in all aspects. This time around, we know what Mars really looks like. Ridley Scott has it pinned down pretty well. No standing water. A thin, unbreathable atmosphere. The sun is farther away, thus less light at least for our human eyes. Lifeless world with a bluish-grey sky or orange tint as red oxidized dust fills the atmosphere. Put in a few dust devils and lightning in the distance and you are definitely there, on Mars. The lone Martian has to survive. His crew has left him for dead after an unlikely freak dust storm has forced them to take off. Had to happen for the movie to take off, so to speak. The rest is made of ingenious solutions to survive, not to mention ample use of duct tape. Really, don't ever leave Earth without it. Everything is kind of believable until the end. Of course, so many things would have to go right for the abandoned astronaut to survive that, in most likelihood, he would not. But this is science fiction. Matt Damon puts in a great performance as astronaut Mark Watney and the rest of the cast pitches in believably. I wasn't expecting the movie to be so hilariously funny at times, but it is. The Martian never felt long to me and was enjoyable to the end. The science aspects of it was top notch and made you believe that it could be done. Kudos for the writers. This is excellent work. All in all, the best new movie I've seen in many years."
"odaat-30737","10","3","9","3 November 2015"," A fantastic new voyage with scott Ridley
","As terrifying as I imagine it would be if I were suddenly abandoned all by myself on the planet Mars, one of the first questions that came to my mind the first time I ever saw the trailer for this year's The Martian was can this film succeed mostly being carried by only one man? I know that Tom Hanks successfully pulled it off in (2000) 'Cast away', but he at least had the island's wilderness beauty to help with enlivening the film. Can Matt Dammon pull it all off in a geography that what I understand is mostly only dessert? The answer is that with director Ridley Scott behind the scenes, many things are possible; particularly 'The Martian' serving as just one of those examples! <br/><br/>In the near future 2030's, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) with a crew of others are on day number 18 on Mars living in an artificial habitat of a 2 month mission to research the possibilities of Mars one day being able to be colonized. During a sudden massive storm, the crew is forced to evacuate early in their mission to make their 4 year journey back home. Thinking that Mark was killed upon being swept away by a monstrous dust storm and only minutes to escape before the spacecraft is crushed, the crew take off and leave him behind. Mark miraculously escapes the fate of death. However; the bad news is that with the limited supplies of food and NASA equipment left on Mars, he now has the seemingly impossible task of trying to somehow make contact with NASA. Even when; as seen in the trailers, NASA discovers he is alive, NASA are pretty much as clueless to how to get him back as it is with Mark; thus begins the lengthy journey of twist and turns for a workable protocol to be created. <br/><br/>Matt Damon does a fairly good job inhabiting the role of the stranded astronaut who knows that his chances of ever getting back home are slim to nothing; most likely in his mind his status being the latter. Determined to be a good scientist and find as many answers in his research before all his months of food ahead runs out causing him to die of starvation, he gets to work both doing mechanical work and also attempting to grow food in an artificial greenhouse composed only of human wastes to plant in. Unlike Chuck Noland in 'Cast Away', Mark Watney does not have Wilson the volleyball to have a one way conversation with and to also serve for dialogue in the movie. However; documenting all his experiences daily in the video loge diaries serves as the inside of his mind both good and bad days in his uncertain life. Here you get both his dramatic fragile demeanor and his comical demeanor in interpreting life on Mars.<br/><br/>Back on earth at NASA, there are a complex of characters adding to the tension. There is the self-serving director of NASA Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) whose desire to get Mark back is only second to his bigger concerns of NASA equipment, money, and propaganda. In contrast to his minimal concern for safety in getting Mark back is flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean); whom wants nothing more than to get Mark back safely back home. Under the authority of Teddy while butting heads with his boss from time to time, Mitch wrestles between doing what Teddy tells him to do, or for him to do what is morally right. <br/><br/>As captivating as the story was, the most enchanting part in the movie for me was the unexpected beauty of Mars! I've have not seen enough photos of the planet of Mars to make a comparison, but I suspect that Ridley Scott's perception of Mars is beautifully created more from his imagination than the real Mars. From time to time, visually you're treated to spontaneous sunsets along the rocky mountains lining the dessert land on the horizon; in which blossoms in a starry dessert night. If that is the way Mars really is; while I'd never want to live there, I'm love to visit there.<br/><br/>Not being of a scientific mind, it is hard for me to distinguish how credible many of the strategies in this space movie are; as far as the tactics attempted to bring Mark back home. Nevertheless, the film did remind me very much of, (1995) 'Apollo 13'; which was the true story of astronauts tackling and improvising the impossible odds of getting back to earth. The fact that the real NASA seems to be getting closer in the years to actually putting a person on Mars makes this tale seem even more plausible. <br/><br/>While 'The Martian' has been airbound for at least a few weeks so far inside movie theaters everywhere; while I suspect that it will be around for at least another week, the abundance of new feature films coming out I believe will create the inevitable: it will soon blast away from the big screen and land into the family small screen. If you can, I'd highly recommend to watch this new science fiction film on the big screen."
"keikoasmom","10","3","9","2 November 2015"," Great Film
","I am shocked that so many people didn't love ""The Martian"", especially so-called science nerds. <br/><br/>To me, ""The Martian"" was very realistic, with a scientist, a man who is trained to think of solutions to problems, stranded but a person who is ready to assess his environment and determine if there are ways to remedy the problems before starting to worry.<br/><br/>I loved the solutions and the realistic photography and situations! To me, I was there and each problem was solvable in some way, and each problem was realistic. Matt Damon, as usual, was very good, very believable, lovable and gave a great performance!<br/><br/>I do think that this movie will appeal more to those who are science-minded, and those who understand survival and problem solving. It was entertaining, but if you are just out to see a movie where there is not thinking required, you won't like this one.<br/><br/>PS(It doesn't hurt that Matt is good-looking, maybe some of the male reviews that were less than 10 are disgruntled men.)"
"rjsf96","7","3","9","21 October 2015"," Scott Brings Forth His Astonishing Talent
","'The Martian' is a hard film to analyse and critique. When a film is already held with reverence how can one hope to accomplish their goals? 'The Martian' was not the masterpiece I had been told to expect. Yet it is entertaining nonetheless that fails when drawn up in comparison against '2001: A Space Odyssey' and in more recent years; 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar'.<br/><br/>Astronaut Mark Watney is having a bad day. He is stranded on Mars, help only 140 million miles away. He will have to put his survival skills to the limit as he tries to figure out how to survive on Mars and make contact with NASA so that he can eventually go home.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, 'The Martian' is a troubled film. Its main problem is Matt Damon as Watney or rather just the character himself. In a film of this type, essentially a survival story against the backdrop of space you need a compelling and likable character to reach out and root for. Watney comes across as a snide and arrogant person, far too sure in his approach for his own good. Remember when characters used to have arcs, a la Phil in 'Groundhog Day', he changed from insufferable to a good person. The same cannot be said for Watney, which makes it increasingly hard for me to like him. I've said it a great many times and I will say it again. If the main character does not grab my attention, why should I care?<br/><br/>Tone also remains a flaw. Should I really be laughing in a life or death situation? Would Watney be as cynical and witty if he knew for sure that he was not being observed? I doubt it.<br/><br/>Still there's plenty of fun to be had with 'The Martian'. Especially if you are far more forgiving than I am. There are terrific performances across the board, most notably Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The production design is astounding and the sets are creative and well thought out. The cinematography is gorgeous and highlights the vast wonders of Mars and how truly alone Watney is in this savage wasteland.<br/><br/>'The Martian' could be termed the last chapter in the unofficial space exploration trilogy that began with 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar'. 'The Martian' may not possess the tension of 'Gravity' or the wonder of 'Interstellar' but it makes up for it with sharp scientific knowledge and an interesting take on the genre. Even if it's not my favourite film from Ridley Scott, it's a hard film to dismiss and dislike at the very least."
"rikandum-205","9","3","9","11 October 2015"," Realistic concept of a modern space trip to Mars.
","There are two very-well known individuals who went in the making of this movie, Ridley Scott and Matt Damon. This year's space blockbuster has proved to be very well-executed, as usual. Mark Watney (Matt Damon), is a lonely astronaut that is left behind on Mars when he's considered dead by his crew on take off back to Earth. He has to find a way to contact Earth so he can go back, but meanwhile he has to save and produce supplies to last about 2 or 3 years, while help is on its way. Matt's portrayal of a character who is completely lonely on an entire planet and has only hope to hold on to is formidable, including the fact this character has a very strong personality. So once contact is made, Earth begins to work on a rescue plan, and when everything seems to be going well, it isn't. After Mark finally figure out a way to survive for several years on Mars, everything goes wrong and everything gets lost. It leaves the audience with thrill and wonder, because every time you think you're predicting what's gonna happen next, it never goes that way. This is an example of good screen writing. The movie is not hard to follow, but some scientific aspects may leave you a bit confused. This movie also includes a strong cast and well performed acting in a way that, even though this is fiction, you can't help but notice how real it feels. There's no year representing the happenings in this movie, it just feels like nowadays. Visually, there's a lot to this movie. Although it isn't as overwhelming as Interstellar, it looks real enough to make you believe ""this is Mars"". Some space shots from Mars didn't look as photo-realistic as expected them, but that was probably because it was too much saturated in color grading. I'm expecting at least 1 Oscar nomination for either sound editing or mixing, since there was so much about. I usually don't watch a movie thinking there's something special about the sound but this definitely has in the way it was edited/mixed. Overall, ""The Martian"" proved to leave me at the edge of my seat, not many movies can do that. It's at least one of the best movies I've seen this year from 2015."

","The Martian is a visually stunning, very well-acted and enthralling watch. Matt Damon's performance made the journey a wonderful one. Together with a mix of thrill and comedy, it was gripping and entertaining. I was really immerse into where the story is going to go. With the help of the talented cast, it made for a solid watch even without putting the camera to Matt Damon. <br/><br/>Despite of this though, I feel like few parts of the writing were a bit rushed and lazily handled. The run time I think was a tad too long.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a must watch Sci-Fi movie mainly because of the performances, the visual effects, and engaging story."
"Pinkman8","7","3","9","11 October 2015"," Space Robinson
","Andy Weir's book is a kind of modern interpretation of ""Robinson Crusoe"" by Daniel Defoe, and we can easy to compare Watney with Crusoe. And he and the other loves, inspired by his occupation - travel and search for something extraordinary, in addition, both are far away from civilization. Of course, in this comparison, there is a caveat: Robinson was easier, he had Friday, but Mark has appeared something wonderful and precious, gift of the gods - duct tape. Humor! Here it is the highlight of the product Weir, which does not spoil the impression of an interesting story about survival. Basically the jokes come from the main character, well, Matt Damon, once again in trouble far away from Earth, perfectly played Watney with his characteristic sarcastic humor. This character gives a picture of the inimitable charm, because self-irony is always easily finds its way to the heart of the viewer, which proves the cult director in his film.<br/><br/>In addition to the good sense of humor, Weir boasts a host of technical details and detailed description of certain actions, and skills that help to survive in an unfamiliar environment, but the reel of film still remains the films, because to make every element of the book in the film - it is impossible. Drew Goddard is responsible for the adaptation of the book, got rid of the weight of the complex technical subtleties, emphasizing only the best quality Weir's creation, and to achieve the full visual impact on the big screen, the screenwriter has made some changes. In the film Ridley Scott more humor than scientific details, while in the book jokes were for respite after a long and long affairs of Watney. It is clear that this story of the film is necessary in order to achieve the maximum shine and glitz in parallel without tiring the audience, but judging by the drama and seriousness - Ridley significantly inferior to their colleagues, whether it's Kubrick's ""Space Odyssey"", Cuaron's ""Gravity"" or Nolan's ""Interstellar"". On the other hand, a film that is not required, the director does not follow in the footsteps of other directors, but on the contrary, stands out wittiness and uncomplicated, and Weir once in his book named all the technical details as scientific crap.<br/><br/>And now the disco! Yeah, you read that right! Why disco? Because the commander Lewis ""has lousy taste in music"" and Watney stuck on Mars, it is left with no choice but to listen to the songs of Lewis, from David Bowie and finishing group ABBA. In addition to the eccentric and unusual background music for sci-fi tape, ""The Martian"" attracts with its interesting secondary characters, including the charismatic crew of the Ares III mission and fun NASA employees. A lot of movies where the protagonist saves the planet, in this case the whole world is trying to save one man, and behold it - very exciting and thrilling. In Ridley Scott's picture pops up drama that, in view of the presence of the lion's share of humor, oddly enough, does not repel and not confuse the viewer. A mix of irony and drama - damn effective. Making various technical manipulations, while listening to the song Bowie and other performers, with wisecrack and joking, Mark Watney is striking in its resourcefulness and ingenuity, and sometimes cheerful and fun. Perhaps, there is nothing better than the desire for freedom and the opportunity to see native home, apart from the presence of duct tape, of course.<br/><br/>Turn on ""I Will Survive"" of Gloria Gaynor!"

","The Martian represent more realistic scifi movie to Ridley Scott than his Alien movies. Story may sound simple and boring, but it way more than that. Story has build to very solid thriller, kind of modern Robinson Crusoe survival story. Story keeps you awake entire two and half an hour time. Occasionally you almost hope that story would take more time to tell. It scientific side is executed with Nasa's co- operation and that makes it so realistic. Even it's survival story may sometimes feel a little unrealistic it still is great narration of human inventiveness and relentlessness to survive in hostile environment. Matt Damon is convincing in his role as astronaut Matt Watney. Maybe movie is sometimes trustworthiness because it won't tell anything about his loneliness in vast planet, but with story's humor and great nostalgic choice of music makes it more enjoyable.<br/><br/>3D format is once more plea than normally. Harsh scenery of Mars looks great and it's vastness is breathtaking. Movie set is brilliant, crisp an very realistic. It is good that Mars has shown mostly at day time so framing won't get too dark and it's scenery looks great in 3D.<br/><br/>The Martian is a great survival story which is at it's best when you watch it from big screen at movie theatre. Set design and scenery looks that great that there might be a change to get Oscar from it's visual effects next spring. Great choice of nostalgic music piece at the end crowns the whole story.<br/><br/>As Gloria Gaynor sings ""And now you're back from outer space...I will survive"" the movie ends."

","The Martian (2015): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara: A fish out of water story that delivers Ridley Scott one of his better films in a while. Matt Damon plays an astronaut who ends up stranded on Mars when a mission is struck within a space storm. Damon is knock unconscious and the crew believe him for dead. Reluctantly they are forced to leave. Damon awakens alone and isolated but since he is playing a guy who is extremely intelligent and witty, he is able to use science to create water, heat as well as grow a crop of potatoes. This is far more uplifting than Interstellar, which is depressing. Here Scott allows for a touch of humour as Damon faces any challenge that hits. This is where Damon is at his best and where humour becomes a counter to a dire situation. Unfortunately the supporting cast is completely cardboard. Jessica Chastain is a terrific actress who spends much of the film on a spacecraft going back and forth on the Damon search. Jeff Daniels plays the typical NASA suit leader whose job is to counter the press in the wake of Damon going missing in space. Then when it is discovered that he is alive Daniels is pitted between truth and lame excuses whether Damon is rescued. Kristen Wiig is completely miscast, and Kate Mara's role has all the personality of the sh*t Damon plants to grow potatoes. The special effects are impressive but thankfully not as claustrophobic as Interstellar. The theme regards the idea of living and surviving on Mars using one's mind to increase one's chances of propelling beyond. Score: 8 ½ / 10"

But The Martian is a REAL 3D Movie.<br/><br/>I still remember the Martian dust storm scene at the start. It is one of those rare scenes taken in the dark (remember Jurassic Park?) that is so perfect - in 3D - you'll feel like you're inside the storm yourself!<br/><br/>But the big new is - the REAL Ridley Scott the director - is back!

Marooned on Mars Mark Watney (Matt Damon) displays the epitome of perseverance and now has to figure out how to survive and make contact with anyone that could come to his aid. Will they be able to bring him home? <br/><br/>Paced fairly slow but never with a missed beat THE MARTIAN gathers pace and flow right from ""Go"". Well-adjusted with subtle humor, momentary heartfelt banter and an upbeat soundtrack allow the mammoth 132 minutes pass by faster. Ridley Scott once again has resurfaced with a notable project since PROMETHEUS from 2012. This man certainly loves his missions into outer space and he most certainly knows his way around particulars of his Sci-fi. There is never a moment where the audience would question the reality behind his interpretations. The cinematography as always with him is on point. Ridley Scott will in your mind effectively place a man on mars! Ridley Scott isn't the only one who shot back into the spot light with THE MARTIAN. As his Jason Bourne days become a spec in the history of Hollywood Matt Damon hasn't been able to resurface for sometime, not in this magnitude. INTERSTELLAR cannot really be considered a Matt Damon breakthrough although the movie can be spoken of otherwise. With trifling parallels to Tom Hanks in THE CASTAWAY I thoroughly enjoyed watching Damon at work. He was spot on. There isn't anything that will astound the viewer in terms of playing the character, however Damon is adequate and undeniably effective. The poster to the movie makes us feel that Matt Damon is all that is to the movie. Well this isn't the case. Whilst Watney is out there fighting the good fight there is a greater ensemble of people trying to get this astronaut back home. Jeff Daniels stands out in my mind as the director of NASA. His authoritative performance is what made bringing the astronaut back home even more enthralling and I could not stop having flashbacks of Harry.<br/><br/>Is this the best sci-fi of 2015? I think it is. Will it find a spot at the awards in February 2016? Best picture? I think not, however the visual effects are more than worthy of a nomination. While I wouldn't consider THE MARTIAN a must watch and I wouldn't dare to put it up with productions such as GLADIATOR & ALIENS (Both by Ridley Scott), it still is refreshing, unique, inspiring and highly recommended.<br/><br/>TITLE: THE MARTIAN DIRECTED BY: RIDLEY SCOTT STARRING: MATT DAMON, JESSICA CHASTAIN, KRISTEN WIIG, SEAN BEAN, Micheal PENA & JEFF DANIELS.

Each one delivers an all star performance that form characters that you grow to love and root for. Matt Damon specifically is amazing in this movie. When a man is stranded and the only person on a planet, you can imagine emotions would be high. Damon does an incredible job of portraying those emotions and also brings forth comedic relief in an excellent form. This is a very stressful and high intensity film at times and the comedic relief was a pleasant surprise and best of all, didn't feel forced into the situation at all. The writing, the special effects and the directing (the amazing Ridley Scott) well all spectacular. This movie is over 2 hrs long but it doesn't feel like it. Time flies because you are so sucked into this movie. I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie and I don't want to give too much of the story away. Usually I try and think of some things that I might change or what they could have improved on but I am drawing a blank. You guys will just have to see it for yourself and see what you think. I would highly suggest seeing it! <br/><br/>Average Man Score: 10/10"

","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie going in. Matt Damon is pretty hit and miss for me and I was afraid of a preachy message from Scott (like so many sci-fi movies do). To my great surprise I, I loved this movie! The story was compelling, the characters believable and the ""leave no man behind"" message is very positive. Matt Damon's performance shines and watching him deal with overwhelming problems is enough to inspire anyone to not give up. Of course much of the science was not believable - it's a movie - but as a story element it all worked terrifically. I recommended this movie for everyone teen and above. It has some language issues (so would I if I was left struggling alone on Mars). This movie just topped my list for 2015."

","Both Matt Damon and Ridley Scott had been stuck in some sort of slump in recent years, and some wondered if ether would set their storied careers back on track. With Damon being thought of as a has been star, and with Scott being woefully inconsistent with his recent projects, I'm pleased to say that The Martian brings two greats of the film industry back into the forefront.<br/><br/>The premise of this film starts off almost immediately. Botanist Mark Watney(Damon) is thought to be dead after a violent Mars storm rumbles its way into the NASA research base that Watney and his crew are conducting their scientific mission. Only he is still alive, and must find a way to not only contact his crew, but figure out how he is going to survive for the 4 years it will take for NASA to come back with an extraction team. So within the first 5 minutes of this film, we are thrown right into the thick of Mark Watney's desperate fight for survival.<br/><br/>Some people who have seen this film have basically stated that The Martian is just Apollo 13 meets Cast Away. While this film does do a fantastic job of distinguishing itself from other survival stories, it is mainly Apollo 13 meets Cast away, only its on Mars and Tom Hanks is no where to be found. But what separates The Martian from many other survival stories, is how warm hearted and humorous this film is. So many other films like this are dull, depressing and sometimes void of all hope till the vary end, when an opportunity arises for the protagonist to want to save their lives. From start to finish, Mark Watney has this drive inside him, that even in the most seemingly hopeless situations, he finds a way to crack a joke, and to stay positive at all times.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant. The Martian is easily his finest role since The Departed. You constantly laugh at his jokes, you are rooting for him to make it home, and you feel for him when he is starting to break down and go through his emotions. Most importantly, you care about his character and because of this, the audience gets sucked right on in for the ride. They become fully committed and invested into what is unfolding before their eyes and what is unfolding is one of the best Sci-Fi films of the year and one of Ridley Scott's best work in a long, long time.<br/><br/>Besides Damon's amazing performance, The Martian boasts a loaded cast of A-listers. Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Micheal Pena and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Ejiofor in particular reminds all of us, why he was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor and I have no doubt that he will one day, walk away with that award in the future. Not one actor gave a bad performance, not one. Every character was likable, even the CEO of NASA (Daniels) who is supposed to be the corporate boss we are all supposed to hate, we end up understanding why he makes the decisions he does throughout, and the film makes us think about what we would do if we had to make the difficult decisions that he is responsible for in his position. <br/><br/>Lastly, the visuals, because my goodness, what a well shot, well crafted and gorgeous film this is. I would love to find out where this film was shot because if they aren't on an actual set piece somewhere on earth, then the CGI in The Martian is absolutely breathtaking. This, besides Mad Max: Fury Road, is by far the most stunningly beautiful movie of the year. So many times I was in awe of how majestic the sand blew i the wind, or how the sun reflected off of Damon's helmet, or even how something so simple as a close up shot of a budding plant screams of magic and life. Simply put, you will feel like you never blinked the entire 2 hours and 40 minutes of run time.<br/><br/>The Martian is a return to form for two aging greats in Hollywood. Its easily the best Sci-Fi film of 2015 and arguably the best in the past 3 years. The CGI was crisp and amazing, the cast was incredible, all with fantastic and memorable performances, the story although extremely basic, has more meat and weight to it then most survival stories. The Martian is an absolute must see, without any shadow of doubt, and when you walk out, you will be begging to come back and see it again."

","It's almost impossible to not have seen at least glimpses/clips from this movie. But just knowing what this will be about, does not mean you won't enjoy the ride. It may be true with some other movies, but this works quite good. Even though we do know more and are expecting the inciting incident to happen to Matt Damons character.<br/><br/>And while everyone else does not know about him and his status, we do know. And I think everyone can at least relate to some parts, when it comes to feeling lonely. Even someone who has a lot of people around him/her, has moments where you only have yourself (to rely upon). And Damon has a lot to do. You could say this is predictable (and maybe has an agenda, depending on the outcome always), but the tension still never lets up. Entertaining and funny too, even when Damon breaks a couple of rules of filmmaking (not talking to oneself, but then again, what else can you do? Plus he's not ""just"" talking to himself ... well you'll see)."

","The entire plot had a very phony smell to it, esp. Damon's character showing little ""negative"" emotion (hopelessness, despair, depression), but instead he was a busy little bee who seemed to be an expert in every technical area that needed tending to and rose to almost superman status in fixing his HAB after an airlock exploded (for a very dumb reason, BTW), besides solving several virtually impossible problems without unexpected snags cropping up. The further the plot developed, the worse it got, and the in-orbit rendezvous was absolutely ridiculous --- the instant he tore a hole in his spacesuit, it would rapidly expand with an explosive decompression --- he's be dead in 15 seconds. And the equally ridiculous stunt of building and detonating an explosive device to reduce the velocity difference was beyond laughable. Also, the background music was so loud and distracting it gave the movie a ""for kids only"" feel. If you haven't seen this awful turkey of a movie yet, don't bother --- it's a waste."

","The budget for this film was over $100 million. The hours subsequently spent watching it by people who could have been otherwise employed for nearly two and a half hours might have been sufficient to rebuild the Great Wall of China.<br/><br/>Technically 'The Martian' is impressive. An unbelievably huge spacecraft with space that puts the grand hotels of the world in the shade. Real potatoes that germinate when a presumed dead survivor is stranded. Miraculously not dead Mark grows them in Martian dust and human poops. A crew of five in a spacecraft big enough to house a thousand Syrian refugees.<br/><br/>As gentlemen in Dubai are likely to be offered by imported ladies of easy virtue, there is a happy ending. No tension, it was bound to work out well.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott doffs his directorial hat to political correctness. The Commander is a gorgeous woman, as is another of the crew. Persons of what are inaccurately labeled black and yellow skin feature strongly in key back-room roles. We have a Hispanic in the heroic rescue gang.<br/><br/>The dialogue is banal throughout, with plenty of f**ks and s**ts. I don't remember a single ear-catching line. To call the characters two-dimensional is to give them more substance than they deserve.<br/><br/>Well done Matt Damon for nursing your planetary rover over 3,200 kilometers of a path that was forever smooth.<br/><br/>This film is rubbish, all show and no substance.<br/><br/>I liked the closing scene. Mark (Matt Damon), now a retired spaceman, lectures in the middle of a circular venue. Why would anyone talk to an audience, half of whom are behind him? That must have been a Scott Ridley joke to give his cameraman a license to swoop and circulate.<br/><br/>It was obvious from the start that Mark would survive.

"revelryreview","9","2","5","22 February 2016"," The Martian: Film Review (www.revelryreview.com)
","Upon watching the first trailer for The Martian my initial thoughts were that it was a ripoff of Interstellar (fantastic movie by Christopher Nolan), where it was such a successful movie I thought this movie was heading in a similar direction to feed off it's success. But reading into the plot more I found that it was a lot different, Ridley Scott being one of my favorite directors I could not miss out on seeing another one of his epics. Also seeing that Sean Bean was cast into a role I just had to see whether or not he would survive his encounter in this movie!<br/><br/>The general plot of this movie is that an astronaut named 'Mark Watney' is presumed dead after a fierce storm on Mars which forced his crew to abandon him. Watney finds himself abandoned on Mars and must fight to survive before help can arrive.<br/><br/>My expectations were high for this movie and I was not disappointed, while it was not Scott's best film it was still definitely one of the years best movies. The visual effects are stunning, and the recreation of the planet Mars is probably one of the best yet we have seen in any movie, surprisingly this movie won best comedy movie at the Golden Globes, and to be honest it was deserving of it as there were some very funny moments. <br/><br/>The pacing of the movie was brilliant, there wasn't a dull moment, the overall tone of the movie was bleak but the screenplay was brought to life by the often comical moments that were portrayed in the film keeping it well balanced so it didn't come off as too depressing. <br/><br/>Matt Damon really showed his class in this movie, with most of the film on his shoulders he carried it perfectly and gave one of his best performances, not all of the actors were great in the movie though, Kristen Wiig was a strange choice and I felt as though her character could have been left out.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Ridley Scott has put together another great movie, with intense action scenes, great comical moments and cripplingly emotional at times I believe this movie is in the top 10 of 2015.<br/><br/>PROS: - Never dull or boring - Great humor for a Sci-fi/Drama - Matt Damon's performance<br/><br/>CONS: - Some of the casting was a bit off<br/><br/>9/10"

","I am mystified by the overwhelmingly positive reaction that this film received, not only among moviegoers but critics as well. To be sure, Matt Damon is his normally engaging self, to the point that, if it weren't for him, The Martian would be almost unbearably tedious.<br/><br/>Let's start with the fact that there is really no dramatic tension here whatsoever. Was the fact that the stranded astronaut would be heroically rescued in the last five minutes ever in the remotest doubt? This is a Hollywood movie, after all. Sure, there is the usual internal dissension - heartless management vs. compassionate colleagues. We know who is going to win that battle. There is Mark Watney's ongoing struggle to stay alive, through an increasingly unbelievable series of stratagems, despite things repeatedly blowing up around him, all the while making endearing wisecracks (for the most part to no one in particular).<br/><br/>The special effects are pretty good, though nothing that is much beyond what Kubrick was able to accomplish almost half a century ago.<br/><br/>The script has a few bright moments, but is so replete with clichés that it frequently verges on parody. The cheering crowds in Times, Trafalgar and Tiananmen Squares, the ubiquitous CNN news feed, the ""unconventional"" but brilliant young NASA engineer/math whiz who saves the day (along with the Chinese, this being 2015), the selfless, bantering and bonhomie among the properly gender-balanced crew of astronauts, the hard-ass ""suit"" who runs NASA and runs up against the ""old guy"" who has one last act of defiance left in him - and on and on and on. Really, there is not an interesting or nuanced plot twist or character among the lot.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie, mostly because, despite its thin story, Blade Runner still holds a special place in my heart. But I do now understand why Ridley Scott didn't get his Oscar nomination for best director."

","So I hadn't seen this movie yet but heard a lot of good things about it. Well, those people were not wrong.<br/><br/>Let's start with the different part. It's different because the whole movie is so focused on one person. Of course there are other movies that do that as well, but not many. And then there's the whole being on Mars part that, of course, gives it something different. There's so many rules that do, or do not apply because he's on Mars.<br/><br/>And then there's the fun part. There are just so many great quotes in this movie. Especially from Mark Watney, the main character. I mean, he's stranded on Mars, alone, and he's still funny. Cracking jokes now and then. Making fun of himself. And then there's this tiny funny thing about going to Mars with something called the 'Ares' missions.<br/><br/>But really, just go check this out."

","I just want to be clear here. I know a lot of people are claiming that the science in this movie is outrageous and unbelievable. I am no scientist by any stretch of the imagination. I took one semester of Chemistry in high school. However, even I know that the science depicted in this movie and, more specifically, the book is actually quite conceivable. There are obviously factors that are, for lack of a better word, stretched, but almost completely the science is still POSSIBLE. That is what I find most interesting. So, be careful before writing a review that this movie is impossible or, at the very least, unconvincing. <br/><br/>With that said, this is my favorite movie of 2015. Though I doubt that it will win Best Picture at the 88th Academy Awards, it certainly is worthy of its nod. Matt Damon is absolutely at his finest and is certainly one of my favorites for Best Actor. He achieves an acting performance that even surpasses Tom Hanks (for whom I have a soft spot), in Zemeckis's Cast Away. The supporting cast is lovely. More interestingly, I am thoroughly impressed with Goddard's adaptation. After reading the book (which I did after watching the movie), I was blown away that Goddard could craft such a fiction into a film (and one that is in fact even better than an already great book). And of course, Ridley Scott is brilliant. The visuals of this movie are beautiful. I went to see this on a whim. I actually wanted to see Bridge of Spies of but didn't have the chance. I decided to watch this on the basis that ""eh, it looks pretty good."" I was not disappointed. This movie will surprise you."
"a-little-squeek","5","2","5","14 January 2016"," Everyone from Mars loved this movie
","I like Matt Damon in almost every movie I've seen him in. This whole movie plays like the middle of a story. There's no initial plot or character development or effective ""button up"" at the end. I compare it (somewhat) to ""Cast Away"" with Tom Hanks. It seemed to most folks that I discussed ""CA"" with that Hanks' isolation on the island dominated too much of the film. In reality, his isolation on the island took up roughly only about 40% of the running time...the rest of the time was devoted to character and plot build up and wind down. That process was woefully missing in ""The Martian"". Additionally, the ""rescue ship"" in ""The Martian"" had a gym with too much equipment and a huge conference room, both with high ceilings and seemingly constructed with no concern for space or weight considerations. Didn't seem logical to me.<br/><br/>To me, numerous elements in the execution of the whole project just didn't ring true, even by a stretch, the last 20 minutes or so in particular. Don't want to create a spoiler here so I won't go into detail. <br/><br/>Unless it's a film by Clint Eastwood, usually when they make a movie like this or ""Gravity"" with Sandra Bullock, I kind of expect that they're not going to kill off the star. So it boils down to wondering throughout the film how they're going to keep the star alive and create a happy ending. <br/><br/>I gave it a 5 because I enjoy Matt Damon and the execution of some of the concepts relating to his survival, but in my view, the plot needed way more refinement and development."

I'm actually writing this as I'm watching the movie. Please Let Him Survive and give him a lifetime of Ketchup. Also what was with all the Happy Days references?

I started counting down the minutes for this trash-fest to end but later decided at 65mins to call it a night.<br/><br/>Matt continued to torment the viewers with his inane jokes, and annoying selfie videos. His comments later degenerated when he started to ""take on"" Mars as a sentient being by reminding himself that he's prepared to make water, oxygen, food, drone vehicles and weapons because he happens to be a mathematician, chemistry professor and botanist. Never mind the fact that a person stuck in space with extremely limited resources would have a sense of panic, stress and experience various nervous breakdown episodes, Matt continued to sing in the shower, and play disco music whilst longing for additional soundtracks.<br/><br/>Not only did all his inventions of creating water and planting 100- year old dried potato work, but he happened to come across all his resources and materials needed for his inventions like strolling through Walmart.

"miachristinapink","7","2","5","4 January 2016"," Simply an enjoyable movie
","Though I get some of the negative reviews, I simply can't agree with them and felt compelled to leave a review of my own.<br/><br/>Read a lot of complaints that Matt Damon's character was unrealistic in his optimism and cheerfulness. I however experienced his character as slightly different, optimistic and cheerful by nature, for sure, and why wouldn't he be? Young, successful and well...an astronaut! And that being said, thought it was fairly well known, especially amongst science and sci-fi aficionado that astronauts go through extensive physical and mental evaluation and training, needing to be able to cope with prolonged isolation, living in cramped confines with and without other people for extended periods of time and to master a degree of lucidity and presence of mind even when put under tremendous stress and pressure.<br/><br/>With that knowledge I found nothing unrealistic about Matt Damon's character, simply displaying an interesting form of upbeat Stoicism. I also didn't feel this movie was, what some scathingly called, a NASA or American propaganda movie. The NASA director isn't actually placed in the most positive light, more concerned with public opinion than the recovery of Mark Watney's body. Then, as it turns out he's alive, he again makes some dubious calls throughout the movie. Not to mention turning to China for help, another point I liked; finally a movie okay with depicting the cooperation between other nations and the world rooting for one of its citizens, a thing for governments and the voting public to aspire to, rather than more cynical movies (which though not entirely untrue) have often already resigned the world to a dystopian fate.<br/><br/>So that is to negate some of the negative opinions and offer a, I think, more fair and still realistic way of looking at Matt Damon's character and acting performance (and I usually don't even particularly care for Matt Damon). Now as to my own opinion of the rest of the movie...<br/><br/>As said it just a very enjoyable film, its upbeat nature already a breath of fresh air. Its optimism and 'man can do' spirit also seems very necessary in an age of cynicism and pessimism. Beyond Matt Damon, each actor gave a solid performance, with the exception maybe of Jeff Daniels who more and more either seems to be playing himself or reprise his performance in 'The Newsroom'.<br/><br/>The special effects were gorgeous without being over-stated, balancing well the feeling of being on an alien world, yet a world obviously no longer totally alien to the average movie goer. The Martian sky, the miniature whirlwinds, all of it, I thought, gorgeously done. I did take some issue with the gravity seeming no different than on Earth. As I write this I just looked up just how different the gravity would be, and apparently a person weighing 100kg on Earth, would weigh 38kg on Mars. Something you don't see at all. A considerable difference to be ignored in a movie advertising itself as scientifically accurate.<br/><br/>That, some of the scenes feeling to drag a bit and the fact that apparently this movie in many ways is a copy of another movie called 'Red Planet', one which I haven't seen, make me take away a few stars.<br/><br/>Still, an enjoyable movie that won't leave you bored and hopefully inspired. But no, if you want moments of anguished despair in outer space, better turn to the Alien franchise or Event Horizon, this is simply not that kind of movie, nor does it mean to be I don't think.<br/><br/>A solid 7.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Alien franchise, what is with female leads being bashed so often lately as being 'liberal/pc propaganda'. Seen no role that has been strong, diligent without turning butch or unrealistic since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley."

","This is a highly intelligent and very well executed film. It almost made me believe this movie was based on a true story. The cast did their parts really well and it really seemed like they were actually real professionals working for NASA. Matt Damon seems to be a part of a meme now because he gets put in positions where other characters has to put a lot of effort into saving him with this being the 3rd time of that happening in a film. But yeah he was really good in this as the astronaut that gets left behind and has to survive using his intellect and resources at his disposal. And keeping on very optimistic perspective on things despite it dire situation. Which is the reason why he kept chugging away at it without not even trying. While this is going on, the greatest minds on earth are working on a way to bring him back home alive by using their brains, wits and will power. It's like watching nerds working on science projects after science projects to accomplish something really cool. The ideas and direction just kept getting more clever and clever as it progressed. And as it progresses the build up makes you really care as an audience on what is going to happen and because it actually feels like a lot is at stake, although it's a rescue mission to save one man. So near the end, there is quite a bit of tension. I mean I wanted to get out of my seat and cheer although it's a fictional event. I also liked the message at the end about not giving up and keeping hope alive. This isn't a movie that I would want to see again immediately, but it's a really good movie to sit through at least once.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"borsch56","6","2","5","26 December 2015"," Disappointed.
","Read the book before watching this movie! I got it book for my birthday, and I was absolutely amazed. Read it in 2 days,literally, and after I've heard about the movie, normally I was excited and expected so much. Oh boy was I wrong. Matt Damon and all the other actors did an amazing job, but what I didn't like is that they stretched out the movie and also they missed some important parts of the movie. Like, for example they didn't show at all how he ***SPOILER*** changed the rover and how he had problems with the drill. They missed the sandstorm part. They missed the part where the rover flips. And that may not be a critical part for the story but I think the movie would be so much better if they added that. Also, they could've worked so much on the main character. He is showing zero emotions. He never talked about how he misses his family,wife (?) nor anything on the planet Earth. He didn't care too much if he survived or not. He realized that he had the chance to survive but also had a chance of not surviving and was not to shocked by the situation. From the very beginning he is very calm. I don't think that's a realistic scenario. I mean he just woke up on a deserted planet with a satellite antenna in his chest and he just walks right back in the habitat and just stitches himself without showing much shock or any other emotion .<br/><br/>They made him so relaxed that he even started making really bad jokes. Would be a lot better if you did the whole ""I just woke up on Mars and I don't know how will I survive"" part better Sorry, but that's a big problem. Second thing that bothered me:science facts. This is a minor problem, but the movie is crowded with scientific facts. That didn't bother me but I think that it's not really suitable to use some of the facts and ""science talk"" when doing a movie that's aimed to the general audience. There may be a lot of people who didn't understand some of the parts of the movie because of that.<br/><br/>That's my personal impression. Now I don't want to be too negative so I also want to add a couple of bright sides of this movie: filming, editing,special effects. I was really impressed by the filming, I have to admit. Overall I'm not satisfied.So much potential yet they blew it.I would compare this movie to the movie Gravity. Such a good story yet they didn't meet the expectations of the general audience."

Only the final part of the movie delivered some thrill. Actor I enjoyed the most in this movie: Benedict Wong. Actor I enjoyed the least in this movie: Sean Bean.

You just don't get attached to the characters, you don't feel anything for the characters. First of all the idea of space astronauts working on mars planet and one of them getting left behind wasn't shown properly. Acting wise no real performance , Matt Damon's character in Interstellar was far more credible than this one,In this movie his character is boring, over the top confidence that he can achieve anything with his math formulas, although he is an botanist just really didn't quite go well and also his character show's no real attachment to family on Earth.Probably only scene where he shows some kind of emotions is when he breaks down when his crops gets destroyed by storm.

"estebangonzalez10","8","2","5","22 December 2015"," Space Smart
","""I don't want to come off as arrogant here, but I'm the greatest botanist on this planet.""<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's latest film, The Martian, is an intelligently crafted science fiction drama that takes on the form of a problem-solving movie in a very nerdy way. It is not an easy movie to sell considering it is very talkative and there is a lot of science involved, but Drew Goddard's adaptation of Andy Weir's novel is quite captivating. There is no denying that the true star of the film is Matt Damon who basically manages to put on a one-man show in Mars and deliver a very entertaining performance in a similar way to what Tom Hanks did in Castaway. Although this film does give much more screen time to the characters back home as they try to communicate and find a way to bring their astronaut back, but it is Damon who really stands out. The film has been nominated for the Golden Globes for best comedy and although I don't agree with that designation it is Damon who delivers the comedy through his charismatic performance as he faces each new struggle in quite a light and positive way. The movie is a drama more than anything else and it carefully studies every scenario of what could go wrong in Mars and presents interesting solutions to those problems. Ultimately that is what makes this film stand out from other space films which Ridley himself has directed. This is a different kind of movie, a survival film with brains that respects its audience and doesn't try to include any fantastical elements for entertainment purposes (not that I have a problem with it since I was a huge fan of Prometheus, but this is a completely different genre).<br/><br/>Matt Damon gets all the credit for his charismatic performance as Mark Watney, the astronaut who is abandoned in Mars after a storm breaks out and his crew is forced to leave him behind, but the supporting cast is quite impressive as well. Jessica Chastain is Melissa Lewis, the astronaut in charge of the mission who has to make the fatal decision. The rest of the crew members are Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), Chis Beck (Sebastian Stan), and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). They don't get much screen time, but they are each given their moment and it is enough to know what motivates their decisions. I would've enjoyed to spend more time with these characters considering the cast is wonderful, but Matt Damon doesn't even give us time to miss them. The focus is on his character and he delivers every line to perfection. We are instantly drawn to his character and we identify with his struggle to survive. Back home at NASA headquarters we are also introduced to several characters who are doing the best they can to bring Mark home. Jeff Daniels is Teddy Sanders, the man responsible for any decision taken as the NASA director, Kristen Wiig is Annie Montrose, the director of Media Relations who is trying to save face in the midst of the situation, Sean Bean is Mitch Henderson, the flight director who is in contact with Watney's crew as they are returning home, and Chiwetel Ejiofor is Vincent Kapoor, the mission director. It's surprising how Ridley Scott manages to include all these characters in the film and give them a unique personality as they all join forces to come up with the best solution. Daniels plays a very similar character to who he plays in The Newsroom, but if you only know him from Dumb and Dumber than you are in for a treat. <br/><br/>When I first heard about this movie I was a bit worried about the effects that recent space films like Interstellar (which also starred Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain), Prometheus (which was directed by Ridley Scott), or Gravity might have on The Martian considering the space theme. To my surprise, the film stands out from the very opening scene as it takes a totally different approach and focuses more on Mark's survival skills and his wit. He is a very charismatic character who easily pulls you in to his conflict and allows you to participate in the problem-solution process.

","Let me start with: this is not Gravity. Although comparable (basically one actor carries the movie, trying to survive), Gravity is much better. This one is just OK. Not better or worse than that. Matt Damon is excellent as usual (as well as Chivetel Eijofor) but there is no obvious signature for Mr. Scott here (dark atmosphere, long shots and so on). It seems he was again just doing his job with not so much personal involvement. There are also some purely scientific flaws (too much light during the ""day"", for starters), but this is a movie, right? Anything passes. What this movie obviously lacks is both story and character development. Although predictable, everything happens too quickly leaving almost no space for ""digestion"" or ""surprises"" or explanations. It should probably last more than three hours or so. And it still would be fun to watch. Go for it, but don't ask yourself too many questions."

If you know anything about space or physics, you will shake your head throughout this movie. <br/><br/>The movie was unbelievable with the casting with a bunch of 20-somethings working at NASA. If you ever seen a space launch, there are a bunch of old people at the launch control who have PhDs. <br/><br/>The script was boring and filled with plot holes. Can't believe there was a book written for this movie. At least they could have asked NASA or Neil Dygrasse about what was possible.

This aspect ties in nicely with the score of the film and breath taking sound effects that have been very well mastered.<br/><br/>The story of this film is amazing, the scenario that the main character is put in to is something unimaginable to the any human.

So having said that, I loved the movie which was a surprise because I thought it would have made for a slow moving movie. And for some I'm sure it will seem that way. If you aren't enthralled by shuttle launches and realistic space travel etc, you're probably gonna want to put a gun in your mouth about half way thru.<br/><br/>but the thought of travel and survival on another planet captivates me, apparently.

","SPOILER ALERT: beginning basic plot leak<br/><br/>The Martian, directed by Ridley Scott is a shining example of the building power and artistic visual expression a film can share with a science fiction novel. This suspenseful, science fiction film starring Matt Damon as the resourceful astronaut Mark Watney, demonstrates the gripping reality of high science fiction in a vivid depiction of the dangers of being trapped on Mars. An unexpected turn of events leaves Mark Watney, thought to be left for dead yet very much alive, stranded on Mars with no communication with Earth. This unfortunate happening leaves Mark wandering the abandoned astronaut outpost originally designed for his entire team, whom evacuated Mars during a space storm. This film has an overall eerie feel, similar to several other science fiction films by Ridley Scott, like Alien or Prometheus. The dark lighting that would be expected of the outpost creates unsettling shadows during the film adding to the tension and enforcing the grave reality of Mark Watney's situation. The lone astronaut also makes log recordings on his computer throughout the movie forcing the viewer to watch the recording screen, which adds a realistic connection to common activities practiced by most viewers, similar to chat rooms or skype. This perspective is personal and would evoke pathos in most viewers. Overall this film uses many popular and sometimes overlooked elements of film to bring a great narrative to the big screen in a way that not only supports the written plot, but builds upon it."

","The Martian is the movie surprise of 2015. Well written story. The viewer is compelled with anticipation of what will happen next. The problem of a stranded astronaut. The crew which left the astronaut and N A S A all try to solve the problem. The triple layered story is intertwined perfectly. The director (Scott) gives a good pace and feel for the social, political, and science problems of the story. Well acted. Matt Damon perfectly can physically act and create solitude scenes with no dialogue. Bean and Daniels create the problem solving interchange of N A S A. Jessica Chastain shines as the leader of the space crew. Chastains strong personality kills it in every scene. The extra character development of the characters using science and deductive reasoning makes for an interesting story. The movie is a bit long but worth it. 8 out 10"

","Honestly I did enjoy the acting and could tell the cast were serious about their roles. The story was solid and convincing. What ruined it for me was the visual effects. Please note I saw this in 3D, so it may be better visually in 2D. The CGI popped out way too much. It is almost as if the effects were a layer hovering over the picture. This issue was notable in the rocket exhaust, storm, and breath vapor. Another problem was the ""soap opera effect"". The movie, at times, looked like a soap on daytime television. I actually laughed once during a scene where astronauts are supposed to be weightless in a space station; it looked way too fake. Also there were times that it felt as if scenes dragged on a little longer than they should have."
"isabelhorton","8","2","5","16 November 2015"," Mixed emotions
","I have mixed emotions about this film. The theme film is powerful, but kind of unconvincing. Maybe I expected too much, but I was expecting a tense drama on the verge of tragedy, the drama that takes you breath away while you crush your fingers and do not take your eyes off the screen. But Martian does not have nearly such tension and the audience was a bit drowsy. I do not know whether it was intentional or director and Matt Damon just did not succeed. Martian is focused on solving the problem but does not seem to deal with the problem his life depends on and the slightest mistake insures an agonizing death. There is no despair, no wrath, longing, no nothing. The visual effects are pure artwork they could have lasted longer. In some moments, you really have a strong impression that you are on Mars."
"monstermayhem32","9","2","5","3 November 2015"," A touching story of survival and Hope
","One of the amazing aspects of the Martian that makes it a great film is how there is no villain in the story but instead a rather refreshing change of pace seeing characters coming together for a common goal and that is rescuing one of the their own. The story follows the crew of the Ares 4 who are on a mission to Mars who are forced to leave the planet early due to a storm which would prevent the ship from taking off. However things get complicated when of the astronaut's Mark is accidentally left stranded on the planet when he is a amused dead. What makes Mark a great character is rather than falling into despair, he manages to keep his morale up by recording video messages and being a botanist he is able to grow his own food which is rather impressive. What I love about the film besides the scenery, music, and visual aspects is seeing how people come together and can truly bring out the best in one another when the situation calls for it. I will say Matt Damon did an excellent job in his role making his character relatable and likable. A definite must see."
"temrok9","8","2","5","2 November 2015"," The Big Other
","At first look, I dismissed The Martian as a boring, repetitive,and overfilled with blah blah and clichés film that could be classified as average the most.At second thought-and view-I discovered that there was a certain logic, and a certain attitude and pace underneath the surface of the movie, a certain way of becoming entertaining in its own way. After reading the book, I return with some remarks regarding what I consider The Martian to be.I believe that the adaptation on the screen is a very faithful one, and despite the arguments about not being explicit enough(or at all) regarding the solutions the main character finds out to the problems he encounters, I think that it captures the essence of the book perfectly. Yet I have to add that in my opinion this essence is not survival, or even science(these are obvious themes, and, of course, targets of the story), but rather Communication, and, as Jacques Lacan would put it, Communication is always a matter of speaking with the Big Other.So, what I first thought of as repetitive-the continuous talking of Mark-turns out to be a means of showing(not necessarily on purpose)the mechanisms of language and the nature of being human. The whole movie and the whole book are a series of distant communications-Mark's discourse at the centre of them-and the main invention of the writer-putting Mark in the place of an evertalking subject-is a brilliant one that does not only enable a narration that would otherwise be impossible(all these actions and events while alone on Mars), but also stresses the need to be tuned to Someone(from the point of view of Mark, it is his need not to feel alone;from our point of view it is the need to be his constant listeners, his others).Being human is being translated through the Big Other, one could say, and that's what the movie and book show, using technology as the mirror through which this translation occurs. So, despite the simplicity of the look-sorry, this is no match to 2001-there is some complex form here that works well, becomes more obvious in the movie, is more powerful in the book, and is perfectly stressed in the ending of the film, when the whole crew of the mission-and the film-are on stage, one by one:the actors in a joyful play that's called Life.There's a starman up there indeed!"
"samfischer88","10","2","5","28 October 2015"," Ridley Scott is Back!
","What a story and what a movie! Ridley Scott does an absolutely amazing job telling the story of Mark Watney, the man stranded on Mars. The story was compelling and the way the movie moved from event to event was spectacular. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. This is a serious movie about Watney as he is stranded on Mars and is has to find a way to survive while he waits for NASA to come to the rescue. Matt Damon does a stellar job as Watney and adds a great comedic presence throughout the movie. The story is serious with life and death situation, but Damon finds perfect ways to sprinkle in some laughs. The rest of the cast really steps up and contributes to the great storyline to really bring everything to life. From Jessica Chastain to Jeff Daniels, everyone developed their characters well within the flow of the story. Ridley Scott did a great job helping these characters as well. He really showed how great of a director he is by bringing this novel to life and by developing the characters as the movie progressed. There is never a dull moment and really is worth the watch."

The only thing i didn't really love was a few of the disco music parts. I think they kinda ran that joke into the ground. Other than that it was great. <br/><br/>Also, I hate to say it but how much did it cost to save that one astronaut, billions? Maybe in real life he would have just died up there. And speaking of money, they've made like 200 million on this movie and not a penny will go to nasa, space programs or scientific research. That's kind of a bummer."

Therefore, Mark has to survive alone on a planet where there's no oxygen, no water and where nothing grows.<br/><br/>In my opinion, ""the martian"" is one of the best sci-fi movie i have seen. It's full of surprises and even if the situation of Mark Watney is dramatic the director and actors are able to make us laugh. Moreover , the soundtrack is amazing and truly corresponds to the spirit of the main character. We also need to mention the setting which is brilliant and , to my mind, realistic.<br/><br/>My only criticism is that I was disappointed by the end. Unfortunately I think that the end of the movie is not as moving as the rest of the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would say that ""the martian"" is a moving and compelling movie with a lot of humor and good music.

","I nearly fell asleep at times as the lines were so corny. Very predictable and unimaginative dialogue. Yes, the special effects were good - but they always are these days. The characters were unbelievable and hollow. The film just seemed to be full of a series of poor jeopardy incidents which were then predictably solved. The final scene was particularly embarrassing (I won't give the ending away by describing it). The whole film was often like watching an American TV comedy programme(for example, the dynamics expert). This was definitely a film just made to make money in the USA rather than have any real excitement or merit. Certainly not up to Ridley Scott's normal standard. This film is not in the same league as Gravity."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","5","27 October 2015"," A straightforward, entertaining space survival thriller
","It's official – science is cool again. Yes, even science in outer space.<br/><br/>In ""The Martian,"" based on the book by Andy Weir, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) gets stranded on Mars when his crew, believing him dead after a storm, sets course for home without him. Knowing the timetable for his rescue would force him to exhaust all of the resources necessary for his survival, Watney must ""science the **** out of this"" in order to live long enough that he might ever come home.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" is built on a series of problem-solving scenarios for Watney and the others rescuing him, including the people at NASA and his crewmates from the Mars mission. The entertainment value comes not from intense drama or the usual theatrical conflict or thrills that come from science fiction, but from writer Drew Goddard's (""World War Z,"" Netflix's ""Daredevil"") plot structure of presenting the audience with an obstacle to Watney's survival or rescue followed by the clever way in which he or others maneuver around it.<br/><br/>In other words, this is not the type of outer space move you'd expect from Ridley Scott of ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" fame. ""The Martian"" hardly necessitates the guidance of such a veteran auteur, yet many might argue it's Scott's most entertaining film in a decade, and without question his most universally appealing effort in that time. It's the kind of movie that 10-15 years ago you would've expected to see Ron Howard or Steven Spielberg direct starring Tom Hanks – a character-driven survival story.<br/><br/>As such, ""The Martian"" does not warrant much comparison with recent outer space blockbusters, i.e. ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar."" These films are philosophically driven and perhaps even arrogantly intellectual; ""Martian"" is more blue-collar – its biggest ""idea"" is that with a lot of hard work, a never-give-up attitude and plenty scientific knowledge, you can do just about anything.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" doesn't need to be ""deep"" either. Damon adds depth with his performance, giving Watney real personality that's both entertaining and humanizing to his character. Considering the movie contrives a video blog for Watney in order to provide explanation of what he's thinking and doing, it takes someone of skill to turn these expository scenes into character moments. He provides both the humor and the emotion in this film, countering the annoying bickering NASA officials and scientists (Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean and Kristen Wiig). The other talented costars, including Jessica Chastain, Kata Mara and Michael Peña are hardly necessary but definitely nice to watch. <br/><br/>Would the science in the film pass the Neil deGrasse Tyson test? Probably not, but I'll let others search for that article. For most people, maybe even the true science nerds who know better, ""The Martian"" will be fun escapism at the movies.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Space seems to be the trendy environment for original cinematic adaptations to take place, this time it is Ridley Scott's chance with The Martian, starring Matt Damon.<br/><br/>During a mission to Mars, the crew must make an emergency evacuation after a fierce storm, and leave the presumed dead Mark Watney behind. Unfortunately, or fortunately, for Mark, he is not dead, he is very much alive, but is now alone and stranded on the near uninhabitable planet and must persevere if he hopes to make it off the planet alive.<br/><br/>If I've said it once, I will say it again, the best films being released recently are those that take inspiration from novels rather than exhausting the pre-existing roster with a remake. The Martian isn't quite outstanding in the way that Christopher Nolan's Interstellar captivated audiences and awards shows, in comparison, it could only compare to Interstellar if you stripped Nolan's creation of all cerebral content. It is energetically great like an action-adventure, thanks to its levity in matter rather than over- reaching toward lofty ambitions, a la Gravity, with which we were less than impressed.<br/><br/>In terms of a film, The Martian is an odd one in that, unlike most films, the audience basically knows what is going to happen. Despite this fact, you are still interested and engaged in the story and in Watney's journey, a testament to both Matt Damon's performance and the general 'light' tone created by Ridley Scott. And for a film lasting over two hours, you hardly notice thanks to its fast pace.<br/><br/>The Martian is not perfect, by any means, but it is great. Once Watney contacts NASA, the film loses a considerable amount of steam. NASA becomes a distraction from the gold of the film, and honestly I could have used less of that story line.<br/><br/>Everyone can relate to a survival story, it taps into a basic instinct all humans have, the twinge of fear that creeps up your neck telling you to fight or run, and sets it on fire. Whether this was the intention of the author Andy Weir, I can not say, but based on the film adaptation I am very interested in reading his original version of the narrative.<br/><br/>This quirky wannabe Cast Away set in space is sure to entertain movie goers, even if at times to is a bit formulaic in that manner. Using disco music, having a sassy main character, a lot of the methodical tropes of a good film are in The Martian, which is not bad per se but simply not original.<br/><br/>7.5/10 but not near enough to upgrade it to an 8 <br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."

I found his video monologue messages back to Earth, to be so void of any fear or apprehensiveness regarding his dire situation, that it was next to impossible to believe. It's an entertaining movie worth watching, but better script writing would have greatly enhanced this movie's credibility. There were other believability issues with this movie as well. Jeff Daniels' performance as the Director of Nasa, also left me with inconvincible notions. His portrayal came across as over-confident, non-charismatic, nonchalant, and pompous.

","""The Martian"" - a film about a man who gets stranded in Mars waiting for rescue from Earth. Matt Damon depicts the role of Mark Watney, a Botanist cum Astronaut. Filled with humour, Matt has done a great job in acting as always. He justifies his role as a lonely guy in a planet, but the scenes where he is shown in Mars did not give us a complete depth that he was alone,implying that Scott has done it necessarily thereby reducing the sensitive part of loneliness or at least I presume so. A great attempt at that,which can truly be appreciated. The pace of the film was always good, there are some scenes in the second half which will test your patience but none the less, they will be forgotten along the film. <br/><br/>On the note of acting, I personally couldn't find any of the character's acting extraordinary. Each and every character did what they intended to but they also stick to our mind at the end of the film so none of the characters can necessarily be said as wasted.Matt can be given the thumbs up for acting because it didn't look like he was pushing himself to give the best performance, it was with ease with which he gives us the role. <br/><br/>Scott, one of the most renowned directors before certain years definitely deserves this film as to be his comeback. I have seen a lot of Scott's film, he's a master in giving us a commercial flick but at the same time filled with all the vital elements that should reside in a GREAT film. ""The Martian"" can definitely be considered as one of the good films that got released this year. Bottomline, this is a good film which gives a average movie-goer all he wants but this cannot be considered as a GREAT film as this has only shades of it. A Good one by Scott after a long time !!"

","This movie isn't full of non stop action, but its about a man stuck on mars, and his survival. I had the pleasure of reading the book before hand, and was hands down better than the movie, but the movie was fantastic nonetheless.<br/><br/>The story takes place in the near future, and humans are able to travel to mars. One on the the missions, a dust storm hits the crew members and while trying to prep for emergency take off, Mat Damon is hit with debris, getting separated from the group. His crew members lose his vital signs, and risk all dying if they stay to look for him, so they leave, presuming he is dead. But, he isn't, and he must survive until NASA can come get him. But living on mars for years is no easy task, and he must ""science the f*#$ out it."" The movie has some very beautiful scenic shots of Mars, with the full array of stars at night, but the movie is mostly an adventure film with comedy, as Mat Damon was solve one problem after another if he is to survive. Food, water and atmosphere are all constant problems.<br/><br/>The book had A LLLOOOTTT more problems, like every chapter there was a new problem to solves, so the movie toned it down a lot more, almost too much for me, it made it look a lot easier then it was in the book. They also missed a few big problems, and instead, focused on one big one and then several small ones that were easily solvable. In the book, it took him a lot of time to solve problems.<br/><br/>But without comparing to the book, the movie had some gorgeous scenes, perfectly added humor, and was mostly evenly paced. Sometimes it did feel like it was going bad too quick, but thats a movie for you and i don't remember once where it felt like it was going too slow. There were obviously things i would have done differently, but overall, the movie was fantastic. The acting was A+, the comedy was A+, there was a slight uniqueness to the filming which made it enjoyable, switching between Mars, Hermines (other crew) and Earth, and it all came together with a fantastic ending.<br/><br/>Do i give it a 10/10, no, i mean it was amazing, but perfect. A 9/10 is better, but i blame myself for reading the book, and although i think they did a great job following the main story and adding some fun stuff, i think they did make it seem too easy for Mat Damon to solve problems, and so i would have liked to see more problems arise.

I love how the main spacecraft has gravity sometimes in some places, and not in others. That's a neat trick. LOL. I didn't pay to see this and I'm disgusted. If you pay, you'll be livid."

","The film is quite happy-clappy to the point that I'd say there is a strong possibility it was sponsored as a PR tool by NASA in preparation for the huge public expenditure they'll need for the real-life mission<br/><br/>To underline the above, we were never shown how deadly the Martian surface is (certainly they were never going to let one of the crew die!) and so I never felt any great peril. Watney didn't appear to feel he was in any great danger eitheralmost as if he was in a movie. Lol. <br/><br/>The crew were pretty forgettable and the landscapes were not alien or stunning enough. <br/><br/>The ending was particularly Disney happy-clappy.<br/><br/>Overall it was quite good but its not one I'll put on my to-buy list."
"aceofspades96","9","11","57","4 October 2015"," A definitive, eye candy success!
","The Martian was a great, fun science fiction staple in Ridley Scott's career. Of all genres of films that he's tried, this one was definitely spot on where it needed to be. Visuals were great, acting was very warm, and appealing to the audience. In short, the film is about an astronaut stranded on mars with almost no way of contact top earth.<br/><br/>Be prepared to have your mind positively blown by the visual effects in this film. This film takes the effects in Gravity, shuts them off, and tears the switch off. The setting literally looks like mars. A perfect red sky, red desolate sand, and lots and lots of red barren mountains. Zero gravity in the film is practically flawless, however Scott is really picky and choosy with Martian gravity which is about a third of earth. One aspect of gravity effects that was rather impressive was the shift from zero gravity, to earth gravity all on the same ship. Nothing like that has been done before.<br/><br/>Scott was for the most part pretty solid on keeping the science reasonable. The facts about the martian soil were correct, the rocket science was pretty much correct, so expect to be even more amazed that a lot of what happens in the film is pretty much possible! However, the time delay for radio signals would be about a half an hour, and that was pretty much ignored in the film.<br/><br/>The film had an all star cast. Matt Damon did a fantastic job playing an astronaut scientist who knows what he's doing, and can keep both his sanity, and his sense of humor even though he could die at any moment. A good actor knows how to make every character different than the other he played, and Matt Damon showed no trace of his previous roles, and carried out his own phenomenally. Be prepared to fall in love with Damon's performance.<br/><br/>The plot was very linear, and was super easy to follow. The screenplay wrote enough not to make obvious exposition lines, but also made it clear to the audience what was going on. The screenwriter didn't just throw you into the dark and expected you to make sense of the universe on your own. cough* Christopher Nolan. However, he used way too many sour jabs at humor. There were so many pointless jokes and gags that made the plot seem less serious. It really takes away from the suspense. <br/><br/>Definitely go see the film. Definitely worth seeing in theaters. Be prepared for a fun, epic joy ride from start to finish."
"sohansurag","8","6","26","6 October 2015"," Ridley Scott's Awesome Comeback!
","Minutes into The Martian, Matt Damon's Mark Watney says ""I'm gonna have to science the s**t out of this"" and I swear I chuckled so loud that the guy next to me was eyeballing me. I never thought I'd be in for a treat going for Ridley Scott's The Martian. Of course I am a huge Scott fan but his last two movies were a bit too tiresome to sit through. The aging director's prowess felt bumbling a bit, but The Martian proves that he's still got it. This is Sir Ridley Scott's awesome Comeback!<br/><br/>Lets get the obvious stuff out of the way. NO, I am not going to compare Interstellar or Gravity or even Apollo 13 with this one. 'Apples, Oranges and a PERIOD' is what I'd add if anybody'd even start to argue about the same. The Martian sits cozily in a niche that Scott has carved so well.<br/><br/>The Martian is a straightforward sci-fi drama about an astronaut stranded on Mars. It is about his sheer will that he ""wont die on Mars"" and up to his wits to survive in hopes of a rescue team to arrive. Its equal parts drama, sci-fi and survival genre and it never tries to be anything more than that. There is nothing that's too complex to comprehend, nothing that beckons for multiple viewings and despite its flaws it comes out a winner. The flaws were too obvious and felt deliberate as if Scott wanted us to ignore it and go with the flow. I had already sunk into the fact that there were so much flaws and to think about the same while watching the movie would ruin it for me. And it did wonders for me! What you get is a well acted, well written, visually arresting and unambiguous sci-fi movie with chuck-loads of comedy and tension to drive you till the finale.<br/><br/>The Martian is a Matt Damon show! He was never a bad actor but his post-Bourne roles never needed much of an effort. Scott opened an awesome sandbox for Damon where he makes the most of it. The 'log files' worked out for a great mechanic that was used to document most of Watney's life on Mars and it felt like Damon was interacting more with us than a video capture device. A stellar supporting cast also supplements The Martian's narrative. The AAA cast included Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Peña, Sean Bean, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover and instead of overcrowding the movie, each one of their performances were memorable. Even Donald Glover's barely 5 minute of screen time remains etched in my mind. Agreed it was much more fun watching Damon 'Science-ing the S**t out' but at the same time the supporting felt integral and never came off as a 'me too' addition.<br/><br/>The Martian could have easily been a tense drama or rather have an over-all grim tone but it successfully injects well paced comedy and balances out the tension and drama. Thanks to Drew Goddard the comedy in The Martian doesn't feel forced. Get me started on the licensed tracks in the movie and I might not even stop; brilliant selection of licensed tracks that gave the movie a quirky beat.<br/><br/>Sci-fi need not be mindbogglingly complex or have logical explanation for every damn detail on screen or even demand multiple viewings. Most of yesteryear's sci-fi classics focused more on 'fiction' than 'science' and it worked out well. I loved The Martian more than Interstellar or Gravity. I am no scientist and I am not here to argue about the plausibility of everything that happened in The Martian. I was there for entertainment and boy, did I get it served hot! Absolutely terrific performances by Matt Damon and the supporting cast, superbly written by Goddard and all executed perfectly well by Sir Ridley Scott. Come to think of it, even the the recent discovery of liquid water on Mars feels like a huge Marketing stint for The Martian."
"curteck","6","6","26","5 October 2015"," A Rushed Disappointment
","This is the first time I read the book before watching the movie. Perhaps you've heard the expression, ""The book is always better than the movie."" This is due to the lack of time a movie has to flesh out details compared to a book. However, it doesn't mean a movie has to be bad. A movie can be altered and still be very good. Gone Girl is an excellent example of this. The Martian does not stray too far from the book, but it does suffer from lack of tension.<br/><br/>If the point of this movie is to show the trials and tribulations of surviving on Mars, why did they gloss over Watney's efforts? One of the best scenes in the book is Watney figuring out how to survive after the airlock to the Hab blows. The first challenge was to deal with his emotions. His first reaction is to give up, sit there, and die. He calms down and starts to figure it out. He first fixes his helmet and suit with resin (by the way, this resin is used to help Watney with many issues but is absent from the movie), figures out how to create smoke to find and fix the airlock leak, and then roll the airlock close to the collapsed HAB by jumping countless times against the wall. He then has a limited amount of time (time he had to calculate with information he knew about the situation and what he knows as an engineer) to run into the HAB and find a new helmet. If his execution faltered in any way, he would have died. Watney working through these issues on screen would have created the tension needed and given weight to his efforts to survive.<br/><br/>What did the movie do for this scene? Watney ducktapes his helmet to cover the holes. That's it. The situation was far more dire and dramatic in the book. The movie decided to take the easy way out, for the sake of time, and trivialized the entire scene. There were more issues in the book, but the few they cherry picked for the movie had the same feel of it being far too easy.<br/><br/>The other issues this movie has is bland characters and gimmicky effects. A bomb made from sugar and liquid oxygen does not make beeping noises in space and you don't need silly ass flashing lights! Why are there crowds of people standing outside watching huge displays of Watney getting rescued? Can't they watch it from their home? Why is accessing the byte code of a jpeg done in two touch screen button presses? That's stupidly convenient. Why does Mitch become a pussy when confronted by Teddy? In the book he's not. Why make that change? Why have any semblance of a romance between Johanssen and Beck when it adds nothing to the story? In the book, Watney confronts Beck about his feelings towards Johanseen. This conveys the idea that these astronauts have a relationship with each other and not just silly banter.<br/><br/>My voice is in the minority if you look at the scores this movie is getting, but this movie does not stand up to serious scrutiny. The movie makers chose easy, feel good exposition and does little to challenge the audience. You got a great cast of famous actors/actresses with an awesome book as the basis for the movie. If you're not very critical of movies, chances are you'll end up liking it. For me, the movie makers were just being lazy. There's a lot of missed opportunity (like the airlock scene) and its sad to see this great story diminished. Do yourself a favor and just read the book."
"Hellmant","Null","3","10","5 October 2015"," A little too cheesy and pathetically crowd pleasing!
","'THE MARTIAN': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The sci-fi blockbuster from director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard; based on the 2011 book, by Andy Weir. It tells the story of an astronaut, that's left behind on Mars, after mistakenly being presumed dead; that desperately struggles to stay alive, while NASA tries to save him. The movie stars Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Mackenzie Davis and Donald Glover. I found the film to be very well crafted, and ultimately entertaining, but it's also just a little too cheesy, and pathetically crowd pleasing.<br/><br/>A horrible storm, on Mars (which isn't scientifically possible), wipes out astronaut Mark Watney (Damon); and he's presumed dead by his crew. The commander of the mission, Melissa Lewis (Chastain), decides to take off, and leave the planet without Watney (assuming he's dead). We soon discover that Mark survived, but his communications equipment was destroyed. Being a botanist, Watney begins growing food, in an artificial habitat his crew created. NASA later learns of Mark's survival, and plots to rescue him.<br/><br/>The film is technically very well made; it looks great and it comes to a thrilling conclusion. It's somewhat involving, and you do learn to care about the characters, but in a mostly gimmicky way. The constant video log scenes, that Mark films of himself, seem incredibly forced and clichéd. I never believed that any of the characters, in the film, were real people, and the entire movie has a very contrived/corny feel to it. I haven't read the book but I expect a lot more from Drew Goddard. I also expect a lot more from Ridley Scott; this is the man who brought us such science fiction classics as 'ALIEN', 'BLADE RUNNER' and 'PROMETHEUS' (all much better movies than this). 'THE MARTIAN' kind of feels like a cheesy US military propaganda film, except it's made to support NASA instead.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/NdWU81GeyN4"
"kristian_cooper","9","6","28","5 October 2015"," Cast away meets Apollo 13
","As I sit here writing this I am also listening to an interview with author Andy Weir. Andy Weir wrote the book on which this film is based and its quite interesting how the book now film came to be. Andy like me was also a Sci Fi nut so went about writing science fiction and posting it online. However when he began writing ""The Martian"" there were no aliens, no star cruisers, no lasers this time round. Instead it was all researched scientific fact and it revolved around a manned trip to the planet Mars. Each week he would post new chapters online and would ""update"" chapters each time his readers corrected his factual inaccuracies. Eventually he had completed a book, it soon got published from online to paperback and the rest is history.<br/><br/>We have been graced with several poor adaptations of mars in recent times from the likes of the pitiful ""Red planet"" and ""Mission to mars"" and I don't think Hollywood wanted to finance big budget sci fi films after several flops but then blockbusters ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"" came round and we all know how amazing they were This brings us to the newest member of the Science fiction film family 'The Martian'. Ridley Scott created some Sci Fi masterpieces in Aliens and Bladeunner so when I heard he was attached to this film I was already anticipating this one. The premise is simple. A manned mission to mars in the not too distant future encounters a freak windstorm. Forced to evacuate the planet in the chaos they drop everything, leave behind astronaut Mark Watney believing he is dead and begin the journey back to earth. In actual fact Mark survived but has been injured after being impaled by his communication antenna. With no way of contacting NASA or his crew and the next mission to arrive on Mars another 4 years away not to mention dwindling food supplies Mark is left with a pretty tricky situation. <br/><br/>What happens next has been described as cross between cast away and Apollo 13. The film alternates between 3 main facets. NASA mission control on Earth, The crew members of the Ares 3 mission en route to earth and Mark Watney now stranded on Mars and the actors chosen for each portray them brilliantly. Note to Jeff Daniels try a serious role like this one rather than a silly sequel to Dumb and Dumber. Matt Damon portrays the role of Mark Watney perfectly from his mannerisms to his humour. Far from thinking this future is bleak and I'm gonna die on this god forsaken planet Watney takes a Bear Grylls style approach to survival and proclaims If I'm to survive here 'I'm gonna have to science the $#!@ out of this'. Each ""Sol"" (means Mars day) he updates us on his situation via his ""Video journal"" For the budding science minded individual like me many of his ideas also came into my head as I viewed the film but for the average Joe the film is not difficult to understand. I was afraid of the film having a lot of scientific jargon but was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to understand what was going on. <br/><br/>When NASA caught wind of this film being in production they were more than happy to lend their expertise to help this novel translate to the big screen. Legally you are not allowed to portray NASA in any other form without their express written permission anyway... In a way you could say this is a product placement promotion for the future of NASA which in a way it is but hey that's a good thing. Its not fully 100% accurate. We do know that the winds on Mars are no way near as strong enough to generate the storm style winds but by and large the film gets the science right. We have to remember it's a film not a science lesson. Author Andy Weir even calculated the trajectories, distances among other things to ensure everything is told as it will be when we finally make that mission to the red planet. <br/><br/>This film is simply stunning simply amazing but it will also have some good competition with the upcoming Oscar awards. ""The Walk"" and ""Everest"" come to mind. If this film doesn't win any awards I will be bitterly disappointed because I can already foresee Matt Damon standing on stage accepting an award for ""Best Actor"" So with that in mind go out and watch this film already if you haven't done so you WONT regret it."
"liberationz","9","6","29","5 October 2015"," Ridley Scott could be back.
","Has Ridley Scott finally returned to form with The Martian? Well seeing that The Martian turned out to be one of the best films of the year, you can say yes! After a period of mediocrity by Scott, The Martian was a reminder that Scott is one of the great directors living today. When you initially look at this film on paper, you see an amazing cast, good writer, and shaky director, but this film had it all. First of all it is amazing to look at. The cinematography is stellar, shot by Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Exodus: Gods and Kings, Alice in Wonderland). Ridley Scott's execution of this film was outstanding, he made you feel like they were actually on Mars. When you look at this cast, which has various Oscar nominated actors you are expecting the performances to be good (maybe not great cause look how the Counselor turned out), and they deliver big time! Matt Damon who played Mark Watney was obviously the star of the movie. He delivered on all aspects, and might be one of his best performances of his career. Jeff Daniels (Teddy Sanders) does an amazing job in this movie, playing a real human being, a business man who is concerned only about what is best for NASA. He is not the antagonist at all, even though he might be made out to seem like it. The whole crew consisting of Jessica Chastain (Melissa Lewis), Sebastian Stan (Chris Beck), Michael Peña (Rick Martinez), Kate Mara (Beth Johanssen), and Aksel Hennie (Alex Vogel) played off each other so wonderfully. It seems like they have been together for such a long time and the chemistry is beautiful. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Vincent Kapoor) was superb, but when is he not? Sean Bean was Sean Bean really, nothing super spectacular, but not bad. Kristen Wigg, leaving we can say her comfort zone in comedy and doing some drama, did well, didn't disappoint. Surprising performance came from Mackenzie Davis (Mindy Park) who blew me away. My least favorite was Donald Glover who seemed out of place in this movie and was one really slight negative, but did not detach me from the film. This movie is really an original piece, of human survival and hope. Ridley Scott managed to make this movie feel so real, you were scared for the well being of Matt Damon while he was stuck on Mars. The writing was outstanding as well, done by Drew Goddard. It was the perfect blend of comedy and suspense. The big things I was worried did not happen at all. Mainly being that the movie seemed to spoiled by the trailers, but it wasn't! Also the science behind it all which I thought could become confusing, wasn't! This film ended up being one of my favorite of the year, and made me remember what a great director Ridley Scott can be, and don't be surprised come Oscar time, you see The Martian in the running for an award. Highly recommended a must see this year."

The movie is about a guy who gets hit by this thing when there's a storm and then they take off cause they think he's dead and he's actually not. So he can't contact nasa and he's trapped in mars. This movie is not like 127 hours and buried at least those were intense not like this they don't take it serious.

There were good actors in it and I love Matt Damon he's one my favourite actors. There's one scene in the movie he's doing this thing and the thing exploded in his face and he's still alive, I was like how the heck is he still alive and his face only and a scar and 2 scratches on it.

"spartancurtis","9","2","6","29 December 2015"," One of the best Sci Fi films made( Don't listen to the haters)
","First let me start off by saying that this movie isn't going to have a masterpiece plot with development between the characters and yeah there are some minor flaws that i will get into. Don't listen to the bad reviews, the characters are fine the way they are. Its a copy paste of Apollo 13 pretty much expect its on mars, it has Matt Damon, and there is only one man to save. The movie doesn't pretend to be unique or something its not. The trailer, the title don't give you anything else as to what this is. Its a simple rescue mission to go get Matt Damon off of mars, and we get to see how he survives it. <br/><br/>The acting was great, the characters also were great. You could relate to all of them and there struggles of what choice was the right one on getting Mark Watney (Matt Damon) home. Mark Watney is a very likable character that the audience can cheer on and support through the movie.The science is very accurate sure there are a few flaws which i will start with first. <br/><br/>The intro was a little confusing, at first i questioned whether or not the storms on mars were that powerful, or whether or not there were any storms at all on real life mars. I did end up finding out that mars does have storms, but the storms wouldn't be able to push watney all the way out onto the landscape like that, nor would it be able to cause the module so much damage that they have to take off and leave without him. Other than that this films adaption of the mars setting and environment, along with what Mr. Watney had to do to survive is very accurate and beautifully portrayed. For example, when Mark Watney figured that he only had enough food for 400 days at most. He figured he had to create his own artificial environment inside the station to farm food and sustain himself until rescue. "" In order to make water you need to combine hydrogen and oxygen and you burn"". That was the only way for him to get enough water to farm his crops, he barely enough water to drink and for sanitation to begin with, so that was the only method he could use. As we all know inside the station, its basically pure oxygen so he had to be careful to only use small sparks to create it. When he was successful at doing this he then had his moment of triumph and cheered right in front of artificial water maker adding extra oxygen to from his own breath caused an explosion. The travel time between earth and mars is very realistic as well, during the movie you can just feel time passing by and watney doing his daily chores next to the station or hab and Ares 3 seemingly taking forever to get back to earth. FINALLY it accurately depicts what long term space travel is like, its brutal and long and boring. The gravity isn't accurately depicted, which is forgivable. You cant film all sequences like this underwater or with CGI you need times where film has to be shot, so its forgivable and i will give that a pass. All and all this is a very good movie and you should go watch it when it comes out on DVD on January 16th 2016"
"dromasca","6","2","6","29 December 2015"," techno-survival
","I expect something special when I go to a film by Ridley Scott . In his long and remarkable career Scott approached many genres from space horror to historical sagas, from road movies to gangster comedies and succeeded exceptionally well in many of these. The secret is of course professionalism, the talent to tell a story, and to build (sometimes) greater-than-life characters which are credible in extreme situations. He tried to do the same with 'The Martian' but in my opinion he did not succeed too much.<br/><br/>Maybe the problem lies in trying to build too much on the combination of two successful genres - the sole survivor story and the big space drama. The second genre was pretty successful in the previous two Academy Awards seasons (with 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar') and Scott and his producers may aim for a similar fate for 'The Martian' - the saga of an astronaut believed dead and left behind on Mars, to be rescued in an extreme action of inter-planetary dimension. We'll see if he succeeds, but on my scale he rather failed.<br/><br/>The sign of such a film not really succeeding is when the day or the days after you remember more the technical aspects. This exactly happens to me with this film. Planting potatoes on Martian soil and sealing a space vehicle with adhesive tape has some fun of itself, but it dangerously competes with the human dimension of the story, with the fight of the lonely astronaut to overcome the elements and his own despair. Matt Damon is a fine action movies lead actor but he's no Tom Hanks (not yet, at least) and his role here may not get him even an award nomination. This techno-survival story leans too much on the technology side."

","Matt Damon is stranded on Mars and after a couple years or so will run out of food. Naturally, federally-funded Space Agencies worldwide spend billions to rescue him! Sure, they COULD spend that same money to improve the lives of many thousands of people here on earth. But that thought isn't meant to cross the audience's mind. It definitely doesn't occur to Matt Damon's character, either. At every step, our protagonist is two-dimensional, completely self-absorbed, entirely unsympathetic. He relishes his role as ""colonizer of worlds"" but refuses to accept that his life is of limited value. Instead, science is his salvation and the rest of humanity is just another tool for him to ply. His interminable video selfies are an indictment of our era, of our inability to tell a story or to live a true narrative. This movie is bereft."

","The main problem with the Martian, is that we don't feel the desperate condition Mark is supposed to be. <br/><br/>I am not sure if this is a directing problem or Mat Damon's approach to the role. The thing is, the stranded hero is so cool and calm and super smart that makes everything to appear so easy. It is like if you are watching Superman doing his daily chores. <br/><br/>Maybe this could work better as a mini-series. Or focus on what is going on in the planet and not on earth. <br/><br/>Only during the end, when our hero is almost starved and weak he finally shows human. Well at least till the moment he casually says ""I am OK just broke my ribs"". <br/><br/>So it is an interesting movie, especially while watching all the tricks and solutions each side finds to help our hero come back home.<br/><br/>But it is without a feeling and strong emotion.

In fact, Mark is so good at this that he is capable of gaining our sympathy down the road. The visual appeal of this movie is positive featuring ochre sand and picturesque backdrop. You will watch a blend of NASA chic and an Alien 3-like environment here.<br/><br/>Lived-in Feel The movie will also make you feel a lived-in thrill from time to time. The Martian is particularly appealing for younger audiences looking for new things to learn about science. For example, the movie shows a strong interest in chemistry, astronomy and biology. This can be something of great interest for a younger audience. In fact, this movie has gotten a lot of benefits from the recent scientific news on Mars. This moving picture is truly a mix of human drama, humor and adventure. Mark's does face aliens but time, desperation and the outer space's woolly nature.<br/><br/>Damon Shines In this entertaining movie, Matt Damon demonstrates why he is an A-lister. Matt is always working hard to give forth the best of his talent in every movie. This movie is also a love letter to man's desire to reach the stars. You will not find any dark, ugly environment here, as the movie is full of color, good vibe and life. The best the human spirit can produce is here, as Mark strives to provide the audience with clues on how to deal with daunting situations. The lead actor is very croky and we suspect the movie is all about this trait. Anyway, this sci-fi movie just stands out."

","There have been a lot of movies and TV shows about the red planet. Most of them I've enjoyed. I also like Damon. He's a good all round talent. Had me believing the story in a matter of minutes. Likewise with Ridley Scott. Always find myself engrossed in his imagined world almost immediately. You may be asking yourself if this is building up to a 'but' here?' No not really. But (haha!) whilst I really enjoyed this movie, I did think to myself that this had been done before in a round about way. I'm referring to the 1964 movie called 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars' starring TV Batman Adam West. Of course without the monkey and man/alien companion 'Friday'. News has been floating around about Scott developing screenplays for a couple of classic sci-fi books. Notably Larry Niven's 'Ringworld' and Joe Haldeman's 'The Forever War', both award winning reads and firm fan favourites. Judging by his previous efforts including 'The Martian' I'd say Scott is more than qualified to turn these fabulous classic stories into first rate movies. Especially since Scott relies a lot less on over the top special effects (think Transformers 4 Age of Extinction) and more on script and good casting/acting."

Visuals were no doubt awesome. The vast desolate Martian landscape leaves a mark. But somehow this movie reminds of many other science fiction movies.

","After Robert Zemeckis' «Contact» cinema goers haven't seen any sci- fi movie about optimistic sight of our universe and space theme. Even a new wave of realistic science fiction movies (Cuaron's «Gravity», Nolan's «Interstellar») focused on Tarkovsky's man-needs- man idea. Space means not the future of humanity, but loneliness, emptiness and things like that. But it's obviously a truism. And a new Ridley Scott's masterpiece «The Martian» is going to prove it. <br/><br/>In the very near future manned missions to Mars become as if every day routine. But one of these missions called Ares-3 fails with the sandstorm. Almost all astronauts make it to evacuate in time, but their crew member Mark Watney is presumed dead and left behind on the red planet. But Watney survives and finds himself alone. His task is to survive and find the way to contact the Earth until he'll starve and freeze to death. <br/><br/>After a row of mediocre works («Exodus: Gods and Kings», «The Counselor») it's okay to think that Ridley Scott has forgotten how to direct movies. But in «The Martian» it feels like it's made by the creator of «Alien» and «Blade Runner», and not by an old fart responsible for «Prometheus». Scott always finds a way to entertain the audience by lots of humor and he knows how to satisfy geeks hungry for the real scientific movies without pretentious philosophism.<br/><br/>But there is still a serious message in «The Martian». Mark Watney is the embodiment of a man of scientism and positivism. He tries to survive not just by sitting and hoping, or by believing in God, or by «the power of love». He builds a natural kitchen garden and grows potatoes for food, becomes a space pirate and the first colonizer of Mars and the one thing that bothers him is that he should do all this things during listening to disco music. Even in the moment when Watney thinks that there's no chance to abandon the planet, he doesn't whine about his existential loneliness, but admires the beautiful Mars' landscapes and says like: «Well, I tried the best I can but if it's not enough I should deal with it». <br/><br/>Sometimes Ridley Scott shows some problems with the rhythm of narrative. Especially close to the end where there are too many scenes about NASA and Watney's rescue crew and the protagonist is in the middle distance. «The Martian» could be more spectacular, but Scott is too focused on the story. The happy end can be also criticized, because it's too naive and idealistic, despite it really fits the movie and works for the idea. But every bean has its black. «The Martian» is the best entertainment of this year since George Miller's «Mad Max: Fury Road» and a new sci-fi classic of all time."

Yes, there are assholes who just don't care, but they're massively outnumbered by the people who do."" - Mark Watney (The Martian) <br/><br/>The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator) and stars Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting, The Bourne Trilogy, The Departed) as astronaut Mark Watney who is on a mission to Mars that is supposed to last two months but instead only lasts two days due to a severe storm. When trying to evacuate, Mark is hit with debris and stranded on Mars while his crew leaves because they think the debris killed him. However, Mark is alive and now has to figure out how to survive 4 years with limited supplies and no connection to Earth or NASA. <br/><br/>The acting is definitely one of the high points of this movie, particularly Damon's performance as astronaut Mark Watney. Damon was very believable in the role and managed to pull off comical moments and moments of intense peril. He had to carry a lot of the movie on his own which is a tough feat to accomplish but he did it well. The supporting cast includes Jessica Chastain (Interstellar), Jeff Daniels (Dumb and Dumber) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), who also do an amazing job. They sell the intensity and drasticness of the situation very well. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, we see Watney applying accurate scientific methods to ration his food and supplies. You really get the feeling of how hard he worked to survive on the planet. Furthermore, the visuals were spectacular, with the feeling you are actually on Mars: Mars actually looks like Mars and not just a boring desert. The story was well shot and well told and the viewer is always interested in what's happening.<br/><br/>In the end we really enjoyed The Martian and thought it was well-acted and spectacularly directed. It is definitely an experience that should be seen in the movie theater and we highly recommend seeing it in theaters. 9/10"

","All right, I'm not a famous movie critic and I am not the one who offers projects to Ridley Scott but this time he made a wise decision and chose to direct The Martian. I had fun writing my previous review.. I was mean & nasty with Ridley. Then I couldn't imagine why he made such a bad movie as Prometheus. It was junk, if you like junk, make yourself comfortable and watch it. I really wanted to cry just 20 minutes into the movie and he deserved all my wrath. When I finished my Prometheus review I left a door open for him...I knew somewhere in his cortex... his talent was there. He just had to try a little bit harder to regain his mojo. And he did! The Martian is fun to watch, has everything a movie needs (well, no sex in Mars) and the story makes sense. This is where I disagree with other reviewers, some say he could have done it better. The problem with space movies is that you have to choose between two options. Are you looking for a science compliant movie like 2001 or space fun like Star Wars. Yes, some scenes cause me to get drowsy a bit and needed a dose of extra excitement but this could just hurt; I guess Ridley wanted to keep the story believable. You did it right Ridley, see you at the Oscars. (Hey.. Academy, I'm a critic, send me an invitation)."
"vsks","9","2","6","6 November 2015"," It's Not Just Sci-Fi--It's about the Human Spirit!
","Ridley Scott's movie based on the runaway best-seller by debut author Andy Weir is a knockout. But then I'm a sucker for stories with a big component of ""how to make things work."" The hero of this story, astronaut Mark Watney has to get a lot of things working very fast, when the crew of the ARES III Mission inadvertently strands him on Mars, ""the first person to be alone on a whole planet."" Watney (played by Matt Damon) is left behind when a massive sandstorm threatens the entire crew. Flying debris damages his biotelemetry unit, which registers him as dead. And in the storm, they can't find his body. First, he must solve the problems of food and water, long-term, since it will take at least four years until another Mars mission could rescue him, even if NASA knows he's still alive. Which he has no way of telling them. It's a test of humanity to put a person in extreme circumstances, and you cannot get any more extreme than the surface of the Red Planet. Back on Earth, though, eagle-eyed Mars-watchers notice movement on the planet surface and come to an obvious conclusion. The race is then on—against distance, bureaucracy, technological limitations, and the implacable elements of Mars. All I can say is I'm glad I'm not NASA Director Teddy Sanders's (Jeff Daniels) or his media relations director (Kristen Wiig). Especially strong were the roles of Jet Propulsion Lab director Bruce Ng (played by Benedict Wong), and ARES III Mission Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain). Matt Damon is terrific, as always, in the role of Watney. Just the right mix of angst and wit, supported by an excellent script from Drew Goddard. The Martian surface was filmed in Wadi Rum, Jordan. I know there are people who believe they don't like science fiction. To me, movies like this are less about the science and more about the human spirit and how it can engage with the creative mind. The science makes it read ""real."" As The Atlantic critic Christopher Orr wrote, ""Excellence in cinema is sometimes a singular achievement . . . On other occasions, it's the result of extraordinary collaboration. The Martian is one of these."""

"Likes_Ninjas90","6","2","6","31 October 2015"," The Martian isn't a great film but at the very least it shows that there is still some life left inside of Ridley Scott's directorial efforts
","The Martian isn't a great film but at the very least it shows that there is still some life left inside of Ridley Scott's directorial efforts. The English director is seventy-seven now and in the twilight of his career. Some of the films he has made recently have been overblown and disappointing, in spite of the impressive casts he musters. He has returned to space and science fiction, a genre explored in his two most popular films Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982). Those two films were warnings about the future, technology and dangerous new worlds. The Martian has some of these elements but is comparatively, a more hopeful film. It is generically concerned with American individualism but also what can be achieved through being calculated and accounted for, which is, coincidentally, a positive trait of filmmaking itself by being measured as a director, rather than indulging in excess.<br/><br/>Adapted by screenwriter Drew Goddard from Andy Weir's book, the film focuses on Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon), who is an astronaut and biologist left behind on Mars after his crew (Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara) abandons the red surface and believes he has died. Wounded, Mark uses his skills and resources as a biologist to inhabit and live on the red planet. He uses feces for example as fertiliser so that he can grow tiny plants and consequently, potatoes that he can eat. Whether this is plausible or not isn't up for debate. Rather, it's refreshing how the film makes the action practical for its main character, focussing on his resourcefulness rather than bombastic special elements and fight scenes. This is a gentler blockbuster and also one with an unexpected funny bone, freeing it from the self-seriousness pretensions that engulfed Interstellar—the film to which it's regularly compared.<br/><br/>However, more could have been made of Mark's isolation and the terror of being the single person alone on the planet. Compromises are made which offset the isolation, including Matt Damon's persistent narration to a camera (and the audience) as he documents his journey. Using pop tunes such as Abba from a music collection of one of Mark's crew members is also like an offshoot of brighter sci-fi films such as Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). Matt Damon is very charismatic, funny and likable in the lead role but a shade of seriousness and trauma is missing from his performance. Rather than countering the film's commercial elements, such as its humour and its bright tone with a dose of realism and psychology, Mark resorts to jokes and punchlines, which makes him too relaxed for the singular person on the planet. One shot which demonstrates Mark's physical deterioration is late in the piece, when his wilted frame emerges from a shower.<br/><br/>Mark is not entirely alone throughout the film because it also extends into earth scenes, which thematically stress the ethics of media and control. The closest the film has to a villain, there are thankfully no aliens or monsters, is Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels who is excellent), the director of NASA. He is reluctant to tell the crew about Mark still being alive and also stalls a rescue operation because he is more concerned about the pictures being posted, which would reveal the carelessness of the operation. In one sequence, he also opts to skim through a safety protocol to fast-track the launch of a rocket. Whereas Mark rations his food and counts his resources, Teddy is equally calculated in his strategies, opting to take shortcuts if it's more convenient. Is Teddy perhaps representing the over controlling studio boss who wants production rushed and is pitted against the micromanagement and attention to detail? There are other strong actors here, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, Sean Bean and Jessica Chastain, who make memorable impressions with their roles and overcome the script's lack of backstory and inner lives.<br/><br/>As a showpiece of spatiality and 3D technology, The Martian is predictably an impressive specimen. The film has generally high production values, expected at this level, but most surprising is the way in which the 3D effects are gently pushed into the frame to enhance the shape of the spacecraft's passageways or the vast open spaces of the red planet itself. The shots of Mark sitting alone in the open are examples of when the film conveys the empty plains of Mars and his detachment from humanity. Once the film overcomes the weight of some of its scientific jargon in the dialogue, which can be intimidating late in the film, it also becomes an exciting rescue mission. The finale is staged with an impressive amount of tension and great skill from this experienced director. It may not be Ridley Scott most impressive film but it shows that after decades in the industry, he remains entirely capable of fine craftsmanship."

","Seriously. I thought this was perfect. For the last hour or so (from when they start playing Starman as the crew on Hermes enact the plan to go back and rescue) I was fully emotionally engaged, and as absorbed as I have ever been in a film.<br/><br/>The film is well paced, with good inserts of humour (to relieve the tension). The best is Sean Bean explaining why the new rescue plan is named Elrond, after the council which reached dangerous but decisive decision in Lord of the Rings. The science grew in complexity, and was always believable if sometimes not perfect (don't know where extra oxygen coming from for explosion, and not sure why they got weight and hence acceleration and then altitude wrong when he takes off from Mars, but at the time who cared) it never got into pseudo science or techno-babble.<br/><br/>I have read critical reviews complaining of ""no emotional engagement"", and one saying ""no explanation why so motivated to get back to earth"". I don't like criticising other reviews - everyone has a right to their opinion - but really. Perhaps their life's are so unemotional and empty of hope and imagination that the simple idea of continuing to live isn't enough.<br/><br/>I had to sit and wait before I drove home as I was still choked up 15 minutes after the end (and I am an notoriously unemotional bloke out of the old school). Both my daughters (ages 11 and 17) agreed with best they've seen.<br/><br/>I really hope this popularises reality, science and true adventure.<br/><br/>It won't, but it should win every award going. I haven't mentioned actors - I judge excellence when I forget the actor and focus on character. After the abandonment on Mars Matt Damon was forgotten and it was just Mark Watney, which is the highest praise I can give. Others all believable and solid. Final spoiler - Sean Bean doesn't die!<br/><br/>For anyone with interest in good old Newtonian physics, adventure, and great visuals should rush to see. Best film ever"

A survival story in space seems like an interesting idea but while I was watching it, I felt like I had already seen this somewhere else, in Interstellar and Gravity to an extent. Some shots felt exactly the same (because the technology is the same (realistic) there are only few ways to shoot a docking scene) and I felt more invested in Interstellar movie where they go and rescue a scientist (played by Matt Damon. The feeling of deja vu reminded me of how more i had enjoyed interstellar which I then reflected cant be much because I had felt like Interstellar hadn't been a good movie. Some things i Didn't like about the movie itself. I felt that because of the nature of the story, we were only really seeing the highlights when we would see Matt Damon talk to the camera. I understand that it seems more realistic but I would've preferred less time between scenes on Mars. Time passes unnaturally, sometimes at normal speed an then we jump four years in the future. So that the movie is realistic, these time jumps have to be included but it just felt too long. Matt Damon was a pleasure but we didn't really spend enough time with anyone else for a lasting impression."

On Mars, a planet boasting every shade of orange, why not a forest green spacesuit with blue accents, to contrast with the desert planet, to identify Mark Watney as a botanist, an Earthling, a fish out of water? If I were the cinematographer or colorist, I'd be irked by an orange suit against an orange landscape. <br/><br/>But then again...orange to blend into his environment, like a ranger in camouflage, Mark's rugged armor in a barren wasteland of sand. Blue for water. Orange for desert. Orange because the movie title is ""The Martian"". As a driver glimpsing the billboard, I'd buy a Mars-bound astronaut in an orange spacesuit.<br/><br/>But the details don't add up to detract from the big picture, the crazy idea:<br/><br/>Mark Watney. One man representative of humankind. Stranded on Mars.<br/><br/>What would it be like for all of humanity to follow the journey of one man? One man whose only goal is to save himself-- to simply get by in life? Get by alone, in a desert that engulfs a whole planet, until a rescue mission reaches him from Earth, 225 million km away. It's not completely hopeless. He's got all of humanity on his side. Humankind united, rooting for him to survive. The brightest minds collaborating with the best resources at hand in an international truce to save one man. It's inspiring, to say the least. <br/><br/>Mark Watney, he's got brains and brawn. He's creative, optimistic, funny! He deserves to be saved.<br/><br/>The Martian approaches sci-fi like a captain's log after a shipwreck on a deserted island. In the book, the author's passion shines greatest in Mark's every step of every problem, logged in great detail. It reads at times like a survival guide. The movie adapts many events to be more cinematic and engaging in the film medium. Precisely this attention to realism, in both movie and book, makes the impossible seem possible, sparks curiosity and raises questions. People are wondering about science and space.<br/><br/>The Martian shines brilliantly in realism and faith in humanity. It makes a science fiction concept a world away feel like a news story that happened a month ago. The Martian has crazy ideas that seem too crazy to be true, yet crazy ideas are the ones that change history and progress humankind. For example-- the time is now: we can send astronauts to Mars."

"adean81","9","2","6","17 October 2015"," The Martian Review
","Set on Mars, The Martian is a unique science fiction movie that follows astronaut and botanist Mark Watney, as he tries to survive on the desolate planet. After being injured and separated from his crew, they leave him and return to the space station ""Hermes"", presuming Watney to be dead. He then wakes up in the desert only to find that his crew has left him behind. Trying to survive off of left over meal rations, Watney has to figure out a way to make water, grow potatoes and communicate with NASA, in order to plan a rescue mission back home to Earth. <br/><br/>One of the things that I really enjoyed about this film is the humor. While there is a lot of suspense in the movie, it is inter- cut with a lot of humor, mostly from Mark Watney and his video journals. I think that the video journals work well to show us how Watney is dealing with being alone and also gives a different way to show him on Mars, without the camera just following him around all the time. It gives the movie a cinematic feel, like it is is based on a true events, rather than a book. <br/><br/>At 141 minutes the movie never drags because the action, suspense and humor are all well paced throughout the film. The cut backs between Mars and Earth also help to keep the story moving forward without feeling the length of the movie. Director Ridley Scott is known for his visually stunning movies and this one is no exception. The sets on Mars and in the space station are spectacular and it feels like the movie was really shot on Mars. There are some great anti-gravity scenes inside the Hermes station that are as good as the scenes from the movie Gravity and made me believe this crew is really in space.<br/><br/>Not only is this a great story telling movie with amazing visuals but it also has an all star cast. Matt Damon does a great job playing Mark Watney, with the majority of his scenes being alone on Mars. The supporting cast of Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain and Chiwetel Ejiofor are just as great and add a more grounding and realistic element to the rescue mission plot of the movie. A character that I really enjoyed was the young NASA analyst Mindy Park played by Mackenzie Davis. Her character is just some nobody NASA employee that discovered Watney was alive and got caught up in the mission and put in charge of monitoring Watney's movements on Mars. While it's a minor role, a few scenes here and there, it brings in a character that the audience can relate to. <br/><br/>The movie does have a couple of minor problems, none of which really distracts from the story, but rather would have enhanced it. There is almost no mention of Mark Watney's family or life back home. Adding something small like that would give more weight to Watneys motivations for returning to Earth. Another small part that was a bit overlooked was the integration of working with the Chinese government. There was scene discussing working together but then it just happens. I'm guessing this could be due to time constraints but an extra scene negotiating between the two governments trying to solve this problem would have added more realism to the movie. Again these are just minor issues, the majority of the movie is fantastic.<br/><br/>After seeing other movies, like Gravity and Interstellar, The Martian is probably my favorite. For me the pacing and use of humor are what made it more enjoyable and kept me invested. Overall this is a fun movie with some suspense and action that I highly recommend every one seeing. This is one that I will for sure end up buying on Blu-Ray when it comes out."

","The director of such movies as 'The Duellists', 'Blade Runner', 'Thelma and Louise', 'Gladiator' and 'Alien', Ridley Scott, has returned to the masterful level from whence he came. The beautiful landscape of Mars, a compelling and at times hilarious script, and an all star cast make this a spectacle, to be seen on the big screen. The film is NOT based on a true story, as some thought, but a fictional novel by Andy Weir. This outdoes the book in many aspects, something few films besides The Lord of the Rings manage. The film looks and sounds beautiful, there is a wonderful sense of atmosphere, and its a feel good movie. By the run of the end credits, you feel great, and while i'm not a huge fan of this genre (I was disappointed by movies like Interstellar, 2001 and Gravity) I still loved it. Besides a sense of predictability (even if you haven't read the book) and the fact that Sean Bean doesn't die, this movie is a great one, up there with Mad Max: Fury Road as one of 2015's greatest films. Final Score: 9/10 - Incredible"
"lanegramiak-118-110668","9","2","6","16 October 2015"," A true Ridley Scott masterpiece
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to finish. Despite it being almost 2.5 hours I never once stopped paying attention. The story was kept up throughout very well. Matt Damon among the other actors delivers a remarkable performance, and it was definitely one of my favourites with him in it (The Departed being number one). I would like to add one thing about how they wrapped it up at the end. I've always been a fan of the epic endings that tie the movie back together and reference something earlier in the movie then cuts to black (like Wolf of Wall Street, the ""sell me this pen"" which was referenced earlier and is the last line of the movie). In my opinion they should have had him teaching before they had him on the bench, and when he looks down and sees the plant growing and says ""hey there"" like he did earlier, that's where I thought they could have cut to black. Other than that no complaints and that definitely was not the last time I'll see it."

Maybe for people who have not read the original novel, that not so bad, however I strongly doubt that, as even for the one who knew the background stories and the causes and the reasons of the actions - the movie was still very ambiguous, with no suspense and quarter-heart at most."

","Seeing that there are some people that took this movie seriously and genuinely believed it, just says it all. Be it that humanity is on a steady decline or that The Martian was just that good.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott has brought a whole new bar to the table and has set it very high. He along with this extraordinary cast and crew have made a truly breathtaking film. From the trilling 'on the very edge of your seat chewing your nails down to the bone', the truly sad and tear wrenching moments or the great sense of humour that is shown throughout the film, Ridley Scott and his team have, in my opinion, made the greatest movie this year."
"thefilmlawyers","9","2","6","14 October 2015"," A comeback for Sir Ridley in the form of the Martian Wasteland
","By: Basel Exposition<br/><br/>Mx8WA<br/><br/>The Martian, I believe, is the comeback film for director Sir Ridley Scott after the disappointment of Prometheus and the wretchedness of Exodus: Gods and Kings. It features a cast that would be quicker for you to search up on your favourite movie database than me listing each and everyone here. But the important person is ""The Martian"" himself, Matt Damon playing Mark Watney. And to start with, this movie was absolutely golden in terms of the visuals, the comedic factor and the overall ""gripiness"" of the plot. <br/><br/>There is so much to say about The Martian, but I think the first thing the viewer notices is the scenery and the visuals. The movie starts off right in the heart of Mars; and even though it's filmed in the Jordanian desert, the accuracy in which the Martian landscape is captured is absolutely gorgeous. The Scientifical anomaly that is the opening storm that strands Mark on Mars is beautifully done in its scope even if the reported 150 mph winds on Mars should have just been a slight breeze. But I'm not about to use that detail to bash on the movie, rather it uses what is found in Andy Weir's source and integrates absolutely beautifully. <br/><br/>Now, in terms of being true to its source, there are maybe 2-3 missteps, which if you've read the book before (or after) the movie, you will notice very clearly. However, I truly believe that films should be able to stand on its own merit without having to be constantly compared to its source and The Martian's adaptation by Drew Goddard is done in a way where even though the deviations are there in the movie, you immediately let it go because of all that's going on with the film all around you. <br/><br/>The performances are very good, especially the very nuanced and quite accurate portrayal of Mark Watney by Matt Damon. The jokes that made the book such a delight to read were delivered on point by Damon and honestly the movie was a lot funnier than many of the comedies that have played in theatres this year. Jessica Chastain's character portrayal of Commander Lewis was very nuanced and a perfect casting to play someone who had the range of emotions needed for first, believing she had left Mark for dead on Mars, and then finding out that she had left her crew mate behind. Back on Earth, Jeff Daniels is in full Will McAvoy form. There really is no performance in this movie that can be at fault and were played absolutely to a tee. <br/><br/>The plot itself is a rollicking affair in which the 140 minute run time does not feel long at all at any point throughout the film. The performances are excellent on Mars, on Earth and in Interstellar space. This truly is a case which showcases why Ridley Scott is known as a great sci-fi director. It does harp back to his directorial performances of Blade Runner and Alien, but you wouldn't want to compare this to those, however, it's not a million miles away.<br/><br/>The Martian gets an A and a well done sticker for Sir Ridley.<br/><br/>Check out our other reviews at http://thefilmlawyers.wordpress.com"
"yanti1997","9","2","6","13 October 2015"," Surprise, surprise from Matt Damon
","""Bring him home"" is the tag line of this film because Mark Watney was left on Mars when an unexpected storm happened and he failed to evacuate with the crew. Surprisingly, the one- man show of Matt Damon isn't any boring and right here he showed us that he's not just Jason Bourne but also Mark Watney. From curing his own injury to as he said, solving problem and problem to ensure survival, he had definitely science the sh*t out of Mars. Interestingly, the ending of this Mars film has actually made a touching point where the whole world cheers to celebrate his come back. This is a must-watch because it's not like ordinary space film. With NASA fully support the film from beginning till the end, it can be said it depicts true and realistic view of how a human actually survived in Mars."
"graupepillard","7","2","6","13 October 2015"," Bring our Boy Home
","I am fascinated by films that show how people survive in impossible situations. THE MARTIAN is an old- fashioned ""feel good"" movie directed by Ridley Scott who knows how to make blockbusters and hold your attention - though here he goes ""off course"" from his usual dystopian science fiction-y horror movies like his breakthrough thriller ""Alien.""<br/><br/>THE MARTIAN is basically about Mark Watney, (a breeze-through performance by Matt Damon,) as an affable brilliant, but down-to-earth botanist/scientist on a manned flight mission to Mars who is left stranded on the ""red planet"", after a fierce storm untethers him from the rest of the crew. Dramatic footage of sand and flying debris slamming the spaceship upending its stability, forces Jessica Chastain (performing in a minor role as Melissa Lewis, the flight Commander) to make the agonizing decision to abandon their fellow crew member - assuming he was killed by some space junk that pierced his body - to continue their NASA mission.<br/><br/>The quiet after the storm shows us a steadfast Matt Damon awakening to his dire predicament, and the knowledge that death is almost a certainty, but never panics; rather he is optimistic, immediately going into survivalist mode - step by step using all that science and life experience has taught him in order to figure out how to live on a planet without water or food. One advantage is the artificial space vehicle/living habitat, or Hab which is still intact - providing oxygen and dietary supplies including his fellow astronauts' personal effects, along with a trove of ""bad"" music that becomes a continuing joke in the film. The lighthearted likability of Matt Damon, who relates his daily chores and mundane skirmishes with the airless ""elements"" via a video diary - a technique that keeps the film buoyantly hopeful; psychological depression never sets in - so we know that Hollywood has cast a rosy net of oblivion around THE MARTIAN. And by doing so, it feeds directly into the hearts of Rocky Balboa, and sports viewing fans - we love to see America's can-do spirit triumph.<br/><br/>This is intrinsically a story about man's ability to endure in the face of terrible odds - which makes for great theater, and we in the audience cheer him on. Who cannot get caught up in this existential dilemma and not feel the intensity of Mark Watney's battle to exist? He is not alone - eventually there are others who join the fight to aid him in his heroic efforts to stay alive in an ""alien"" atmosphere; everyone realizing that there is a looming deadline when necessities will be depleted. Lots of actors contribute to the ensuing drama and add to the film's tension, which involves the diminished ""window of opportunity"" - to bring Astronaut Watney home while he is still alive, as the months glide by. <br/><br/>The supporting actors were chosen to exemplify a ""type"" in the movie: Jeffrey Daniels as NASA's Director, caught in the vise of the political ramifications of his decisions; Michael Pena, a fellow space traveler who is the jesting buddy; Chiwetel Ejiofor, an assistant at NASA who is a catalyst for getting things done; and a surprisingly wonderful scene-stealing performance by Donald Glover as a young ""idiosyncratic"" Jet Propulsion Lab scientist whose mathematical computations lead to innovative approaches in the rescue attempt to bring Watney home. Being a bit of a wonk, even though I don't understand the mathematics and physics involved in the computations, I am thrilled seeing numbers and formulas no longer sitting abstractly on notebook papers, but put to use to change the world we live in- another example of what a group's inventiveness and a resilient outlook can accomplish."
"BillSims28","9","2","6","13 October 2015"," Five Word Review: Hilarious, Emotionally Fulfilling, Thoroughly Entertaining
","Based on Andy Weir's best-selling 2011 book, Ridley Scott's newest film stars Matt Damon at the head of an all-star cast featuring the likes of Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty,) Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years A Slave,) Jeff Daniels (The Newsroom,) and Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids.) The premise concerns astronaut Mark Watney, who is accidentally stranded on Mars after the rest of his crew believes him dead during a storm.<br/><br/>Having been rather disappointed with the latest offerings of Alien/Gladiator director Scott, after the stodgy misfires that were The Counsellor (2013) and Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014,) I was suspicious going into The Martian, which had been eliciting rave review from various critics prior to my viewing it. And the result was highly enjoyable. Where The Martian succeeds is, despite its 141 minute runtime, keeping the audience comprehensively entertained over the whole period, whether through the razor-sharp, unexpectedly hilarious script (credit where credit is due to Weir's book, which I'm definitely going to read) or the marvellous special effects and Mars scenery, or the real-feeling human emotion of the piece. The latter is mainly down to Damon's spectacular performance (easily his best since Invictus, 2009, maybe even his best since Good Will Hunting, 1997) as the astronaut in the worst position imaginable, desperately maintaining a positive attitude despite all the odds being against him. Damon expertly conveys Watney's emotional range, from his positive, sardonic usual self to the terror that inevitably crops up, but with the astronaut's determination not to let it get to him; not to give up.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is fantastic, especially Chastain as she portrays Watney's commander, guilt-stricken that she left him behind, and Jeff Daniels, once again displaying how adept he is at both drama and comedy, as he plays the man who has make the tough calls and take all the flak for it. The visual effects are, as previously mentioned, flawless, with the Mars environment seeming real, the bleak loneliness showing amongst the landscape's harsh but astounding beauty. The soundtrack is similarly great; the cheesy disco themes all Watney has to survive on and proving an apt metaphor for staying positive in his dire situation (I won't be getting David Bowie's 'Starman' out of my head for a while.) One of the best things about this film is the humour. Damon has his afore-mentioned ability to switch between pathos and note-perfect delivery of hilarious one-liners (I hope to see more Matt Damon in comedy,) while Ejiofor, Wiig and Sean Bean, as another NASA employee, all have their moments to shine - watch out for Bean's involvement in a Lord of the Rings reference. Donald Glover is a wonderful surprise in a role which allows him to do his best Troy- Barnes-As-Abed impression and getting some good laughs, while Kate Mara, Michael Peña and Benedict Wong also deserve recognition among the massive cast. <br/><br/>The Martian isn't perfect; while they're all huge fun to watch, the characters do suffer from a lack of character development - Damon's funny yet emotional performance can be lauded but it remains rather unrealistic for his character to stay so infectiously positive (most of the time) in his situation, and none of the other characters, perhaps due to the huge amount of supporting characters, have much chance to be developed. But The Martian is a triumph nonetheless. I expected a stodgy, boringly dramatic story of one man's survival, like a less intense Gravity on Mars, but what I got was a top-notch sci-fi dramedy with wit, heart and thrills. That'll teach me not to read the book. This is for me the second-best film of 2015 so far, after Inside Out. 90/100"
"mgriot","8","2","6","13 October 2015"," An ode to problem solving
","The film is visually stunning, it feels very real (although there are a few inaccuracies on the Mars side) which goes well with the tone of the story. <br/><br/>On the story, the film focuses completely on the problems the lost astronaut faces and the thinking progress to try to solve them. I was very drawn to this aspects, I thought it was fascinating and engaging, but I love technology. It so much focuses on this, that the movie immediately goes to the astronaut being left behind on Mars, and only adds a little suspend and ""action"" in the latest scene. <br/><br/>This means that the human relationships aspects are very lightly explored, and although the other astronauts and people on Earth ""say"" they care for the astronaut on Mars, there aren't enough scenes showing this bond or human connection for one to feel this and get invested in their relationships. And the movie suffers for it, I can completely understand how people not too interested in the technology, engineering and problem solving, and more interested in the human relationships would find this movie bland and possibly even boring.<br/><br/>But not me, I was so drawn to the issues and engineering, and positive attitude in the light of such daring circumstances that I did not mind much the lack of human connection, although I did notice it."
"uwalvin","9","2","6","13 October 2015"," Hard Science Survival transitions awkwardly to close out the story
","The first third of the movie will please survival fans. The second third will please those looking to draw real world parallels to space exploration. The final third is rushed to finish the narrative and will please no one.<br/><br/>This film is realistic science fiction and details how the top echelons of human intellect would treat a crisis in real life. There is no villain, no one is incompetent and no one has insurmountable character flaws used to drive the conflict. Interestingly, this may run the opposite to at least half of Pixar's 22 rules on how to tell a story. This does mean, to the dismay of many, there is no exploration of mental health nor are there any emotional issues used as plot devices (not to say this film is devoid of emotion). Perhaps the addition of an at home family, similar to Apollo 13, would have sufficed, but it would have been unfaithful to the source material.<br/><br/>But the impenetrable psyche of Walberg's character is realistic; astronauts are screened heavily and must pass the most rigorous psychological tests. In 2013, only 6 were selected of 6000 applicants, and it may take 10 years before they make it into space. To apply to be an astronaut is already unfathomable. This film is far removed from the misfits of 1998's Armageddon or the stranded pedestrian of Cast Away.<br/><br/>Still, the final acts of the movie rush and skim over conflict to wrap up the already long running time. Political negotiations are omitted, likely to encourage co-operation and inspire a future generation. Depressing and challenging turmoil is skipped in the protagonist's penultimate trip, likely because the audience has long since been exhausted.<br/><br/>Despite all this, I recommend this film as one geek to another. If you want to see experts at their craft thrive, receive support from competent peers, and not suffer through conflict based on egos or emotion, this is the film for you. If this sounds terrible and unbelievable that there is no focus on the human psyche, then avoid. This is perhaps why many critics find the film hollow, yet others herald the rigorous science."
"bakchu","9","2","6","12 October 2015"," Gripping near-future SF
","This is a film that quite closely follows the book upon which it's based. Andy Weir's novel is a pretty straightforward thing: It tells an exciting, gripping story in plain prose, characterized by short sentences and an uncomplicated structure - the fanciest thing about it is the interweaving of chapters containing the stranded astronaut's logs and ""meanwhile on Earth"" chapters. The story progresses at a steady pace and the scientific background isn't bogging it down. Well, Ridley Scott's film does the same thing. The visuals are also nicely done, with convincing Mars landscapes and technology. It's a rather ""realistic"" kind of science fiction adventure, doing fine without too esoteric technology or visions (no aliens here, no wormholes, faster-than-light-travel or the like, and it's set not very far in the future). In fact, I *like* SF with aliens (including Scott's ""Alien"", of course!), but it's a refreshingly different approach. I saw the 3D version which uses 3D in a rather low-key manner and doesn't try to overwhelm you. So, it's enhancing immersion without being as obtrusive and dizzying as many other 3D movies."

Martian is a TOP 10 Lifehack for staying on the distant planet and Gravity is an endless twist of troubles happening almost at the same time. But all that doesn't mean, that Martian or Gravity is better than the other - they are both great, but completely different. Speaking of actors I liked Matt and Daniels, and the guy, who invented the way to get from Earth orbit to Mars one and back. Others are OK, but not as good as that three named above. And of course, it's always exciting to hear experts about the movie - if the things described in Martian are real or not. The Earthlings are on the verge of taking next step into the Universe and that space-movies are really cool for heating up public's interest for Space Agencies actions across the globe."

He did not presume on some outside agency to do it for him, but went with the flow and paid attention to realities. Matt Damon's character did that as did Sandra Bullock's in Gravity. The people in Interstellar were more ""what if"" and changed the outcome by changing the input. Listen to those voices in your head and do the math and get to work. Pay attention to what is, avoid wishful thinking, be in the moment. Who said it, ""Solve one problem at a time. Then move on to the next""?

"ifranco-97117","9","2","6","8 October 2015"," The Martian Review
","The Martian Review<br/><br/>The Martian film has become one of the best sci fi movies since Gravity. It is by far one of Ridley Scotts best-directed movie since The Gladiator. It has captured the minds of many people of what the future of space travel may look like in a few decades. The movie quickly starts with Astronaut Mark Watney, who plays by (Matt Damon), which is presumed dead and left behind by the crew-members in Mars. However, Mark survives the storm that hit him and his team; yet he is discovering that he is stranded and alone on the solitary planet. He has limited supplies on food and water, so he must use his ingenuity will and spirit to survive to contact earth. Meanwhile in NASA, expert engineers, physicists, and Mark's crew, are working tirelessly to bring Mark back to earth safely. As the story unfolds, the world comes together to root for Watneys' safe return; while the crew volunteers to bring him back home on a suicidal mission that could cost everyone's lives. The ending of the film is nerve-racking, and it will leave you at the end of your seat. Overall it is a magnificent sci fi adventure that will leave you speechless. <br/><br/>The film was never flat at any point. It had tension and humor in different parts of the movie. You connected with the main character, Mark Watney, and the struggle he had mentally and physically. The visual effects are stunning, because you can see that while Watneys crew is in space. Since it is not your blockbuster action film; you feel the action tension, along with the adrenaline, while you are watching the film. The script from this movie was outstanding and magnificent, because it delivers emotion in so many different ways, that it makes you feel really bad for Mark. Drew Goddard did a great job on developing a script that was intellectual and funny at the same time, because he incorporated a lot of scientific facts into his script that made it seem more realistic. For example, every time an actor needed to do a calculation of some sort, it showed the brilliance of Drew Goddard. The cinematography is well presented in the film. It reflects on it when you see Mark walking and driving around the planet in his rover. You take the journey with him around the planet and it seems like you are next to him on the challenges he faces. Matt Damon did a wonderful job carrying a film like this one. He gave humor, drama, suspense, and more. I would say that this film is the best film he has ever made; even better than Good Will Hunting and Saving Private Ryan. <br/><br/>Since Oscar season is right around the corner, we will see The Martian to have several nominations when the time arrives and will have at least four nominees in the next Oscars. The first nomination will be for best Director, Ridley Scott did a fantastic job creating this sci fi movie that took use to another world. The second nomination would be for best visual effect; the stunning framework from space and mars are just speechless. The third nomination would be for best picture, because it is a great film from start to finish, and will be surprised if it is not nominated. Lastly, the fourth nomination would be for best actor, Matt Damon should be nominated because of is great performance and being able to carry a film. Time will only tell if the academy awards give the Oscars to The Martian."
"ashwindyre","9","2","6","8 October 2015"," An excellent movie with fun thrills, exciting moments, and humor to keep the audience interested
","Directed by Ridley Scott, The Martian takes place in the year 2030 on the planet Mars. The United States launches a manned mission to Mars to collect information about the planet. After a unexpected storm, the team leaves astronaut Mark Watney behind as they believe he is dead. However, NASA soon finds out that Watney miraculously survived and is living on the supplies leftover from the aborted mission. With increasing pressure from the public to bring ""the martian"" home, NASA initiates an ambitious search and rescue mission to bring Watney safely back. Alongside NASA's efforts, Mark's fellow astronauts plan a near impossible mission to get their crew mate back. As the story unfolds, the world watches carefully to see whether or not Mark Watney will make it back alive. <br/><br/>Mark Watney and his crew mates are millions of miles away from home when disaster strikes. Watney is all alone after a disastrous storm takes hold. As the stranded astronaut begins to ration his food, he looks for other ways to survive. Being a botanist, Watney grows his own food and lives in solitude for years waiting for help. As the days go on, Watney faces immense challenges threatening his very survival. Plans for a rescue mission finally begin to take shape when NASA teams up with international organizations for help. With the combined efforts of NASA and his crew mates, an ambitious rescue plan successfully brings him home. Throughout the film, the plot is clear and concise. There is no confusion as to what is happening at any part of the movie. The bits of humor added into the dialogue kept the audience attentive throughout the film. Each character has their own distinct personalities which remain consistent throughout the movie. Melissa Lewis, the captain of the space exploration, remained determined the entire time to bring Watney back. Mark Watney remained fixated on surviving throughout the film. All the characters in The Martian remained the same from start to finish. Being a space enthusiast, it was also very interesting to see the hypothetical situation in The Martian unfold. As I watched the movie unfold however, I found the movie to be quite predicable in its outcome. It was never dull or dragged out, but I wish the producers included a turn of events that threw the audience off guard. It was always a question of ""when will it happen"" and never ""what will happen."" Nonetheless, I found the story line to be captivating, holding my interest for the full 2 hours. <br/><br/>The acting throughout the movie was excellent. Matt Damon portrayed Mark Watney beautifully. Damon is an established actor who has played in many movies such as the Bourne series, Good Will Hunting, and even Saving Private Ryan. Matt Damon has also played other space movies such as interstellar and Elysium, but acts particularly well on the set for The Martian. Matt Damon accurately portrays Watney through a story filled with fluctuating emotions. Supporting actors and actresses such as Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, and Jeff Daniels also portray their characters equally well. The Mars exploration team had to wear space suits which I found were very detailed, adding to the realism of the movie. Ridley Scott, the director of The Martian, films the landscape in Wadi Rum, South Jordan. Mars has a red landscape, composed of rocky and mountainous regions. I found Wadi Rum to depict the landscape on Mars very accurately. I found this setting to be very persuasive, leading the audience to believe that Mark Watney really was all alone on a planet millions of miles away. <br/><br/>The cinematography in The Martian was mesmerizing, going well beyond the expectations I had prior to the movie. As the audience watched Watney struggle through life on the deserted land, the movie's sharp and distinct cinematography brought out Mark's dark and unpleasant situation. Through each fighting moment, the camera's portray Watney's will to stay alive. The visual effects are incredible, bringing the audience into a world of the unknown. I also really enjoyed the appropriate music for each and every scene. The orchestra was a delight to listen to, keeping the audience entertained throughout.

","Took a flyer on this movie because I hadn't really heard the hype and had only seen one trailer, but I thought it looked good so I bought a ticket and went in.<br/><br/>Long story short, it WAS good. <br/><br/>Visuals were STUNNING with the exception of one scene where Mark Watney is being rescued, but Mars looks 100% real and is very believable. The visuals were on par if not better than Ridley's other film, Prometheus, which I thought was also a great movie. Ridley Scott knows how space needs to look, or at least how it should look on a movie screen. I will be shocked if this doesn't win some kind of design awards. <br/><br/>Lead acting was excellent by Matt Damon (as per usual), the crew was fair to midland with Michael Pena being the highlight, Jeff Daniels was a little too wooden (complete opposite of Dumb and Dumber haha), Chiwetel Ejiofor was fantastic in his role, and the rest of the cast got the job done. <br/><br/>The only laughable part of this movie is that the Chinese would actually try to help one of our stranded astronauts...That's how you know this is fiction. Either way, I enjoyed this quite a bit more than Interstellar, thought it was a bit better than Gravity, and is in a class of its own as far as Mars films go! <br/><br/>The movie has a light tone overall full of humor, but there are definitely some tense moments that will have you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>This was actually worth seeing in the theater for the visuals, highly recommend it."
"DanOffley","7","2","6","7 October 2015"," Not the Most Impressive Space Film, But Good Anyway
","I was very excited to see this movie once I heard Matt Damon was starring and Ridley Scott was directing, both men who have more than earned my respect with their work. After seeing the trailer I was hyped to witness a man's isolation on an alien planet and the bureaucratic battle on Earth to bring him home. I did not read the book the film was based on so I did not know what to expect. While I feel that this was a good, I also believe there was missed opportunity that had me leaving the theater let down. <br/><br/>The plot felt more centered on the attempt to bring astronaut Mark Watney (Damon) home than it was about Watney's survival itself. I thought there was great potential to dive into the psychological effect of being stranded on a desert planet for nearly two years and Watney's battle to maintain his sanity and his mission to get home. There seemed to be less focus on the man and more on the mission itself and how NASA figured out how to bring him home. This lack of connection to the main character made me feel little investment in his journey that by the time of his eventual rescue I felt almost nothing. While I was routing for Watney to make it off Mars throughout the film, there wasn't much about him I cared about so I only wanted a happy ending for the sake of a happy ending. Likewise, I was not affected much by Watney's crew tearful reaction when learning of his survival or their heroic choice to go back and rescue him. The film overall took little care of the characters with its over focus on plot that whenever anyone made any sort of decision involving the mission, I felt very little for anyone's ""moral dilemma."" <br/><br/>Speaking of the ending, while Commander Lewis' (Jessica Chastain) ""terrible taste in disco music"" made for some good laughs, hearing a cheesy everything worked out in the end song made the ending feel very cookie cutter and disappointing. The film could have ended with Watney's rescue and have been fine but with a montage of what happened to the crew of the ship and NASA workers left an overly sweet taste in my mouth that made for a typical Hollywood ending instead of something special in its own way. <br/><br/>While the film itself is well directed, edited and acted; it was the script and the story that held this film back to from reaching its full potential. Overall, I did enjoy the film but had much higher hopes for it that it did not deliver on. While this film may not create the legacy like other space survival films like Apollo 13 or Gravity, it was still a decent film to watch."
"nemenemenes","Null","13","81","2 October 2015"," Almost everything is wrong about The Martian
","CONTAINS SPOILERS - Actually, does not, because the trailer is enough to know all about the movie.<br/><br/>I will start with mentioning the last two movies I saw on big screen and my ratings for them so that you can have a better judgment of my review. Interstellar 10/10, Mad Max: Fury Road 9/10.<br/><br/>I say the following about a movie very rarely as I am very picky for the movies I see in the theater, but I just wish I didn't go to the theater to see this movie. I will list the reasons below:<br/><br/><ul><li>The trailer is the movie. If you saw the trailer, then you saw the movie. No surprise moments, no curiosity, no ""what will happen next?"" feeling. Except for very few (two or three) scenes that I liked, the whole movie did not show anything new to me.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It's boring. The first 10 minutes or so gave a pretty bad impression about the movie and I hoped it would just get better. It didn't happen. At the end of the first half, I stayed only hoping for seeing something interesting in the second part, stayed till the end hoping the same thing. I was glad when it ended.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It doesn't feel like Mars. I don't know how Mars feels, but my point is it feels like a random desert with some harsh environment that could be as well on this planet. Yes they had astronaut suits to survive but it really didn't give me the feeling that he was on another planet. In Riddick, for example, even though he did not have to wear special suit for surviving, the feeling of being on another planet was strong (ignoring the creatures of course).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Visuals, sci-fi factor I know most of Mars surface is not interesting, mostly dull rocky areas, deserts etc. but the majority of the movie passes at the same spot and the journey he makes towards the end kind of happens in very similar areas so my eyes were not satisfied with the visuals this movie had to offer. I didn't see any scenes that I would consider amazing or that I didn't see a similar before.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It is not a survival story. It's more like a random guy is having a fun time in his own way at a deserted location. Also, since you saw the trailer, there is no ""wondering"" or ""if"" moments at any time. You know what will happen and it happens.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No attachment to characters. I didn't feel anything for Mark. Or any of the other crew members. Except for being astronauts on a Mars mission, I don't know who they are and I don't know why I should care about one unknowingly being left behind. That aerodynamics guy, he was neither funny nor cool, just a disturbing character in my opinion. Sean Ben, no idea why he was emotional and usually against the decisions of the director. Overall, I didn't feel anything for any of the characters.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No soul of the movie, no emotions. You can get the feeling of a movie's soul within the first couple of minutes. What I got from this movie is nothing. I didn't feel I was immersed into the story and characters, I didn't keep wondering what comes next, I didn't wish it not to end. Except for a couple of kind of ""forced"" emotional moments of Mark, the movie did not have emotions.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No strong reason for why they are doing what they are doing. One crew member is unknowingly left behind after strong belief he was dead, but then he appears to be alive and all of a sudden everyone is mobilized to bring him back. No sane commander/mission director would risk 5 men's life for a very low chance of saving another. And the movie does not give a reason (let alone a strong reason) for that either. Mark is just a random guy, who is having a fun time in an environment he seems to be enjoying and no reason is given in the movie to feel strong about him or rescuing him. It would have been more interesting if he had some strong bonds with some crew members or with some people he left behind and that he was knowingly left behind after some grudge or fight among the crew and then him trying to survive like a true survival and finally coming back to confront the crew.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Music... It felt like some nice but random soundtrack pieces were stitched together but the result is that you will not remember what The Martian's music/soundtrack was like once you leave the theater. If you saw it already, you will know what I mean.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Only thing good The only thing good about the movie was its concept: One man is left behind on Mars and he is trying hard to survive to come back. The movie portrays that concept very poorly.</li></ul><br/><br/>In summary, I wish I didn't go to the theater to see this movie."

Wattney survives, but now with no connection to Earth, he must rebuild on his own for his own survival and find a way to connect back to home.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays a very excellent character of Mark Wattney who is surprisingly optimistic and full of charm and humor even though he is aware of the fact that all the odds are against him when it comes to his survival, but through his own wits and scientific knowledge, he will overcome the spectacular odds through the power of science and botany<br/><br/>Matt Damon constantly drops line after line of charisma, witty dialoge and an infectiously likeable personality that you will root for him throughout the entire run time of the movie as he solves problem after problem, always maintaining his humor and optimism throughout<br/><br/>The special effects in this movie are a sight to behold aswell with some incredible outdoor scenes of Mars which is replicated beautifully with some outstanding CGI. It really captures the emptiness of the planet which further adds to his pure isolation.<br/><br/>It's a more than great adaptation of the novel and is full of scientific brilliance aswell as a great performance from Matt Damon aswell as Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain and Chiwetel Ejiofor. It's a great sci-fi experience. It will not dissapoint"
"yusufpiskin","9","1","2","17 November 2019"," The Martian
","I absolutely love space. Between the unknown, the grand scale, and the unlimited possibilities; space is something I find fascinating. As a kid there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to become an astronaut when I grew up. As I got older I knew that it wouldn't be a possibility. It's no surprise that space films are my favorite types of films. Science Fiction is my favorite genre and when the sci-fi movie takes place in space, oh man I'm like a kid in a candy store while watching a science fiction space film. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, Gravity, Alien, Aliens, Moon, and Interstellar are all films that I consider to be some of my all-time favorites. After seeing The Martian its not too far off from those other films. This is great, but not quite on the same level as the space films I mentioned above.<br/><br/>As of late, Ridley Scott hasn't exactly been top notch. I did like Prometheus, but many did not. I hated The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings was incredibly boring. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little worried about The Martian despite its fantastic cast and great subject material (I read the book).<br/><br/>The Martian has restored my faith in Ridley Scott's ability as a director. In all honestly, I think Ridley deserves an Oscar Nomination for best director. The direction in this movie is nothing short of outstanding. This movie looks absolutely fantastic. Mars looked incredible. Space looked incredible. Everything looked incredible! From a technical standpoint, this is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Like Ridley Scott, Matt Damon gives his best work in years. A great comeback film for both of these guys. All the performances are great. I was most surprised by Kristen Wiig. I don't think I've ever seen her in a non-comedy role and to my surprise she ended up being pretty great here.<br/><br/>My one problem with the movie is that it drags on in some parts. Also, the book is better. Which isn't a knock or an issue I had with the movie. I'm just saying that I preferred the book over the movie."

","In this movie Matt Damon goes to be alone of new Robinson Crusoe: after an accident during a mission, he remains on Mars and their colleagues think he's dead. Instead, he has to try to live on Mars and to invent solutions to survive using what he finds. Fortunately he's a botanic scientist and manages to create crops and to eat potatoes.<br/><br/>This interesting idea open to a reflection on techniques: human being is configured as the technological being, and it's work is creation of artificial stuff. The fact that Mars is inhospitable, makes this process a sort of foundation, a sort of creation of a new civilization that is born from human faith on technological world.<br/><br/>This interesting reflection on relation between man, techniques and nature (but with a too clear positivism), however, is not developed with the deepening that I would love to see: beyond a lot of infodumps, there's a no-problematized condition of man in a terrible desert. He's activity is not quite put in dialogue with fear of death and desperation and the final is too easy.

The solid performances of the cast present us with a tangible story, especially Matt's acting ability that never fails to give us some scenes hard to forget.<br/><br/>An entertaining movie that manages to consume his time quickly without us thinking about it, even though it is not totally a master touch. The movie doesn't have a lot of tense scenes, well, it does, but it seems to be more like a situation where we already know what will happen, so the tension is quickly removed. The structure of the film is also somewhat fast, moving completely, and features a large cast of actors who act wonderfully, but don't have as much time on screen as we would like. Still, The Martian is a wonderful space adventure movie worth watching."
"kuarinofu","9","1","2","17 August 2019"," One more reason not to give up on humankind
","I first saw The Martian in 2015 in a movie theater and I remember enjoying it.
After giving it a re-watch 4 years later I can say I enjoyed it even more.
The best part about this film for me is its emotional package. I love it when a film shares its emotions with you through good screenplay and acting. And The Martian does a great job at this.
The film also deliveres a very hopeful message. There is still good in humankind and as Sean Bean said it in the film - a single life is worth it.
It feels great to see people dealing with the situation through science one problem at a time (as Damon's character put it in the end of the film). Human intelligence and cooperation can work miracles, and as I've said, even one human life is worth all the trouble.
The characters were also great, them being more human (all the humour and interactions) but still logical and thoughtful helped the story.
It is also great that they have made it technical enough to be believable.
Some of the comedy timings and mentions made me burst into laughter (especially the Project Elrond announcement with Sean Bean in one scene).
And while I do think that making this a little darker would've made it better, I still think that The Martian is one of the best movies about human spirit, survival and problem solving.<br/><br/>P.S. It was interesting to see how some of the ideas and vistas of The Martian made it into other Ridley Scott's projects like Alien Covenant."

"gooteeiii-69016","10","1","2","1 August 2019"," Light hearted spacey fun, minus the aliens and a dash of drama
","The film The Martian was adapted from the novel of the same name by Andy Weir. This film is placed at some point in the near future where humans have successfully landed on Mars. We join the film midway through the third manned mission to Mars. The crew is going about their tasks, you are given the feeling that they are excited yet settled into a normal routine of daily tasks. What we see of these tasks is short-lived however because a storm is moving in and the crew must act fast to escape. In the following frantic minutes, the crew attempts to salvage their work before take-off, however, as they move through the storm one of the crew is struck by debris and is lost in the dust of the storm. Without the time to search and the astronaut's life signs failing to report the crew launches in their vehicle to head home.<br/><br/>The theme throughout this movie is hope through cooperation, we begin to see this theme shortly after the crew escapes, as this is where the movie truly begins. We learn that our main character, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) did survive the storm, but now alone on Mars he must survive again with limited resources and knowing that it will be at least 4 years before help arrives. While we feel for the character initially being abandoned on a planet, it isn't long before NASA discovers that he is alive and work begins to save him.
This film overall is one of my favorites, I have watched it at least 5 times over the years and read the book multiple times as well. Matt Damon's portrayal of Mark Watney is a perfect fit, his mix of humor and emotion as he goes through his ordeal is captivating. All the actors/actresses in this film really were superb, it is one of those movies where you can tell that everything and everyone just clicked together to create something special.<br/><br/>There was a large cast behind this film but some of the highlights were Jeff Daniels as NASA Director Teddy Sanders, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor Director of Mars Missions, and Kristin Wiig who I am generally not a fan of for all her comedy movies but was great as NASA's Media Relations Director Annie Montrose. We follow these characters as they initially deal with the loss of Mark Watney and then work to save him once he is determined to be alive. The set design and sound are amazing, while Mars appears clearer then what we generally see in photos from our rovers I completely by what I see and hear. The technology in the movie seems futuristic yet attainable, nothing appears to be so advanced as to be not a reality within the next 20 years.
The music choice while not a personal favorite fits well into the movie and is used in multiple ways, as a running joke about bad taste in music, as a source of positivity and laughter to see Mark Watney listen and comment on the songs despite his situation, and as a source of hopefulness as we see people of different ethnicities, countries, and political influences put their difference aside to work toward the goal of saving one human. I will admit that I am a sucker for that last bit, this part of the movie and the beginning of Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets both have scenes of selfless cooperation that really touches me.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of space movies minus the aliens and love disco music then this movie is for you, if you love Matt Damon then this movie is for you if you love underdog movies where people work together to overcome then this movie is for you."

When we work together, or even when we're alone and determined - ""where there's a will there's a way"" - and we can accomplish anything, even the impossible.

"ilikeweirdstuffs","10","1","2","9 April 2019"," 11/10 unironically and wholeheartedly
","I could not name a single thing that could be improved in this movie without sacrificing some of its realism and unique feeling.<br/><br/>It is not typical hollywood, the ""countdown stops at 0:01"" feeling is missing from the movie. Which is apparently what a lot of people miss, because scifi is aliens and lasers and action.
But this is how things actually usually are and it gives the actions of the characters and challenges faced by them paradoxically *more* weight through this.
This is an extremely brave decision that on its own sets this movie into a class of its own.<br/><br/>It is deceptivey light. It is a positive, realistic, and respectful portrayal of the future, instead of a romp through some adventure, while at the same time being relevant in the present and ebracing the past.<br/><br/>It manages to appeal to the human desire for exploration and togetherness without being emotionally manipulative. Kindof how a planet loved and cheered for the mars exploration rovers as if they were actual beings of their own. Because the capacity and desire of humans for connection and discovery is limitless. This movie speaks perfectly to that part in all of us.<br/><br/>It is also a veritable nerd's delight without ever being embarrassing and feeling ""wink wink, nudge nudge""-y.<br/><br/>The acting was so on point that it retroactively erased all of Matt Damons other roles from memory, and all future performances will be measured to this one.<br/><br/>The characters were real. Not action/sci fi heroes, but regular nerds and people.<br/><br/>This movie also adds something to the real world by it existing. It portrays exploration realistically, but still in a positive light, appealing to the human craving for it, and maybe reawakening that. At the same time it teaches that difficulties are not overcome as al movies would have you believe, by just a couple of people trying really hard for a couple of hours and fighting it out possibly. Difficulties are overcome by enduring through difficult times, taking advice from other people, and keeping hope. Physical fortitude, book smarts, coolness and on your feet thinking, friends you can rely on, emotional strength, and burning passion, desire and trying hard are all things that work together to get one through the night. Alone they are not enough, but some can be missing from people at times.
But we as humans overcome the difficulties. Because in the end it is worth it. For the future of us individually and all of us collectively.<br/><br/>No other movie does as good a job as this one of conveying this.
All while i fail to find anything that when changed could make this movie better.
And while it is appealing in all its details, characters, designs, references, robots, music and action.<br/><br/>Truly in a class of its own, and compared to others definitely up at the top with the best of them."

","The Martian directed by Ridley Scott is a Sci-Fi film following a rescue mission to Mars after one man is stranded on the planet... and this movie is GREAT. Within cinema one thing is for sure, when Ridley makes a great film it's monumental. The Martian is one of my all time favourites. The shots and cinematography on Mars are truly out of this world... The editing, score and integration of CGI is outstanding. This film is put together beautifully. Although The Martian isn't just exceptional on the technical side, it's also insanely entertaining. And that is thanks to the excellent script and line delivery by Matt Damon. This is his best performance in years. He's everything from witty to emotionally fragile, which forms such a complex and compelling character. The Martian has a perfect balance of distress and great humour. I love the integration of music by David Bowie and ABBA. It really helps lift up the spirit. The large cast doesn't weigh down the film at all, as they all add something more to the story. I can honestly watch The Martian countless times and never get bored. This is an outstanding film so therefore I give it a 10."

","I, for one, am excited that space travel is now a topic regularly covered on the big screen. If the general public becomes even a little bit more interested in interplanetary travel, perhaps I can see man stand on the surface of Mars in my lifetime. The Martian (2015) is merely the latest in a string of space-themed sci-fi movies that brings the excitement of outer space to theaters. While not nearly as continually intense as Gravity (2013), or as epic as Interstellar (2014), what The Martian does right is give a sense of scale to the challenge of returning to Earth from being abandoned on Mars.<br/><br/>Gripping and just humorous enough to keep it from being dour, director Ridely Scott uses many cinematic techniques, including several montages, to tell the story many have already read from Andy Weir's novel of the same name. While many sequences and scientific explanations were obviously cut for the sake of time, the ones that remain help maintain the ebb and flow of victory and tragedy. Like many films based on books, I saw the movie first before committing to reading the book. After now having read the source material, I can say that each version has its merits, and both are equally as spectacular. Sure, there were some elements I wish were in the film, but that's why reading the book version is great too: it has ""deleted scenes.""<br/><br/>Matt Damon's portrayal of Mark Watney was spot on, and the rest of the cast certainly did a great job of filling in their respective roles. The pacing was great and the CGI looked incredible. Considering the current array of NASA equipment, the ships and shelters used for a Mars mission certainly seemed realistic in this film, which should help with my aforementioned desire for the general public to become interested in interplanetary travel.<br/><br/>A stupendous film that gives a good visual representation of Andy Weir's novel, I give The Martian 5.0 stars out of 5."

Matt Damon was a thespain who would undertake this role perfectly, resuming the battle of surviving in the mars after the accident despite loneliness. It was an extraordinary experience for him.
Ridley Scott knows how to convert the story of a book into a movie and affect the people positively. One of the most favorite genres of Ridley Scott with his perseverences.

","I have few movies which I'd be perfectly fine watching over and over again. One of them is Apollo 13 starring Tom Hanks, and I'm so glad I can add The Martian to the list, right next to Apollo 13.<br/><br/>Both the book and the movie exceeded my expectations with flying colors. In the past Matt Damon wouldn't have been my first choice for the role of Mark Watney, but I have to admit he did a brilliant job. Now I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Watney as he managed to bring through every emotion of a man who realizes he's alone on a giant red planet, and nobody knows he's there.<br/><br/>But of course the best part of the movie is the story and the book behind it. The story could've gone so many different ways, but somehow it managed to do things just right. It makes you gasp, hold your breath and - sometimes - burst into laughter when you least expect it. The brilliance lies in the humor of Watney and how he handles the situation, even when it's more or less clear he's alone and all odds are against him.<br/><br/>This here is a story of survival at it's best. Kudos."
"ioanapmaria","9","1","2","12 November 2017"," A review of a gripping film
","Released in 2015, ""The Martian"" is a movie made by Ridley Scott, being a screen adaptation after the novel written by Andy Weir. It was nominated for 7 Oscars and it also won several awards at the Golden Globe. Even if it was filmed in many locations, the most unusual one ,for me, was Wadi Rum, Jordan The star of the movie is the well-known actor, Matt Damon, who manages to portray 'Martian' as a likable person and also to fill the two hours that remain after he is stranded on Mars. Being an adventure, drama, Sci-Fi film, ""The Martian"" tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew on Mars. Surprising he has survived and finds himself stranded on the planet with only meagre supplies. Watney finds a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring him home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring rescue mission, a very risky one. All of them adventures are full of emotions and every scene in which one of them is risking his or her life makes you feel part of the movie and so becoming very gripping. For me, the biggest strength of this film is the actor who plays astronaut Mark Wathney, Matt Damon. Despite the fact that he is a gorgeous actor in general, he manages to play his role in an authentic mode, but also a little bit intriguing because of his way to act. But on the other hand, the story can be sometimes predictable and far-fetched, which is a huge weakness, from my point of view. Overall, in my not so humble opinion, I can say that ""The Martian"" is one of the most gripping films I have ever seen so far and I can recommend it to everyone who is interested in science, adventure and, why not in drama. I consider it can be seen by any category of age and occupation, but only a small part will understand the real message of the movie."
"wobblycogs","8","1","2","26 October 2017"," Generally very enjoyable
","I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this film but I found myself getting drawn in right from the opening. The landscapes are epic and the cast are likable with Mat Damon playing his role particularly well. If you've seen Apollo 13 you know the story but somehow this is better even though it's complete fiction.<br/><br/>So why did I only give it an 8/10 if I enjoyed it so much? It lost a couple of points for realism. Space / Mars is hard and will kill you in a myriad of different ways but the writers chose to use threats that wouldn't exist on Mars. The final rescue should have been kept simple, there was no need to go all gung-ho on it and it didn't fit with tone of the rest of the film."

Is it completely scientifically accurate.....who cares? <br/><br/>General moans include:<br/><br/>1.Matt Damon isn't funny. Well he seems to be doing alright for himself as an unfunny actor. I find him very entertaining and I thought his performance was good and, even if I hadn't I'd like to think I would have stopped short of lambasting him.<br/><br/>2.'It's unrealistic'...'It would never happen'...'That's not right' blah, blah, blah. As I said earlier...who care's? It's a film not a documentary. The fact that basement dwellers are up in arms because we don't actually have to sit and wait the 25 mins that it would take for any communication to get to and from is laughable. I'm glad we didn't have to 'wait it out'. <br/><br/>'He's a Botanist....what's he doing there'? Well...and I'm no expert but perhaps, given that NASA have sent a Mission to Mars...potentially with a view to 'one day colonizing said Planet' a botanist might be handy? <br/><br/>The potato's....Could it actually work? No idea, don't care...not planning on being stranded on Mars to find out. God forbid that any future mission to Mars uses this film as a training guide because there's no mention at all of 'bacteria...ph levels...lighting levels'..zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...Good! Couldn't be happier that all that mumbo jumbo was left out. <br/><br/>3. 'There's no sense of actual loneliness'.....Maybe it should have been a hour and a half of Matt Damon weeping into the cameras? Sounds fun....cut to Matt kicking the dirt in boredom....now we're talking, much more entertaining. <br/><br/>4. 'The special effects aren't up to scratch'.....yawn, next! <br/><br/>5. 'It's not a true portrayal of human nature'....It seems that because the characters were actually nice to each other and didn't spend their time insulting each other it means it's a poor film.....Here's an idea..lighten up a bit, have some fun. If you want human nature, watch the news or one of the myriad of other films that portray it very well.<br/><br/>There's so much more rubbish that has been written about this film but my stress vein is starting to throb in my forehead.... So I will simply say this: Why not watch it and see what you think? If you like it, great. If you don't well, not to worry eh?"
"Tweekums","10","1","2","14 September 2017"," Stranded on Mars
","Set in the not too distant future the Ares III mission to Mars has to abort there 31 Sol (Martian day) mission on Sol 18 when a storm hits their base and threatens to topple the rocket that will take them back to the Hermes, the craft that will take them back to Earth. As they run through the storm a piece of debris hits mission botanist Mark Watney. His colleagues try to find him but as his suit's telemetry suggests he is dead they are forced to leave without him. It soon emerges that he is not dead unfortunately he calculates that there won't be enough food left for him to survive till the next mission to Mars. Back on Earth everybody thinks he is dead until a satellite photograph shows that the Ares III site has changed so somebody must be there! Still at this point there is no way to contact him. Mark manages to grow potatoes for food and sets about retrieving a transmitter from a previous mission. With contact finally made they start discuss how he might be rescued. Time will be close and there will be setbacks.<br/><br/>Fans of 'Hard Sci-Fi' should really enjoy this; the idea of manned mission to Mars might seem many years away the technology we see doesn't seem unrealistic and the story seemed plausible so much so that the film this most reminded me of was 'Apollo 13' which was of course based on a real life near disaster in space. The opening set up is effective and wastes little time in stranding Mark on Mars then we get down to the business of him trying to figure out how to survive. He encounters many problems which are resolved logically. Similarly the events on earth appear plausible as first those in charge want to avoid a PR disaster then work to rescue him when it becomes apparent that he is alive. The cast does a fine job. Matt Damen excels as Mark Watney managing to be entertaining even when the only talking he does for much of the time is direct to camera as he records a video diary. The rest of the cast, which includes many familiar faces also impresses. The Jordanian locations used look suitably barren to act as a substitute for Mars. While things are serious for the most part there are some good laughs as well; many provided by the fact that the only music Mark has is some disco taken to Mars my the mission commander this provides an excuse for some enjoyably incongruous back ground music which I rather enjoyed. Overall I really enjoyed this and would certainly recommend it even if you don't consider yourself a sci-fi fan."

","Mark Watney is a spaceman. One day, he was working with his partners on Mars when suddenly, a storm came but his partners didn't wait for him. He was stuck on a strange planet! What can he do? Will he survive? Let's find out!<br/><br/>This movie started with an accident. A sand storm hit the Ares crew (a spaceman crew) while they were collecting samples. One of the crew members named Mark Watney was separated from his crew by the storm. The captain named Commander Lewis thought Mark was dead, so he was abandoned on Mars! <br/><br/>When he woke up, he found that he was alone on Mars. He wanted to survive, so he tried to make water and he did it! Then he used the water to grow his food - potatoes.<br/><br/>On Sol 54 (Mars Day), Mindy Park, a girl who works in NASA, found that something on Mars was moved. According to that, people knew Mark was still alive. Then people on Earth tried to save him. Through a series of search and rescue operations, they finally succeeded.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it's a good movie but it is a little boring. Though it is quite dull, I really like the sentence, ""I want to fly like Iron Man!"" Maybe if the director added more funny parts like this it would be better."
"weeklypro","4","1","2","12 August 2017"," several science mistakes in this movie
","Probably The Most Weird bit of all is the fact that Matt says that an explosion from a sort of water generator was caused by the excess OXYGEN that he breathed out: 1. You breath out co2 not oxygen 2. you would not cause an explosion by breathing a single breath of wind 3. How would like 10gs of wood chips burn for some like: 200 sols? he would need 10 kg instead of grams.<br/><br/>Duct tape does not help in taping together a hole. It just doesn't. And I don't see any seals in that. all there is is a tarp and a few straps and duct tapes strips to seal it together. Mark uses duct tape to fix his spacesuit, attach a dangerous plutonium reactor, and to seal of a giant hole in the wall of the HAB, the base of the mission. The alarming fact is that it is 100% worrying when you hear the flapping sound of the tarp, and sending a person on a rocket ship with its nose cut off and replaced with a tarp is totally nonsensical. <br/><br/>Overall, This is an okay movie but if you are one of those experts on film better not watch it. or if you are a scientist."
"asifahsankhan","8","1","2","12 July 2017"," ""In your face, Neil Armstrong!"" — The Martian.
","If it's the goal of great science fiction to boldly go where no man has gone before, Sir Ridley's ""The Martian"" might be a rare trodden turf, and typically Skeptical of science fiction movies dealing with space travel, yet. <br/><br/>While it's no ""Interstellar,"" spinning off from Andy Weir's everyone-was-reading-it-on-the-bus bestseller, as much as it is a Robinson-Crusoe-in-space, it's a jet-black comedy about laughing in the face of mortality.<br/><br/>This well-crafted film intricately embedded thought-provoking science, real controversial decisions pertaining to space, and futuristic science applications humans have yet to develop.<br/><br/>""Mission Control"" monitoring, in the movie, the large TV screens plastered in every angle accurately captured the darkness, timing and adrenaline involved in finding a solution within a 3-5 minute span before potential explosions were to cause deaths. <br/><br/>""You do the math. You solve a problem. Then you solve the next. Then you can come home."" Running a mathematical analysis for 560 Sols straight, all by and for a nozzle botanist to stay alive simply on, hey Potatoes! - it takes a skilled team to find real-time solutions.<br/><br/>There's a fictitious scene served to brilliantly re-ignite a real concern echoed in the Space community about launch safety. Rocket launches are risky, and successful rocket science is about proper certifications being met. In the movie, the NASA director orders that the return flight's thrust and weight certifications be skipped in order to save time in returning to Mars. His decision led to excessive vibrations and bending moments within the launch, which exploded the rocket into pieces mid-air. This scenario is real. That's almost bloody accurate!<br/><br/>Chaos Theory is used for more than space travel. It predicts new technology, new weather systems, and even explains how the human brain's neurons fire together in Neuro-plasticity. Though in travel, humans have never been on a spacecraft that has flown to Mars partly because the ""gravitational assist"" effects on the human body are not fully understood yet.<br/><br/>Don't forget it's been four decades since Sir Ridley Scott first made space travel so uniquely terrifying with ""Alien;"" here, he and Damon fill the film with fresh, deadpan pleasures, storm that kick- starts the narrative, what lingers are the crew's panicked faces, helmets aglow like Chinese lanterns. <br/><br/>There is not always much adrenal drama: the default mode is problem- solving. But put The Martian next to its peers and it shines. In particular, between its last-man-standing plot and the presence of both Damon and Jessica Chastain, the overlaps with Christopher Nolan's Interstellar are downright curious. And The Martian is nimble everywhere Nolan's film galumphed; it's a movie in which the greatness of the human spirit meets the wonder of gaffer tape. Furthermore, this must be a new frontier to explore, if ""The Martian"" is put in contrast to Britain's spectacular cinema landmarks: ""Moon"" to ""Gravity"" to ""Interstellar"" it'll look like a 70's disco classic remix album: While it is a great science fiction film that intricately embeds thought-provoking science applications humans have yet to develop, you'd hardly call it a Scott 'Masterpiece' stretching itself, or the boundaries of where an effects blockbuster can take us. It's less a space odyssey than this genre's equivalent of a high-climbing log flume that's also very enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>""They say that once you grow crops somewhere, you officially Colonised it. So, technically, I Colonised MARS. In your face, Neil Armstrong!"" <br/><br/>— Mark Watney a.k.a ""The Martian"" a.k.a ""the Greatest Space Pirate—Botanist"" to ever step foot on the ""RED Planet: MARS,"" <br/><br/>and COLONISE it by growing fresh—POTATOES, harvesting his own S%it!"

"alb-26920","10","1","2","3 April 2017"," Does not follow the laws of physics, but still an amazing movie/story!
","I loved this movie! <br/><br/>I understand that the whole premise of what this movie is based on is practically impossible, but that's just it...it's a story! This is not a documentary!! This is purely a story showing what one man did to survive on Mars and it is a fictional story!!<br/><br/>I loved this movie because of what he did to survive. He solved all of these problems on his own until he reestablish communication with NASA. And even after establishing communication with NASA he sometimes ignored them, he had fantastic jokes and the connection that they portrayed with his crew mates was fantastic. <br/><br/>There are some questions that I've seen people posting in the reviews like: ""... growing a potato over soil not tested fertilized with astronauts ""poo""... what about bacteria? ... why he had potatoes in a Martian station?""...<br/><br/>To answer these questions: (I believe) it's mentioned in the movie however I have read the book multiple times so I might be getting that mixed up but it is at least mentioned in the book. <br/><br/>1)He's the only freaking astronaut on the planet hence his ""poo"" bacteria has already come out of him so it's not going to get him sick. 2) he had potatoes that were not the normal way astronauts would eat food in space because they were (supposed to be) there over Thanksgiving. So NASA thought it would be a great morale booster to have them eat an actual Thanksgiving dinner (or close to it). <br/><br/>This person has three others listed, but again if you actually read the book that this movie is based off of it answer all of these questions. Just because you don't like the movie does not mean that it's bad it means it's a movie so they don't have as much time to go into detail as the book does. Do you say that Lord of the rings and the hobbit were not as good because they didn't explain some things? No, you understand it's a movie (and a long one already) and that there are going to be things left out. <br/><br/>Bottom line that I have to say about this is: I think it's a fantastic movie. There are obviously mistakes but your average person is not going to notice them because they're not gonna know that there physically impossible or that NASA doesn't run a specific way. If you're unsure after reading my and others reviews that may be similar or very different my advice is to rent it if possible or borrow it from someone. Or if you're still not sure just read the book it's better anyways!!<br/><br/>P.S. The story is set in the future therefore it implies that things have changed maybe not significantly but enough to be a change from what is currently happening now."

Daniels (Dumb & Dumber) plays Ted Sanders, the Head of NASA and Jessica Chastain (Interstellar), Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids) and Sean Bean (Goldeneye) co-star.

"zkonedog","7","1","2","26 February 2017"," ""Apollo 13"" Meets ""Interstellar""But Not Quite As Good As Either
","""The Martian"" is a solid movie. It has an interesting plot, some good character development, and (in a complete departure from most Ridley Scott films) contains a very hopeful, at times even light-hearted tone. Most people viewing this will find it a very enjoyable experience all-around.<br/><br/>Here is the problem, though: About a year ago, ""Interstellar"" was made by Christopher Nolan. It shares many similar character types and themes with ""The Martian""but manages to beat it in nearly every single area. So, I have to say that it was a little weird seeing this movie and thinking that not only it wasn't as good as ""Interstellar"", but now it is chronologically second-fiddle too.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Martian"" primarily tells the story of a member of the Aries III crew exploring Mars sometime in Earth's future. A violent windstorm picks up and astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is flung off into the eye of the storm and presumed dead, his fellow crewmates having to make a tough decision and a quick getaway. Due to some incredible luck, however, Watney is most certainly not deadjust stranded on Mars with few supplies and not enough food to last until any sort of retrieval mission can be furnished. The catch? Watney is a scientist (a botanist, to be exact), and must tap into all of his ingenuity and wits in order to survive until NASA can pick him up again.<br/><br/>Like I said, ""The Martian"" is a pretty good movie when looked at with tunnel-vision. It has all the right ingredients for a great sci-fi drama, and those ingredients do indeed gel together to form an entertaining final product. It has some high-concept themes, impressive visuals, and that sense of gravitas befitting films like ""Apollo 13"". Damon turns in a great performance, and his scenes are the highlight of the entire experience (had the movie focused on him even more exclusively, I probably would have liked it even better!).<br/><br/>There are indeed two major problems that keep this film from being a classic sci-fi adventure, though:<br/><br/>1. The casting besides Damon is very poor. Jeff Daniels is terrible as the head of NASA, as is Kristen Wiig in a similar corporate role, and Jessica Chastain's character is inexplicably under- utilized. As such, the scenes where Damon isn't front-and-center really drag the fun to a halt.<br/><br/>2. Maybe this isn't 100% fair, but it still stands that this movie can't really hold a candle to Nolan's masterful ""Interstellar"", and that turned into kind of a problem during the viewing experience. I mean, think of it this way: A film featuring Chastain, Damon, space travel, space anomalies, and all set in a very hopeful tone. Where have you seen that movie before? I know that ""The Martian"" is based on a book and thus it is difficult to scream ""plagiarism"" too loud, but having not read the book I really don't know how closely it was followed. To me, then, this sure seemed like an opportunity to capitalize on the success by using the same general themes of the previous ""Interstellar"".<br/><br/>Bottom line: Had I seen this movie a year or so ago, I may have liked it considerably more. However, once one has seen movies like ""Interstellar"" before it, it kind of feels old-hat. Not a bad movie by any means (and hence the four-star rating), but also not all that close to being one that will be remembered for years, either."

","What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said? It is great and I just watched it again for the second time. In some ways it is better than the book because it cuts out a lot of fat. In other ways, the book is better. One of my main issue with the film version is the casting and unnecessary changing of character's races. Having a white chick play Mindy Park when it should have been a Korean chick? Really? There was literally no reason why they had to do that. Plus the book version's of the character is much more interesting. And why did they have to make that one dude half black and half Indian? Why couldn't they make him full Indian and just have that one guy from Jurassic World play the role? In fact, back when I was reading the book I imaged that same actor as that character and it would have been perfect. Whatever, those two casting choices and character chances are somewhat palatable. Kristen Wiig playing the character of Annie Montrose, the media spin lady was just an awful decision. Annie Montrose isn't a goofball, she is a tough as nails hardcore b!tch and you do not want to get in her way... which is what you would except from a person in that line of work.

The biggest problem I have with this movie is that there is really no arc, since the protagonist appears to have nearly everything under control from the beginning. The terror and dread of being stranded and left for dead in space is never truly captured. The Mars settlement does not really feel cold and alien. You're never really worried about the protagonist, even during the brief time when it looks like there might be actual suspense due to is little potato farm being wiped out in an explosion.<br/><br/>Also, I have nothing against having a little ""faith in humanity"" type theme in a movie, but this film gives China way too much credit, both in their government's altruism and their ability to surpass our technology in such a way that we would need their help in the first place."

Although Moon is a good movie, it's atmosphere is desolate and sad. Therefore, if you want to compare The Martian to another movie, it's more some sort of SciFi version of Cast Away, where the situation makes the main character creative and resourcefull, and at the same time the loneliness drives him to some sort of funny insanity.<br/><br/>Some SciFi elements were not completely believable and the dialogs from the other cast was not funny at all (altough I think they hoped it would be funny) but overall still something you need to see.<br/><br/>7/10"

Maybe he wasn't the best choice for this role, but he gave what he had and I enjoyed his part, as long as I didn't think deeply about it.<br/><br/>The director should really get his head out of America's a** and learn a few things from foreign cinema/television.<br/><br/>One of the things that bothered me is the lack of average-looking people. Have you seen pictures of scientists? They do not look like that. To be certain, the director wasn't going for realism. Hollywood really needs to cast some unbeautiful people, because it detracts from the rest of the movie. Just like there is no sound transmitted through a vacuum, there should not be 99% beautiful people cast for movies... not in 2016.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me is the fact that the US spent billions retrieving this guy and it never even came up that maybe one life isn't worth billions to the government. In fact, I'm pretty sure one life is only worth $10,000 in proactive payments. Maybe a few million in reactive payments. Billions? Hardly. Not to this government.<br/><br/>I wish this movie had been directed by Hong-jin Na, TBH."

","There are a few occurrences that seem a bit too convenient eg: Mark being a botanist, and the readily available top secret Chinese rocket. <br/><br/>Also, the ""required"" complication Mark faces, in the form of an airlock malfunction, occurs just when you expect it too and Mark's lighthearted attitude seems odd for a man stranded in on Mars, as he remains jovial and cheerful throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects and cinematography are wonderful and are what make the movie so great. The scenes of Mars and the spaceship are beautiful and will enrapture any sci-fi fan. The movie is also surprisingly well paced for a movie longer than 2h as there were very few places where the movie moved slowly. The movie was very funny with some great one liners delivered by Matt Damon, though by no means a comedy ( not sure what the guys at The Golden Globes were thinking...)<br/><br/>The cast was great, but I feel the role of Venkat Kapoor should have been given to an Indian actor <br/><br/>Overall the movie was very enjoyable."

","Hello, Well this is my personnel opinion about this movie first of all over all movie was fantastic but there is a huge blunder. in this movie the astronauts are travel to the mars where no food, no water, no grass. but at the time when martian is alone at the planet and one scene when he is in his car and there is a mountain with grass showed up. so this is a huge mistake by camera man to shoot those mountains with grass.The movie is about the journey of astronauts to the mars where grass should not be there that is why martian harvest potatoes by him self for several years for survival but the set where this movie was pictured are had mountains with grass this should be a big mistake which does not show the reality of this journey to the mountain although this is setup but the director should direct properly for the perfection of each and every shot of the film."
"Tehmeh","7","1","2","28 March 2016"," It's alright. Nowhere close to great.
","""The Martian"" is a crowd-pleaser. It's a feel-good movie. It's adequately put together, and it's aesthetically pleasing most of the time. It's not a tight, gripping story at all, it's more like a 2+ hour montage. It's perfectly fine as what it is, but it's certainly nothing more than what it is.<br/><br/>There are plenty of transitions between Mars and Earth. Problems are presented, and one after another they are solved, often without tension or deeper investigation. Things just happen. Science - as opposed to what I heard about it before seeing this film - is treated like it often is in these films. You don't get to really dive into the world of scientific wonders. Science is just a plaything to further the story along. And that of course is fine, as long as you know what kind of movie you're going into. If you don't count the nice visuals, ""The Martian"" feels like a movie that could've existed in the 1980s. It's not deep, it's not highly intelligent, but it's a nice popcorn movie instead.<br/><br/>Characters are somewhat shallow. They all have roles in the story, and that's it. I never got to really ""know"" any single character well. They do have characteristics to them, but it ends there. I hoped for something more for a movie that was nominated for an Oscar. I can't tell you how that happened, because this is not an Oscar-worthy movie. It's a pretty good one, and pretty good movies shouldn't count.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is well-cast and entertaining in the lead role. He's not great, and I certainly didn't learn anything about his character, but he's entertaining. The whole cast works well enough, and Sean Bean is always a plus.<br/><br/>I'm still waiting for that last great movie from Ridley Scott. Prometheus suffered from much of the same problems than this movie does. I like them both just fine, but whenever there's a chance to really dive in to the story or to the characters, to really deepen the tension, the moment is gone almost as soon as it began.<br/><br/>But, in the end, I felt pretty good once ""The Martian"" was over. Indeed, it's a feel-good movie, and does have its moments. A few laughs here and there, sometimes even unexpected ones. I wasn't bored once, and even though the science was just a quick pawn for the story, some of it was undoubtedly cool.<br/><br/>Not a masterpiece. Not an Oscar-worthy movie. Not even close to Ridley Scott's best films. Structure and pacing is a little off. It's also not a failure, and certainly not boring. I would recommend this one for those evenings when you don't have much else to do and even if you think you don't want to pay too much attention to what's happening, because this film doesn't get stuck into the details. It's an easy watch, and these movies have their place too."

","In this Ridley Scott blockbuster epic, you see Matt Damon playing the character of Mark Watney, a Lone Ranger who has been left and stranded on Mars. As soon as I first saw the trailer of this movie, I knew I wanted to go and see it as soon as it came out, so I did! I love Ridley Scott as a director, my favourite of his is Gladiator which in my eyes is a perfect film. This film kind of reminded me of Christopher Nolans Interstellar the year before, as it was set on another planet, and it also briefly starred Matt Damon in that which is probably why it does remind me of it. I thought the whole plot of this movie was awesome. And Damon did brilliantly in the role of Mark Watney, you did actually believe he had been left on Mars. It was very interesting and entertaining to see Damon help himself in the creation of his own food, and water. The whole idea of the movie was fantastic, and Ridley Scott always makes his movies exciting no matter what. Congrats on Damon's performance as Mark Watney, he was fantastic. Definitely a film to see in cinemas, and when it comes to blu Ray and DVD. One of my favourite films of 2015!"

","Great Movie! Matt Damon does an excellent job portraying a stranded astronaut. There was a lot of realism that I liked in this movie. The movie has one basic mantra; how do I solve the next problem to stay alive. The obvious items are food and water, then the elements, motion, and communication. Meanwhile, NASA is trying to decide the worth of a single life. Save him by putting others at risk or let him fend for himself, which will mean certain death, but will minimize any loss? The drama of things going badly for Matt on Mars is pretty spectacular. At one point he nearly blows himself up, but at each point he just brushes himself off and starts with a new problem to solve in order to get home. I think it is a metaphor for life that we tend to miss. One of the lines from the movie is, ""you solve one problem then the next. If you solve enough problems, you get to come home."" I think if we took our own lives the same way, maybe more people would be better off. Solve a problem, then solve another, if you solve enough problems in your life, then you get to have the life that you want."

","This is my very first review ever on IMDb.com and the reason I wanted to write here is because, I have never been this disappointed in a movie in my life.<br/><br/>Yes I have read the book, and it kept me up many late nights. I would rate the book 9/10 in my opinion if you like this genre. The book is so large that the movie format didn't work well at all with this book. Should have been done in a maybe 5 hour miniseries instead. <br/><br/>The big problem with trying to scale down a 12-13 hour book is trying to fit in the most important parts. And they did get the important parts in the movie but, the thing is, on almost every page in the book the main character almost dies. He always has a problem to fix, and if he doesn't fix it in time he either suffocates gets dehydrated or starves to death. And when reading the book you really get a feel for how dire the situation really is on mars with the supplies he has to work with. The movie jumps so often that you don't get that feeling.<br/><br/>My conclusion is that if you have read the book stay the hell away from this movie, it will not be worth your time."
"SquigglyCrunch","5","1","2","4 March 2016"," Not Bad, Not Great Either
","The Martian is the heavily-hyped movie based on the novel by Andy Weir about a man who is presumed dead during a storm on Mars and left to survive completely alone on the planet until he can be rescued. Due to the incredibly high amount of praise this movie received and my own interest in the idea itself, I, naturally, had some expectations. Unfortunately they really weren't satisfied all that well. <br/><br/>The plot of The Martian is one that I like, but it's not one that we haven't already seen in 2015. It felt relatively similar to The Revenant, and while both movies are based off of books that I assume came out with a fair amount of time in between, I just think that maybe the timing wasn't super great. Now we've got two critically- acclaimed movies about people being left in a desolate location by their peers to survive on their own. Only The Revenant is more revenge-driven and The Martian is much more light-hearted. Anyways, The Martian's plot was, while a good idea, presented in an extremely predictable way. There was never a single moment of real, genuine tension, because it was blatantly obvious how the movie would end. It was too light-hearted to go in the way that I hoped, which was down a much darker, less fortunate path, and that's just fine. There's nothing particularly wrong with that but it just adds another layer to the already high stack of predictability in this movie. Furthermore, this movie felt like it was introducing certain conflicts for the sake of an extended run time. A lot of the problems that the characters have didn't affect the movie at all. Something happens, it gets fixed almost immediately, and then everything goes back to normal as if nothing ever happened. Maybe it's just me, but I felt like a lot of this movie's conflicts were just filler over actual plot driving- scenes. Nevertheless, I thought that it was paced relatively well, and I only started to get bored more towards the end when I realized that I knew exactly what was going to happen. <br/><br/>The characters were alright as well. None of them are developed particularly well, but then again I didn't even know who most of them were by the end of the movie. I recognized their faces, and I think that that's the important bit. But even Mark Watney himself wasn't super great. Yeah sure, he had his moments. But his character wasn't particularly original. It seemed like the majority of his team was almost an exact replica of him, only they didn't demonstrate as much anger as he did. Which I guess makes Watney a bit more realistic as a character, considering he goes deeper than just humor, but then it only goes down to humor and anger. Other characters, particularly Donald Glover's character, were blatantly built around clichés that have been so used to death that in a movie like this it really doesn't work. Basically I didn't think that the characters were super well- developed, but it's not like I didn't care enough about them not to see where the plot took them. They were averagely well developed at best. <br/><br/>The visuals were pretty good. While it was a lot of the same, that's probably what Mars is like. Just a lot of the same. Nevertheless, it was pretty to look at for sure, and I'm certainly happy that I decided to watch this movie on a television screen over a small computer screen. <br/><br/>Overall The Martian is just a decent movie. It's not great if you ask me, but it's not like it wasn't worth my time. While it was a little overlong, and it certainly did wear out it's welcome by the 2-hour mark, I still think that it was good. The plot is interesting but extremely predictable, the characters are average, and the visuals are great. Will I watch this movie again? I highly doubt it. I think that I'd probably end up hating it if I did that. In the end I'd recommend this movie, as I'm sure that you'll love it more than I did."
"R_Willis17","7","1","2","18 January 2016"," 7.5 Stars. Entertaining but not a Best Picture IMHO.
","I'll give it 7.5 stars. It's a good movie, entertaining, but I don't feel it's an Oscar-worthy ""Best Picture"" film like the vote-pursuing advertisements have been saying.<br/><br/>Damon does a very good job. The flaws in his performance are not really him; they are to be found in the writing. I saw the author (or was it the screen-writer) recently on TV, saying that he does indeed see people as having this kind of pervasive positive attitude. Personally, I want to live where he lives, as remaining 100% positive, like Mark Watney does, for so long seems to me to be very unrealistic. Still, suspension-of-disbelief is necessary in movie watching... and this is no exception here.<br/><br/>Recently, I believe, this film won 2015 Best Comedy on the Critics Choice Awards. Ridley Scott responded with his non-understanding question ""A Comedy?"" and he was the director. The humour is used to maintain the positive attitude of the stranded Watney. It appears that is has been misunderstood as the theme of the movie by many.<br/><br/>There are equally misunderstood leaps of logic and achievement (by the Watney character) in the film. So prepare yourself for a good film, not a great one. Be entertained and hope... hope that we have more people who could indeed be so uplifting, so positive, and so intelligent, as the Watney character is, in real life."

","I am a long time fan of the sci-fi genre. This has to be one of the weakest big budget sci-fi movies out there. I was really looking forward to it but found it utterly disappointing, almost to the point of getting mad while watching it.<br/><br/>I never got the feeling that Mars was a deadly, deserted planet far from Earth. The plot is really weak too imho. How is it possible that the makers of ""Moon"" were able to make space seem so cold and far from live? Is it the way better soundtrack of Moon? The better cast? The more perceived realism? The only way this movie could have been saved is to let the protoganist die a, much deserved, horrible death - but again, i was disappointed. This from the director of ""Alien"" - what a let down! I think this movies settles that score that Cameron is the (much) better Sci-Fi director."

","After reading all the positive reviews I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I'm a huge science fiction fan and I love anything that has to do with astronomy and space. While this movie has some decent moments, I found it lacked any sense of danger or tension mostly due to the fact that every character in this film feels the need to laugh off every situation like it's a joke. Don't get me wrong, there were some legitimately funny moments in this film, but I felt it tried TOO hard to be funny and came at the expense of the movie's overall tone. It seemed like every time there was a potential threat or danger to someone, a character would say a smart-alecky line about the situation. This totally diminished ANY sense of tension in the movie and as a result the whole thing feels almost like a comedy. <br/><br/>Also, another thing that bothered me was that aside from Matt Damon, the other actors such as Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Kristen Wiig are absolutely WASTED in this film and are given SO LITTLE to do. What a waste of a talented cast. <br/><br/>Overall, very disappointed in this movie and I'm really shocked at all the good reviews it's getting."
"joehemmings68","7","8","46","4 October 2015"," Like Gravity, But Ridiculous
","Firstly I'll say this film was a complete surprise to me. I very much expected a very serious survival film with lots of fairly blatant philosophical points to hammer home. This doesn't buck the current Sci-Fi trend of constant science discussion, there's a hell of a lot of that. Despite this the film is not dry at all, it's a very fun and easy watch. There were moments of self awareness that were very funny, and the light hearted humour throughout was much appreciated and unexpected from a Scott film. <br/><br/>My main issue with the film is how it can't quite decide what it wants to be. Is it like Gravity, an endless sciency human battle against the elements? Or is it an entertaining, yet rather ridiculous romp? For me tonally it leans toward the latter. This is fine, but it does mean that the film runs a little long. Since I wasn't sucked into the drama, my interest waned towards the end, at the time I should be most invested. The film also feels very constructed due to endless plot conveniences. <br/><br/>I'm being kind in giving this film a seven, but I genuinely enjoyed it, so there you go."
"captainmike-michael","9","12","78","2 October 2015"," Less Ambitious than Interstellar but Brilliantly Delivered and Funny
","Ares III, another group mission of NASA astronauts to the Mars may not have originality in plot due to source adaptation and visual effects not as amazing as Academy Awards winner Interstellar, director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Gooddard still manage to turn it into a successful and brilliant sci-fi. It's definitely not scientifically accurate at all levels due to minor flaws, but the story mainly focuses on the survival skills and rescue efforts which are presented in a straightforward, entertaining, chilling, educational yet inspiring way. The film is surprisingly funny compared to Interstellar and Gravity thanks to the outstanding performance from Matt Damon who delivers the character's positive attitude overshadowing the fear of being a stranded stranger on the red planet, other strong star-studded cast including Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor have solid performances as well as scores composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, not extremely powerful but strong enough to fit into scenes. While it seems to be a rescue mission, the film is able to deliver an important message - regardless the help from the whole world, self-initiation determines the survival opportunity. Overall at a smaller scale and fans perception, The Martian fits perfectly as sequel of 2013's Gravity and prequel to 2014's Interstellar."
"siderite","9","9","54","4 October 2015"," The sci-fi we deserve and need to see
","I've read the book before I watched the movie and I absolutely loved it. It's sense of humorous optimism and of the value of scientific achievement is, quite frankly, unparalleled. So the question is, how did the movie fare? It did really well, too!<br/><br/>This is the kind of science fiction movie that we need to see: it is about science, using fiction. It is not using technobabble to give us fiction. The difference is huge! Also, most ""sciency"" films are going for the dark and broody feel, discussing the things that people fear about science, not the things that people love. The Martian does not do that!<br/><br/>Not everything is rosy, though. In order to cram a book filled with inner introspection, science calculations, explanations of what was going on, all going on for almost two years, the film had to take some liberties with what was shown and what wasn't. My feeling is that they did a good job, but even for a two hour and a half movie it wasn't quite enough. My wife was still asking me what was going on and why did he do that and where is he going.<br/><br/>In fact, the biggest defect of the movie was to eliminate the sense of size for the planet Mars that is present in the book. Seeing some guy going to the Pathfinder landing spot in a few minutes and then Pathfinder back at base doesn't begin to show the scale of travel and difficulty Watney had to overcome. Also, Damon does a good job bringing humor to the script, but the book was filled with jokes and that Weir humor and optimism.<br/><br/>Bottom line: A movie that doesn't need deux ex machina to save the protagonist, doesn't need implausible crises or alien villains to share the thrill and terror of space exploration and yet shows that hope, friendship, skill and hard work, knowledge and science can overcome any obstacle. We needed that. Thank you, Andy Weir! Thank you, Ridley Scott!"
"guchrisc","Null","4","18","6 October 2015"," Houston has a very big problem in this exciting and tense SF film.
","This Twentieth Century Fox film opens on the planet Mars. A crew is working there but they have to leave in a hurry and thus accidentally leave behind one of the crew, the eponymous 'Martian' played by Matt Damon.<br/><br/>A major storm forced the rapid departure but Matt Damon's astronaut suffers an accident and his life-support systems show he is dead, thus the reason he is left behind. If he were dead, this would be a very short film. However, the film, 'The Martian', is 141 minutes long, (2hrs and 21mins), and as the trailers show, Astronaut Damon is alive and thus destined to be 'The Martian'. Alive, through a quirk of fate, Astronaut Damon realizes that he will soon die from starvation except if he can utilize fully his botany skills and Earth mounts a rescue mission.<br/><br/>On Earth, Astronaut Damon is declared a hero, and a funeral is held. Things though quickly change when a lowly tech worker, played by Mackenzie Davis, discovers the reality. The scenes with Miss Davis on the floor of Mission Control are well done. The excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor is brought in as the story develops, as are Jeff Daniels, playing NASA head Teddy Sanders, and Sean Bean. Donald Glover too, gives an authentic performance as a bright computer geek and mathematician.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels has the hard role of playing the boss who has to play politics, play the long game, all the while playing the numbers, and most importantly playing safety first always. He does this well enough to arouse empathy and understanding in his position. Sean Bean's character is perhaps easier to play. He is compassionate, honourable and noble. The two instruct a rescue-mission. Benedict Wong plays well the engineer asked to meet impossible 'Scotty-style' deadlines. There is a little humour here in this, as there is in much of the rest of the film too.<br/><br/>Unaware of any of this, are the crew of the Martian expedition, who are now sailing home back to Earth. Aksel Hennie, Kate Mara and Sebastian Stan are good in their roles as crew members. The pilot who had to blast off from Mars is played with great humanity by Michael Pina. Those who fell in love with his character in 'End of Watch' (2012), will be happy to know that once again he plays a really warm and human character. Jessica Chastain plays the Captain who had to order take-off. Her character is responsible for the Seventies disco-music used throughout the film to such great effect, especially in the scene which uses the song that started an era.<br/><br/>It is good to see both Miss Chastain and Mr Damon in this film. They have both also appeared in 'Interstellar' (2014). The appearance of Mr Damon in that film was actually one of the highlights. 'Interstellar' actually, was a disappointment. An interesting dystopian start, and perhaps too brief sojourn to the planets, was marred, ruined in fact, by a dreadful last third of the film. However, here, in 'The Martian', we have the film that 'Interstellar' could have been, and should have been.<br/><br/>While praise is due to all the cast, in reality they play small roles in this film. Matt Damon has to shoulder a lot of the burden in this film. His performance is in fact a tour-de-force. Facing death, he records his thoughts for posterity, using cameras, thus also supplying us, the audience, with explanation and exposition.<br/><br/>As said, this is not Matt Damon's first trip into space. As well as the aforementioned 'Interstellar' in 2014, in the previous year of 2013, Mr Damon also appeared in another exciting SF story, 'Elysium', which also had some hard social comment in it too. Nothing new for Mr Damon, 'Promised Land' (2012), was a serious film that tackled a serious issue. However, the talented Mr Damon can also deliver a performance that balances romance and comedy, as in his role as a suave but bad-French-speaking character, in the true story 'The Monuments Men', a film that perfectly balanced humour and seriousness.<br/><br/>'The Martian' is directed well by Ridley Scott. The 3D version shows well the Martian scenery, basically massive mountains and wide sandy valleys. The scenes in space are perhaps some of the most breathtaking and gripping. Drew Goddard's screenplay comes from Andy Weir's book.<br/><br/>Those of you who enjoyed seeing Tom Hanks have a problem in 'Apollo 13' (1995), will recognize a similar NASA and similar themes. So too, those Sandra Bullock fans, who were wowed by her performance in 'Gravity', will also find familiarity. If you liked those films, you will enjoy 'The Martian' too. Perhaps not the most action-packed film, it is after all basically about one man alone on a big planet, the film does build up the excitement and the tension as it heads to it's climax. The last couple of scenes could be described as an unnecessary anti-climax, however as they play out, you realize why they are there.<br/><br/>Top marks for a top film! 10/10."
"virek213","10","4","18","6 October 2015"," Saving Mark Watney
","For all the hype about CGI, and such things as ""Real"" 3-D, or IMAX 3-D, the fact is that Hollywood is throwing in a lot of ultra-expensive special effects and gimmicks to lure patrons into theaters as incentives to watch movies costing anywhere from $150 million to $200 million that are so much about the sonic and visual experience exclusively, and so precious little about the art form of the motion picture itself—primarily comic-book spectacles, and ultra-violent action. But there are still directors who like to do things differently. One of them is British director Ridley Scott. Known for such masterworks as ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER, GLADIATOR, and, in 2012, the Alien-influenced sci-fi/horror epic PROMETHEUS, Scott returned to the science fiction genre in 2015 with a film that is full of eye-popping visuals and sonic experiences, but rooted in realism. That film was THE MARTIAN.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name by Andy Weir, this film, which is a far-into-the-future science fiction opus in the manner of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (one of the films that Scott always considered a touchstone film), focuses on a manned expedition on the surface of Mars that goes horribly wrong for those involved when a severe Martian sandstorm envelops them. In a panic to leave, they unwittingly one of their own, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) behind on the Martian surface. The crew (led by Jessica Chastain) believe him to be dead, as does practically everyone at NASA, including its chairman (Jeff Daniels); but in fact, he is managing to survive on his expertise as a botanist and grow his own potatoes inside the sealed space lab on the surface of a planet where nothing can really grow naturally. Chastain and her crew only find out about this just as their spacecraft is making it home to Earth; and Daniels, a mission specialist (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and a British technician (Sean Bean) have to fast design a new mission for Chastain, Michael Pena, and their compatriots to quickly swing back to Mars for an incredibly dangerous rescue mission. Damon's knowledge of botany, and his somewhat caustic wit, are what manage to keep him reasonably sane through all of the difficulties; but at some point, luck will run out on him.<br/><br/>As the bar for realism in terms of space flight and space exploration had been set by ""2001"", where both director Stanley Kubrick and legendary writer Arthur C. Clarke were in close contact with NASA, and was extended with films like that film's 1984 sequel ""2010"", 1995's APOLLO 13, 2013's GRAVITY, and 2014's INTERSTELLAR, Scott found it worth his while to follow in their footsteps when it came to The Martian. And although some slight inaccuracies were inevitable (Hollywood has a tendency to exaggerate reality for visual spectacle), in general, Scott shows an otherwise extremely high accuracy and attention to detail as Kubrick, one of his personal favorites and mentors, had done for his 1968 sci-fi masterpiece. And as with all good serious science fiction films, from ""2001"" onwards, the technology doesn't overshadow the characters or the plot; it is all in service of the story, as opposed to the other way around. Damon, of course, in his own sardonic way, is really good in his own sardonic way, as is Chastain (who was in INTERSTELLAR), Ejiofor, Daniels, and Pena. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams, who did the score for GLADIATOR, has an appropriate amount of futurism to it, as well as some moments of pure classical music and modern minimalism, to give the appropriate amount of tension (as well as lighter moments that use 1970s disco music, including Vicki Sue Robinson's ""Turn The Beat Around"", Abba's ""Waterloo"", and the O'Jays' ""Love Train"").<br/><br/>The vastness of the cosmos, as well as the red deserts and mountains that constitute the surface of Mars itself, are all vividly rendered by Scott, cinematographer Darius Wolski, and the visual effects team assembled for the project. With its combination of visual accuracy and stellar acting, THE MARTIAN joins GRAVITY and INTERSTELLAR as a pre-eminent example of how great science fiction movies can still be made at a time when Hollywood has eschewed visual spectacle for visual reality, and sonic assaults for story immersion. Scott is one of those veteran directors who has shown that it need not be any other way."

When they reach Mars & go about exploring the terrain, a severe storm breaks out. After Watney is hit by debris, he's presumed dead by his crew because his space suit doesn't give off any readings. So, the rest of the crew reluctantly leave Watney behind on Mars. Now, it is up to Mark Watney to use his skills, wit & wisdom to survive on the limited supplies he has on the extreme planet. Watney also has to somehow convey to NASA, that he's still alive. <br/><br/>The Martian is a spectacular film. This film surpasses both Gravity(2013) & Interstellar(2014) to become my all time favorite film, set in space. The Martian is a flawless medley of the best elements of those two movies. The special effects are mind blowing. The 3D definitely adds to the already magical experience of watching this film. Director Ridley Scott & cinematographer Darius Wolski have masterfully captured the martian terrain. Green screen or real location, it actually looks like the movie was shot in Mars. I also loved the fact that the film tried to be as realistic as possible. The farming techniques that Watney tries is most probably what one would have to do if they're stranded on Mars. The fact that despite all the adversities Watney faces he always holds on to hope & never loses his sense of humor. Matt Damon is fantastic as Mark Watney. Being the protagonist stranded on a deserted planet, the success of this movie will always be judged by Damon's performance. He pulls it off, effortlessly. If it wasn't for Matt Damon's entertaining & powerful performance as Mark Watney, this movie would have been quite boring. Jessica Chastain is superb as Melissa Lewis. Kristen Wiig is great as Annie Montrose. Jeff Daniels is good as Teddy Sanders. Michael Pena is awesome as Rick Martinez. Kate Mara is impressive as Beth Johanssen. Sebastian Stan is amazing as Chris Beck. Aksel Hennie is effective as Alex Vogel. Chiwetel Ejiofor is outstanding as Vincent Kapoor. Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover & Benedict Wong are great as Mindy Park, Rich Purnell & Bruce Ng respectively. The Martian is a must watch. Hopefully, it will get nominated for a couple of Oscars. One of the best movies of the year."

","After making Interstellar Hollywood said, ""Man people are f**king stupid. Interstellar was a joke and they loved it but, it was obviously way over people's heads. Let's make a new space film the masses can all get behind; complete with poop jokes, clichés, and dialogue for the understanding of twelve-year-olds complete with cursing, and did I mention poop jokes? See, that guy laughed! We'll be sure to nail our demographic with the soundtrack too! We'll call it... The Martian."" Seriously, these guys know how to read their audience! As soon as the toilet started flushing members of the audience started a light chuckle. ""He made dooty!"" the thought of the gentleman sitting behind me perhaps. Has anyone seen that film Idiocracy? Not a bad flick if you ask me.<br/><br/>Very impressive scenery and CGI though. Also the acting wasn't half- bad! More than I can say for Interstellar and Matthew McConaughey."
"emdeecee15","Null","7","40","4 October 2015"," The best space expedition in years
","Relatively unimpressive works like Prometheus (2012) and Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) have put 77-year-old Ridley Scott's directorial prowess under scrutiny as of late. The Martian is Scott's response to these sentiments. With a level of humanity that Gravity (2013) could only dream of and a precision that Interstellar (2014) never achieved, The Martian is definitively the best space mission I've been on in years. <br/><br/>Based on the book by Andy Weir, The Martian follows the Ares III mission to Mars. Due to an intense sandstorm, the Ares team is forced to abort their mission and flee the planet's surface. During their departure, botanist Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) is struck by debris and lost by his crew. Presumed dead, the team cuts their losses and sets out for Earth, only to find out later that Watney has survived and is awaiting rescue. <br/><br/>Much like Scott's sci-fi classic Alien (1979), The Martian features an enormous ensemble cast full of some of the most talented actors in today's market. This is the first of many reasons why this film works on such a deep level. No aspect of the narrative feels peripheral because each character is fully fleshed out and critical to the story's structure. Every person is given purpose and dignity, which deeply enhances the film's connection with the audience. <br/><br/>This is primarily because Drew Goddard's script, and subsequently Weir's novel, is written with such charisma and wit that it's near impossible not to become profoundly attached to the characters, namely Watney. His sense of humor, which is so well developed that the theater I found myself in erupted with laughter on several occasions after some snarky insight or sardonic remark about his situation, keeps the entire movie afloat. Watney remains simultaneously very conversational and intimate throughout and is definitely the most likable protagonist this year has seen thus far. This allows for all his hardships to connect with the audience that much more. After watching this man's incredible ability to remain calm through such an ordeal, seeing him break down becomes almost too much to bear. <br/><br/>It's this profound humanity that makes the story so interesting. The Martian is nearly a two-and-a-half hour movie, but not once did I find myself checking the time. I could've watched Watney wander around Mars forever, observing as he sarcastically mutters to himself about the absurdity of his situation while simultaneously performing miracles of science not thought possible. After leaving the theater, I found it difficult to come to terms with the fact that I had just watched a work of fiction, not an actual biopic, precisely because Watney is so well rendered. He's a living, breathing human being, just like the rest of us.<br/><br/>The film's supreme sense of realism is spearheaded by the way it so logically and casually implements the science of its fiction, a skill that won't be found in most other films of this nature. For example, I have little to no idea what was actually happening in Interstellar, and for those of you who haven't seen it, I can almost guarantee the same confusion awaits you unless you're a quantum physicist. I'm certainly not a scientist, and chances are you aren't either, so when a film presents concepts that are unfathomable to the average citizen, few people benefit. <br/><br/>The Martian avoids this problem altogether for two reasons: the first is the fact that the entire film is based in science that transcends theory. Much of what is seen on- screen is accurate to where we stand today. The narrative of the film is supposed to take place in the very near future, so most of the technology seen is either already in existence or just a few years away – something that Interstellar most certainly cannot lay claim to. <br/><br/>The second reason why The Martian remains so accessible to the scientifically illiterate is that Watney explains everything he's doing in detail as he does it, getting into the nitty-gritty of every process he undertakes and every feat he achieves. For him, he's just talking to himself while documenting his experience, but for us, he's giving a clear, understandable account of how one could possibly survive on Mars while not being in any way prepared to do so. This didacticism keeps the film wholly engaging and credible throughout. <br/><br/>But the film's narrative isn't great just because it's so fascinating and thorough – its also incredibly well structured and paced. I wasn't sold on Gravity because of its relentlessness. Every possible thing that could've gone wrong did go wrong, and after a while that has a numbing effect. I can't be completely invested in a character's struggle if A. I don't know them very well and B. the level of danger they're in is so constant and explosive that it borders on absurdity. <br/><br/>The Martian understands this. It doesn't test the limits of its characters by throwing everything and the kitchen sink at them. Instead, it provides only intermittent crises. It allows for the audience to become invested in the improbable success of Watney and then tests both him and the audience at just the right moment. This allows for bursts of intensity and subsequent release that establish the emotional intelligence of the whole film. <br/><br/>That being said, it's still early in the year and Oscar season has only just begun, but for now, The Martian is the best movie of 2015. Ridley Scott has been the king of science fiction for several decades, and it doesn't look like he's going anywhere anytime soon."
"daffydus","6","6","34","5 October 2015"," Not exactly a psychological sci-fi thriller
","The good: 3D has matured to where it enhances the film instead of being the main feature of it and The Martian is a good example of just that. It does not do it as well as Gravity, but it's close. You seldom get the feeling that the 3D actually consist of 2D layers between the foreground and the background, and objects don't too often fly towards you and out of the screen, thus breaking the immersion. All in all the images are really great. The movie is packed with beautiful landscapes and some enjoyable planetary shots. Moreover, the installations and space ships are actually convincing to a certain degree and don't break the realism too much, as often happens in this genre.It's well worth the cost of a visit to the movies or (later) your time in front of a good television just for the visuals. <br/><br/>The bad: First, what is up with the Chineese suddenly lagging 50 years behind in train technology? Sure the U.S has the upper hand when it comes to space tech, but I'm not convinced that will last till 2035. Second, victory comes too cheap in this film. Third, I really wish the script had dived into the psychological tension of the main character's solitary confinement in space a lot more. There is really only a couple of times in the plot where you wonder for a quarter of a second whether our man can take it or not. Although it would have been deeply interesting, the movie never delves into one of the yet unsolved issues of space travel, namely how humans cope with them selves and their inner demons when they are out there alone. Instead it goes for a comic relief every 10 minutes and ends up becoming a sort of MacGyver in space. It makes for great, albeit shallow entertainment, but if you are looking for a psychological science fiction thriller you need to check elsewhere."
"josephkehoe","9","8","50","4 October 2015"," Matt Damon + Ridley Scott = Astonishing Space Epic
","Optimistic, witty, A great story of human survival.<br/><br/>Stood outside of the cinema I had to make a decision whether to watch this or the maze runner:scorch trails or this and I made the right decision.<br/><br/>First of all Matt Damon gave a stellar performance and was perfect for the role. He really made you feel for him and want him to survive. He does a great job of keeping you entertained even when he is by himself. This is where the directing skills of Ridley Scott comes in. He makes it so Matt Damon character is indirectly talking to the audience while he is talking to the cameras in the base.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is also brilliant. I especially liked the angles created by the small camera/Go Pro on all the astronauts suits.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott does a very good job of making mars look exiting and extremely cool place. As a very vast and desolate place making it interesting was very difficult task and Ridley Scott delivered.<br/><br/>The supporting cast in this film really adds to its overall enjoyability. Most of the best of the supporting cast are on earth at NASA. Jeff Daniels and Sean Bean where both every good in there roles and the dynamic between the two was really interesting. Chiwetel Ejiofor was all so very good and really showed his acting ability.<br/><br/>The film also supplies some comic relief. This usually come in the videos Matt Damon is recording and the conversations between him and the crew.<br/><br/>To sum up this is a powerful, gritty and at times funny tale of human survival.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it to anyone looking for a tremendous feat in film and by far one of the best films I've seen this year!"
"the-fearless-america","7","8","50","4 October 2015"," Formulaic & Predictable. Intense-Intellect Movie Turned Into Half-Comedy & Young-Aged Sci-Fi Movie.
","Firstly i must say that the martian is one of my awaited-movie this year. You know, it was Ridley Scott.. One of the best sci-fi director which Hollywood had of all time. The originality he had in blade- runner and intense plot-maker in alien were really mesmerize me. I know he was something.<br/><br/>After the martian shot the theater, well.. it's a bunch of promotion and marketing for the movie. it's like this movie gonna be exploded in the way that interstellar did. But no.. This movie too disappointing for me and only mediocre to a known-director. <br/><br/>The shape of the movie follows all of nowadays movie formula. It's straight to first-climax at the start of the movie, then cooling down a little bit, then going back to second-climax (with some forced sentimental-scenes added), then easy-cheating solution for the ending. This formula sacrificing the performances of the actors and actresses. It changes the way how the character should behave in the movie. Well, most of the audiences even didn't realize if Chastain's performance much way better than Damon's. It's because audiences nowadays never care about the performances, they only care about visuals and easy-enjoyable story-shape, yet fast-climax, and of course some unworthy jokes.. Thats what happened to the martian.<br/><br/>The second problem that happened to the martian, Scott add too many easy-jokes on it. Please.. This is a horribly serious and intense movie, but too much jokes where one man's life was in danger. Scott, are you serious to work this ? This movie can be a lot more.. Even when i see Damon, i don't know what to say. Well, this actor was not capable to play this role, yet the plot didn't support him either.<br/><br/>Then the science was a total mess up.. Too much cheating to the plot. Everythings that related to space and astro-science were extremely calculated and was a life-and-death decision. It's not like i choose that way or i choose this way or i think it's better to do this idea. I don's see any psychological pressure even a little bit to Damon's Character. It's totally failed in character depth.<br/><br/>Well.. I know that Scott trying to follows the other young directors to pull the audiences.. But please, you're a respectable and legendary director as well as we all know. Just don't use any nowadays formula and i know Scott will be scary as what he did in blade runner."

"agmoldham","7","2","7","8 November 2015"," Thrilling movie
","There are many movies where you never really engage with any of the characters. That certainly isn't the case with The Martian where there was clearly a lot of thought put into the script. I never really pay too much attention to scriptwriters, but Drew Goddard can certainly be praised for his work on the Martian. Looks like he's mostly been involved in writing for TV series (Buffy, Lost) in the past, so hopefully he'll be doing more feature films in the future.<br/><br/>Anyway The Martian tells the tale of Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who is presumed dead on Mars when the rest of the crew head back for Earth. It's not giving too much away to say that isn't the case, but how's he going to survive and what's going to happen.<br/><br/>It certainly reminded me very much of Apollo 13 in places and that's a pretty good movie to be compared with. Definitely not to be missed and one of the best movies of 2015."

","Back from a talk from Astronaut Superstar, book author and musician Chris Hadfield in Jasper, Canada where he mentioned the movie as having some of the science and feel right, I am glad I got to see this in immersive IMAX 3D. Not only did it get that right, but more importantly the love for science and science-fiction back like what Hadfield has been able to do with social media and space.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott pioneered sci-fi movie-making 3 decades ago with Blade Runner (1982) and Alien (1979) both major entries in the genre. I however found he hit his prime as a director in 2001 (not Kubrick's landmark sci-fi adaptation) with action ""Black Hawk Down"" and thriller/horror ""Hannibal"" after his Oscar-heavy ""Gladiator"" hit of 2000. Body of Lies (2008) was his return to form with a twisted tight thriller and to a lesser degree American Gangster (2007) also starring Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>Now ""The Martian"" may - should!- get Oscar attention with possible acting, directing, visual effects, sound, editing, cinematography, screenplay and best picture nominations. The screenplay is a wonderful, witty, humane and humorous adaptation of Andy Weir's novel by Drew Goddard who wrote sci-fish Cloverfield and some fantasy TV show episodes.<br/><br/>Scott's directing is a great mix of tension, humour, action and crisp narrative. Pietro Scalia made good editing choices that sets this apart from Interstellar's long moments and even if it lacks the vision of Interstellar (2014) it makes it up in ingenuity, laughter and levity making the most of humanity, space and science current frontiers. It exploits the explorer spirit with the human and technical challenges necessary to overcome again and again.<br/><br/>From the brisk bang-for-your-buck beginning to the engaging ending with every twist and turn in between, this is a compelling and moving movie that you don't really want to end. Matt Damon is the perfect marooned man on Mars with positivism and sarcasm. His crew-mates and the ground staff are also great characters and supporting actors. The balanced cast is like the editing, enough to keep your attention, keep you guessing and engaged.<br/><br/>The storytelling has classic elements of recurring themes and jokes coupled with situations that compound difficulties to be surmounted. The triumph is not only in the story but in the importance of facing these improbable odds as individuals and as a species to surmount space's difficulties. We cannot help but go along readily with the ride and follow the fortuitous and fateful out of this world journey.<br/><br/>Early this year I saw the small and smart UK offering Ex Machina (2015) from a nation that is getting good sci-fi out finally. With sublime lesser-known ""OXV: The Manual"" and ""The Machine"" also from the UK to US heavy hitters ""Gravity"" and ""Star Trek Into Darkness"", 2013 was a great sci-fi year. Now coupled with Interstellar (2014) and The Martian (2015) as big back-to-back year blockbusters, we can only hope for a revival of the best of this imaginative genre that was made for movies. In fact, I hoped for a movie like this in my Interstellar review almost to the date (release date) last year!<br/><br/>Yesterday announced the go-ahead for a New Star Trek series slated for 2017, on top of the 2016 & 2019 movies. Next month will be the first of the much anticipated Star Wars trilogy with Disney and JJ at the helm. 2017 and 2019 will follow and maybe 2 spin offs. Add awaited Avatar sequel trilogy 2017, 2018 & 2019 from James Cameron. All that aside, most importantly the Blade Runner remake is in pre-production with a finished script as we speak to make sure we are back into the Science-Fiction era!! It will be in the capable hands of none other than other great Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve, currently finishing another sci-fi fare, tentatively titled Story of Your Life (2016).<br/><br/>I haven't felt this good since Deep Space Nine was on the air...<br/><br/>Now if only someone dared to adapt Asimov's Foundation series to screen...<br/><br/>Cheers and happy sci-fi decade"

","This movie is portraying what it would take for someone stuck on Mars to survive. The movie shows what would be needed to get the person back to earth and how the survivor would have to navigate the technology. <br/><br/>So when Matt Damon is acting all chill and joking around, for me it seemed like he was being ironic about the real chances of surviving. In the end, it would be pretty much impossible for a man left on Mars to survive. Period.<br/><br/>I also liked how they portrayed NASA as a good guy and bad guy at times. Matt Damon's performance is really good. Unlike some of Ridley Scott's recent movies, this one was a thrilling and satisfying one."
"jeggaar","6","2","7","11 October 2015"," Read or listen to the book instead.
","I listed to the audio book of The Martian and it is amazing. It's smart, funny and interesting with a lot of emotion and has you wanting more all the way trough it. The movie has to cut something out since it cant be 20 hours long. When I went to see the movie I was expecting them to do a good deal of narrating when it comes to the thoughts of Mark Watney, since it is a big part of the book how he tries to solve the problems he is facing. Mark Watney is also a really funny character and very smart so his way of thinking is important to understanding the character and to make the audience connect with him. But this is one of the parts that is missing in the movie, you don't get to connect with him, most things are skipped and makes the whole experience for Mark seem really easy with no real problems. You don't get to hear how he is planning to his food supplies and how big a problem that is for him. Another example is his time in the Rower, his travels on Mars seem so easy in the movie, but in the book it's anything but. It takes a lot of planning and he HATE's being stuck in it for so many days. In the movie you never get immersed in how many days he spends on the different tasks he has to do. It is a real shame.<br/><br/>Marks has to travel a huge distance on Mars later in the film, during that trip in the book he is faced with a very very large sandstorm, this is problem for him and for NASA. It makes the trip much longer for him and he has to figure out if he is moving into or out of the storm. The way he figures it out is pretty smart. He later actually gets in a really bad situation when the rower get into a problematic situation. All this is missing from the movie. Another huge aspect missing is the emotion of Mark when reaching his goal, in the movie it seems like nothing to him, like it was just another Sunday trip down to the local store.<br/><br/>All this combined changes the story so much and makes it really tame in the movie. It's such a shame and also why I can no stress enough how much more you will enjoy the book over the movie. So is the movie worth seeing, sure it is but not if you have read the book. You will be left wanting more, you might be left wanting more even if you have not read the book to be honest."

","Matt Damon carries the load as he is left alone on Mars to survive. But that is in the trailers and ads and posters so did we need the head of NASA stepping up to a podium with a Presidential Seal telling the audience what we just saw? Perhaps the movie could have been trimmed here as it is a bit long.<br/><br/>The effects exceed the performances and are sure to be recognized this awards season. Of course the movie requires considerable suspension of disbelief. Jessica Chastain who recently got back from space in ""Interstellar"" is in orbit again. She and Sandra Bullock must have been in astronaut training school together. Sure there are elements of ""Gravity"" and ""Castaway"" but the Mars location gives things a fresh spin.<br/><br/>The movie subscribed to the theory of glasses on actors make them look smarter. Great product placement for Duct Tape as it solves a lot of problems in space and hostile planets.<br/><br/>There is plenty of interesting music including some great stuff from Abba. It's a fun time at the movies even if you see what is coming and know the ending before the first day of shooting. It looks great on the big screen, the bigger the better. The 3D was very subtle and mostly noticeable in space debris scenes. Even if you shy away from science fiction give this movie a chance. It is worth seeing."

","Mark Watney is the Ares III Mars mission's botanist astronaut. A few days (sols) there, a storm rages through the Hab site forcing the team flee the planet on the Mars Ascent vehicle (MAV). Hit by a debris and presumed dead, Mark is subsequently left behind. Awaken, he patches himself up and starts video-logging his activities. With no communications and the next Mars mission in four years, Mark has to 'science things up' to survive. He rations food and plants stash potatoes in his own feces. He creates water by oxidizing hydrogen and nitrogen. NASA eventually learns of his survival and announces it but refrains from telling it to the Ares III crew. Mark mods the rover to enable him drive longer distances. NASA engineer Vincent Kapour finds Mark is traveling to the 1997 Pathfinder rover. As Mark recovers it, Vincent is able to control it from earth, enabling a simple communication.<br/><br/>Vincent's team instructs Mark to hack the Rover's OS to enable text communication. NASA finally reveals the truth to the Ares III crew. As NASA prepares a supply mission at the least, Mark becomes somewhat a celebrity on earth. One night, a malfunction in the airlock destroys Mark's second potato crop. Mark's left with his food, which left a limited time before NASA can reach him. Mark chats with the Ares III crew and rebuilds the Hab. NASA tries to launch a supply probe but their rocket explodes mid-air. CNSA, the Chinese NASA, helps out with the propulsion technology. Meanwhile astrophysicist Rich Purnell contacts Vincent about his calculations that instead of sending a new mission to rescue Mark, NASA can just resupply the Ares III's spaceship Hermes to go and get him. Even though the NASA director disapprove the plan but the mission director secretly sends course plan to the Hermes, thus the plan is underway.<br/><br/>NASA and CNSA cooperate to relaunch a probe to resupply the Hermes for their return to Mars. Meanwhile Mark starts his journey to the site of Ares IV's MAV. After seven months he reaches it. NASA tells him to dismantle the protection layers to lighten it so Mark can reach the Hermes better. As the Hermes gets into range, its crew remotely ignites the MAV with Mark in it.Floating on space, Mark still can't reach Hermes automatically, so the Ares III's Commander Lewis 'bungee jumps' herself to catch him mid-space, with him puncturing his suit to make an ""Iron Man style"" flight to approach Lewis. With that Mark safely board the Hermes and gets back home to earth.<br/><br/>In essence the story doesn't really offer something unpredictable as a big picture. Everyone who has seen the trailer, let alone read the book which I haven't, will easily know that the movie only tells of an astronaut mistakenly left on Mars and have to utilize his craft to survive the overwhelming odds. And with the current trend in Hollywood movies and literature, with the exception of true story based tragedies like the recent Everest (2015), one can safely assume that this movie will have a happy ending without having to watch the whole thing.<br/><br/>But with that kind of expectation this movie still able to give me wow moments as it use so many scientific points which are logically understandable without having to delve deeper back into the science textbooks. There are a lot of technical stuff lying around in the critical story flow, even technical abbreviations and jargon. But the movie went on with confidence to insert them without having to explain them in the duration. This is quite smart considering that The Martian (2015) took advantage of the steady flow of space movies since 2013's Gravity, which exposes the audience to the technicalities of space travel. The setting and location filming, with aid of CGI, do worth a mention. The end results look so convincing indeed that I gave up searching for unedited set bloopers after about thirty minutes in. Coupled with all the factual physics and space travel knowledge, this adds into the enjoyment of watching the movie.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, the movie presents us with a nice level of acting work, although it's kind of weird to see most of the cast list of familiar faces only take less significant faces. Matt Damon of course nailed his parts very well. His balanced up depiction of Watney's ingenuity and despair at different times completes the story angles well. Jeff Davis provided the skeptic and cautious angle very nicely to the story, Sean Bean gives us a more entertaining performance through references to his other work, rather than his actual role here. It's very nice to see other familiar faces like Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara, Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and even Kristen Wiig brightening up the cast list.<br/><br/>my say for The Martian is a solid 7 out of 10. A recommendation surely goes out to see it in the cinemas. It's very entertaining and indeed also informative."
"scottshak_111","8","2","7","8 October 2015"," An orgasmic dig into science, unknown territories, top-notch optimism and undying hope
","As the beginning frames of The Martian survival painted the screen with a silent promise of grandeur, the first quotient that riveted me instantly was 'Hope'. Mark Watney's undying attitude towards life was really something. His optimistic nature towards survival was commendable. So what adds further icing to this survival tale? Sheer Watney genius!<br/><br/>The Martian is everything a survival movie needs to be. Ridley already had Andy Weir's brilliant story in his vanguard, and he takes it and moulds it into one helluva beauty. The end result: 141 minutes of awesomeness. It keeps your heart in your mouth, your head attentive so you don't miss all the useful science jargon, a smile on your face with its great humour whilst keeping you engaged throughout. <br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>Matt Damon is outstanding as Watney. At times it's like you can almost read his thoughts. He lingers his expressions like an expert and makes you connect instantly. Like one time he talks about his eventuality with a ""so, Yeah......Yeah"". His instincts help him tackle every setback. His genius complements his acts. A very practical man, who takes every possibility into account but doesn't let reality cloud his judgment. This makes you think what if the Martian wasn't a polymath? Instead a normal human being like us? What would have happened then? Wouldn't we have, I don't know, died within a fortnight?<br/><br/>Visuals are rad. The scenic landscapes of Mars and Earth have been framed beautifully. At times the debris in the movie makes its 3D look bad-ass. The screenplay is apt, most of the times shoehorned with Science. The plot is like a tide that makes you rove with its ups and downs. The brilliant brains manifested in the story are quite exceptional too. The flick teaches us a lot of things. The primal one being: never lose hope!<br/><br/>At the same time, Martian makes you feel like a layman.

"RaduBontideanu","9","5","27","6 October 2015"," Better than Gravity, not as good as Interstellar. Still one of the best movies of 2015 so far!
","The Martian, directed by Ridley Scott (one of my favorite filmmaker of all time) is that kind of film that claims to be a hit from the beginning but, at the same time, tries to remain a simple and intense story that can be enjoyable and easy to understand by a wide audience, not just by the typical science-fiction fans.<br/><br/>The movie follows two main story lines which remain parallel until a certain point of the action. The first one tells the story of the protagonist, ""the martian"" Mark Watney, played brilliantly by Matt Damon in one of the best roles of his career in my opinion. The hero is left behind by his crew during an ordinary mission on Mars after a huge storm that made everyone think he's dead. But as he turns out to be still alive, despite a serious injury, the movie follows his efforts to survive totally alone on a hostile planet without any possibilities to escape in the next years, until the next mission of NASA on Mars is programmed. But will he manage to survive? This is the question that remains predominant through the whole movie.<br/><br/>The second storyline is based on the action that takes place on Earth, where an entire elite of scientists and even the whole humanity tries hard to rescue the astronaut as soon as possible by planning an earlier programmed mission to bring him home.<br/><br/>The movie has terrific visual effects (especially in the 3D version, which I was lucky to watch) but also a quite realistic vision of the future, presenting an unfriendly image of the Red Planet, with stunning landscapes that seem to be more and more hostile as time goes by. There are no aliens, robots or other futuristic machines and this apparent lack of fantasy offers a significant touch of realism.<br/><br/>I recommend this film not only for the die-hard fans of Sci-Fi genre, but for anybody who wants to see an emotional and thrilling (occasionally filled with the specific humour of Matt Damon) story about one man against the hostility of an entire planet. Among other recent Sci-Fi movies, like Interstellar and Gravity, The Martian is also focused more on the human nature and not just on the science stuff."
"ramtimak","9","5","27","5 October 2015"," Very well done and entertaining
","After watching Interstellar where I was feeling sleepy, this is a refreshingly entertaining movie which is believable and has nice human touches and wit to keep the audience interest intact. Fortunately, the science behind what happens at Mars and the rescue is explained in plain English which makes it thoroughly enjoyable and a delight to watch. Of course, the spectacular visuals is done very well and I must mention that the subtle use of 3D complements the story rather than distracting from it.<br/><br/>Hats off to Ridley Scott for making a very wholesome, entertaining and visually delightful movie that will appeal to the masses."
"kckidjoseph-1","8","4","20","5 October 2015"," How Ridley Scott and Matt Damon Channel Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart _ on Mars
","Some years ago, I accompanied the great director Frank Capra, whose works included life-affirming pictures like ""It's a Wonderful Life' and ""Meet John Doe,"" on a nostalgic return to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he had graduated some years before with a degree in chemical engineering.<br/><br/>While there, Capra met with a group of students who had formed an informal film club, for which they shot clever home movies basically for their own pleasure. <br/><br/>Capra patiently waded through the eight-millimeter silent films, which were actually pretty good, and offered some sage advice that applied not only to these little snippets but to movies in general.<br/><br/>First, he said, movies have to have a beginning, a middle and an end, not just be a blurb of cinematic virtuosity that goes nowhere for no particular reason, and second, the characters in the film have to be someone the audience in some way cares about. (He would note during a later meeting I had with him that the reason ""E.T."" was so successful was that it was, in his words, ""a love story between the boy and the alien."")<br/><br/>I mention all of this because a portion of ""The Martian,"" director Ridley Scott's new science fiction movie starring Matt Damon, takes place at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed by Caltech for NASA.<br/><br/>It's impossible to watch this film and not be reminded of Capra's words. The bright faces and eager minds on the screen helping us wend our way through the story are not unlike those of the young film students I encountered with Capra at Caltech those many years ago. <br/><br/>Interestingly, Damon has been called the new Jimmy Stewart, whose career was cemented by his association with Capra in films like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""You Can't Take It with You"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" Damon, like Stewart, is a terrifically appealing actor who meets the Capra standard of being someone audiences really care about.<br/><br/>Even more intriguingly, it's not a stretch to say that Stewart _ a decorated World War II pilot who would go on to achieve the rank of brigadier general in the Air Force, and who himself played the ultimate lone-wolf-in-the-sky, Charles Lindbergh, in the 1957 film ""The Spirit of St. Louis,"" as well as the lead in other flight-oriented pictures like ""Strategic Air Command,"" ""No Highway in the Sky"" and ""Flight of the Phoenix"" _ might have been greatly interested in this role.<br/><br/>If indeed Damon is the new Jimmy Stewart, then Ridley Scott, at least with ""The Martian,"" might here be called the new Frank Capra.<br/><br/>Like Capra, Scott in ""The Martian"" emphasizes what is best about man and the human spirit. And like Stewart in those films about flying, Damon is a man who represents mankind.<br/><br/>This film, based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel ""The Martian"" with a screenplay by Drew Goddard, stars Damon an astronaut named Mark Watney who is left behind on Mars after he is caught in an otherworldly dust storm and presumed dead.<br/><br/>Mission commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) reluctantly decides to leave the planet with her crew.<br/><br/>Watney, although badly injured, is very much alive, and our story begins.<br/><br/>As luck would have it, he is a botanist and there is enough equipment left on the planet from that and past missions so that he can attempt to survive.<br/><br/>During his efforts, Watney records a video diary in case he doesn't make it, wry and humorous descriptions and asides that are almost a movie within a movie (and it's tempting not to think of how Jimmy Stewart might have handled the scenes as well, in his patented offhanded natural way).<br/><br/>A fascinating parallel story has NASA officials reacting back on Earth, both in all their glory as technological whizzes and pioneers, and at their nadir as techno-politicians reaching for ways to spin the possible impending tragedy of losing an astronaut to their own advantage.<br/><br/>The film has a solid cast, and along with Damon and Chastain in the leads, features in supporting roles Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br/><br/>If I have a problem with the film, it might be that the dialogue is a little too heavy in technological jargon (that may or may not be accurate), and that some of the plot devices seem a bit contrived.<br/><br/>But then I think about those great Capra-Stewart films, which critics also complained were too contrived, to the point that they derisively labeled them ""Capra-corn.""<br/><br/>If this is corn, I'll take it any time. It's a luscious, beautiful film, made for all the right reasons. Mainly, it's just plain fun to watch."
"DoctorEvil1337","9","6","38","4 October 2015"," Like Gravity, except better
","Everyone compares this movie to Interstellar simply because it has two of its cast members and somewhat of a similar purpose when it's actually more akin to Gravity (which in my opinion is a vastly overrated turd of a movie). Though the quality is close to what Interstellar achieved, this movie is very different. Rather than being a tale of optimism, the feeling of survival in the grimmest of circumstances is constantly reinforced by so many things going wrong in Mark's (Matt Damon) desperate attempt to live long enough for rescue.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is quite solid. It suffers at time from slow pacing, but then again most space movies are quite long and require such to really get it to work. Matt Damon, like in Interstellar, puts on a hell of a show as his character, while having far more screen time to make an impression. We see him at his heights and his dips in this movie, and all are worth watching.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil too much, nor am I going to dive into what makes this movie worth watching too heavily, but I will say I cannot endorse this movie enough. It's easily one of the better movies of the year, and also should be watched in 3D.<br/><br/>If you liked Interstellar, you'll like this. If you liked Gravity, you'll like this as well. If you never watched either, watch this movie. If you've never watched a movie, watch this movie. It's worth your money.<br/><br/>What are you waiting for?"
"Dragonsouls","6","10","76","1 October 2015"," Boring, unemotional, but beautiful.
","The Martian is another big budgeted blockbuster by Ridley Scott, who I like the call, the hit or miss director. I loved all of his classic films, and who doesn't right? I loved Prometheus, and the underrated Kingdom of Heaven, but lately, he's been a bit off. I don't think this will be the flop that Exodus was; because it is more catered to the casual moviegoer of all ages. Exodus was messy at times because it was the product of an entire group of people, rather than the single vision of Ridley Scott. I think Ridley did a fine job with this film as far as pacing goes and directing, but the writing was iffy and juvenile at times.<br/><br/>The script was an adaptation of a highly acclaimed novel, a novel that I never read but I have a feeling that the fans of the book will be disappointed because I just never felt bad for the main protagonist. Matt Damon's fantastic performance was not enough to save the film in my opinion. I think he'll be nominated for a best actor Oscar and he deserves to be. He was absolutely hilarious too, many of his lines were clearly improvised, but never once did I feel myself rooting for him. He was a character without back-story, without family, and without something to live for. He hardly lost a single pound of weight during his ordeal and the obstacles he faced did not produce any amount of tension at all. He had a lot of tools at his disposal, and the solutions to his problems were solved easily. He came off like a vacationer at a resort rather than someone in grave peril.<br/><br/>Most of the film was spent on NASA officials and their hypothetical solutions for the rescue mission. An entire hour was spent on the plan, and the plan B, and the plan C. As I watched, I kept saying to myself, ""Just save him already!"" The scientifically minded moviegoer will cherish these scenes, and at times, the solutions by the protagonist were clever, but there was nothing close to the wow factor of pseudo science. Natural elements, from gravity to sugar were used in creative ways, and the making of water from out of thin air was cool, but it all just felt like a science lesson. Some people might be wowed by it all, but I wasn't. What wowed me was the set design. Ridley Scott and his art directors are as good as they come. Visually speaking, this movie blows away anything seen on screen before, and that includes Interstellar, Prometheus and Gravity. The sets, props, and CGI were stunning. <br/><br/>But all in all a disappointing film. When I spend 12 dollars on a movie, I expect one or both of two things. For one, I want to be emotionally stimulated. This movie failed to do that for me. And if the film is labeled as science fiction, then I expect a clever script, a story that makes you think. This was far from an esoteric film and it was not on par with great survival films such as Cast Away or Alive either. If this were a film that was based on a true story, it would've had a bigger impact on me. But it's just a futuristic adventure story, unoriginal, and a boring one at that. <br/><br/>6 out of 10."

His helmet when it got cracked, and the station on Mars when it got depressurized (he fixed it with some plastic bags and DUCT TAPE!!). This is unbelievable, the pressure on the surface on mars is 1 % that on earth (same inside the station), this pressure difference should rip the plastic bag apart!!!! Also the martian dust is known to be toxic for humans, you can just bring it inside the station and mix it with grow potatoes!! And I don't wanna even start talking about his maneauver to escape mars and rendevouz with the rest of his team in orbit, and how he punctured his suit .. etc because it was complete stupidity!!

"robert-temple-1","5","2","8","14 February 2016"," Long, boring, and wrong
","This film is misconceived and far too long (2 hours 24 minutes) for us to watch one man in a spacesuit talking to himself. The idea of Robinson Crusoe on Mars may seem good for a book, but does not make for a good film. It was clever to cast Matt Damon as Mars-Crusoe, because he is an excellent actor, highly watchable, and does as well as anyone could. Jeff Daniels is one of my favourite actors, but he is entirely miscast as the Director of NASA. The director, Ridley Scott, became far too involved in the technical story of how the guy can survive when trapped on a planet far from home. He forgot that not everyone watching would find the survival saga as absorbing as Scott clearly did, at least not for two and a half hours. I once spent a long time writing a screenplay with Arthur C. Clarke based on his novel A FALL OF MOONDUST, which is about some people trapped on the Moon, and how can they be rescued. (The film was never made because of costs at that time.) I therefore know more about coping with stories of characters stuck on a body in space than most people, and I can say the struggle was to get one's nose out of all the technical detail so that it did not just become an engineering lesson and still remained a human drama. This does not happen with Scott's film. The characters are all made of cardboard, and a lot of good actors like Kate Mara are just wasted because they are barely glimpsed. And then one comes to all the errors. It has already been pointed out on IMDb that the sandstorm on Mars which occurs early in the film would be impossible there. So already from the very beginning, we are in fantasy land. There are some other errors which the producers and Scott probably have no way of knowing, so they cannot be blamed. All the senior people at NASA have known for a long time that there are huge stores of water as ice beneath the Martian surface, and therefore the 'shortage of water problem' in the story is not viable either, though admittedly this information has never been made public. As for China Aerospace, it certainly does not look like that, as I have been there many times. Nor would the Chinese space officials ever be able to make a political decision and 'keep it between us space agencies' as we see in the film, and use a Chinese rocket to save a marooned American on their own initiative. How fantastically naïve can you get? Nor is NASA a purely civilian space agency, as the film says, since if you read its founding charter you can see that it is required to have a military mission as well. More important still is something which is genuinely secret, though why it is secret I cannot imagine. Arthur Clarke through his friendship with the top people at NASA was given some photographs of the Martian surface which have never been released to the public. He showed them to me. They were high resolution photos taken from a very low altitude. Indeed, my best guess is that if they had been taken by a normal camera they were taken from about 500 feet. However, they were probably enlargements of detail from photos taken at a much higher altitude using all the super-camera technology which the US Government has for satellite photography. They were not however taken 'straight down' from a satellite in high orbit, as they were all at a forward-looking angle. What they showed beyond any doubt whatsoever were copses of trees and lots of bushes. The trees were shaped like pine trees, and were clearly gymnosperms (evergreen firs, with needles rather than leaves). They showed no signs of having been bent over by prevailing winds, and stood upright. They were very dark green and looked pretty rugged and tough. They grew in clumps of anywhere between two or three together, to perhaps twenty to thirty together, scattered here and there in the red land and hills. In other words, there were no actual forests. None of them grew near any sign of surface water. My subjective impression of these pathetic clumps of trees is that they were sad remnants of what may once have been more extensive tree cover. Another interpretation however is that they were seeded from earth randomly by seeds blown up above Earth's atmosphere in storms. (Some seeds can survive travel through space and exposure to space radiation and still germinate.) Someone I know who once worked for NASA in relation to Mars soil sampling told me he found clear evidence of live bacteria in Mars soil sampled on Mars remotely by a probe, but his findings were dismissed and never acknowledged, and there is a policy of sterilizing all soil recovered from any body in space which would kill any bacteria before they could reach Earth for analysis here. As for the bushes on Mars seen in the photos, they looked like very tough desert bushes, certainly not succulents, and must have had woody stems. They did not appear to have leaves of the usual kind and were very scraggly. So why all the secrecy? What is there about scattered trees and bushes on Mars that is worth concealing? Wouldn't it have been fun if Ridley Scott had known about the trees and had tweaked the noses of NASA by showing them in his film? That at least would have been more interesting than the potatoes grown by Damon. A scene where Damon explores a clump of Martian trees, now there you would have a really good scene. And show him boring for Martian sub-surface water. Oh well, maybe next time."

"nikashvili","9","2","8","13 October 2015"," In your face, Interstellar! (or any other sci-fi this year)
","I always get excited for adaptations of my favorite books, just like I did last year. Gone Girl ended up to be my most favorite. Even further, The Perks of Being a Wallflower sneaked in my all time favorite list, just as I rewatched it multiple times. <br/><br/>The Martian turned out to be an amazing adaptation - as joyful and entertaining as Weir's brilliant work. In fact, I loved most parts of the book, because it was smart, with quirky humor and delightful main character. Andy managed to create the most realistic story about living on Mars, so realistic that you will never cast a doubt on anything he writes. Having said that, there were few parts where a though of skipping couple of pages crossed my mind. Anyways, I read all of it.<br/><br/>Shrinking this huge book to 141 minutes film is unimaginably hard but Ridley Scott did it. Luckily, he left out my least favorite parts of the book, like long travel to MAV. In the end he made one of the most enjoyable films of his carrier and directed Matt Damon to his best performance in years. <br/><br/>Speaking of cutting the film, the long time duo of Scott and film editor Pietro Scalia (who won his second Oscar for Ridley's Black Hawk Down) did an amazing job. Most scenes are so well edited that they take your breath away, especially in the final part of the movie, where a lot spinning and floating happens. For the sake of protecting you from spoilers, I will not breakdown each scene. <br/><br/>I had more expectations for cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, who shot beautiful Prometheus. I always think of sci-fi as a genre, where camera crew and special effect supervisors have enormous chance to invent something extraordinary, to go beyond the imagination and surprise the audience. Just like Emmanuel Lubezki did in Gravity. Despite some gorgeous shots in The Martian, there are few scenes which I can remember for a long time - one of them pictured above. I think that shot is just amazing, it is freakishly symmetrical. The line where board ends is like separator of two different worlds: cosmos and the earth. And the way colors interact with each other, ugh, can't even describe my feelings.<br/><br/>Cast that huge always works. But kudos to two times Emmy winner Nina Gold for such an amazing collaboration between A list actors. I am quite sure I will be speaking for everyone when I say that Matt Damon is the best Mark Watney we could have probably hoped for. He is naturally as charming as I imagined Watney while reading the book. I am not saying it because his ass popped in my face in 3D, but because he's got very likable face and voice and Damon nailed all the jokes. His portrayal of arrogant, straightforward, smart, optimistic and all positive astronaut proves Gold's phenomenal casting choice. Above of all it, every other actor is a perfect fit to their characters, but especially, Donald Glover whose few minutes on the screen as Rich Purnell is a moment of joy. In contrast with the book, his character was one of the most memorable ones in the movie. <br/><br/>When I left the cinema, there were few things I wished I remembered more vividly. One of those is music. Harry Gregson-Williams's original soundtracks neither impress nor stays memorable for a long time. I remember watching Interstellar and no matter how much you like the film, Hans Zimmer's music never leaves your mind. And I wished someone like him (is it even realistic?) composed for The Martian. It would have made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable. Music has a vital role in living through the film, especially in a (mostly) single character movie, where non verbal details express the verbal emotions. A good music could have made Mark Watney's experience both more dramatic and funny the same time. <br/><br/>I feel like I have to say few words about the outraging comparison to Interstellar, which is both unfair and incorrect. While Nolan told the story with superficial, yet complex and utterly boring science, The Martian looks like more practical survival guide for those stuck on Mars. It does not have a claim of solving all mankind problems, or exploring the human nature, or pursuing the destiny of persons, it merely tells a story of courage and dedication. In fact, the only common thing for both movies is a space and I'd be true to myself if I say that I enjoyed Ridley Scott's work a lot more.<br/><br/>To cut it short, The Martian is the most enjoyable blockbuster movie I've seen in 2015 so far. And people, who say that it is the best work for both Ridley Scott and Matt Damon in years, are absolutely right."
"midas-jacobs","9","2","8","10 October 2015"," 'Hello darkness my old friend...'
","I will explain the title further on in the review.<br/><br/>So ""The Martian"" is about Mark Watny, a botanist. He and his crew members were on a mission, the Ares III mission. But at sol 18 (one sol is a day at mars), there happens something bad, there is a storm. Due to this storm Watney and his crew have to abort the mission and get of off Mars. While the evacuation takes place Watney gets hit by an antenna, and is impaled by it. His crew thinks that he is dead, and leave him behind. Alone at Mars. But Mark didn't die by the antenna, he survived. Now he has to 'sience the 'Beep' out of this' to stay alive, and wait for rescue. <br/><br/>""The Martian"" is directed by Ridley Scott. This man has directed some classics and good movies (e.g. ""Blade Runner"", ""Alien"", ""Gladiator""), but also some bad (""Exodus: Gods and Kings"", ""The consoler"", ""GI Jane""). I think that this movie should be on his 'good movies' list. The film was beautifully shot. The effects were stunningly beautiful. Scott did an amazing job at directing this movie, and I am glad that they chose him to direct ""The Martian"". The landscape the used the recreate the landscape of Mars, was also very well chosen, it really felt like you were on Mars. You could see the landscape really wheel, when there were some aerial shots, who looked beautiful. Like I just said, the effects were stunning, you just couldn't see when they used green screen. You obviously knew it, but you couldn't see it. What I also liked was the costume design. The space suits used on Mars looked nice, but also practical. The suits made me think of the suits in ""Prometheus"", also a movie by Ridley Scott. On the 'trivia' section on IMDb I also read that it is inspired by it. The sound in the movie was very surprising. It was well edited and chosen, it felt very realistic. What also helped to keep this movie so realistic, is the science behind it all. The science is mostly correct, and that is what I liked the most about the movie. Weirdly enough there were enough tense moments throughout the movie, but it is a good thing.<br/><br/>The acting is handled very well. Matt Damon was amazing as Mark Watney. He plays Mark as a positive, funny guy, who sees the best in almost every situation. But he also has his breaking point. Sometimes he just finds the most weird ways to laugh with somebody, but it is still funny. He was just like I imagined him in the book. Jessica Chastian played Lewis. Lewis was the leader of the mission. She is a caring leader who doesn't want to leave a man behind, and when she has to leave Mark behind, she is devastated. Chastian did a good job at portraying her. Some other crew members are Kate Mara, she played Johanson. She definitely redeemed herself after ""Fantastic Four"". You also have Sebastian Stan, he plays Beck, who turns out to be a love interest for Johanson. He did a good job as well. There is Alex Vogel, he is played by Aksel Hennie. He played a German astronaut. He was also pretty good. And the last crew member is Martinez. He is played by Michael Peña. I very much liked his character. He and Mark were both hilarious, and it was just fun when they had a conversation. He acted very good. This movie doesn't only focus on Mark and his crew, it also focuses on NASA's side. Here you have Jeff Daniels, he plays the head of NASA and is very good at it. There is also Sean Bean, who plays Mitch Henderson. He did a good job at portraying him. In case you wondered he doesn't die at the end. Vincent Kapoor is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, I have nothing really to say about him. And my favorite character of NASA's side is Rich Purnell. He was played by Donald Glover. He was very convincing as a smart, but messy boy. <br/><br/>I very much liked the writing of the movie, this was maybe even the best part of the movie. It was funny at times, but also clear when they explained the science stuff. It had its emotional moments, and I liked that. You also cared about Watney and didn't want him to die, that was due to the script. I was glad that Andy Weir, the writer of the book, could help writing the script of the movie. I didn't really like that they left out some funny moments from the book (I have read it) for example: The aqua man part. And what I didn't get was why they cut away at the part where Watney is trying to anger NASA. <br/><br/>But as I said in the beginning of my review, I am going to explain my title for this review. With 'Darkness' I was talking about Ridley Scott. This is because he has made a bunch of had movies lately. This is why I symbolize him with the 'Darkness' part. But also with the 'Old friend' part, this is because he made a bunch of good movies back in the day, that is why the 'Old' part.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading this review, I hope you think that it is useful. I would recommend this movie to everyone who liked ""Gravity"", but with a bit more science. I would also recommend it to everyone who has read the book, and if you haven't read the book, then go read it! The movie is a very good movie, and I hope you will see it."

","Bullet holes in a nice vehicle = Martian Note: This is full of spoilers so be warned! -The name of the movie would probably be more appropriate as, ""Bring Him Back"". I asked around and everyone I talked to didn't know a martian had to specifically be from Mars, they thought it was just from ""anywhere in space"" which would be a confusing title - because everyone in the film is human.<br/><br/><ul><li>They never explicitly said what a SOL is - granted it can be figured out - to the non science inclined this is an annoying term they use when DAY would suffice. Pivotal? no, but hugely important? yes, because they say ""SOL xxx"" hundreds of times in the movie which brings me to: -The SOL days - They introduce too many variables, to the point the viewer doesn't know how desperate or helpless Damon's situation actually is. ""He has enough food for 400 days, which is 200 days short of rescue (okay so that's DOOM, he WILL DIE), then his crop freezes and dies, oh yeah! he has 200 days of reserve food, he can last to SOL 580, but they're coming SOL 620, if he drives to this other rocket, a 150 day drive, he can blast off, SOL 138!"" ----it all becomes so redundant, confusing and you never know what the hell is true - What broke the film for me wasn't SOL days or Damon's jokes (I was actually glad to see a sarcastic hero astronaut, I thought it worked).... but the teenage laptop dude that solves NASA's incredibly complex problems. The guy, you know, in soooo many of these films, the guy who drinks red bull, plays techno music, has 15 computer screens, lives at his parents or on college campus, and somehow figures out NASA's space crap? That guy?!! Not in a critically acclaimed space movie involving Damon and Ridley Scott, no way.... BUT YES! Are you serious! A dozen similar movies before this make ""slingshot around an object"" a pivotal plot move, we expect it. So when a teenage kid is the genius who figures this out in Martian, and drives to NASA lol.... I just lol'd.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In Apollo 13 it's easy to recognize the team in Houston lead by Ed Harris. For some reason, the team on earth in this movie... is scattered, confusing, role-less (like what was the blonde's point?), just too many players on earth in too many changing locations, it becomes a distraction. And why did they feel the need to label certain people as they appeared... LOOL, it should be obviously apparent who the character is, this is storytelling with film 101 - Set/prop design was incredible - which made the macro scale special effects seem not as good by comparison.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It was like a good burger. Sure, it tasted better than most burgers, but it's still a burger with the usual ingredients: storm wipes them out, guy left behind, must defy odds, teenage nerd discovers secret to win, drama ensues back home, gotta eject and float through space while someone grabs you, fairytale ending.

"peefyn","7","13","111","23 September 2015"," Wrong approach to the book
","I have read (and loved) the book, and I am not distancing myself from that in this review.<br/><br/>There's many ways to adapt material, and in a sense, The Martian is very faithful to the book it is based on. Obviously you can not fit an entire book into a movie, so you would have to skip parts of the plot, etc.. The book the movie is based on is in large parts the astronaut's first hand account of what is going on, the logs he writes. The movies have him making video accounts of the same, so we can hear the character say the lines instead of writing them. All of this makes sense.<br/><br/>What I disagree with, was what the movie decided to put its main focus on. It has picked a couple of moments from the book and spent quite a lot of time on them, and fast forwarded through the rest. This has the effect of making Watney's stay ""easier"" then it is in the book. To me, the book was at its most interesting when Watney was coming up with great solutions, and explaining how he did so. The movie has some of this, but skips most of explanations, choosing to rather ""show than tell"" (which you'd think be a good thing).<br/><br/>That said, I thought they picked great actors to play all of the roles, and all in all I appreciate how close to the book the movie was with what it decided to have on screen. I wish the movie all the best, but would really have preferred if it was done differently. I don't know how, but for this movie I would not have minded an almost continuous voice-over. Or at least for the movie to be longer. Or maybe replace most of the parts without Watney in them, having rather the ongoings on earth being related through other means. I don't know what would work the best, but the direction they went for was a big disappointment to me."
"Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer","9","4","24","6 October 2015"," The Martian is Tuly Out of this World
","The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Drew Goddard. It stars Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kirsten Wiig and a slew of other equally talented actors.<br/><br/>The Martian is about manned mission to Mars in which Astronaut Mark Watney(Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott did it again offering one of the best science fiction movies of this century. After Blade Runner, my personal Favorite of his, and a slew of if-fie movies I wasn't sure how he would ever meet his standard. Well He did!<br/><br/>Scott offers some of the best direction I have ever seen in a science fiction movie. With intense camera-work Scott unleashes the sheer despair of being four years away from one's family, friends, and and most of all planet, while keeping glimmers of hope through out. This works hand in hand with the awesome cinematography done beautifully by Dariusz Wolski. A true beauty technically it holds up just as well in script and acting. My personal favorite scene in the movie was second to last scene in the movie. I was terrified but enthralled.<br/><br/>The script from this movie was brilliant. Excellent Work From Goddard made the movie gripping as well as intellectual. With actual scientific ideas to boot this movie is very hard to pull apart. It holds not only great science fiction but comedy so funny I found myself crying at the hilarity of the moment. With inside joke galore, this was a great script.<br/><br/>Finally the acting. Matt Damon was magnificent in the role of Mark Watney, demonstrating is comic chops and his dramatic finesse. He was optimistic, funny and smart, three characteristics it takes to pull of a role like this.I enjoyed Jessica Chastain, Kirsten Wiig, Kate Mara, and Micheal Pena. I loved Jeff Daniels' somber but caring portrayal of his character. One of my favorite characters was that of Rich Pummel, played by Donald Glover. He was magnetic in the part for such a small role. My favorite character in the movie was Vincent Kapoor played by Chiwetel Ejiofor. He was highly intelligent, witty, charming and resourceful.<br/><br/>With a tight script, direction, cinematography, acting and no glaring issues, I am forced to do this. The Martian Gets an A. The Martian is truly out of this world."
"Troy_Campbell","8","9","74","2 October 2015"," Another successful epic form Ridley.
","Ridley Scott and science fiction go together like strawberries and cream. They are made for each other. Some of Scott's greatest work has been in the sci-fi realm: Alien, Blade Runner and, arguably, Prometheus. His impressive form within the genre continues with The Martian, a surprisingly comedic adventure that is so meticulous and intelligent you would be forgiven for thinking it was science fact. Pitching its tent somewhere between a less serious Interstellar and a more plot-driven Gravity, this interplanetary saga follows Matt Damon's stranded astronaut as he MacGuyver's his way to survival on the red planet. Damon's portrayal of the never-say-die genius botanist is tremendous, unexpectedly delivering one of the funniest performances on his CV whilst still bringing the dramatic heft. It's a small shame then, that we spend a fair chunk of our time away from Mars, either back on Earth with NASA execs, engineers and astrophysicists figuring out how to rescue their man or in outer space with the guilt-racked crew that accidentally left him behind. Regardless of location, Drew Goddard's screenplay (based on Andy Weir's novel) is always clever and carefully balanced, with a light-hearted tone that works amazingly well considering the dire circumstances. In fact it's this consistent and edgy humour that sets The Martian apart from other similar sci-fi outings; some gags are so funny it could quite easily find a place on 'best comedies' lists at year end. Scott brings his usual visual flair too; the arid vistas of Mars are gorgeous, the outer space shots are conceptually intriguing and photo-realistically executed, whilst the wisely injected action scenes are thrilling, if not totally reinventing the wheel. And wow, what a cast. Damon is the deserving star of the film, but it doesn't hurt when Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Kristen Wiig and Kate Mara are playing second fiddle. Don't be fooled by its jovial disposition and spirited 70s disco soundtrack, this is yet another successful Scott epic."
"bobbobwhite","6","2","9","10 October 2015"," Disappointing after reading the book
","So much was left out from the book, as of course it had to be with the limited time frame of a film. But so much of the science that was so interesting to me was omitted, and a lot of unnecessary stuff that bored me was inserted to get butts in the seats. Not much to do for Matt Damon as Mark Watney, the stranded astronaut on Mars, so Hollywood did what it does so well, it added emotional scenes not in the book to get the heartstrings going, but not so much the brain. Some of it was too silly for credibility, from a science perspective.<br/><br/>Great visuals and NASA-type sets though, and I enjoyed those, even as the story was very lacking for those who read the book before."
"RforFilm","9","2","9","7 October 2015"," The Martian is the scientifically sound space thriller that Interstellar should have been
","Castaway is my favorite ""stuck on a desert island"" story. It was an almost one-man story about a guy surviving with the skills he has. He's not a genius, but he uses what he has (coconuts and anything washed up from the crashed Fed-Ex Plane). There's no villain or McGuffin device that could save him. Castaway knew that it had to play things simply. That, along with most desert island stories, take their inspiration from the Robinson Cruise novel that turned the simple premise into an engaging genre that has been repeated over and over. It's usually easy to make up the story by simply choosing the location.<br/><br/>You set the story on an island, then anybody has a chance to survive. Put the story in space, then your character, no matter how intelligent they are, will be facing a bigger challenge. Food and drink would be a problem as space has nothing that a human being would be able to live by. Shelter would be another issue as you only have enough oxygen for so long. Speaking of oxygen, even air would be troubling. For a Mars-set The Martian, it's going to have to take a very resourceful Matt Damon to solve this.<br/><br/>Sometime in the near future, the NASA-bound Ares III crew on Mars has done well with collecting samples that they hope to study on Earth. A sudden storm hits the red planet where the crew, including commander Melissa (played by Jessica Chastain), Rick (played by Michael Peña), Beth (Played by Kate Mara) struggle to get to their escape ship. Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) gets struck by debris and is presumed dead. The crew launch off the planet, mourning their loss before starting their return mission to Earth. Mark wakes up in a sand pile and manages to make it back to the artificial habitat, unable to make contact with NASA with the communication equipment all destroyed. He calculates that it will take four years for another mission to reach him. Before attempting find a different way to get any message home, he uses his skills as a botanist to try and make enough food and water to last the next long period with only disco music as his source of entertainment.<br/><br/>Back on Earth, head of NASA Teddy (played by Jeff Daniels) already announces Marks death before other engineers Vincent (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mindy (played by Mackenzie Davis) see that they have an astronaut to rescue.<br/><br/>Last year's so-called scientifically accurate Interstellar seemed to capture a lot of people's imagination except mine. The Martian accomplishes that scientific accuracy while boasting a better story and more interesting characters. Matt Damon seems like a more human character then Matthew McConaughey's monologue spewing borefest. Even though he's a genius, Damon still seems at home enough that we along with him would work as he does, get hungry as he does, and become angry as he does. Damon comes really close to rivaling Tom Hank's Castaway performance.<br/><br/>Unlike Castaway's one-man show, The Martian boasts a huge cast that surprisingly never becomes over crowded. Everyone fits their shoes and plays their part in this one guy's journey to make it home. <br/><br/>I may not be an astronaut, but The Martian also reminded me why I made those annual trips to Space Camp. The movie shows how cool these intelligent people can be with what they can make. I won't say what he does to survive, but it seems so believable, that I wonder how much of a part the real NASA played in creating it's plausible situation.<br/><br/>I'll give this nine Mars artificial habitats out of ten. The Martian only has one goal in it's story and that all it needed. This movie is my Interstellar and should hopefully even turn those individuals to see why that Christopher Nolan story was drab while this Ridley Scott movie is awesome. This is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of 2015."

This was however not possible with this film.<br/><br/>Too often I got ""woken up"" with the next unrealistic decision making step in the story.<br/><br/>If you are like me, a person who NEEDS the story to be plausible to enjoy it, that film is NOT for you, I promise.<br/><br/>If however, the degree of realism in how the story develops does not bother you at all, and you have time to kill, then you might enjoy this film.<br/><br/>3/10 for me.<br/><br/>Not recommended"

"fellyday","1","1","3","4 January 2018"," dumbing down the book spoiled the screenplay
","I read the book and also listened to the audiobook several times now. The charm of the story for me is, that it heavily emphasizes the Science in Sci-Fi. The whole thing is (mostly) sound and very well explained, so even technical illiterate readers can follow. 
For this movie someone decide to dumb down the content and take shortcuts and - surprise - mistakes, failures and plot holes ensue and some things simply make no sense anymore (just look at the goofs list - you could make a book out of them). Then again some scenes were unnecessarily added to confuse even further to make up for plot twists that were cut.
This messy screenplay can't be saved by the cast. Most of the characters are but a faint shadow of their book selves. Take crewman Vogel for example. Would anybody have guessed him to be German, if it wasn't for the patch on his suit? Jeff Daniels seems to wear a stiff neck and all the characters interactions feel like packed in cotton. Those guys should be passionate and fight for their opinions especially since the lives of astronauts are on the line and depend on their decisions. They are highly trained specialists in their field of work and have to fight against political red tape. Non of this was in the movie. They could have had a more passionate discussion about a burgers or football.
And don't even get me started on the props. Think about airplane furniture and then shave that down even more to get rid of any unnecessary gram, while barely preserving basic function. Where was that in the movie? The Hub looked like it was built to house colonists for decades and not to serve as a pressurized shelter for a two month mission. The movie-Hermes consists mostly of large corridors without any purpose and large window panes. A spaceship like this would never be approved.
I could go on forever, but it all boils down to this: Andy Weir went to great length to make the plot and every action the protagonist take plausible and get his book scientifically correct. That's what I love about it and why I was looking forward to the movie. And then I got handed this stupid, dumbed down, senseless piece of trash."
"ioanamocanu-90769","10","1","3","15 November 2017"," One of the best SF films
","I've been a big fan of the Martian, ever since I first read the book written by Andy Weir based on which the film was made. It is directed by Ridley Scott and features an outstanding cast such as Matt Damon in the role of astronaut Mark Watney and Jessica Chastain as Commander Melissa Lewis, the Ares III mission commander. Set in 2035, the action takes place on Mars, around Acidalia Planitia and its surroundings. The plot revolves around astronaut Mark Watney who, believed to be dead, was left on Mars by the rest of Ares III crew when they had to abort the mission due to a strong dust storm. And so, he sets out in an amazing race for survival, with limited resources of food and water, managing to do what no one would have thought that is possible to do on a lifeless planet. Under the direction of Ridley Scott, Damon gives a superb performance. As you'd expect, the film is thrilling and visually spectacular, with state-of-the-art visual effects. The script is surprisingly hilarious, which reflects on Damon's character, Watney, who tries to remain optimistic, despite knowing that he might not see the Earth again. Also, regarding the scientific information, the film, like the book, doesn't disappoint. It gives a wide range of accurate information from all the scientific branches. That said, for me it is the best science fiction film for many years, far more entertaining than the other science fiction films I've seen, and I would recommend it for anyone interested in science or looking for thrilling stories."
"mckyj57","6","1","3","27 October 2017"," Who made the decision to ""jazz it up""?
","It is clear that someone grabbed control of the script. Some producer who made the decision not to go with a slightly jazzier Apollo 13 and allow this film to be halfway believable.<br/><br/>I was ready to give this a solid 8 or 9 stars. Despite the usual needless Hollywood visual embellishments, I was hanging in there, liking the way they were resisting making this film just another special effects exercise. But they couldn't do it, so right in the middle of the film they seem to invent ""Rich Parnell"". Young kid who comes up with hare-brained maneuver, and somehow gets into the office of the NASA director to make a stupid unrealistic demonstration that no one would put up with even from a legendary mathematician, much less a grunt astrophysicist no one knows. A maneuver that is totally unbelievable because it is preposterous.<br/><br/>After that point, they continued to stretch our credulity until it broke. There were innumerable cases, but the final straw was when they had to honor political correctness and send a wisp of an woman, who had not trained for the maneuver, out on EVA when it would have been clear they needed the strongest man they could find. It's like Hollywood films have the equivalent of a Communist political officer -- ""The party wants it this way!""<br/><br/>This kind of crap must sell, but it is sad. I would hope that the people who make this will realize they have relegated their movie to the scrap heap of history. ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" is a classic because they didn't overreach. Likewise ""Apollo 13"". Those are films a director could be proud of. Instead, Ridley Scott will be remembered for laying a turd on the cinematic landscape."
"Evan_Wheatley","9","1","3","11 April 2017"," Why you should take time to see ""The Martian""
","""Everywhere I go I'm the first. It's a strange feeling. Step outside the rover, first guy to be there. Climb that hill, first guy to do that. Four and a half billion years, nobody here. And nowÂ…me."" - Mark Watney, ""The Martian""<br/><br/>Imagine you're the first person to be alone on an entire planet. You're in a NASA exploration habitat that was built to last for 31 days. Your food supply is limited. If the oxygenator breaks, you'll suffocate. If the water reclaimer breaks, you'll die of thirst. If the habitat is breached, you'll implode. What do you do? How do you survive? Is it possible to make it back home? For astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon), dying is not an option. <br/><br/>You'd think a story about one man's fight for survival on a planet several million years away from Earth would be bleak, but this return to form for director Ridley Scott is anything but. ""The Martian"" is one of the funniest movies I have seen all year, largely due to Drew Goddard's adapted screenplay and Damon's perfect execution of the sarcastic spaceman Mark Watney.<br/><br/>Each time something goes wrong, Watney delivers a line that showcases his optimism and comedic nature. One of my favorite lines comes a little over halfway into the movie, when Watney is forced to ration his food into smaller portions. As he eats a piece of meat the size of a Lego block and half of a red potato, he stares at the camera blankly and says: ""It's been seven days since I ran out of ketchup.""<br/><br/>While humorous moments like this are sprinkled throughout the film, Damon also captures the underlying despair and loneliness felt by Watney, and his desire to get back home. <br/><br/>The scene that hooked me comes right after Watney is marooned on the red planet. As a massive dust storm rages outside of the habitat, a defeated Watney looks through some of the belongings his crew left behind. Staring off into the darkness, he confidently mutters, ""I'm not gonna die here."" <br/><br/>Damon's performance is complimented by those of a large supporting cast consisting of Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Sebastian Stan, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean, who play members of Watney's crew and the NASA men and women trying to get him home.<br/><br/>When Watney says, ""Mars will come to fear my botany powers,"" you believe him. His scientific wit is as entertaining as his humor, and you're for rooting for Watney each step of the way. You cheer with each success, and empathize with each failure. <br/><br/>Ridley Scott and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski bring the desolate wasteland of Mars to life. Scott and Wolski create beauty from the barren world, and with each shot, the vast desert further contributes to the sense of isolation you feel while sitting in the theater.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" stands among Ridley Scott's best work, and Matt Damon provides one of his greatest performances. The scientific wonder the film evokes transcends both of their contributions however, and I am excited to see where we as humans progress in the coming years. <br/><br/>With several Mars-based projects currently being pursued by NASA as well as advancing technological developments, the future looks bright. Hopefully in our lifetime we will have the chance to witness history. Mars colonists will be able to say with a smile, ""In your face Neil Armstrong."""

","I have seen some reviewers who claimed that this movie hadn't live up to their hope. However, as for me, I enjoyed it pretty much. When I was a kid, the book I loved most was ""Robinson Crusoe""(until now is still). And I love to play video games like ""Ark: Survival Evolved"", ""Don't Starve"" and other survival types. Therefore, this movie just satisfied my fantasy in every way. I can never deny that I am afraid of solitude, but if I can create a world of mine just Robinson and Watney, things may be different. In spite of many physical ignorance, I suppose it is a good piece. Oh, forget to say, when Watney first tempted to burn the hydrogen and was blew up by himself, I burst into laughter."

","Matt Damon's characters quirkiness and comedy added much needed relief to the film.Graphics were great. It was a nice spin on sci-fi space thrillers. Most loose ends were tied up throughout the movie and all of the characters actions had logical reasons. Definitely liked the part on earth working with the people of NASA. Everybody coming together to bring him earned viewers investment in the film. This move was cheesy at the right time and realistic at the right time. Showing the martians un-fed body added a somewhat realistic view of his condition.The ongoing drama and wavering faith of all going well kept me on my seat throughout the movie. Only bad thing I can say about this movie is the ups and downs were at times prolonged but always picked up speed after a while. Definitely recommend this movie to everyone."

","Films made from novels are usually great in my opinion. I think screen writing a story without a famous novel behind it may be fading by convention. ""The Martian"" is one of those hip cool novel-to-movie examples. I read the first few chapters before seeing the movie. The understated humor and NASA space themes drew me in right away. That and the universal praise of the critics put seeing this one at a high priority.<br/><br/>""Star Wars"" proved a global love for space movies. ""Castaway"" did the same for survival films. It's likely ""The Martian"" draws from both audiences along with readers of the novel. It's already being given ""Blockbuster"" status in the press. In the story, a manned mission to Mars goes wrong and an astronaut, thought to be dead, is left behind. He uses his ingenuity and tenacity to survive. The movie is well over 2 hours and I wasn't bored once."

The Movie industry is no exception to this, despite which, the majority of releases do seem to be made to pretty high standards. It then becomes a matter of personal opinion whether you like them or not.

I love a good dose of believable sci-fi and Ridley Scott once again delivers the goods right here as he did with Blade Runner and Alien before this.<br/><br/>Matt Damon play Mark Watney, an astronaut who gets accidentally stranded on Mars after failing to get off the planet with his crew after a severe sandstorm hurtles him away from the spacecraft. After this troubling accident, Watney is left stranded on the planet, and is desperate to find a way to let the Earth know that he's still alive. Will he succeed though? Ridley Scott is a great interpreter of the human condition with his films, and The Martian continues to ask questions about human life the way Blade Runner did, though in a completely different context and more on sovereignty and survival.<br/><br/>The Martian is a must-see."

","""The Martian"" is a nice film about an Astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who is left behind on Mars after a storm hits him and his crew and he is believed to be dead, but miraculously he survives and has to learn to live on the planet until someone rescues him. In a way this film reminds me of ""Gravity"" with Sandra Bullock except for the fact that Sandra Bullock's character had to do almost everything on her own without the help from anyone after she got stranded in outer space, now that's not taking away from the intensity of this film just because Mark Watney (Matt Damon) had some help from earth. He still had to survive in the hostile conditions of Mars. With Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as part of the cast you couldn't go wrong. These are some very talented actors and they were perfect for this film. If you liked ""Gravity"" you'll love this film. It was well written and had great visual effects and the plot will keep you interested from beginning to end. This is a great one and I would recommend it."

","Firstly its great to watch a film were someone is deserted in space, or on a island that does not involve a love story. I laughed a lot in this film and was not expecting to do so, no offense to Matt Damon but i was not expecting him to make me laugh. Matt Damon and the support cast were fantastic in this film, Jeff Daniels played such a good part it took me a while to realize he was in Dumb & Dumber!. Easy to watch, and the sort of film that the family can watch on a Sunday after a roast dinner. It actually makes you think, will we ether make it to mars? or in habit another planet? Hope so but maybe not in my life time. But if we did i hope we don't have to grow vegetables in poop!."

","Castaway on Mars The Martin feels just like Castaway which is a good thing. Man gets stuck on some remote location and must struggle to survive and get back home. The scenery is just beautiful and the plot is engaging and not to mention that Matt Damon puts on a brilliant performance. <br/><br/>Unlike Castaway it shows the characters on Earth trying to figure out how to bring him home. If you enjoy a movie with a character trying to survive and get home in what seems like an impossible situation this is the movie for you. If you like science as well this is the movie for you despite a few instances that it does not make sense. <br/><br/>I definitely loved this movie and I know a few reviewers claim that the movie is too Politically correct but I do not care. Why can't a woman be a Captain or a Black person be a higher up at NASA. The actors did a fantastic job and did not need to resort to be stereotypical to be great. Overall I give the movie 9/10"

","I expected way more from this movie so I was a bit let down. <br/><br/>The real-life link: I am not familiar with all the scientific reasoning that this movie shows so I can not comment if it is possible in real life or not or if they did a good job in bringing the movie as close to reality as possible. <br/><br/>Character analysis: Mark Watney's positivism and humour get him alive. While is hard to believe that someone in those conditions would be as calm and as humorous as Mark Watney was, it is good to see that the movie shows that with those two virtues you can survive even in a foreign planet. There is not much more depth to the characters as this. <br/><br/>The movie missed those exciting turning points, those moments when you don't know if the lead is going to survive or not and if he does how is he going to do that. I felt that from the beginning it was pretty clear that Mark was going to be saved. For a men alone in Mars his stay was pretty comfortable. There was only one instance when things get complicated for Mark ( when he looses his corps) everything else goes exactly as planned. There was only the scene almost after 2 hours that gets slightly exciting (when Melissa Lewis catches Mark) everything else is slow and non action not to say boring."

People have found numerous elements of stupidity in this film, but here's another one to consider: how come the guy never sees the Earth on the sky in those 500 nights? How moving such a scene would have been? Him contemplating the home planet on the sky just like we watch Mars from the Earth...

And all those calculations about the days left to save him... Like anyone watching the film gives a damn about the days left before his food ends. It becomes so predictable that one way or another he will try to escape instead of waiting and starving.<br/><br/>I cant believe the director of Aliens and Promitheus is the same with the one who did the martian.

No, not really, we'll get a star actor, let's say, Matt Damon, put in some great special effects and boom...it'll work. It's a good movie, little boring half way through. What's really annoying is the need to explain everything to the audience. Since we're dumb and it's too difficult to explain science stuff not using words. So Matt talks a lot to himself. An annoying scene was at the end as the astronaut stands in front of his class and utters some hero like corny American epilogue lines.To summarize: not very original or realistic, sometimes dull. Not really memorable, just a good, albeit not great, movie. The music is the best part."

","Possibly one of my favourite science-fiction films. It is a film which is visually stunning and credit must go to Ridley Scott for the creation of such a world. The Martian must also be commended for its scientific rigour for the most part and directly grapples with the genuine problems of a human mission to Mars.<br/><br/>The film is also helped by easily finding Matt Damon's character to be likable and remain amazed at his ingenuity stranded on the red planet. The film utilises humour brilliantly as relief from the vicariousness of the stricken astronaut and it possibly has a higher number of funny lines than many comedies.<br/><br/>At its heart it is simply a survival-and-rescue mission, but one which is beautifully told."
"kevmay-243-123271","10","1","3","11 March 2016"," Why you should watch this film
","I have read lots of reviews of this film some good some bad, some people want to hate it and some people love it. I had no opinion either way but having read the book decided to watch it with an open mind.<br/><br/>Is it the book? No, it isn't the book because reading the book takes about 10 hours and a film can't be that long. Because of this some portions have been abbreviated and some omitted for length and pacing. Some things which are explained in detail in the book are not explained at all in the film and that was in all likelihood to keep the talking to the computer log to a minimum as it slows the pace.<br/><br/>Does that make the film bad? No, it is true enough to the spirit of the book and the changes make sense.<br/><br/>Lets talk about the bones of the film, like The Castaway and Gravity and The Moon the main actor is alone on screen for the vast majority of the film. This is hard to pull off, not having anyone to act against. It takes a confidence and ability to communicate non verbally by expression, stance and intonation that many actors can only aspire to. Some people think his character is unrealistic and that by rights he should have curled up in a ball and stopped moving. I disagree, NASA would not send someone with a personality like that on a mission. Nasa's astronauts are a positive, upbeat and determined crowd who would not allow themselves that weakness. Some question the science but it is actually pretty solid so those that doubt it should do some research.<br/><br/>Matt Damon owned this film, he was superb in it. That is hard to say as I have never been overly fond of his acting but praise where it is due he nailed this.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast whilst seen only occasionally are very good in their supporting roles. It speaks measures that such accomplished actors would agree to such small roles and they add immeasurably to the enjoyment of this film.<br/><br/>Should you watch this film? Yes, if you like Sci-Fi or comedy or a feel good ending to a roller-coaster ride film then yes watch it as you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>I do not listen to pre release hype but on its merits this is a first class film, so go watch it."

How cool is that! My only issues, are the deviations from the actual book. So if you are a fan of the novel, keep in mind this film does deviate. Respect for the core product must always be maintained as much as possible. Not that this film is in anyway disrespectful at all and I'm certainly not suggesting that any film that deviates is wrong for doing so, but there has to be a really good reason for it. This is still an outstanding film regardless.<br/><br/>The way each character is handled is outstanding. It works as a film and doesn't lean solely on it's lead.<br/><br/>This has to be one of Ridley Scott's best efforts. The effects are outstanding. One of the issues with dramatic films is they can be grueling to sit through. Sometimes there is simply too much tension and it can turn a watcher off.<br/><br/>Not this film. It balances humor very well. The visual effects are outstanding and on par with even the best special effects film. A great film that deserves all the accolades it has received so far.

And I almost shed that happy tear when they announced ""We got him (Watney)...."". This was a human emotion drama with a sci-fi backdrop. Why do Americans take their movies so seriously? Or anyone for that matter? I in fact felt that certain places could have been injected with some more drama (e.g. people finding out Watney is still alive, etc.). Matt Damon was fantastic, and so was his rest of the crew. The people who played the NASA heads and all did a great job. This is a popcorn flick and it super entertains.

","Super-science is the name of the game in this drama regarding a Botanist who was left behind during a super storm on planet Mars in 2035. Astronaught Mark Watney wakes up after the dust settles and finds himself abandoned by the Aries III crew with no means of communication, a decreasing supply of food and water, and the harsh environment of the Mars surface on the outside of his surface pod. Watney drums up the courage to continue surviving despite bodily injury, starvation, dehydration, and several near death experiences.<br/><br/>The scope and scale of this movie is pretty amazing. So much so that it inspired one of those ""War of the Worlds"" moments in modern society. Several articles were published in American newspapers about movie goers who either believed they were watching a dramatization of real events or a documentary. Yes, some people actually believed we went to Mars because of this film, but that isn't the impressive part.<br/><br/>What i really enjoyed about this movie wasn't the acting to be honest. I really didn't find any moment where I felt Watney to be in any real danger, and you somehow always know he'll be okay. His confidence brings him a long way through this sci-fi drama, and of course I'm no scientist so it's hard to refute any of his survival techniques (seriously though... a plastic door and some duct tape?). Never the less, the thing that is by far the most outstanding achievement of this film, is the use of real organizations, technologies, and creating an amazing setting on the surface of mars. I couldn't believe how beautiful everything looked, and was constantly impressed with the effort this director took to make it somewhat believable. Enough to fool a few anyway.<br/><br/>An excellent weekend movie, and be prepared for a lot of Matt Damon screen time.

"maricelkarandang","7","1","3","6 February 2016"," It's an Action COMEDY Drama
","People ought to realize The Martian is an ACTION COMEDY DRAMA. The underlying plot of course sets the cliché stage for a very serious space drama, which most of these ""shit always goes wrong in outer space"" type movies gear towards. It's no coincidence this movie was released soon after the very serious and very dramatic (surprise!) ""shit went wrong -- again -- space movie"" Interstellar. The Martian is more likely poking total fun at the whole genre itself. <br/><br/>Most are well aware of Director Ridley Scott's ability to produce and direct incredibly dramatic and prolific films: Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Prometheus, and more recently Concussion, and so on. He also has an uncanny ability to produce comedic films such as The A-Team (2010). He's simply combined these two elements in The Martian. <br/><br/>Here's how...<br/><br/>Terrible acting? Of course! The use of A-List Academy award winning actors (Jessica Chastain - Zero Dark Thirty, Interstellar and Matt Damon - Saving Private Ryan, Good Will Hunting) who are obviously highly-skilled in the art, intentionally doing a horrendous job at that very art. Ironic, isn't it?<br/><br/>The use of excessive corny and inappropriate humor in the most dire of situations in order to ""psychologically survive our circumstances."" Scott just simply overdoes it.<br/><br/>The sheer cheesiness of the movie. From the illogical, irrational, and absurdity of events, to the lack of egoism in a very egotistical species -- the human species -- setting their own human needs aside without much consideration over the actual terrifying risks and consequences placed on themselves to save an individual with a slim-to-nothing chance of survival. That is to be optimistically assumed from people, right? This movie also satirizes The US's gung-ho Cowboy attitude. <br/><br/>Our ""friendly"" Communist international neighbors willingly providing The US billions of dollars worth of advanced technological weaponry without any hesitation and no political implications is very likely, correct?<br/><br/>The ""brilliant"" heads of NASA are played by the most comedic actors of our time: Kristen Wiig (SNL, Bridesmaids) and Jeff Daniels (Dumb & Dumber/To). You can never take these two seriously in any serious role -- seriously.<br/><br/>And the soundtrack of the entire movie is disco. Disco music plays throughout this so- called ""intense"" and ""dramatic"" movie. That's just hilarious. <br/><br/>And to everyone's surprise, ends in a very cliché way.<br/><br/>But it still is a very well-made and entertaining movie. Enjoy it and just don't take it too seriously."

The film poorly attempts to add plot twists -- monkey wrenches being thrown into survival plans. They come off very scripted and implausible. If you're a rational person, the film has plenty of ""Oh, give me a break!"" and ""Yeah right!"" moments.<br/><br/>All the characters are so scripted and cliché it's hard to look past. You have the character that wants to do everything by the book. The one that wants to do nothing by the book. The bureaucrat made to look like the bad guy for caring about public image.

Well, so i thought. But the thing is that there's so little emotion one cannot really connect to the characters. And because one cannot properly connect to the characters, one cannot feel a connection to the story as a whole either. And that's really sad facing the fact that it is, as stated previously, a beautiful piece with good acting and plot.<br/><br/>To summarize, this film was so close to becoming a masterpiece.

It simply is not possible to tell the story in 2 hours without cutting so much out that it can't create the back stories, emotions and the how and why. Best way to get this story is by audio book (from audible) and you after each hour will notice how making it a 10 part netflix series would have worked so much better. There are many natural cliffhangers, emotional ups and downs and moments that would have you think how would you react as the main person, the human population or the different people at nasa/gpl.

Matt Damon is perfect for his role and yes, it does seem odd to have a man of Nigerian background play an Indian (no matter how mixed his parents are) - but then, didn't Mickey Rooney once play an Japanese man and Marlon Brando a Mexican? Admittedly it's only a film, but plausibility is stretched to the limit plot-wise and the total package would be so much better if, at the end, he simply floated off into space.... But unfortunately such endings are not generally permitted in Hollywood these days - its a pity Mr Scott had not watched the ending of, say, Dennis Hopper's Out of the Blue (with Linda Manz) before making this film, in order to gauge the power of a negative close to a film."

","This one really makes me wonder about critic—apparently they're all crazy about this film. I think they're just crazy. This is a sub- ordinary triumph-of-the-human-spirit tale. Here's the plot: An astroteam about to leave Mars for home is beset by a storm so violent that it nearly destroys their rocket. Astronaut Mark Watney is believed killed by flying debris and his body blown away who knows where; the team must leave or die with him. Too late, it's learned that Mark has survived. How to bring him home? The Mars base has food and water for mere months, the next Mars mission is five years away, and the homebound team can't turn back. There ought to be drama by the long ton here, but there isn't. None. The visuals are often pretty good and sometimes better, but they have nothing to support.<br/><br/>There are two overwhelming problems. First, is the gripping space rescue of Apollo 13, which was in addition to the movie Real Life. 'The Martian' is not real life and it ain't real interesting, neither. In the face of Apollo 13, that, you need something better than a fairy tale. Second, this movie is grossly unrealistic. For example, the killer storm has barely scratched the team's base. OK, there's lots of dust and communications with earth are out, but everything else is tickety-boo: lots of tools, a truck with a crane, more solar panels than Solyndra ever dreamt of, yada, yada. Now Mark is a specialist--botanist, in fact--so we can accept that he figures out how to make water from chemicals and dirt from his own feces, and that he uses potatoes from his small food supply to grow a healthy and presumably organic crop. Problem solved! But this happens over and over and over; no challenge too great for our Mark. This botanist patches together a system so he can contact earth; digs up a plutonium- isotope canister to provide extra battery life; finds the escape module left by a previous mission and drives nearly 2000 miles to it in his souped up Mars truck. Does he ever fear? Despair? Give up? (He has no friends or family save his parents, who are mentioned in a throwaway paragraph.) Not our Mark. He just tackles and solves problems one after another, and there are so many of them that the problems themselves become a problem: they're mere busy-work. That is, none of them ever becomes truly critical; we always KNOW they'll be solved. When a second storm destroys his potato crop, Mark should be truly desperate and afraid, but he simply brings out the plastic tarp and duct tape (!!), utterly unfazed (and extremely unconvincing), as if he were assembling Legos. On earth it is not as it is in the heavens. NASA & Co. try to gin up some drama, but their problems too, just melt away. Actually, they're blown away by lots of Macho Management: ""But it'll take 6 months!"" ""You've got 3!"" And of course they do it in 3. When the rescue rocket blows up, here comes the Chinese Space Agency with a spare rocket in its pocket. Is there not enough time/fuel/whatever? Enter the team's most junior member; he has a whole new plan on his laptop! In space, where the original team HAS turned around to go back to Mars, there's more Macho Management: ""Just work the problem!""<br/><br/>OK, there is some drama when the rescue mission almost loses Mark at the last second, and when the whole business is broadcast live on Jumbotrons all over the entire world. But that's at the end. By then it's too late."
"penguinschu","6","1","3","31 December 2015"," A different experience than the book
","I enjoyed the book, The Martian a great deal. It was tense from the opening moment and never let up. It gave a clear and believable sense of what it might be like to be alone on a distant planet. Truly alone. The industriousness of Watney was clear from the outset and his character caused you to root for him. But more than anything, he was definitely alone. <br/><br/>The movie never gave us a true sense of his aloneness. Perhaps they felt it would be too hard for the masses to follow, or would appear too much like Gravity, but in the end the story lost its soul because of it. <br/><br/>There was no explanation of why the hatch blew in the movie leaving viewers with a sense only that something went wrong, but with no idea of the fact that it had weakened with unpredictable overuse. <br/><br/>The trip to Ares 4 was fabulously presented in the book with many challenges including a dust storm that was life threatening. Nothing in the movie resembled this, making his trip to Ares 4 seem easily attainable. <br/><br/>It was a fine movie, but whoever was in charge of the screenplay really did an injustice to the author of the story. <br/><br/>I would recommend the book for anyone who enjoyed this movie. It will feel familiar, but will also give you a new view of the situation."
"zampino-2","8","1","3","18 December 2015"," A fine future tale of survival, but a pales imitation of the book.
","Coincidentally I found Andy Weir's book ""The Martian"" without realizing that the movie was coming to the theater. So I read the book, which I truly enjoyed as a science-loving and sci-fi-loving enthusiast. In the book the main vehicle for Mark Watney's inner dialog was his journal, and the plot is propelled by his need to survive. The scientific explanations are credible and detailed, and his journey fraught with peril and struggle. It is a Jack London story of the (future) modern age, and for me one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a while.<br/><br/>Upon completing the book I went to the movies. Overall I give the rendering a good rating: Matt Damon is a good choice for Watney's character, and the cinematography and CG is mostly stunning. My caveat is that I had to augment the movie with the knowledge I had from the book to understand and enjoy it. In fact, I would advise anyone interested in the movie to read the book first to fill in the gaping holes in the plot that make the movie too much Hollywood styling and less science and survival.<br/><br/>A few key problems. In the book NASA and the other crew don't enter the story for a considerable amount of time. The sense of isolation and the need for Watney to survive dominates, and the reader's attraction to Watney quickly develops. In the movie the mix of situations breaks that isolation, so that we see Watney sometimes struggling, but never feel the danger or sense of time the book conveys. To fit the movie into a typical 2 hour format a great deal of the book had to be cut; I suspect Scott would have made a 4 hour movie if allowed, and I'm sure much was on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The worst of the cuts is the loss of Watney's journey to the Schiaparelli Crater. In the book Watney again loses contact with NASA, and must use his own ingenuity to survive. Again isolated, he solves problem after problem, including deducing and resolving a dust storm that would have made his journey impossible, and a horrible entry into the Schiaparelli Crater that nearly kills him. In the movie when he finally is rescued the crew cut away his suit to reveal a myriad of injuries that are never properly explained... unless you had read the book.<br/><br/>It's a pity to gloss over the foundation of the tone of the story, but I suppose it's understandable that a movie of this scale and with Hollywood money had to conform to convention. But it's a pale imitation of the book, albeit a beautiful feast for the eyes and a fine story of survival. Just nowhere near as impressive as the book. So go read the book!"

","May contain some light details that cannot be considered as real spoilers but they will be announced before you are going to read: <br/><br/>What I loved: Jessica Chastain Mars, the planet is well represented. It feels like Mars in the pictures from NASA's Curiosity Robot. You're there, far away from Earth. The colors, the quiet red world, the lack of humanity and the feeling of being isolated in a environment unfriendly for humans. <br/><br/>What I like: The main idea of the scenario and the fact that the story line was kept close to the frontier of reality and science-fiction. <br/><br/>What I dislike: While I appreciate slow pace in movies for character development and taking the time to focus on story details, this time it feels a bit empty. <br/><br/>(light details that could be considered as spoilers, AVOID READING NEXT if you really care about SMALL details) if not, you can continue, there is no real spoiler!!!<br/><br/>> > > > ><br/><br/>What I ""hate"" (hate is a strong word, take it as total disappointment):<br/><br/>The main character makes this story feels like a simple problem, not a big tragedy, the main character is too optimistic. Maybe this was done on purpose, in the original story, in the book (I didn't read it), but this takes away the level of drama and tragedy that this movie could have. Almost no suspense at all. It was presented as a comedy/drama/action movie on IMDb.<br/><br/>This is still a good story, but the main character doesn't feel worried as half as Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar or 1/3 as Sandra Bullock in Gravity. <br/><br/>7/10"
"stubeat","7","1","3","20 November 2015"," Great book, Average film
","When I first watched Gladiator, I remember thinking the film was pretty poor. It felt too much like it was trying to out-do Braveheart which preceded it by some 5 years. It felt over acted, over dramatic. This was a let down as I had big expectations for the film with Ridley Scott behind it however over time, the depth of the film shone through and now Gladiator is an undeniable classic.<br/><br/>So, having watched The Martian last night, I am contextualizing my disappointment in the same vein as the above. I am certain The Martian will grow better over time......unfortunately, for the first viewing I was disappointed. <br/><br/>Now, I have to admit to reading the book which was excellent. A build up of drama, tension, relentless adversity and then euphoria of success at the end. The film just missed the mark. Major plot lines were missing from the book....and yet, these were intrinsic to the build up towards the finale. In the film the trip to the MAV is like a relaxed Sunday drive to the shops. In the book, it's a terrifying endless mission against the odds, through dramatic storms, a crashed rover etc etc....why Ridley canned this part of the story I will never know. <br/><br/>Matt Damon was good and the cast were well balanced however, Sean Bean stuck out like a sore thumb. There's clearly a favor owed from Scott to Bean behind the story of him being given that role. It just didn't work. Jeff Daniels was excellent by the way.<br/><br/>I agree with some of the other comments on IMDb. The Martian missed the true isolation of Cast Away, it missed the drama of Apollo 13. It's scientific grounding was poor too with dramatic dust storms and tornadoes occurring in a martian atmosphere that's practically non existent and as for some reason, not too much concern about solar radiation either even though this would be a huge issue on the surface of mars. Small details.<br/><br/>For the scenery and high quality direction, the cast excl Bean and the expectation that I'll grow to enjoy the film more and more over time I rate this a generous 7."
"leeftr","5","1","3","24 October 2015"," Starts off promising but loses it to ""Gravity"" envy
","This movie starts off well. It handles the story of the botanist/astronaut stranded on Mars well, and Damon does a credible job. He is thoughtful and methodical in his approach to survival, and the movie avoids standard survival movie clichés.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the last 1/3 (after the resupply rocket blows up) is as annoying as the first 2/3 is good. The blatant pandering to Chinese censors is perhaps forgivable, as is the overall demographic pandering in the casting, but the idea that a team of highly disciplined and trained NASA astronauts would go off on a rogue mission to save a colleague is laughable, as is the dumbed-down demonstration of a gravitational slingshot by an eccentric young orbital mechanic.<br/><br/>By the time the cartoonish Gravity-imitating climax arrived (or did it remind me of the awful Bond space opera Moonraker?), I was shaking my head in disgust. All that preparation, and the astronauts needed to resort to sugar bombs and punctured spacesuits?<br/><br/>A disappointment."
"george_petrov02","7","1","3","24 October 2015"," Robinson Crusoe on Mars
","I'm no scientist but read somewhere that the density of Martian air is only 1 percent that of Earth. That means that even the most powerful storm on Mars won't lift a kite off the ground, let alone knock off heavy objects. Other than that, everything else looked believable.<br/><br/>The plot is full of some very intricate, attention grabbing twists and turns, in addition to the remarkable problem solving skills of those involved in the story. The jargon, the attitude, and the entire atmosphere convey a realistic feel for the action.<br/><br/>The only major complaint I have, besides the storm knocking off heavy objects, is that Watney spends more than a year on Mars, and he remains almost ludicrously optimistic throughout. He never really breaks down in despair, even during several moments where things go from bad to worse.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's not a masterpiece but it's definitely worth watching. It kind of reminds me of the 1964 movie Robinson Crusoe on Mars, minus the monkey."

","Astronaut Mark Watney is on Mars with his crew. After being injured during a powerful storm, his crew, thinking him dead, leaves him behind. Watney wakes up, and after removing the object lodged in his body, assesses the situation. His chances of survival are low, but he is determined to pull through against all odds.<br/><br/>I had heard a lot about how funny the film was, but I didn't find it THAT funny. Sure, there were some decent humorous lines, but I was a bit underwhelmed with them. Other people in my theater didn't seem to share my views, though. Donald Glover's character, Rich Purnell, seemed too over the top and out of place in the movie. Also, I thought more of the science should have been explained. At one point, Watney communicates with NASA through a camera pointing at signs in base 16. I understand base 16, but I didn't understand how the camera was being controlled to communicate with the numbers and letters. I wish the movie would have explained this better. Instead-- and maybe I'm wrong-- it seemed like it was glossed over because they assume no one really care HOW it works, just that it works. I had heard that the book contained a lot of clever science that was fully explained. I haven't read the book, so I don't know if that's true, but it still seemed like the movie could have used more science. Also, the movie's poster is pretty bad. It's just a close up of Matt Damon's phrase with the tagline ""Bring Him Home."" When I first heard of this movie, I didn't expect him to come home. I thought the movie would be darker and about him trying to survive knowing he can't. I'm not disappointed that it wasn't like that, but I don't think the poster should make it so obvious that he'll be rescued.<br/><br/>Thinking back on this movie, I think of it as less enjoyable than it really was. I'm not sure why, and watching clips of it, I remember how suspenseful and entertaining it was. Some awkward humor aside, I had a lot of fun watching this movie, but I still think it's being a bit overrated. It's being heralded as the best movie of the year, and I just don't think it has the greatness to make it a classic. For a comparison, I thought The Martian was more ""fun"" to watch than Ex Machina, but Ex Machina ended up having a more daring story.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I read this book 3 times, my wife never read it. I was interested in seeing the movie adaptation but a little worried that it would spoil the story (as movie adaptations often do) but quite the contrary, this was actually a very well done adaptation. Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it (she would rate it higher -I only gave it an 8 because of certain things I'd hope would be included, were not (no spoilers here.) -Let me say that the book was a bit overly detailed in areas to explain situations, but the movie did an excellent job of getting around it -is very entertaining and didn't have any ""dull"" spots. The movie is set in ""near future"" which makes it pretty easy to buy into the science and ideas (a nice change for a sci-fi movie). I will purchase this when it comes available on blu-ray.

I felt at point that the movie was very long, and unfortunately the theater I watched it at was very quiet. I can't wait to buy it on blu-ray when it comes out.

","First of all, I like Ridley Scott, I like Matt Damon, and I love space movies. I believe this movie was done well, as most Ridley Scott movies are, but I had a problem with the core point of this story. A wind storm that blows Mark Watney away to be left for dead. In reality, if this were to actually happen, he really would be dead, a 140 mph sand storm picks a man up and slings him hundreds of feet on a rocky planet. Using 2 miracles in the main plot at the beginning of the movie, I don't think so! This is a common fact about dust storms on Mars, 60 mph at best and in no way can break equipment or send an adult male flying through the air! Ridley knows this and could have found alternate reason for leaving a man to die on an uninhabited planet with no breathable air. I did like this movie though and there are other flaws, but, worth the watch. Many parts of this movie I did liked and the reason for the 7 rating."

As a Sci-fi genre lover myself, I have eagerly waited to watch The Martian likewise the other Sci-fi lovers.<br/><br/>The process from Andy Weir (the book) to Drew Goddard (screenplay) to Ridley Scott (the director), at the end, created expectations on watching huge blended new, cult sci-fi movie by the audience. In order, it maintained the martian life of Humanity, in such detailed way for the first time of Hollywood filming history, especially in these days of NASA's exploration of Mars by proving the new life sources could exist on the planet, guarantees the movie's attraction and its box office success. I found it watchable, as I mentioned before the popularity of the genre and the recent events happening on the real life Mars explorations in these days, firstly makes the movie ""a must watch"" even you don't like Sci-fi genre. In the other hand, a Sci-fi lover would never miss a Ridley Scott movie. Generally it was easy for ""The Martian"" to attract all the Sci-fi lovers and popular culture lovers, as it fulfills expectations of both scientific subjects and non-scientific Martian survival curiosity, as the audiences' catharsis on the survival, millions of miles away from earth, individually.<br/><br/>I have used the definition of ""watchable"" about the movie in the previous paragraph. The reason that I have used this definition at the first place is, I liked it with its distinctive and unique semiotic way rather than cult Sci-fi effects on me. Every one of Sci-fi lovers or an ordinary movie audience can find a place for them in the plot and make predictions about living on Mars according to the recent scientific discoveries made on there by Nasa.<br/><br/>Matt Damon as ""Mark Watney"" creates the empathy on the audience as we used to watch him in such other kinds of survival movies.So The choice of the protagonist, who is chosen to survive in outer space is applicable, I must say.<br/><br/>Besides the watchable and interesting plot, directing and acting, Some clichés oppressed me by the way. And just for these exaggerated stereotype scenes and dialogues, I can say it could be much better and become a cult like Scott's other Sci-fi movie ""Alien"" or Kubrick's ""2001: Space Oddysey"" for instance.<br/><br/>The main and biggest problem of Hollywood directors is the pressure on the directors to stay in the box of the mainstream with the producers worry of the box-office success. The amazing side of the plot, showing the audience that, by the Martian elements, humanity can create life sources with science and can create crops or sun-based energy to use vehicles, and other stuff, In the other hand a scientific Robinson Crusoe survival side of the plot. They are perfect. But I repeatedly saw some clichés, that caused to lose my appetite in some parts. For instance, the world's survival support to Mark Watney, with the cheerful screams, watching him on the big screens, the dominant and egoist Nasa headmaster Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) character who is not eager to rescue Mark because of the image and cursing worries, and the last scene that depicted Mark character as the retired superhero in spite of spending some cheerful time with his companions, were some of the scenes that I found a little bit Stereotype.<br/><br/>In addition to ""The Martian"" 's cons and pros, I observed the retro disco music idea was unique, as I am tired of listening to symphonic tones in the most of the Sci-fi movies, especially space exploration based ones."

The dynamics of the team on the mission are too perfect to be really believable and, for me, all the buddy-buddy, black-and-white, suits vs astronauts stuff is so by the numbers that it really annoyed. The structure of the plot is very procedural and it seems that Watney only needed to encounter each kind of problem once - when he had it solved then it never happened again despite all the equipment on Mars getting older and older and ... but I digress. There was also one too many scenes in which someone had a brainwave in relation to a problem and then walks away mumbling to themselves while someone else follows them saying ""What? What? What did you think of?"". In the end, I didn't care what happened to anyone. The movie didn't engage me in that way - sure it was interesting and nice to look at but it main message is that science shall save you if you work it. Science may be the new religion but fanaticism to anything is a blinding and dangerous thing. There are some people at whom this film is perfectly targeted but for many more this will be a good-looking and distracting work with little real satisfaction.

","'Hi, I'm Mark Watney and I'm still alive... obviously.' <br/><br/>Walking into the cinema... Can Ridley Scott redeem himself? This is looking good, but skepticism persists. <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 4.5 stars Cinematic rating: 4.5 stars Bigger questions rating: 4.5 stars <br/><br/>From the opening sequence, it is clear that Mars is a desolate and harsh environment. NASA has sent a manned mission to the red planet, but due to a dangerous storm that will threaten her crew, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) has to decide to leave the place they have temporarily called home. As they attempt to leave during the storm, one of her crew members, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), is hit by flying debris and thought to be dead. Lewis is left with the difficult choice of saving the rest of the crew or searching for Watney. Her choice is to sacrifice one for the sake of the crew and they leave Mars and Watney behind. The next day, the crew mourn their crewman without knowing that he had survived the storm. Back on Mars, the interstellar botanist has to come to terms with the challenges of being left alone on the lifeless planet with meagre food stores and no direct communication with his team or NASA. Through human ingenuity and the desire to survive, he must find a way to connect with the people who think he is dead with the hope of getting home to Earth. <br/><br/>Ridley Scott (Gladiator) is back in true form with The Martian and it is a reminder of this director's brilliance and what keeps his fans coming back with hopeful anticipation. This space journey incorporates whispers of past survival stories like Apollo 13, Gravity and Castaway, but Scott delivers a fresh perspective on this enduring genre. Whether it is on a remote island or in space, experiencing man's ability to survive and the lengths that their fellow humans will go to see these survivors saved is worth the price of admission. Scott manages to bring together a talent pool of actors that provide the right balance of believable performances and drama to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kristen Wiig and Chiwetel Ejiofor help to lead out a stellar cast that make for a perfect mix of characters, but ultimately, this is Matt Damon's film. His strength of character, unassuming intelligence and dry wit help to drive this story and keep it from turning into an arduous experience. The unwavering belief that he is a botanist and an astronaut provides the needed tenacity, brains and borderline arrogance to make his survival plausible. The trick for the director is to bring the audience along on the journey and make us believe Mark Watney is on Mars and providing enough hope that this space explorer can make it home. Scott manages to balance effective cinematography with a well- crafted script and the right support characters to make this unbelievable tale believable for the audience. <br/><br/>The difficulty in writing a review like this is trying to balance the review with potential drawbacks. The struggle is finding any. The Martian may not appeal to those who need excessive car chases or gun fights to keep their attention and the language is meant for mature audiences, but none of these elements weaken the overall entertainment value. This is an exceptionally compelling ride and should be on the must see list of anyone who enjoys good cinema. <br/><br/>The survival genre is ripe with points of conversation about the human condition. In a film like The Martian, the cost/benefit analysis of saving this one man's life does not make any sense. Saving this one man's life does not seem to justify the expense involved, but it shows how others are willing to risk their physical lives and livelihoods to bring Mark Watney home. Why? Some might say it is the sheer will to live, but it has to go deeper than that, because death is a natural part of life. The answer goes beyond being merely a learnt trait or evolutionary instinct. Mankind seems to be internally wired with a hope for the future. Hope for this life and even something beyond this life. The challenge is considering where this hope originates and how there can be any hope for the future. Is it in science or love of your fellow man or could it be in God?

"gheremond","8","7","67","3 October 2015"," Up there with Apollo 13 as one of the best space survival stories
","Ridley Scott is a brand name in science fiction and his latest The Martian turns out to be a wildly engaging, edge of your seat space adventure that even manages to differentiate itself significantly (and pleasantly) from his previous works.<br/><br/>The film doesn't waste any time establishing its story. Within less than 15 minutes we go through a mission abort that leads to the team of astronauts hastily leaving the red planet, with the protagonist left for dead and finding himself alone, struggling against apparently impossible odds as he tries to figure out how to stay alive until the next mission arrives. The pace is in fact so fast over this opening act that compounded by Wantey's no-nonsense, unsentimental stance towards his ordeal seems a little underwhelming (in terms of dramatic impact). But as things start to go south and unforeseen disasters snowball both on the terrestrial and martian front, the Martian quickly escalates into a thrilling, epic in scale tale of survival.<br/><br/>Contrary to what you might have picked up from trailers, this isn't a tale about Watney and his struggle for survival. There is a good deal of that too, but the movie opts for an Apollo 13-like approach, with several intertwined story lines running concurrently on Earth, space and Mars, as several teams try to find a way to put a rescue mission together before Watney's supplies run out. There is a large and great ensemble cast surrounding Matt Damon's main character that adds a lot to the movie. That being said, the choice comes at the expense of segments dealing with Watney's isolation on Mars and its psychological impact. This is more Apollo 13 than Cast Away in space. <br/><br/>Scott has opted here for realism and much of his martian sets feel like they popped out of some real NASA photo of the red planet. Many of the shots even have a nearly earth-like feel. As such, do not expect the grandeur of Prometheus in terms of production design. This is essentially thinking science fiction, with minimal bells and whistles. <br/><br/>The only (possible) drawback is the uniformly optimistic outlook. Scot is well known for tackling morally ambiguous themes and not shying away from the darker side of even his protagonists. Bur there are no shades of gray in the Martian. Space agencies unite for the common good, NASA administrators are all well-meaning, the geek-force always delivers, the astronauts are universally heroic. If you like this style of feel-good, Star Trek science fiction, you are going to love this movie. I know I did."
"gsygsy","6","9","94","25 September 2015"," technically excellent
","Ridley Scott has a great eye for fashioning self-contained worlds, evidenced in this movie by convincing depictions of both the confines of a spaceship and the vastness of a planet. <br/><br/>THE MARTIAN is solidly entertaining Hollywood fare. How much you enjoy it will be determined to a large extent on whether you're happy to pass a lot of time watching Matt Damon, who is at the centre of it. He's improved as an actor over the years. Pretty dismal in THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY, he was impressive in BEHIND THE CANDLEABRA, and has some fine moments here. The sheer size of the role might even attract an Oscar nomination. But there's something about him I don't get, a hollowness in him somewhere, a lack which doesn't exist in actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Leonardo DiCaprio, who fill the screen with sheer presence, just as De Niro and Pacino did before them, and Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Spencer Tracy...the list is long. Damon has his moments, more than he used to, but he's not in the same league.<br/><br/>Provided you can live with that, and some of the clunky dialogue, you'll have a good time with this technically excellent movie."

","WHEW! LET'S DO SOME F-----G SCIENCE.<br/><br/>The Martian comes to us from the legendary Ridley Scott, and you can believe what everyone is saying, this is his return to form. This is brilliantly entertaining science fiction that doesn't manage to get too far fetched, while keeping an emphasis on characters. Basically, this movie rocks.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is the man in this movie, and Mark Whatney is probably my favorite character of the year so far. He's the most likable guy on any planet, and you get so connected to him in all the right ways. The other standout is Chiwetel Ejiofor who's holding things down from the Earth side. Speaking of Earth, the scenes there were not boring or unnecessary at all. That's definitely one of the most difficult things to achieve in a movie like this, and the juxtaposition between planets was just so well balanced that you never wanted to just be in one of the two worlds.<br/><br/>My only complaint would be that it was a little too long. I feel as though there were a few spots that could have been trimmed, and the movie could've lost about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The Verdict:<br/><br/>The Martian is a brilliant adventure with a wide tonal range that doesn't bore in any spot. Matt Damon is fantastic, as well as the rest of the ensemble cast. A little long, but it won't bother you too much because the entertainment is non-stop.<br/><br/>— This movie is funny as hell too!"
"jordan2240","5","7","69","3 October 2015"," More focused on science than anything
","My feelings mirror much of what nemenemenes said below in his review. In terms of marooned characters, I felt comparatively little for Damon's here than I did for Hanks and Bullock in 'Castaway' and 'Gravity,' or for the astronauts in ""Apollo 13."" The only explanation I can think of for this is that absolutely no relationships were established for Damon's character prior to the isolation, so you had no point of reference for the type of person he was. You only knew he was smart.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the film is amazing. A huge amount of work and detail went into creating the sets and verbalizing the science (which most lay people would assume was accurate, but amazing even if fabricated), but that seemed to be where all the attention went. Frankly, I was bored with most of the film. One can only listen to someone spouting scientific formulas for so long before nodding off.<br/><br/>The film finally picked up for me in the final act, so to speak, but that wasn't worth the price of the ticket. And I don't think I would have missed anything by watching it in 2d either, as I didn't see a lot of 3d effects.<br/><br/>I actually feel bad for not liking the movie because of the tremendous amount of effort that went into making it, but unless I feel something for the characters in dramas such as this, even if it's negative, I'm generally left feeling disappointed."
"quincytheodore","9","7","69","2 October 2015"," A powerful, inspiring and possibly full of future awards story of Saving Matt Damon, in space!
","There's one common message on this year's cinematic experience: if you find yourself at hostile sci-fi world, see Charlize Theron (Furiosa) or Matt Damon for a lovely road trip. The Martian is an uplifting castaway tale on Mars. Brilliantly executed and acted, it's a triumphant story of a man surviving on his wit and sheer positive determination on live.<br/><br/>The saying ""he might as well be on the moon"" doesn't apply to Mark Watney (Matt Damon) as he's stranded on a world much farther. After a critical failure on space mission leaves him alone on Mars, he must overcome multitude of problems to keep himself and the hope of rescue alive.<br/><br/>For a desolated story, The Martian is incredibly inspiring. Much of it charm depends entirely on Matt's performance, his effort keeps the movie light and humorous even though tougher times linger just steps or miles away. It probably wouldn't have worked with lesser actor, not just with the dialogues but physical transformation. He brings strangely infectious joy instead of constant wallowing. The positive and identifiable attitude of his character will translate well to audience.<br/><br/>This is not only a solo mission since there's also perspectives of people working on our planet. The assembly of cast is very good. From Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels and many others, these personalities are highly memorable. They make the arduous and lengthy process of space travel into an engaging spectacle. While not everyone has contact with the solitary astronaut, they convincingly unite on the larger-than-life endeavor.<br/><br/>Visual is amazing. This is not the beast Gravity was, but when it gets going, it's utterly beautiful and also bizarrely captivating since Mars is a barren soil. At times it appears that Matt Damon walks across red desert which is so strange but still give the feeling that it probably exist somewhere. The amount of details on science is amazing, it feels like an inviting project or a trip audience could take with these characters. The bits of pop culture reference from comics or movies are icing of the frosty cake.<br/><br/>The Martian is what a movie should strive to be, an amazingly told story of men against their predicament. It's incredibly inspiring, highly enjoyable and simply unworldly."
"joeravioli","7","5","44","4 October 2015"," The Martian: Funny, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying
","The Martian, as a fantastic technical achievement that paints eerie, orange-soaked portraits of the bleak plains of Mars, is one hell of a film. There is many a shot that is breathtaking, inducing copious amounts of awe without resorting to visual exploitation. Scott takes a certain pride in being able to remove us from the theatre, placing us in a strange new world, that is not only lonely, but pristine and even beautiful. But what allows The Martian to go above and beyond your average planetary escapade is that it is not simply a technical achievement; it is well-written, intimate, and much more rewarding than I could have imagined.<br/><br/>The Martian begins as Mark Watney (Matt Damon), a NASA botanist, is lost in a massive dust storm. His crew, presuming him dead, leave the planet, leaving him stranded with no means of contacting them, or anyone for that matter. From there, the film is one big problem-solving session, as Watney does self-surgery, figures out how to grow food (which involves feces), and eventually figures out how to contact NASA, while dealing with setbacks, including disco music, explosions, and of course, despair. Damon is excellent as Watney, giving his character a charming, irresistible optimism, a sense of humour, and a clever resourcefulness, but while his wisecracking is the film's greatest asset, it also may be a weakness as well. Perhaps Goddard, or Weir for that matter could have allowed his character to touch a bit more substantially on existential matters, or even to show his obvious despair to the tiniest degree. But I suppose that there is a fine line between being emotionally superhuman, and a whiny slug, perhaps even too fine to pinpoint a reasonable middle. Despite this, Damon's character is inimitable and fun to watch.<br/><br/>NASA eventually figures out, to their consternation, that they have left an astronaut on Mars, sparking off a series of frantic grasping at whatever straws pop out of nowhere. The sequences on Earth are much less interesting than the ones on Mars, often characterized by space movie clichés. We are once again exposed to pleasantly familiar things, including the infamous control room, the boardrooms, the press conferences, the conservative CEO, the super smart (yet super skinny) dude who just happens to be the greatest genius the world has ever seen, international fervour, etc. However, just because they are clichéd does not mean that they aren't fun. Sure, sometimes you might find yourself rolling your eyes and saying ""Where the heck did originality in cinema go?"", but most of them are lively enough to allow you to forget that they are, in fact, standard space-film fare.<br/><br/>The Martian is at its best, and its most beautiful when it is actually on Mars, following the main character as he figures small things out, often to the exhilaration and laughter of the audience. But as I've said before, the loneliness that he must have felt on Mars is not addressed. The days turn into months, which turn into years, and he is barely even fazed by his lack of human interaction. A little bit of philosophy, or existential pondering would have remedied this, but I don't really mind.<br/><br/>What I did mind was the Deus Ex Machina. Everything seems to happen exactly at the right time, in the right place, and in the right proximity for it to be used to its full extent. There is a tremendous amount of luck pulling the strings in this film, and it makes the film feel rather artificial. However, the film's extraordinary premise needed the Deus Ex Machina to work, and considering the raw intensity and wonder of the ending, I believe that it did.<br/><br/>The ending of the film was one that I doubt that I will ever forget. It is such a pulse-pounding, gorgeous blend of wonder, intensity, and sheer awesomeness, that it has wedged itself firmly and unshakably in my mind. I will not spoil it, but I will say that it has one of the most beautiful shots that I have seen so far this year. Or the last year, as a matter of fact. Thus, I will say this: The Martian is a wonderful and harrowing piece of planetary cinema, bringing itself to the forefront of 2015 in cinema with an excellent performance by Matt Damon, astounding visual artistry from Scott, and a powerful, beautiful, and intense conclusion."
"luke-a-mcgowan","7","7","70","2 October 2015"," A stunning comeback to Ridley Scott, Damon heads up a stellar cast
","Don't you dare say this movie is a sequel to Interstellar. Don't you dare say it rode in on Interstellar's coat tails. This movie is so much better than Interstellar its not funny. Actually no, this movie is funny. But I'll get back to that.<br/><br/>This movie is about Matt Damon and boy did I love him in it. He carried all of the dramatic scenes and the lighter moments as well. I could easily have seen Mark Watney as a grown-up version of Will Hunting, and I do believe its Damon's finest work since that star-making film. I found him to be a believable and likable character to spend most of the film with.<br/><br/>Its taken me a while to get used to Ridley Scott, but I grew to love him after appreciating Thelma and Louise and American Gangster. The Martian is a terrific directorial achievement for Scott, who has been in dire need of a comeback film for some time. Just like Damon, he handles both the lighter and more dramatic moments very well and the film's pacing is almost flawless. I was surprised at how much of the story we got through in the first hour but I couldn't fault it. Similarly, when lamenting some of the changes from the book I sat there thinking ""if they did that scene though, it would feel out of place"". That's a rare way for me to feel, and Scott did a hell of a job. An unfortunate consequence of some of Watney's major obstacles in the book being removed is that the film as a whole is relatively uneventful, but again, Scott balances that by keying the drama in other scenes to a fever pitch. It compensates well. The film's climax is beautifully constructed, and if you didn't want to cheer at the film's conclusion you're either flat out lying to me or you're a snob.<br/><br/>This was one of my most anticipated casts of the year, featuring about four or five of my favourite actors. I said it was perfect casting and it pretty much was, with Daniels, Ejiofor, Chastain, Mara and Bean all delivering just as I had hoped they would. Chastain benefits from a built up character, whilst Bean's feels a bit watered down compared to his book counterpart. Again, the compensation works for the most part.<br/><br/>Drew Goddard's screenplay keeps a lot of the heart and wit and science from Andy Weir's novel, but a little too much of it got cut for me to call it perfect (especially the science!). There was also a noticeable chunk of time where we cut back to Watney on Mars and I thought ""wow, we haven't seen you in a while."" But Scott comes to Goddard's rescue with a couple of glorious scenes that didn't make it into the book - namely when an emaciated Watney covered in scabs emerges from the shower, a stark contrast to the bulky guy we saw strip down at the start. I also found a tacked on ending to be a bit schmaltzy, especially the resolution of Mara and Sebastian Stan's 4-second romance. That would've been the first thing on the chopping board if I'd adapted the book.<br/><br/>Technically - its a marvel. Sound, visuals - ace across the board. We all know Ridley Scott can do space, but boy, Ridley Scott can do SPACE! Move over Gravity, I just found my new favourite space tether scene! <br/><br/>I'm happy to report that The Martian is the best kind of adaptation. Its one that I can enjoy as its own entity. Sure it changes things, but it makes up for them elsewhere. Its more eventful than Gravity and less pretentious than Interstellar. Who'd have thought it would take Ridley Scott to get third time's the charm?"

","You can't really call this a sci-fi movie, since these events in it could actually happen, and may happen before the end of our lifetime. But the truth is The Martian isn't based on any true story yet--although I kept having to remind myself of that. Of course it would all be more impressive and meaningful if it were--like Apollo 13 for instance. It's this odd ""not quite sci-fi"" aspect that makes Ridley Scott's newest project a little different. It's easy to accept the different script beats when we're watching a film where we're encapsulated so much by the unique concept and universe, but when viewing something that COULD be real yet isn't, we may be likely to say to ourselves, ""Hmm, I wonder why the filmmakers chose to do that."" Not to say that The Martian is predictable, but it does lack a certain ""so crazy that it has to be true"" element--because it's not true, and it's really not crazy if you think about what we could accomplish in the next 50 years or less.<br/><br/>The Martian is a film about a manned Mars mission where a series of events lead 5 crew members to believe that their sixth member (Matt Damon) is indeed dead. They leave him behind and head home. Meanwhile, NASA discovers that Damon's character, Mark Whatney, is actually alive, but they can't afford for his crew to turn around and get him because they wouldn't have enough resources to elongate the trip.<br/><br/>It's a star-studded cast featuring, alongside Damon, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, et al. The acting is terrific, and on a technical level this film is nearly perfect.<br/><br/>It may not take enough risks for some of the more macabre members of the audience, but it never bothers me as it's refreshing to get some representation of yesteryear in film. It's pretty Spielberg-esque in the sense that it's not very dark and nothing truly unpredictable happens--since, really, we haven't enough knowledge in order to predict what would happen. It's a subject that not many laypersons know about. But (spoiler alert) there aren't any surprise alien encounters or anything like that. Given the limited information we have, we can foresee certain possibilities ahead of time. But The Martian is such a unique film that we love every minute of it. We live so vicariously through Damon's character that it makes the journey feel so much more real.<br/><br/>Some of the banter between scientists becomes pretty heavy, but I applaud it for making the situations understandable without dumbing it down.<br/><br/>It's just a pleasing film to watch and has a classic cinema quality to it. It's a little long at nearly 2 and a half hours, but it never seems to drag, and the length serves to emphasize the perenniality of Whatney's marooning.<br/><br/>It's one of the best films of the year, and one of the most well done movies you'll see in recent years. It will be hard to find someone who doesn't recommend this one.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 100"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","3","22","6 October 2015"," A smart, exciting adventure
","There can't be any greater story device then that of basic survival. One character battles against the elements as their life hangs by the slender thread solely dependent on their own ingenuity and wit. That's the crux of Ridley Scott's adaptation of The Martian, a bold and exhilarating red-blooded adventure about a man, trapped on the Martian surface 143,000,000 miles from home who must use every resource he has to keep himself alive until somebody comes to pick him up. It's bold, it's fun, it's smart, it's ingenious, and it contains the only montage I've ever seen of a man scrapping a space capsule while ABBA's ""Waterloo"" plays on the soundtrack. The Martian tells a story that is simplistic but not simple-minded: Ares III, a manned mission to Mars finds themselves overwhelmed by a nasty rock storm that forces the crew to evacuate. In the chaos one crew member is lost and presumed dead. Of course, he hasn't. As the crew head for home, our hero Mark Whatley (Matt Damon) wakes up on the planet's surface with his oxygen depleted, and a piece of the antenna sticking out of his abdomen. <br/><br/>Shades of Cast Away, Mark discovers that he is the only man on Mars and not only must figure out a way to survive but must also figure out a rational reason to keep talking (Tom Hanks had a volleyball, Damon has easier device of talking to his video log). He moves into the crew's abandoned man-made habitat where he calculates how much food, water and air he will have to sustain himself for the next four years until Ares III, the next Mars mission, arrives on the planet's surface. Mark discovers that he has enough food and water for a few weeks, and ascertains that he must figure a way to grow more. But how is he going to plant a garden on a dry planet with no air. This solution is inspired. Plus – good news kids – He's a botanist!<br/><br/>Much of the movie is taken up with Mark's adventure in pure survival not only from the hostile environment, but also from the maddening fact that the only music left behind is Disco (That's why the ABBA song). Step by step, piece by piece we're with him as he carves out a tiny civilization for himself on a planet that is dead-set against it. The script by Drew Goddard keeps things movie and always ups that stakes. The irony, of course, is that while Mark is forced to close himself up inside the tiny habitat, outside are the wide open spaces of the Martian landscape. The cinematography here is breathtaking, showing us the vastness of the Martian landscapes which look so beautiful and yet so lonely at the same time.<br/><br/>Of course, that's not the whole story. There are two other parts to this movie. One takes place on the ground as the crew at NASA gets a cryptic message from Mark that he is alive and well. Then – shades of Apollo 13 – they must put their collective heads together to figure out how to retrieve their man from 140,000,000 miles away over the next four years. Again, none of this is ever dull or uninteresting. We get the pure joy of watching smart people coming up with smart solutions. <br/><br/>The other part takes place aboard the returning ship – the one that left Mark behind. We are privy to the crew – led by Jessica Chastain – as they must figure out how they are going to be able to turn the ship around and go back and get him. Of course, that means another four years onboard the ship, plus how are they going to retrieve him when they get there? Everything, in all three parts of this story is based on surgical timing. If one thing goes wrong, the crew could be lost, Mark could be dead and the whole thing could become an international fiasco back home. <br/><br/>All of this, of course, leads up to a third act that – while predictable – has you on the edge of your seat. It's rare in these days when most movies go on automatic pilot in the third act that we are just as exhilarated by the third act as we were by the first or the second. <br/><br/>What an exhilarating movie this is. What fun it is to watch smart people trying to figure out a nearly impossible task. It's rare that a movie of this size – and it is a big movie – can keep us so totally involved in what is going on at every single second. Like Gravity and Apollo 13, this is a movie about a dangerous situation that has us riveted at every single moment. We know the ending but we're not sure how the movie is going to get there. This is one of the best movies of the year."

The humor was well delivered and keeps the plot lighthearted despite the difficult circumstances a lone man finds himself in on the harsh environment of Mars. The cinematic work was gorgeous, the large empty expanse of the red planet played well on the 3D big screen. Mackenzie Davis look beautiful and Donald Glover was hilarious in their small supporting parts, but the main performances that carried this film were Chiwetel Ejiofor and Matt Damon.

The cast was as diverse as Hollywood would allow it and had great chemistry. Matt Damon was captivating and endearing. What stood out the most though, was the story.

","Never have I grown bored with science fiction works that borrow the theme of technologies to highlight the human conditions. Several dilemmas, personal encounters are brought up during the film.<br/><br/>Addressing the dilemmas, I find them essential in bringing home the humanitarian values of the movie. The captain's decision to leave Mars without Mark eats into her soul, a pivotal detail to predispose her to the doggedness to rescue him. The reluctance to reveal to the crew members the survival of Mark heightens tensions. Numerous other minor dilemmas take place, such as whether to employ the crew to continue the rescue mission or seek help from China to send supply. However, since they are resolved quite decisively in the film, I don't feel the need to shed any particular light on them.<br/><br/>The key plot of the film is the human's encounter with nature. His intelligence and expertise have proved useful in keeping him alive, apart from the assistance of the most knowledgeable minds from NASA. It is in fact pathetic to witness Mark literally keep himself sane by remain contact with whatever still deemed as possessing a connection with human beings: disco music, taking selfies, making jokes and fun of the NASA land unit.<br/><br/>I still, though, think that The Martian could have been more dynamic. Watching this reminisces me of Gravity, which authentically depicts the torment and resilience of a female astronaut lost in space. The portrayal of Mark is capped, due to the use of humour that is meant to alleviate the tension, but inadvertently render the story less of a tragedy. Had it been more tragic, the human conditions would have more room to manifest and be illustrated."

","Are you ready for a feel good movie about being left to die on Mars - well ""The Matian"" could be it! (could be a couple of spoilers if there's anyone left who has not already seen this one). This offers all the fun of being left out in the frozen night - then waking up next morning totally ALONE on Mars. Our astronaut (Matt Damon) has been speared in the gut and surviving in a space suit that has a hole punched in it. After some initial grueling pain we surprisingly find Matt doesn't really seem to mind all that much.<br/><br/>Nice images, good locations, some good original score music (in between the compulsory hit-parade-chart-toppers designed for the sales promo sound-track album), then along come those assorted characters from the central casting stereo-types catalog - you know them all from just about every other big budget crowd pleaser over the past 25 years. The stony, super cool NASA chief ~ super smart female space craft commanders who show little fear or sign of human concern - simply reduced to 'gung ho' utterings like: ""OK lets go get our boy""! ~ Chinese scientists willing to give away billions of dollars and years of ""Top Secret"" equipment and information - all just to get a nice outcome for this lone U.S. astronaut ~ understanding wives and children who smilingly wish their life partners well - after being told they've voted to put their lives on the line for a one in a thousand mission. Not enough for you? - there are many others to be found but go see for yourself.<br/><br/>It's beginning to seem like NASA is being reduced to product placement in space. Even the the 55yr old poorly named: ""Robinson Caruso On Mars"" fared a little better in the human psychological stakes. 'The Martian' is really just another typical Ridley Scott movie so if you enjoy those, then none of the above will concern you - now I understand why it ended up on general cable less than a year after its Cinema release. While some of its two hrs plus is watchable, those that are lovers of fantastic big budget space adventures will actually enjoy it all but, if that's not you - then blast off with caution...oh, further warning: you may also need to dodge all those awards that were thrown at this offering."

","Matt Damon is an astronaut working with a team on Mars. A change in weather threatens danger and means the astronauts have to leave immediately. A freak accident leaves Matt Damon's character, Mark Whitney, for dead while the others manage to escape and start their trip back to Earth. Waking up a little battered and bruised Whitney has to survive and find a way of communicating with Nasa in order to get help back home. The film documents how he manages to survive on the baron red planet and Nasa's attempts to mount a rescue. In a nutshell this is Robinson Crusoe on Mars. This is a decent film but isn't the most thrilling or exciting. Thankfully, rather than just follow Damon from start to finish the film is cut up with activities on Earth and events that are unfolding. This makes it easier to follow and breaks up what could be a boring film. The script/ narrative seems to talk to it's audience likes it knows nothing about space so it works for all levels of knowledge within the space-film genre. The cast did a good job although I didn't feel that compelled to like them that much. There is a little intensity, a little drama, also a little light humour, but I kind of felt that something was missing - maybe my expectations were too high but this felt like a very easy film to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, but by no means a epic blockbuster. I'm awarding this 6 out of 10, I think this was OK, but it could have been a lot better. FTR the soundtrack on the film was brilliant and that earned it a bump up from a 5 star review."

","Ridley Scott is a fantastic director. I was expecting a fantastic film. He has shown his prowess in the science fiction genre before, from his brilliant ""Alien"" series to his seminal classic ""Blade Runner"". I was expecting something special with a ""Castaway"" feel to the film. I was sorely mistaken. The cinematography was great and Matt Damon did his best, but in terms of characterization there was little for him to work with. Unlike ""Castaway"", there was hardly any tension in the film. I felt the silly dialogue dampened the more serious scenes in the film, making those moments quite unconvincing. When there's a plot that follows a stranded astronaut, the movie has a lot of room for intensity and psychological battles. That was why I loved ""Castaway"", and why I was excited for ""The Martian"", hoping it would have similar themes and problems for the protagonist. That was not to be. I was expecting a unique, intense, and fresh sci fi movie. Instead I got something that was at times funny, but still unconvincing. With its thin characterization, cheesy and often silly dialogue, this proved to be a mildly entertaining sci fi movie with little intensity and little substance."

","Ridley Scott and Matt Damon combine to make a wonderful movie about survival and man's appetite for life. Nick Watney (Damon) is presumed dead and left stranded on Mars. With insufficient supplies he has to use his knowledge and ingenuity to survive until a rescue mission can try to save him. <br/><br/>Ridley Scott has a reputation as a director more concerned with visuals than character. The Martian is a beautiful film to watch. The landscapes are mightily impressive, and the special effects entirely convincing. However, Scott disproves his false reputation, allowing Nick Watney to take centre stage. Damon gives a performance full of warmth and humour, about a man for whom such traits are an important part of his fight for survival. His ability to take one small step at a time and bounce back from adversity is what saves him. Damon and Scott bring Watney very much to life and imbue the film with the central characters warmth and wit, giving us a hugely entertaining film packed with humanity.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is truly superb in the title role but he is ably assisted by a wonderful supporting cast including Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. However, it's Damon's film. He is better able to win an audience's support and trust in a role than any other film star today. We like him, we root for him, and we care for him. <br/><br/>Possibly the best film of 2015 and worth a couple of hours of anyone's time. Unmissable."

","There are no magical aliens, no farcical wormholes to other dimensions, no hocus pocus. The Martian proves that real, hard science fiction does not need smoke and mirrors. Real science is dramatic enough without fantasy plot devices. Interstellar couldn't drive its plot without magical trans-dimensional beings and their giant cube of bedrooms. Prometheus needed killer aliens who navigate with magic flutes. Mission to Mars was going along fine until it resorted to a 20-foot-tall space lady hologram living inside a giant face. The Martian drives a killer plot without any of these lame devices. The Martian proves that science is a vast resource of plot and drama that more writers should explore.

I've never been so invested into a story and I have never cared so much about a character completing his journey.

","I don't know what it is, but Ridley Scott makes films that you can just watch again, and again, and again. And The Martian is one of those films. I really can watch this film all the way through, go back to the start, and start watching again!<br/><br/>I think what works for me, is that it's so believable, and so well played by Matt Damon. The special effects and scenery are so good, it's worth watching just to get a real idea what it would be like on Mars. There are some amazing long scenery shots, and while planetary scientists may argue aren't 100% accurate, they're still very pleasing to the eye non the less.<br/><br/>The actual story is fantastic, and despite the film being rather long with a somewhat pedestrian pace here and there, that doesn't make it dull. In fact the slower parts are welcome, as they give you a chance to take in everything that has and is happening, and just immerse yourself in the film. There are of course some fast past action parts, and these are very tense.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film that should be enjoyed by all. I'm so glad I went to the Cinema to watch it, as the scenery on Mars can only be truly appreciated on a large screen."

","Matt Damen provided a great balance of clever humour and scientific fact. I was afraid that this movie would be depressing, due to the nature of being stuck in a desolate and hostile environment for so long, however Damen managed to keep the mood serious without crossing the line into stressing out the audience. The amount of failure and hurdles that Damen experienced in the move was reflective of how science actually happens. The fact that Damen's struggles often happened on screen is something that provides a sort of realism that is lacking in most sci-fi movies. Hopefully the industry will take note from the success of The Martian and make an effort to craft more realistic portrayals of the scientific process in the future. If I had kids, this would be the exact type of movie that I would want them to see."

I seriously loved this movie,the performances are all very great,especially Matt Damon who gives the performance of a lifetime.He seems very much committed to the role and he is full of emotion that equals to a great and Oscar-worthy performance. Ridley Scott does an incredible job here with the way that he decides to take on the story and also the ending is just brilliant and very well directed. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams is also very haunting and memorable but what stands out the most here is the incredibly amazing cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. The Mars scenes look great and they just feel real,them mixed with the very good visual effects just make for the perfect once in a lifetime experience.

","""The Martian"" has to be the first comedy survival film about a human being stranded on Mars, and I certainly hope it will be the last. Not that the Ridley Scott epic is bad, but, contrarily, it is so good it would effortlessly put to shame any movie that tried to follow in its footsteps. ""The Martian"" is almost perfect throughout, thanks to flawless performances on (literally) every cylinder, unparalleled directing, and a rhythmic tone that doesn't hit one false note.<br/><br/>Matt Damon carries the movie with charm, wit, and an optimistic sense of humor that assists him in his survival. Jeff Daniels delivers an exceptional performance as NASA director Sanders that has to make the hardest decisions regarding a rescue operation for Mark Wattney (Matt Damon), after his crew, Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Rick Martinez (Michael Pena), and Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), leave him alone on Mars after presuming he died in the midst of a storm. Director Sanders announces Wattney's death to the world, while Mark Wattney calmly but urgently attempts to contact NASA to inform them he's still alive. Sanders resists from telling Wattney's crew that he's still alive, knowing that Commander Lewis would blame herself for leaving him on Mars, but using the petty excuse that ""they need to focus on their mission.""<br/><br/>How Drew Goddard and Andy Weir managed to turn a desperate survival mission into a heartfelt, exciting, just plain fun story puzzles me, but manage they did. What's even more remarkable is the fact that ""The Martian"" is, well, based on facts, proving to be scientifically sound no matter how unbelievable it is. ""The Martian"" is a work of art, a rare gem, an original, creative piece that will go down in history and become remembered as one of the best-made cinematic masterpieces ever.<br/><br/>98/100"
"nmholland","9","1","4","16 February 2016"," Accurate Nomination For Best Picture
","The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney, the astronaut that accidentally is stranded by his team on Mars. The story follows Mark as he struggles to survive on the barren planet, and his crew as they try to rescue him. Now, Ridley Scott has made some good films, such as Gladiator, Alien, and Blade Runner. Now he's made another one. The Martian is easily one of the best films of 2015, up there with The Revenant and Fury Road. Whether or not it deserves best picture is another topic, but I'll get to that soon.<br/><br/>To start, the directing is very good. Ridley Scott always takes nice, wide takes of action, or just to show the epicness of this movie; epic meaning grand scale. That also leads to the cinematography being good. Although Mars is a barren, desert planet, the cinematography somehow makes it look beautiful, especially in far off shots of the vehicle or the base.<br/><br/>The acting is also very good. Other than Matt Damon, there are a lot of other good actors in this movie. Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, and Sean Bean are also in this film, and they do really well. Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain have pretty good on screen chemistry, and their conversations and banter really work for the movie.<br/><br/>Another great thing about the film is how hard the movie beats down Mark Watney. Every time he has things going his way, something happens to knock him back down, and the audience really begins to feel bad for him. This is common throughout all ""stranded"" films, such as Cast Away, Gravity, or 127 Hours. However, being on a completely different planet - and one humans haven't visited yet - really adds to the theme of the film, which is how a man would handle a situation such as this when all he has is his wit and his will.<br/><br/>The above paragraph actually leads me into my main negative, which is storytelling. Throughout every film, the audience has to figure out what's currently going on, or ""what's the plan."" In a good movie, they learn from things occurring, but this film straight up tells you. Every time Watney is making little videos recapping the Martian day, or ""Sol,"" he tells the audience up front what's happening. We don't have to figure it out, he just lets us know. This is my biggest problem with the film, which disappointed me due to how great the rest of the film was.<br/><br/>Overall, the Martian is a great movie with very few problems. I think The Martian deserves an A-, or a 9 out of 10."

Yes if you look for errors you will find them & some of them are silly it's true, it would seem these clever folk simply cannot over look them (yet most movies have them)<br/><br/>It's been said by one reviewer that... Mark Watney (Matt Damon's character) was missing emotion...what now? and that he NEVER displayed any signs of loneliness, despair or fear? Wow! were we watching the same film? sometimes it's rather subtle and clever, then there's the big moments of emotion...come on where were you! when Watney first contacts mission control, when he hears his crew mates for the first time in months (an actual human voice after ALL that time) and then upon the reality that he might actually just make it (after all he's gone through) <br/><br/>MATT DAMON is quiet simply SUPERB.<br/><br/>It's also been said that his character is flat... NOPE, he's an Astronaut Botanist so what did you expect? and he's stuck on Mars presumed dead with all these problems around him, this particular reviewer even mentions that Mr Damon's role in ""Interstellar"" was more credible, now don't get me wrong I LOVED Interstellar (these Science geeks won't) but Matt's character in that one is one I could have done without, it did affect the story but in what seemed to be a convoluted way.<br/><br/>Scores of 10 or 9 for ""THE MARTIAN"" I can understand (it's a 9 for me)so too an 8 or even a 7 but anything less than this I can not understand.<br/><br/>My advice ""DON'T GET TOO BOGGED DOWN by THE SCIENCE"" just sit back and enjoy the shear spectacle of it all.<br/><br/>Yes the science bit is an interesting part of the film and they do get things wrong (yes we breath out CO2 not Oxygen and yes surely on a mission like this there would have been a 2nd back up to contact NASA) but this is the movies, it's NOT Rocket Science, although some here would have you think it so...deduct a few points maybe for these errors but 6 to 9 points (and scoring this a 1 is just troll reviewing!)<br/><br/>The current AVERAGE SCORE of 8.1 is not too far off.<br/><br/>An expertly CRAFTED & DIRECTED Film with WONDERFUL Acting, it has a FUN and ENGAGING Script and should leave most HAPPY.<br/><br/>The 3D is Breath taking.<br/><br/>For me it would Win The Oscar for BEST FILM, DIRECTOR & ACTOR (2016)"
"Filvies144","8","1","4","13 February 2016"," Nice job Oscars for nominating this!
","Yep, this film is rated just fine. It's like Cast away(2000) combined with the previous space blockbuster Interstellar(2014). But how good is it in my opinion.<br/><br/>Like we see in the trailers, Astronout Mark Watney cannot be saved from a storm on Mars as his crew has no choice but to leave. But Mark Watney survives but Earth figures this out and brainstorms how to get him back to Earth. There is no antagonist, but a very simple plot. It's enjoyable most of the time, but one problem with it is that the Earth sub-plot starts out interesting, but becomes a bunch of very boring talk that no one, no one wants to listen to. I was just thinking, move on to Mark Watney. The scenes with Mark Watney are the best scenes in the movie. As Watney would say, ""So yeah, Surprise!"".<br/><br/>The special effects are a piece of art. They are just brilliant and they don't over load s much as the Marvel films. There are no flaws. It makes you feel like you are in Mars or NASA. Just incredible.<br/><br/>The characters in this film. Mark Watney swears up a storm on Mars (Get it?) and learns to survive on Mars. He is a very smart character, is sometimes funny, and a little inspiring too. The crew that traveled to Mars with Watney are blamed for the problem, but they are not antagonists because they had to leave him for huge safety reasons, but are still great characters. Most of the rest of the characters are helpful, but I should say, bland.<br/><br/>So overall, the Martian is a treat and deserves it's Oscar nominations, including best picture of the year. So go watch it. No seriously, I recommend it. Rated PG-13 for language, Frightening scenes, and violence (well, I didn't mean little kids).<br/><br/>So overall, the Martian is a true treat"
"tomsview","7","1","4","11 February 2016"," In whose face?
","When Matt Damon's character utters the words, ""In your face Neil Armstrong"", I immediately thought, ""Whoa, hold it right there""; ""The Martian"" just broke the fourth wall.<br/><br/>I couldn't get over the sudden flash that Matt Damon was an actor on a sound stage, who was probably waiting for the lunch break where a team of caterers would have prepared a meal to the star's explicit dietary instructions. Neil Armstrong on the other hand, was a man who put it all on the line to land a flimsy spacecraft 240,000 miles away on the surface of the moon. He was one of a band of extraordinary men who really did what this movie pretends to do.<br/><br/>Maybe it was the script, but someone should have questioned the reference; it just comes down to a simple matter of respect.<br/><br/>That aside, ""The Martian"" has a fascinating premise: after being accidentally left behind on Mars, a lone survivor, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), uses his ingenuity to survive until rescued in a desperate mission. However, I feel the film has a sterile edge it didn't need to have.<br/><br/>The movie it most reminded me of was Robert Zemeckis' ""Castaway"" where Tom Hanks' character, Chuck Noland, also scienced the sh*t out of his environment when he was stranded on an uninhabited island in the Pacific. The big difference, other than being set on different planets, is that ""Castaway"" has more heart. Chuck Noland has a back-story that eventually leads to scenes of reunion and parting that are heartbreaking. Also, look at the power of the scenes in ""Interstellar"" when Matthew McConaughey's character interacts with his family when he is light years away in space.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" is more all business with some rather forced one-liners. There is slickness to the whole thing that works against emotion. Watney has little back-story other than one reference to his parents. He is such an insular guy he may as well have been a replicant.<br/><br/>But the film has interesting detail, great special effects and it does have tension. If the film has a heart it's actually in the scenes of the crew on the Hermes and back at NASA as they try to figure out how to rescue Watney – scenes that owe more than a little to Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"".<br/><br/>The rescue at the end packs a punch. However I still feel the film could have hit harder than it does. Although it's a return to form for Ridley Scott, it's more brittle than movies such as ""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiator"" or the underrated ""Kingdom of Heaven"". At the very least, it might help erase memories of ""The Counselor""."

I'll start with the good stuff, the storyline. even if it is a bit cliché, it's of a man stranded on Mars having to go through a constant struggle to survive. Before the crew that left him behind come back and save him, putting everyone at risk. the landscapes of Mars and the ship (Hermes) are very good but nothing breathtaking about them like in Gravity.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film, is the average acting and the terrible dialogue. I suppose when you look through the cast its hardly surprising. Their are few who I'd consider to be at the top of their profession and this shows. Having said that the scripting is appalling, you never get the feeling this is a real and dangerous situation just feels like a bunch of Hollywood stars having a jolly. Every character is underdeveloped and most of the cast are just there to spoon feed us some of Damon's problems and how he'll solve them. (I'm not joking this film assumes we're all 10 years old).<br/><br/>Overall this film excels at nothing! There are better films for every aspect of it and even the best aspect of this film the landscapes comes no where near that of Gravity."

","Watched this on a plane, had heard great things about it and figured it would be an entertaining 2.5 hours on my flight. It was okay, but i'm not sure where all the hype is coming from. Matt Damon puts in a good but not great performance. And the plot is pretty predictable without any particularly exciting moments. The whole time i just was thinking ""meh"". <br/><br/>But the movie did manage to consistently annoy me with its subtle misogyny. How? First, the basic premise of a man getting trapped on a planet and quickly figuring out his way to survive, all the while narrating his amazing accomplishments to the audience. All Matt Damon does is narrate his smartness. It is basically 2 hours of Matt Damon mansplaining Mars. Annoying because this movie would literally never be made with a female lead because the world could not fathom a woman lecturing the audience that long. Second annoyance was that, with the exception of Kate Mara, there was not a woman in this movie who said a line without looking at a male character for reassurance or confirmation that she was making the right decision. I didn't notice it for the first 30 minutes, and then once i noticed it, it became like a drinking game. Kristin Wiig, Jessica Chastain, the blond woman who works at NASA. Seriously, they don't do a single thing in this movie except look at the men to see what they think. Other than a handful of exceptions, the men in the movie never do this. It was both comical and infuriating to watch. Argh."

","I honestly don't understand why this movie has such a high rating on IMDb at the moment – there is nothing outstanding about it at all.<br/><br/>Plot is primitive and predictable (one character says: 'but something could go wrong!' and in 10 seconds something wrong happens). There is no tension whatsoever even at the roughest moments of the movie – jokes keep flying around. The main character is obviously not afraid of anything and not going nuts because of social deprivation. Moreover, main character somehow carries expert knowledge beyond his competency (botany), beyond the job he was hired for. <br/><br/>There is not a single convincing character in the movie. Mars team looks like 'Avengers' – everybody is equally young and handsome, kind and brave, ready to lose their lives and jobs for abandoned colleague. Earth team makes jokes every opportunity – obviously they are not stressed at all. China joins for no reason at all (some old important Chinese guy decided to help an American astronaut, really?)<br/><br/>I would forgive the weakness of the story if the FX was amazing but it's not.

It is a fantastic science fiction film supported by amazing special effects and graphics.

Its filled with made up solution and problems but they feel real. They feel problematic and even though some problems might be solved in very stupid/lucky ways. Most of the problems have a scientific and honestly, satisfying explanation. They don't take the time to go into the science too much but they are still very respectful too it. Everything seems very well thought about and every small detail is put in. The main feeling I had in this movie was, If this actually happened. This might be the solution. Familiar solutions to introduced problems that are not way too over the top and when they are explained in a way that makes you realize they just don't put big words and complexity just so you will loose the loop and don't care if its real anymore just because ""yeah well, they said something about a hypersonic transistor, thats going to solve it probably.""

","As a person who is not really a Sci-Fi fan, I must say I'm highly impressed with this movie. It actually gave me another perception, rather than dealing with Space objects, forces, etc. which has been seen many times in ""Space movies"". The introduction of stationary survival mode, which is ensuring food and water supply (roughly) makes you think in whole new direction. How to fight with literally nothing around you? How to get yourself quickly back on feet and pull yourself together? Sounds a bit tough, doesn't it? To sum up, just like Interstellar, this is incomparable with other Sci- Fi movies. Completely unpredictable outcome, a lot of ups and downs, twists and turns, makes your heart beat a bit faster than usual. So for me, it's a 9, almost a 10, because I still think some parts wouldn't be so possible or luckily completed, but I guess it's just my pessimism (or ignorance) speaking!"

"CinemaClown","Null","1","4","1 December 2015"," Following Into The Footsteps Of Gravity & Interstellar, The Martian Is The Space Expedition Of 2015
","A fascinating blend of science, action, adventure, drama, suspense & humour, The Martian is a deeply informative, thoroughly engrossing & highly amusing sci-fi epic that follows into the footsteps of Gravity & Interstellar to succeed as the space expedition of 2015 and also marks a welcome return to form for director Ridley Scott, who had been going through a rough patch in recent years.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name, the story of The Martian is set in the near future and tells the story of Mark Watney; a botanist & member of the Mars manned mission crew who finds himself left alone on the red planet after separating from his crewmates during a fierce dust storm. With limited supplies, he has no choice but to science the sh*t out of everything in oder to send a signal back to Earth and stay alive till someone gets there to rescue him.<br/><br/>Directed by Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner & Gladiator), The Martian makes heavy use of all his trademarks and is a far better project that he's undertaken for the story is packs in is more promising than his previous few assignments. Drew Goddard's screenplay intercuts 3 story lines, brilliantly handles the arc of its lead character, and makes fab use of wit as even its bleak moments gleam with optimism, which is refreshing to watch coz it's rarely present in films dealing with similar scenarios.<br/><br/>There's considerable effort involved in The Martian to accurately depict the science behind everything and with NASA on board, almost every scenario is explained in exhaustive detail and each set piece benefits from their added inputs. The microscopic presence of a man on the vast, lifeless deserts of Mars is captured in breathtaking detail by its camera. Editing is a mixed bag for its 141 minutes of runtime & unhurried pace can easily become frustrating for some. And Harry Gregson-Williams' score doesn't add much & is quite forgettable.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Martian features a promising cast in Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan & Chiwetel Ejiofor, and yet it's only Damon who owns the film all the way from start to finish. Dangerously close to being labelled a typecast for playing characters that often get stuck in unwanted places before being rescued by another team, Damon brings everything he has to deliver a wonderfully balanced performance as Mark Watney and while the supporting cast does well, it's Damon who carries the film all by himself.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Martian is a visually arresting, scientifically dense & very grounded sci-fi epic about the indomitable will of the human spirit to survive against all odds and also works as an awe-inspiring space adventure, thanks to Scott's assured direction & Damon's heartwarming performance. While it still misses a few steps in the storytelling department, is longer than it needs to be, and not every attempts at humour works out in its favour, the positives outweighs the negatives and its optimistic approach to space travel & exploration, an emotionally rich experience it has in store & stringent focus on human condition despite profundity in its science makes it a cinema that's destined to please its crowd. A thrilling & timely spectacle, The Martian comes delightfully recommended."
"michaelrapak","Null","1","4","1 December 2015"," The Martian Analysis
","The Martian was a fantastic science fiction piece. It brought beautiful Martian landscapes with a killer performance from Matt Damon. It was adapted from a novel of the same name by Andy Weir. I did not know it was adapted from a novel going in. <br/><br/>Matt Damon's performance as Mark Watney was incredibly well done. Considering for most of the film, Damon is acting in isolation. His performance is dependent on his ability to act solely in front of a camera and crew and not interacting with other actors to progress the story. But, he did incredible. His character brought a lot of wit and snide remarks that brought a good sense of humor to the dire situation. The video logs he records would give insight into his thought process and how he was comprehending the situation. It was a clever tool to inform the audience since Damon's character was not communicating with another person. For the purpose of the story, his logs acted as a means to inform who would find his footage what happened and for the audience it acted as a means to inform them on his thoughts.<br/><br/>I did not take much notice to other performances. I was really captivated by Damon's character and his wit and charm. If the movie focused only on him and he found a way to save himself with no assistance from other characters on earth, I think I would have still enjoyed the film. The other characters were likable, but focusing so much on Damon and his character's charm distracted me from the others. <br/><br/>The cinematography of Mars was really well done. The exposition shots of Mars showed beautiful landscapes that were rich in color. It also gave a feeling of isolation to sympathize with Damon's character. Surrounded by vast openness and no one to share it with, it makes a person feel so small in comparison. Showing time progression was handled well also. Showing video footage sped up to show hours of time passing and putting text on the screen stating what sol (solar day) it was to show great lengths of time. There were also subtle ways of showing time passage: Watney's potato farm, the time log text on video recordings, Watney's body shrinking from malnourishment.<br/><br/>Themes of survival and creative ingenuity were heavily emphasized as well as isolation and communication. How Watney communicates by leaving prerecorded videos to track his progress to whoever might find them is how the audience is clued into his thought process, how Watney eventually communicates with a team on earth by first rotating a camera off a lander to text messaging, and the communication between NASA and the China National Space Administration, cross-cultural communication. Watney comes up with creative ways to ensure his survival. Rationing food, making a potato farm, modifying equipment for long distance journeys, and his overall wit in deducing that he is the greatest botanist on the planet (being the only one on the planet) and that he is a space pirate for taking an spaceship in international ""waters"" (space) without permission. <br/><br/>The film ends with Watney giving lectures on survival. Survival is the strongest theme of the film. Having the will to survive and the determination to make a way to survive. And then on the flip side of tragedy, having a new appreciation for life and making it count because life is short. Truly a spectacular film."
"robin_sayer","9","1","4","30 November 2015"," A truly great original movie
","A really interesting movie, which I was worried about because of the necessary lack of dialog when watching one person battling the odds all alone.<br/><br/>A couple of shortcomings were the weird downplayed interaction when he first makes any kind of contact with other people. When he first has a conversation with his crew who he's not spoken to for over a year, you get the impression that you must have missed something and perhaps they had been talking the day before or something.<br/><br/>I think he made an agreement with the director that he didn't want an Oscar winning emotional bit but this seemed to go too far in the other direction, so what you get is a completely unbelievable conversations of a human whose not spoken to another human for over a year just talking as though you spoke yesterday.<br/><br/>The other issue for me was Sean Beans slightly strange performance. He seemed to be going for a real person and was playing his character sort of techy dysfunctional anti social and nervous - but no one else in the NASA role did. Jeff Daniels only seems to have one acting style, so while he was just being a NASA version of NewsRooms Will McAvoy, Sean was probably being a more realistic version of a NASA chief nerd. Also it seemed a bit weird that Sean Beans character saves the day but is fired."

","Imagine being left for dead on a desolate planet 200 million miles way -- with no way to call for help. For astronaut Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) in The Martian, that nightmare has become reality. After a mission goes horribly wrong, Watney must survive alone on Mars with limited life support and find a way to communicate to NASA that he is still alive. He uses his knowledge and botany expertise to come up with endless MacGyver-like solutions to problem the planet has to throw at him.<br/><br/>While The Martian predominantly follows Mark during his struggle for survival, the scenes of NASA back on Earth really bring everything together, and prevent the movie from being just two and a half hours of Matt Damon talking to himself. As great as Damon was, the actor who really stole the show was Donald Glover, who plays astrophysicist Rich Purnell. Glover was only in a few scenes, unfortunately, but he gave us all the comic relief that Damon's cheesy one-liners failed to provide. <br/><br/>The stunning special effects and absolutely beautiful soundtrack combined to create a perfect atmosphere and an incredible experience, and I often felt as if I was actually there. Some would point out that the raging storm at the beginning of the movie would be impossible in Mars' atmosphere. While that is true, it didn't break the immersion for me at all since the rest of the movie is extremely scientifically accurate. As well-done as this movie is, however, the immersion was broken at times, mainly during Damon's aforementioned one-liners. I cringed when he muttered, ""F*** you, Mars,"" to himself, and even more so when he said, ""I'm gonna have to science the s*** out of this."" The lines seemed forced and, amongst a few other lines, tarnished an otherwise-perfect script. It really took away from the serious tone that the rest of the movie had established. That being said, if 10 cheesy lines are all I have to complain about in a 2.5- hour movie, I'd say it turned out pretty well.<br/><br/>Between the fantastic cast, awe-inspiring special effects, amazing soundtrack, and near-perfect script, director Ridley Scott made me almost wish I was stranded on Mars right alongside Mark Watney. The Martian is an absolute must-see and I give it 5 stars out of 5."

Mr.Scott, has done it yet again with ""Martian"", a really fun and enjoyable Sci-Fi thriller. It stars Matt Damon as the man stuck on Mars after a terrible Ares mission. This movie is definite must see and you would probably never want it to end. <br/><br/>Mark Whatney (Damon), is left on Mars after a bad storm and a awful mission named Ares 3. His crew is certain of his death and reports it to NASA, the lead of the mission. It turns out that he really is alive, and he is making a living. The rest of the movie is about how he gets back home.<br/><br/>Now, let me say that this movie is around two and half hours. It's usually really hard to keep people engaged the whole time, but this movie does it perfectly. It has its own blend of science, comedy, and action, at the same time developing the plot. The screenplay and performances are amazing, and You can definitely say that Chiwetel is one of the best actors of our time. Not saying the pat Matt Damon isn't good, but his character is very plain and ordinary, even though he pulls of the smart-look very well and is mostly taken care of with CGI. The way that this movie is put together, edited, and executed is just fantastic, and it's really really engaging. The soundtrack in this movie is just amazing and keeps you very satisfied throughout the whole movie. <br/><br/>This movie albeit is very predictable and boring at some times, which is OK, considering that it is really long. Matt's humor really works well, and is absolutely spectacular when you need to relieve tension. This movie has a strong message that is given in a different and very amazing way. They show you survival, tension, and love. It is hard to understand at times, but you have to understand that Hollywood tried its best to make it super simple and understandable. Al of the science references were neat, and all the characters looked and behaved very sharp, except for Kate Mara who just struggled. Jeff Daniels in this movie doesn't really fit as the director of NASA and always reminds me of ""Dumb and Dumber"". Seeing him looks like a joke, and doesn't really fit the serious role at times. <br/><br/>The characterization and description for each character is very well done. You would really really care about the characters and worry about them, as if you were really dragged in to the movie. The CG is mind-blowing, even if there is a short resemblance to the Grand Canyon at many places. The shooting, setting, and character time placement is very well done and is surely not a miss.<br/><br/>After going through two-years of development hell, this movie definitely lives up to the hype and does justice. Ridley Scott, is the man for this movie even though he isn't as consistent. When seeing movies like ""Exodus"", you'll probably lose touch for him. But this movie is smart, executed well, sharp, and has some really really good performances. Like I said, it's really really hard to engage people in a movie for two and half hours, but this movie does that perfectly.

Picture this one as a combination of the science of Apollo 13 (1995), combined with the survival element of Cast Away (2000) and the lost in space fun of Gravity (2013). After the recent success of Gravity (7 Oscars for an all-right sci-fi adventure movie) it seems that space adventure movies can combine Academy Awards' appreciation with ticket selling.

Still it's the perfect movie to have your pop corn with.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"
"lmitrani","8","1","4","11 November 2015"," A fast-paced rescue mission to Mars captures our curiosity with visual delights
","The Martian, a movie rightly praised by critics and audiences alike, deserves its accolades. Following an accident on a voyage to Mars, Matt Damon is separated from his crew, and stranded with limited supplies to stay alive until he can be rescued. The story that follows is suspenseful and engrossing. It has great photography of the surface of Mars and space, humor, science lessons, and a daring rescue attempt.<br/><br/>The scenes with Matt Damon as the only one on screen, talking to himself and audience, are surprisingly absorbing and entertaining. He needs to calmly solve a number of survival tasks to stay alive by overcoming potential shortages of food, water, and power sources. The strategies discussed to rescue him, as well as his separation from his crew and communications with NASA in Houston provide a fast-paced story that never lets up. Will the mission succeed? If you like '70s Disco music, you'll hear lots of it since that's all he's left with up there. The musical score when we don't hear disco also works well.<br/><br/>There are neither contrived romances nor political issues. The Martian combines all elements of an entertaining film: a main character we love, many plot twists, and spectacular space shots that are a feast for eyes.<br/><br/>The Martian can also be seen as a contemporary example of how far we've advanced in ensuring diversity of cast members in major productions like this one, which has been #1 in box-office receipts for several weeks. The leading roles are acted by women (Jessica Chastain as crew commander and Kate Mara as second in command), a Latino man (Michael Pena as Martinez) as co-Captain of the mission, an Asian man as key ""architect"" of the ground crew to plan a rescue mission, and two African-Americans, one a manager (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and the other a scientist (Donald Glover) who solves the technical problem of how to resolve the engineering challenges. (Ms. Chastain was also the key person in Zero Dark Thirty who located the hiding place of Osama Bin Laden and advised the mission to kill him. However, that was a true story.) <br/><br/>But don't white males also have prominent roles? Let's see. The two chief ones are played by Matt Damon, the stranded astronaut, and Jeff Daniels as NASA director. While they occupy lots of screen time, they're limited in their decision-making. As the lowest ranking crew member, Mr. Damon can only wait and hope to be rescued; in decades past, it would be the ""damsel in distress"" being rescued by her Knight in Shining Armor, usually a white male. Jeff Daniels, although the NASA head, is disrespected by the African-American scientist who barges into his meeting, presents the engineering solution he alone developed, takes over the meeting without asking to be recognized, and insults the NASA director by asking, ""Who are you?"" One of his key decisions is reversed.<br/><br/>Can you imagine this happening if the demographics were reversed? What about another white male in the chain of command? He's told he'll be fired when the mission is over. Can a case be made that diversity efforts have gone too far, replacing one set of demographics who were previously minimized (women, African-Americans, Latinos, Asians) with a newer one (white men)? I leave it to you to decide if another episode in the film can be considered political correctness: a key piece of the engineering solution to the rescue mission is controlled not by the U.S., but by China. For more evidence of this trend, note that TV's latest superhero is Supergirl, and in the next Ghostbusters the leading roles will be played by women. Will the next 007 be Jamie Bond? Stay tuned! I suspect that whether or not you agree with my observations will depend on your own identity group, or your support for political correctness. None of these observations, however, should detract from an immensely enjoyable film."

","Originally, I had no interest in seeing this film, but the wife talked me into it. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it a great deal.<br/><br/>This movie addresses the current cultural and scientific Mars fascination blended with the likely not-so-distant-future exploration of said planet. What would/could happen to an exploration team if they actual did land on Mars, what dangers might they face, and in the most unfortunate of circumstances - what would someone have to do to survive on Mars?<br/><br/>At times the movie was a little slow, but I chalked that up to the absolute isolation one would experience on Mars alone - a nice scripting tactic even if it is lost on some. The desperation scenes were well played by Damon and overall thought that the movie scored big! Even some of the more stretched concepts of the film somehow managed to make me believe them in the end.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie was how the writers subtly address the artificial gravity aspect of the main ship! Very cool idea! <br/><br/>This much for now, Dr.T"

","The Martian, is like gravity in the fact that he's lost in space alone and that it is a space film. Other Than that they couldn't be further apart starting with the fact that the Martian actually has a plot. The humour is good as well, not to much to take away from the seriousness of the movie but enough to lighten the mood and let you relax and enjoy it. In terms of a drama/Sci-fi movie I gave the Martian a 7. It's not to say that it's a bad movie, actually I quite enjoyed it but it's not a movie that I would watch again, I know what happens in it there's no crazy twist. It's a movie that you watch, enjoy and then move on from. 7/10"
"xirzon","8","1","4","9 November 2015"," Great adaptation that misses a chance to be amazing
","I didn't think Ridley Scott had another great movie in him, but he proved me wrong. The Martian turned out to be visually powerful, well- paced and well-acted, and will likely be remembered as one of the best sci-fi movies of this decade.<br/><br/>Matt Damon does a great job with a challenging lead role, conveying both the desperation and witty resourcefulness that define Mark Watney. Among the support cast, Kate Mara shines and lets us experience the emotional journey of one of Watney's fellow crew members.<br/><br/>The movie lacked suspense in its last third, which in my view is because part of the story arc from the book has been omitted in favor of greater focus on the supporting characters. A more courageous choice might have been to go the opposite route: to focus almost completely on Watney's isolation. <br/><br/>We're left with a movie that feels ultimately bright and optimistic, and which is definitely very entertaining. Go see it."
"patrickbennett66","8","1","4","6 November 2015"," Good story but let down by some supporting actors
","Hollywood again has made a good film from a simple plot but the story was let down by very, very average acting by Jeff Daniels (please don't try serious roles again as it's just not your thing) and some very wooden performances by some of the supporting cast. If it weren't for Matt Damon then this movie wouldn't have been so successful at the box office. Matt's ability to make each role so convincing that it seems that he can't put a foot wrong in any of his movies.<br/><br/>Given that the time span of the movie was so long, there was a lot of things that could have (but obviously didn't) go wrong over the months stranded on Mars. Then again, for a 2.3 hour movie, there wasn't much more that they could fit in.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I would say that if you ignored Jeff Daniel's acting you should go and see this movie."
"TomHarding04","9","1","4","6 November 2015"," The Martian Review
","""Help is only 140 million miles away""<br/><br/>As a film buff, when you see Ridley Scott has made another film set in space, you find yourself wondering ""Wow, could this be as good as Alien?"" or will this be a flop like Prometheus? Well, I was sat on the fence regarding the outcome of this particular movie, but was always intrigued and none the less excited to see this, especially when there is such a fantastic cast. However, there is always going to be the debate and pre conceptions about any movie with such ""out there"" subjects as this. Challenging Religion, can man survive else where?, are there alternative life forms out there? blah blah But, to divulge and debate subjects like this, we would run out of room to review this particular film. <br/><br/>Based on the best selling Novel by Andy Weir (""The Martian"") which has been expertly adapted by Drew Goddard and directed by Ridley Scott to turn a fictional story to seem like, dare I say it, A seemingly True Story. A Botanist/Astronaut named Mark Watney is on a scientific mission on Mars with a team of astronauts, to make discoveries, and find information regarding the possibility of potential life and travel to this neighbouring planet. However, due to a drastic change in the weather the team are forced to leave earlier than expected, but in a mist of the storm an areal antenna is flung towards a dazed Mark, and sends him into the dark, and his crew are forced to make the decision of leaving Mark behind as he is assumed dead, due to the amount of oxygen in his tank. (Already this movie will spark great interest, and debate as in a few decades from now there is likely to be missions to Mars, as America has just discovered there is Water on Mars). Mark is in fact not dead, and finds himself stranded 140 million miles away from home, running low on Oxygen, and has to head back to base camp, where to add insult to injury he has the sudden realisation he will have to find a way to survive for four years as that is when the next excavation of Mars is due.<br/><br/>Immediately the film sets it self up for a ""Cast away"" like storyline, where one mans drive to survive will create his way home. However, gladly The Martian is not like this and is entirely different due to a relaxed and informal relationship with a video diary Matt Damon is able to inform the audience of all the complex experiments he is undertaking to survive. For example, Mark finds Potatoes the crew had been saving for thanks giving, and creates a Potato farm in the base, due to being a Botanist... Furthermore, by bringing in contact to home through a drone that was left on Mars in the 70's this ""Cast Away"" like storyline is made to be different, as he is still narrating and keeping the audience up to date, but Mark is in fact addressing the nation and his potential ""past"" self.<br/><br/>When first watching the movie, I was sceptical as to how this would keep the attention and follow a narrative arch throughout, as we all would immediately expect him to survive and then go home.. 'Standard' Hollywood story, I mean lets face it, it is Matt Damon after all and we want Matt to get home safe (Because he always finds away home, look at Saving Private Ryan, it just seems to always cost the American Government money. Although we are promised happy endings within major Hollywood epics, this still engages you throughout and certainly doesn't disappoint. Ridley Scott has masterfully encapsulated the vast scale of the planet, making the audience really feel the lonesome nature of life so far from home, due to some fantastic cinematic moments of ""scale"" that really drive this home. As an audience member, I really enjoyed these particular moments, because unlike most of these ""space"" films as of late, we are constantly focusing more on the mise-en-scene and how many special affects can be thrown at us. But what Ridley has done (along side special effects don't get me wrong) he has really used and the dialogue the dialogue from the story and allowed Matts character to explain literally everything the character is feeling, and really emphasising how human this ""Martian"" is. Furthermore, you are welcomed in to the mind, perspective and reality of what is happening in this characters head, day by day, ALONE.<br/><br/>Unlike other Sci fi films, this ironically enough doesn't seem to be so ""sci fi"" and becomes more about a mans drive to survive, with a fantastic solo performance from Matt you really want this man to succeed, and believe his struggle. One of the defining and real thought provoking aspects of this film was the notion of being 'first'. It was surreal to imagine that his character was literally experiencing, touching, walking, seeing etc everything for the first time as a man but also as man kind. To think that every grain of sand etc the character is walking on has been untouched by man. You can obviously look at the underlining capitalist debate, and Americanization of this film, looking at how one nation will spend millions to voyage back and save one man, but will not invest that money in abolishing poverty globally etc, but thats when people need to remember this is a fictional story, and should be enjoyed entirely for this reason. the notion of being the first"
"benjaminwg","8","1","4","5 November 2015"," Send Him Friends
","I joked before this came out that it should have been re-written from the book to act as an explanation to why Interstellar didn't just settle humans on Mars. Maybe they find some big reason with Matt's mission that means Mars is out of the question later... or better yet, he lies, cuz he's a lying liar who steals spaceships and makes up stories why Mars is unfit for colonies. No luck. But all is not lost.<br/><br/>This is more realistic, I think, than either Gravity or Interstellar, though it's still trying very hard to be as NASA as possible, with big space ships, ""private time"", and, in the case of The Martian, not wanting to logically and rationally use the resources of Mars to survive... like making your own fuel for your buggy so you don't have to keep recharging it so frequently. Internal combustion works so much better, folks. If they'd put that in, though, I guess NASA loses face since they didn't come up with that first. <br/><br/>NASA does get some cute rib cracking PR-shill ""image management"" stuff by way of Kristen Wigg. She was adorable and hilarious. That was a pleasant surprise. We really need Congress to pass a law stopping agencies from spending any money on influencing public opinion at all. Equally surprising was Jeff Daniels' complex director and the dynamics with staff.<br/><br/>The dust storm was not only stupid, but looked like it was ripped right out of Prometheus. That briefly took me out of the movie. I'm not sure why Mars movies keep using that. Rocket Man. Red Planet (not as bad as it originally seemed... watch it again, forget the horrible Mission to Mars). There's enough danger in space and on Mars not to need borrowing anything from LV426's eviler twin (the hell didn't they just make it LV426 in that movie?!).<br/><br/>It also seemed like half their crew was red headed, which made me think maybe the gingers were being relocated to Mars or at least were being seeded there to save their race from recessive gene homogeneity extinction here on Earth or something. Hah. But nope...<br/><br/>By the end of it, I was slightly perturbed they didn't just send more people and stuff to join Matt instead. If you have a family back on Earth, why are you even being chosen to go there in the first place? The end does attempt to explain the utility of this, at least. They'd be better off just spending the money to keep sending more people and supplies there rather than building huge starships and trying to launch off Mars. Besides, getting off the red planet is not an easy notion. <br/><br/>They still oversimplify the orbital mechanics a teeny tiny bit and in one stinker line actually wonder how much fuel it would take to just point their nose where they want to go and fire an engine in orbit. At least they do mention the word ""altitude"" soon after, but that whole exchange seemed like a slip. <br/><br/>They could have done more to show the communications delay. They talk about it once or twice and then kind of sort of show it explicitly a little, but there's a lot of editing and a lot of not taking the best route, which is showing the characters doing something else in the meantime between messages.<br/><br/>While some of the dialog in Gravity was truly awful and its realism was more akin to ""truthiness"" than any sense of space science accuracy (it looked great, though), I think on the whole, The Martian is only about at Gravity's level in terms of satisfaction in the film-going experience kind of way, ignoring the science factor and Gravity's lame dialog in the beginning that I found easy to forgive. Don't get me wrong; I found both satisfying enough to recommend. <br/><br/>The sometimes laborious Interstellar I'd still put slightly up a notch even with its bizarrely-abbreviated time between discovering NASA and the launch, and then the clunky and obvious tesseract and watch scene. There is something more lofty and artistic about Interstellar, even if you ignore the intimations of quantum gravity propulsion and future affecting the past that I am obviously partial to (you're welcome, Jonathan Nolan... I'm just glad someone, anyone, used it). Time dilation, even though they took the goofy route of using a neat- looking but unnecessary black hole to encounter it along with the needlessness of a wormhole, however also pretty, to transit to it, is a wonderful dramatic device that clearly too many science fiction screen writers neglect. You have to give Interstellar props for both using time dilation, having an artful structure, and even loftier themes than The Martian, even with the clunk factor of yet another The Brothers Nolan project's third act not quite living up to the rest. There's nothing *that* unpredictable about The Martian, either. In comparison, I think the final scene of Interstellar is brilliant and *it* had totally slipped my mind.<br/><br/>I liked The Martian. I recommend it. Could have been better, but I'm thankful we got three pretty darn good harder sci fi space films of late. They're not entertaining or artistic enough for me to quite want to watch them repeatedly as some others of my favorites. Decent occasional experiences that are notable for being more realistic and not so stupid all the time like most the crap Hollywood pumps out. That's something to be thankful for."
"Icedooitle","9","1","4","4 November 2015"," Non-Fiction Science Fiction
","In the science fiction community, Ridley Scott achieved legend status decades ago. On top of being an exquisite filmmaker, he seems to have the mind of a Comic-Con geek. This trait has resulted in some of the most imaginative adaptations in sci-fi history. It may come as surprise to some viewers to learn that ""plausibility"" is a cornerstone of the genre. You will learn in a hurry that spectacle is not enough to succeed in making a sci-fi film, there must be a satisfying answer as to how, (A good deal of the failure of Exodus: Gods and Kings can be attributed to this notion.) It shouldn't come as a surprise that when given the task of making a massive production about a Mars mission, Scott leaves very little to cry foul over.<br/><br/>The Martian is technically a science fiction film. It takes place in the near future with technology that doesn't quite exist. What seems tempting for many writers of the genre is to take the ""fiction"" aspect and build it to massive heights. If the story could take place in 2020, it might as well take place in 3020. This offers wiggle room to develop inventions and environments that are conceivable, but only need the explanation of ""it's the future"" to satiate critics. The Martian challenges not only critics, but actual scientific professionals to pick apart the verisimilitude of the story. In that way, this film is closer to Apollo 13 and Castaway, than 2001 or Mission to Mars.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is the astronaut specializing in botany among a team on the surface of Mars. When predictable circumstances lead to him being marooned on the planet, a very familiar plot is set in motion; man vs nature with an impending rescue mission. What dictates the success of the clever problems and solutions, is Damon. While the story does ping-pong between developments at NASA and the struggle on the red planet, this is still a whole lot of Damon. There is little doubt that the story will end with anything but NASA operators throwing papers in the air with hugs, and the reunited crew making the trip back to Earth. Despite that predictability, it is amazing how effective the tension here is. All the answers to survival questions like food, water and communication are well thought out and the destination is nearly irrelevant compared to the journey. <br/><br/>Another commendable cliché sidestep, is the murky antagonist role. It is easy to say that Jeff Daniels, the politically-driven head of NASA, is the villain as his motives for getting the astronaut home safe aren't purely sentimental. He lets budgets, public opinions and self-image dictate decisions and outcomes. There is not a moment of redemption or poetic justice for this character, because in the scope of the conflict, he is a reasonable man. The all-star cast of Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, Kate Mara and Kristen Wiig seems bloated considering the lack of melodrama, but the consistent humorous undertone throughout the film belongs in capable hands. There is really no other way to approach a man attempting interplanetary agriculture, wrist deep in his own feces, than with a smirk. <br/><br/>The technical congruencies, guarded special effects and remarkable pacing might not make this a new standard for the genre, but it shows a discipline that is alien to the budget and audience. Now that Ridley Scott is in his late 70's, his abilities aren't waning. It is selfish of me to hope that all his upcoming sequels come to fruition before his timely passing, but if his heart remains in it as adamantly as it is now, why shouldn't both our dreams come true?"

","The Martian, directed by Ridley Scott, is a fictional movie set on the planet of Mars. The movie begins with a group of astronauts making a mission on the planet when a storm hits. The crew is forced to evacuate, and one crew member is injured and abandoned. The allegedly dead astronaut , Mark Watney(played by Matt Damon), awakens alone. The plot of the movie is focused upon how Watney survives, and how he is rescued. The majority of the film is spent focused on the former. This is the movie's strongest portion, mostly due to a great performance by Matt Damon, and a witty script. The other part of the film, how Watney is rescued, is gone about in a realistic way. While this does help the audience become immersed in the movie, it creates sections of the film where Watney, who should be the main focus, is drowned out by other characters and dilemmas. Even though they sometimes take away from the film, these additional characters are still strong editions; they are each well developed, and have good writing. Lastly, the story unfortunately makes few surprising deviations from what the audience can predict will occur, leaving it somewhat underwhelming. Overall, The Martian is an intriguing and entertaining movie, but is never astounding."

","The Martian is directed by Ridley Scott which means it is definitely worth the time to watch. And it was a good movie. The performances by the huge cast were great and once again Matt Damon steals the show. He plays astronaut Mark Watney who gets stranded on Mars. Using his intellect he manages to survive while NASA works to bring him back. This movie is surprisingly very funny especially the scenes with Watney talking to himself on Mars. The effects were good for the most part. From start to finish I was for the most part entertained. And that brings me to my problems with the film. There are some scenes that I was bored in and the plot seemed to stall. Also the movie is a little to long because of this. And finally the movie lacked the overall struggle that films like Gravity and Cast Away had. In a few scenes, Watney's pain and suffering can definitely be seen and I feel the film could have been better with more scenes of his struggle. But at this point I'm nitpicking as this is a great movie and another Ridley Scott classic. From A+ to F, The Martian gets an A-."
"Bmis86-1","8","1","4","25 October 2015"," Good - but not great
","I just watched the Martian after a long wait and i will admit, I had a bit high expectations.<br/><br/>I enjoyed myself, but at the same time, I didn't enjoy myself as much as I did when I watched Interstellar or even Gravity. I know that all three of the movies are very different beasts, but at the same time as the common viewer, I think it's reasonable to compare the movies after viewing in the sense of how the movies affected me and drawed me in. <br/><br/>The Martian for me lacked emotional dept, and deeper characters. I felt no real connection with the main character or the rest of the crew. Don't get me wrong, of cause I rooted for him to get saved and for the crew to make it, but in the sense of really caring about their characters beyond the mere fact that they were human beings that of cause should make it back to earth, I didn't really feel a connection to them. I understand the intent behind making Damon's character use his humor and spirit to distance himself from what must have been horrific emotions, and I can even try to grasp that some of his apparent resilience could be, that he is a professional and a man who was emotionally able to handle more and has had training and so on, (the comparison to a solider in war comes to mind), but at the same time I had a really hard time relating to him and feeling anything for him, because at no point did he really crack, in fact at no point did he show any negative emotion in the manner and intensity that one would expect. Hell, in interstellar I felt more emotionally invested in the main character before he even left earth. <br/><br/>Another thing is that I would have loved to see more of Ridley Scott in the movie - to see his opinion and views or feelings. The only thing I could really see is that he tried to promote that the countries in the world come together and work together in exploring space. But I didn't even get a clear view on if the effort and money we put in spacetravel and exploration is something that he believes is worth it. It seemed that there was a lot of resources put in something that well - what did they really get out of it? I'm not sure I got that.. <br/><br/>A blockbuster is the most interesting to me, if it doesn't just show me a remake and retake on already addressed objective things, like ""spacetravel"" or ""getting our hero home"".. the movie sometimes gets a little to polished, and classical in the sense that it only shows the surface and the points and opinions everyone has. Who doesn't think he should be rescued? Who doesn't think it's cool he can survive? Who wouldn't go back for him if they could choose (and didn't have to actually feel any of the consequences but just quickly go through them in 1.30min)<br/><br/>Also, there was a certain point mid movie, that I thought drawed on a bit.. I think in a book it would have been interesting to read about, but for me, in a movie, there was a part of the movie before the explosion of his ""garden"" that fell a little flat. <br/><br/>But, but, I should of cause also say, that I really loved interstellar and how personal the movie felt and was from the director and I really related to the characters, and at no point did I feel detached or felt that the movie fell a little flat. So maybe this review should also be seen in the light, that I am I guess a bit more of a ""softie"" and I really enjoy movies that are subjective and that go deeper and handle the big questions like what's important in life and ethics and morals and so on. I bet a lot of people would think this a great movie and how cool it is he could survive and how cool and brave he is in general. I just need more to really get engaged..<br/><br/>(Btw, I apologize for some sentences that might be written strangely, English is not my native language, so the sentence construction is probably a little of some places)"

","Beware of possible spoilers! I really liked this movie, and I like Matt Damon. It was certainly a far better movie than ""Interstellar."" However, It dragged and was ponderous at times and was way too long. Of course, that may have been beneficial since I took two bathroom breaks during the movie and really didn't miss much. So this is the reason I gave it a rating of 6. Another reason for giving it a mid-range rating is that this is a movie that I don't really think I would want to watch again. There were attempts to vary the drama with humor, but it all seemed very formulaic and not really fresh and creative. I must say, though, that Matt Damon did a great job of acting. I hope he gets an Oscar nomination."

"asha-albert","9","1","4","23 October 2015"," Castaway + Gravity = immensely watchable movie
","If Castaway and Gravity were to have a child, and that child had a great sense of humor and optimism, that would be The Martian. <br/><br/>Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the titular character, so called because he is the first to grow plants on Mars, and therefore colonize it. He plays Mark Watney, an astronaut who is left for dead by his colleagues on Mars, after a freak accident leaves him unconscious during a aborted Mars mission. Well, he is NOT dead, soon recovers and patches himself up, and then dedicates himself to the task of sustaining himself until the next rescue mission. <br/><br/>Mark's character is that of an intelligent optimist, with a generous sense of humor and level-headedness. All of these qualities go a long way in making sure that he does not lose hope during the time that he is on Mars, and that he takes ownership for his sustenance and eventual rescue. <br/><br/>There is a sense of intimacy created between the audience and Mark, since a big part of the movie consists of him talking directly to the camera (ostensibly recording vlogs). We get to see his emotions, his occasional sense of defeat as well as his sense of humor, his loneliness, his tears and his happiness, and above all, his never- say-die attitude. At times during the movie, I could hear sniffling in the audience, there was the occasional cheering and clapping - you don't generally get these reactions unless the audience is emotionally invested in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie belongs to Matt Damon; this doesn't take away from the fine performances of the other cast members. Jessica Chastain is in fantastic form (as always) as the commander battling with the aftermath of a decision. Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor have extremely well-written roles that are deserving of such fine actors."

He will somehow grow food to survive... <br/><br/>We know they will get him home and with Ridley Scott directing, the special effects and actions scenes for that part of the film are done very well: shuttle leaving mars, ships orbiting planets, space walking etc. all these scenes, with the exception of Matt Damon's character puncturing his own space suit to use the escaping oxygen for thrust (absolutely ridiculous) compliment the human story that is the backbone of this journey.<br/><br/>Watney's struggle for survival on the inhospitable Mars reminded me of Hanks in Cast Away. But Watney's journey, while having it's ups and downs, didn't have the exhilarating highs and soul-crushing lows that Cast Away did. Nevertheless, his space odyssey was intriguing: Watney's ingenuity and adaptability was quite remarkable. <br/><br/>Screenplay from Drew Goddard injected humour at the right moments in the film. I didn't find the running gag of disco music that funny, but others did (perhaps because they were from that Generation).<br/><br/>Now for some off topic comments: 1.

Though, for a contemporary viewer, the word Martian itself carries a distinct connotation; our own near-future sights are set on this very prospect and so we perceive it as 'within reach'. The second act of the film and some shaky humour both contribute to the film's downfall on this very basis.<br/><br/>So, solitude. That should be the order of the day – given the singular title and bleak outlook established early on. Astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is a crew member of the Ares III mission to Mars, tasked with establishing a temporary base and collecting samples for study. Almost immediately, a divisive play of plot circumstance sees a deadly storm brew – forcing an evacuation during which Watney is struck by debris and left for dead. Damon is joined by a strong, if typically specialised, supporting cast helmed most notably by his Commanding Officer Lewis (Jessica Chastain) in space and Houston (various) back on Earth . They do just that - offer support – which when paired with Damon's relentless and abrasive optimism, results in vacuous tension and no sense of danger.<br/><br/>Soon after waking to a metal rod impaling his stomach and his own congealed blood forming the only seal between him and the barren atmosphere, a gripping scene ensues – Watney being forced to operate on himself with a hastily scrounged set of unpleasant, clanging prongs. Damon shines here. Savour it. He is soon settling in as a cocky, quipping jack-of-all-trades; imbued with a skillset plucked from the A-Team. It is at this point, the prelude to the (exceedingly prolonged) 'middle' act; that the film begins to reveal its true intention. This is, of course, to enact a fictional re- telling of Apollo 13 – with less uncertainty.<br/><br/>That's the problem – the comparisons. As much as I hate to belittle contemporary cinema and these genres in particular, if 'superhero' films aren't our generation's 'Western', then space thriller/dramas – are. With the distant Moon (2004), more recent Gravity (2012) and to some extent Interstellar (2014) all setting the bar high in terms of lone-castaway character study and visual spectacle; we've come to expect certain things in space. If a character is alone in adversity, we hope to explore their deteriorating psyche in an insightful and illuminating arc of events or introspective. It is in these moments spent alone together with these characters that we come to care, empathise and root for them. Mark Watney, fifty million miles from Earth, hardly ever seems to be truly secluded.<br/><br/>The script shies from the psychological attrition that the performance may have benefited from, by adapting a sickly sweet narrative of optimism and collective arrogance that undermines the emotional depth of the situation. Lacking threat or struggle, any adversity is trivialised. Rather than buck a predictable trend by flipping the usual chromatic dread with light hearted humour, the plot engenders apathy by giving no indication that any misfortune is worth fretting over. Post that initial scene-setting rush, you can never again suspend your disbelief for long enough to imagine harm befalling one of the characters. Detached from fear, Damon's struggle is both inconceivable and insincere."
"CTYer","7","1","4","16 October 2015"," This is definitely not a Ridley Scott masterpiece, and should have a more polished story (and scientific side).
","I made it a point to watch The Martian without first consulting IMDb for reviews (a usual practice for me). I have to say I was a bit disappointed in the movie, mainly due to various errors and a large lack for a more human element and story creativity. To start out with, this movie is so riddled with mistakes that CinemaSins would love to review it. To begin with, if Watney spent an undisclosed number of hours unconscious with a long piece of metal embedded in him, wouldn't he (A) bleed to death, (B) die because his suit was ripped and (C) not be able to walk all the way back to the base and still perform a basic medical surgery on himself? Another large issue was the sound present when filming an explosion in space where there is no sound. I cannot stress how disgruntled this particular detail left me, seeing as I walked into this movie expecting a Ridley Scott masterpiece that was as scientifically accurate as the novel the movie is based upon. The idea of Watney ""iron manning"" his way to the space ship was also something out of a cartoon. I understand that NASA EVA suits do have some protection systems against holes and tears, but I highly doubt that Watney would survive such a long amount of time without some permanent damage being done to his body.<br/><br/>Like previous reviewers, I also found that the movie lacked a more personal element, where Watney contemplates or is impacted in some significant manner by his solidarity and dire situation when it comes to emotion. I also found that, as the movie progressed, the script began to lack imagination. Watney's constant turn to potato farming for most of the movie did get slightly boring at some moments. I understand that the filmmakers were trying to emphasize on the importance of growing crops on Mars (something that I do appreciate), but I believe the script could be slightly richer if the filmmakers truly wanted to get audiences to absorb the message being conveyed.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie was very enjoyable to watch as a regular moviegoer. Despite the feeling that I got that the action started too early and before there was proper exposition, I really appreciated the general story. This might have not been Ridley Scott's finest films (it is certainly no Alien), but it wasn't a complete flop either (far from it). This movie does have its credit when it comes to scenic shots and scenes filmed in space that capture the sheer enormity of the place. Nevertheless, some of the shots were slightly overkill, not only in terms of quantity, but also because of their constant following of cliché ""helicopter-style"" shots to dramatic soundtrack music. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a enjoyable movie (to a certain extent), with a mostly thrilling story and some good character development. However, it would deserve 8 stars if it was more polished and the story (and science) was more developed."

","This movie have the right combination of humour, sadness, happiness...and a little bit of thriller. watched it in 3d. not that good in 3d suppose they didn't focused that much in it like the avatar does.What i really liked was acting of Matt Damon. He's great in this one. I forgive him for what he did in the INTERSTELLAR :-) . And i don't know why but Jessica Chastain looked really hot and serious in this movie. Sean Ban looked like he haven't got over with his death in Game of Thrones cos he really looked boring and i don't know why. And Bennedict Wong suited the character.But anyways i watched it, loved it, it was awesome and people really clapped and because PEOPLE LIKE SPACE MOVIES. No spoiler!"

","I was set a huge expectation by my friends before going for the movie based on the reviews and critics.. But actually, the movie story line is fantastic,as obviously it is based on a novel! The first half hour and the last half hour keeps the viewer engaged.. the screenplay lacks momentum in between and they would skip a huge time frame of around seven months in the story just through a frame change.. which was not expected!<br/><br/>But the science and maths used by Mark increases the curiosity to understand the space travel and even some of our daily living problems in earth! Sometimes, they speak too technical that the whole theater was silent.. probably none understood the technical terms and the jargon they used! Good for NASA and space agency people, may not be good for common people!"
"flyguy909","6","1","4","15 October 2015"," Worth watching, but really a lazy adaptation
","I had great hopes for this movie after reading the book. Although it was entertaining, it could have been so much more. For me the directing, acting and screen play came up way short. <br/><br/>For example, I think one of the most powerful/emotional moments in the book was when the satellite tech first realized that Whatney was alive - his completely hopeless situation suddenly hits her and she starts to softly cry. This powerful moment was totally missed in the movie. Same can be said of most of the humor which made the book special, like when he's finally rescued and inside and takes off his helmet letting the crew in on the fact that he hasn't showered for days... that and other examples totally glossed over in the movie. <br/><br/>The depiction of Mars landscape, although breathtaking at times was like something out of a 1950's sci-fi - with towering jagged peaks everywhere. Very unrealistic which took me out of the immersion at times. <br/><br/>Then there's the laughable bit where the kid is explaining orbital dynamics to the head of NASA... yea I know it needs to be explained for the audience, but even still, it was so moronic. Also lots of completely overdone clichéd crowd shots. <br/><br/>IMO, Damon does not have the chops for this role. His performance was just adequate. And also IMO, Ridley Scott's effort here is just completely overrated.<br/><br/>Just seems like a rushed, kind of lazy job here with what could have been an epic movie."
"pranalichoudhari","7","1","4","15 October 2015"," Don't expect too much from this one!
","For me, a major turn off with this movie was that it was not realistic as I thought it would be. Yes, the story was new, the concept was new. But it is a bit far-fetched to show that NASA would spend a billion of dollars on a mission to rescue one astronaut. And that the people already on the mission would take the risk of changing their course to rescue someone. It is a bit too optimistic to show that you get potatoes harvested in Mars soil (in earth-like conditions created) at the first go. I mean you could be a really great botanist, but cultivating and growing crops is not just temperature and water, what about so many organisms that take part in the process!Succeeding at first go is a bit optimistic according to me. But then again it's a movie and is based on a science fiction book.<br/><br/>Apart from that, I think the direction is great. The cinematography is good and the visual effects are good. The performances are good especially Matt Damon. Overall, it's good, nothing too special about it."
"burlesonjesse5","7","1","4","13 October 2015"," VIEWS ON FILM review of The Martian
","2015's The Martian (my latest review) is different from any film Ridley Scott has ever done. Yeah it's science fiction and all but you won't see aliens swallowing up Harry Dean Stanton whole, you won't see Harrison Ford retiring any replicants, and Russell Crowe ain't cutting off people's heads while yelling, ""are you not entertained!"" (oops, wrong genre). No this is probably Scott's first foray into feel-good territory, a sort of channeling within his inner, fantasy geek (Bill Nye and characters on The Big Bang Theory would be mighty proud). With ""Martian"", you gotta think All Is Lost in outer space (ha ha, get it), Cast Away on a planet millions of miles from Earth, and fictional splendor in the form of Apollo 13 (with added humor that sometimes deflates dramatic momentum). Matt Damon in the lead role, gives us an effectual, Hanks-ian performance. He even loses weight in the flick's third act to make it look legit.<br/><br/>Featuring a sun-drenched, bleached look (that's Ridley for ya), title cards when various troupers are introduced (I remember seeing this in Scorsese's The Aviator), plenty of bubble gum, seventies soundtrack hits, and dialogue that doesn't seem as clunky as was featured in last year's Interstellar (Matt Damon was also a stranded space cadet in that monster, box office hit), The Martian chronicles astronaut and goofy botanist, Mark Watney (played by Cambridge's favorite son). You see Mark is left for dead, stranded on Mars. His crew thinks he got pulverized by debris in a hellish sand storm. To make matters worse, NASA informs the world that he's departed and even has a bodiless funeral for him. Watney's solution: Try to stay alive long enough for anyone listening, to realize he's not in the grave and come back to pick him up (that could take up to three years). He figures out how to grow his own food, create water from almost nothing, and locate the Pathfinder probe (a robotic spacecraft from 1997). By detecting this probe, he will get the chance to regain contact with Earth.<br/><br/>Now based on ""Martian's"" trailer, I thought it might be silly for NASA to garner many man-hours, fork over millions of dollars for a rescue mission, and have five of their crew members risk lives to save one dude. I was erroneous. This vehicle makes you care about it all and then some. The actors do solid work across the board. You have Oscar nominees (Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor), villainous heirs (Sean Bean), and comedic veterans (Kristin Wiig, Mackenzie Davis) contributing threefold. The film's only heavy is perhaps, space and time (you could also throw in Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders, a snobbish, cocksure NASA contingent). Ah heck, it's safe to say that The Martian is darn predictable (you know Watney's gonna make it home, come on). The journey to get there though is still pretty alluring and seat-grabbing (if you wanna be Iron Man, just puncture your vacuumed suit and let it ride, hint hint).<br/><br/>In conclusion, various, big time directors have tried their hand at making quality cinema via the ""Red Planet"" (that includes the swooping Brian De Palma and John Carpenter). They failed miserably where Scott at least succeeds on a few levels. In the past, some of his work has lacked sentimentality relying on violent images and distant temperaments to get the job done. Here, he paints a picture more human, more amicable. Yeah The Martian is a bit overlong (a two hour running time could have sufficed things) and it sledgehammers comedy in the face of death and dying. However, when the lights go down and you have popcorn in hand, there's entertainment value plus intellectual insight to keep everyone occupied. Oh and you know what, David Bowie's ""Starman"" never sounded so good. Rating: 3 stars."
"dimbost","7","1","4","9 October 2015"," A great welcome back film by Ridley Scott
","Hey guys, watched this film last week and was to busy to do a review then, but here i go...<br/><br/>The film is great! it starts of with an introduction to all of the crew for the Ares III and we get thrown into their conversation and their relationship with each other. Then the unexpected sandstorm and boom... we have our lonely martian Matt Damon who is for the third time has to be rescued by Hollywood.<br/><br/>Story: If only Ridley Scott had this good of a story for Prometheus or at least a story that made sense like this one. Even the decision no to tell the remaining Ares III crew members that Mark is still alive is a reasonable decision that makes sense.Mark's ability to grow and then subdivide his food and document everything is all logical and believable. The story and the direction of the film is really enjoyable and pleasing to the eyes.<br/><br/>Acting is great here, especially from Matt Damon, this is probably one of his best performances. The supporting cast is also great Jeff Daniels has a great role and is very serious. Donald Glover reminded me of his co-star from Community Danny Pudi, the character Rich Purnell is super smart who is super weird and quirky...<br/><br/>Overall this is a very enjoyable film, with very few hiccups, but great story, great acting, great editing and really awesome pacing!!! Hope Ridley follows this up with his Blade Runner sequel and Prometheus sequel."
"alwayshungryy","7","1","4","8 October 2015"," An optimistic, first class blockbuster with great emotional payoff
","""The Martian"" is a very optimistic survival movie, so much so that you probably know going in what the answer to the film's big question is. Therefore, the film, which starts off with a intense sequence of Watney (Matt Damon) being left behind by his crew on Mars, becomes more about how they get there.<br/><br/>This is probably the film's best aspect, it is an unabashedly well- meaning celebration of science and kind, intelligent people working together to help one another (even the potentially clichéd PR antagonist is non-existent). The series of events that follow revolve around scientific ideas that are brought forward with the degree of accuracy and amount of exposition balanced just right, compelling the audience effortlessly (kudos to screenwriter Drew Goddard, though the film's humour is mediocre at best). Moreover, the crew's camaraderie is very convincing and thus affecting.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is pretty by-the-numbers: there are obstacles, those obstacles are overcome, then there are setbacks. This is what keeps the film going (apart from the ensemble's winning performances) but it may become repetitive for some. However, the strong second half builds and builds to an incredibly emotional and riveting climax that catches you off guard. Unfortunately the sequence ends abruptly as we fast-forward to the unnecessary ""and everyone lives happily ever after"" montage.<br/><br/>What could've been a bleak, cynical tale of survival becomes a first class feel-good blockbuster. I would say ""welcome back, Sir Ridley Scott"" but I actually quite like his recent efforts.<br/><br/>(PS – It's easy to take the visual effects for granted, but it is superb.)"
"a-arunprasadh-772-323677","9","1","4","8 October 2015"," The Martian, a must watch film in the line of Gravity and Interstellar.
","The Martian, a very good film and almost scientifically accurate. The Martian novel was the winner in science fiction category of ""Goodreads Choice Awards 2014"". There're few changes in the film towards the climax. As per the book, Mark will lost contact with NASA during a blast and will recontact only when he reaches Ares 4. And second, there will be a Strom while traveling to Ares 4 which Mark will handle/tackle it (one of the interesting part of the novel). Those two and many more were missed in the movie (might be to reduce runtime). Even this script was also good. Overall the movie was excellent. The Martian, a sci- fact. Interstellar, a sci-fiction. Gravity, a sci-visual. All the three films were superb in their own aspect. The Martian was perfectly crafted."

","I watched the Martian yesterday after hearing mainly positive reviews and liking the look of it from the trailer. <br/><br/>Opening up with a scene of scientists operating on planet Mars, a storm hits the site and as the astronauts make their escape, Matt Damon's botanist, Mark Watney is left behind when hit by flying debris. <br/><br/>After this the film shows Mark Watney on Mars all alone and going through what it takes to survive. The film portrays brilliantly a man and his willingness to survive in the face of adversity. <br/><br/>The film had some very good parts and despite most things going well (if not too well) you were rooting for Mark Watney to be saved and to make it back to Earth. I think the success of the film was that Matt Damon was very likable as the lead character. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes like others have said were a bit cheesy but at the end of the day it is a feel good movie and despite being 2 hours and 21 minutes long there wasn't a moment where I felt bored<br/><br/>I thoroughly recommend seeing this film as it is very good.

"SoTotallyDude","8","3","23","5 October 2015"," You'll finish The Martain with a smile on your face.
","The Martian is an uplifting crowd pleaser that celebrates the power of knowledge and the human spirit.<br/><br/>Audiences clearly love their space epics as of late, with recent films like Gravity and Interstellar finding great success. What you'll find different about this year's hard sci-fi flick, The Martian, is it's pure optimism. Matt Damon gives us one of his best performances as Mark Watney, a witty and highly resourceful Astronaut who is mistakenly left behind on the red planet Mars. Throughout the film we experience Mark's journey of survival, having to rely on his scientific knowledge to overcome massive obstacles like growing food or gaining communication with NASA. Watching Damon tackle these challenges is genuinely good entertainment, hearing him think out loud and using science as his main tool of survival is a lot of fun. He's a likable character that you naturally want to root for. The surprisingly large supporting cast does an excellent job as well with notable turns from Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Jessica Chastain. What's most interesting is the main villain and in this film and how it isn't a person or a robot or an alien, it's time. The moment Damon and the team at NASA realize he's been stranded it's a constant race against the clock. When you're stranded on a desolate planet with very little supplies, every single day matters and that's where we find the tension. It's a well-crafted film thanks to its director Ridley Scott, a master at building worlds and showcases his ability by making Mars look believable and beautiful. Although the film starts to feel its length around the midway mark, it certainly makes up for it with a terrific climax.<br/><br/>Despite not being as gritty or thematically heavy as Gravity or Interstellar, The Martian exceeds in its storytelling. With top-notch performances, directing, and writing you will leave the theatre believing in the power of human perseverance and at the same time you'll be happy you're on Earth doing it."

Jessica Chastain is an intelligent looking commander. The likable crew includes Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan and Michael Pena. Matt Damon does a great job and is just the right person for this role not too hero like so he is believable.<br/><br/>It's good to see brain power solve problems instead of super hero powers. This makes it a more palatable form of science fiction. I didn't always get how they reached all their scientific breakthroughs but managed to follow what they were trying to achieve. There is a feel good international co-operation going on with help from China.<br/><br/>A couple of minus points. The set is a bit too much like a desert on Earth but I guess that's what Mars is like. Kind of wonder why they bother to go there if the planet is so unhospitable and it takes so long to get there. Even if it's hard to believe they would do all that to save 1 person the feel good aspect of the rescue is very enjoyable. There is much more to this movie than ""Gravity"".<br/><br/>Worth watching on the big screen."

In reality, what he does is an absolute feat of near future science, engineering and sheer human willpower and ingenuity.<br/><br/>As most book to move conversions go, this one is fairly faithful hence the 6/10.<br/><br/>I saw The Verge complain about the ending, but comparing the ending of the movie ending to the monologue ending in the book, the book's was far more moving. And the book's ending monologue was used for the promotional material for the movie but not in the movie itself... how dumb! In the end, they left out the almost getting lost in the sandstorm and the rover overturning, two highly tentative moments in the books.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting things about the book was the humor and the humor as a result of Mark's comments in his logs, most of which didn't make it into the movie. i.e when he repaired the machine that recycles water and how he does it and the way he interacts with NASA when they tell him don't touch it.

"bartonj2410","8","7","79","29 September 2015"," Further proof that Ridley Scott is at his best when doing sci-fi
","As a genre, sci-fi quite often provides audiences with both thrilling and thought provoking films. Over the past decade there have been some great entries into the genre from filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan and Alfonso Cuaron however, 2015 sees a director return to form in the genre he made his name in.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott is responsible for arguably two of the greatest sci-fi films ever made in Alien and Blade Runner, and while Prometheus may not have been a great prequel to the former in 2012, there is no denying that Scott is at his strongest when working within the genre. The Martian is Scott's latest venture into sci-fi and easily his best film in a while.<br/><br/>When astronaut David Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from the rest of his crew as a result of a storm during a mission on Mars, he is presumed dead by both his crew and everyone on Earth. <br/><br/>Stranded on Mars all alone, Watney must find a way to survive the harsh conditions of Mars while trying to communicate with NASA in order to get a rescue mission sent his way.<br/><br/>What struck me most about The Martian is that, for a film that runs for nearly two and a half hours, it absolutely flies by. Thanks to Scott's direction, a zippy screenplay from Drew Goddard and a superb central performance from Matt Damon, The Martian has an energy running through it that will make sure the audience doesn't lose an interest. Personally, I could have watched another half an hour of it.<br/><br/>The film also finds a perfect combination between comedy and drama, which led to a lot more laughs than I thought it would have. It exceeds in both, leading to an interesting take on the human fight for survival and one of 2015's most entertaining films.<br/><br/>Coming to the performance of Damon as the stranded Watney, which has to go down as one my favourites of the year so far, and arguably his best performance to date. Damon sells both the tough and vulnerable sides to Watney, remaining totally watchable throughout, which is important as he shares virtually no screen time with any other actor for the whole film.<br/><br/>The supporting cast isn't too bad either with Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Aksel Hennie and Chiwetel Ejiofor all playing a part in making The Martian such an engrossing watch. <br/><br/>The cinematography from Dariusz Wolski impressively captures the scope of just how isolated you could be on a vast planet like Mars while also making sure that Damon remains your main focus. There is also some great choices in music for a soundtrack that accompanies the film in such a fun manner.<br/><br/>The Martian doesn't reach the high intensity levels of recent sci-fi films such as Gravity or Interstellar but it doesn't have to. For an entertaining slice of sci-fi at the cinema, The Martian is the film for you. I will definitely have to make time to read the novel this is adapted from."

Well Ridley Scott definitely knows how. Lets face it, the man is stuck on MARS..he can only do so much. The movie starts off great..it will really keep your interest then it slows down...majorly. You will sit and think ""we'll it's got to be almost over..nothing else can possibly happen that hasn't already happened"" you will then look at your watch and realize you are only 1 hour and 30 minutes into the movie. (Knock off some minutes for all the previews you sat through) I never leave the theater but I got up and went to smoke a cigarette. Didn't have to worry about missing anything because NOTHING was happening. Once you get to the last 45 minutes of the film it picks back up and sucks you back. The author is right about one thing...it is a simple story/movie...which is why it could have been made into a 1hr and 45 min movie. I think my favorite part of the movie was that bad ass Lord Of The Rings reference. Totally made sitting there for 3 hours worth it., Gravity and Intestellar top The Martian. Sorry Matt Damon."

","If you're a sci-fi fan who's heavy on the science, there may be a few challenges in store for you here, but I grew up dreaming about space exploration, know more than most about the reality, and I was more than satisfied with this ambitious film.<br/><br/>I can believe there will be a whole new generation growing up with notions of being an astronaut between this film and the earlier 'Gravity'. It's interesting how both 'The Martian' and 'Gravity' manage to create an engaging story from the whole of what we know about space travel so far. There's something very seductive about that.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is the focus here. He plays an astronaut inadvertently stranded on Mars and thinking about this role, I imagine good actors could have very different interpretations. All I know is Damon's low key performance would be hard to top. You will be rooting for him throughout his unprecedented ordeal.<br/><br/>The other thing is the way Ridley Scott decided to treat Mars. His approach is not that complicated or cerebral. It's almost as if everyone knows Mars and doesn't have to be introduced to it. Instead he focuses on the people and the way they work together to help one of their own. The result is a strong movie where you care about everyone involved.<br/><br/>My wife, hardly a science buff, loved it. And I can't imagine anyone not being moved by it."

Jessica, the captain of the mission, rounds up everyone else and heads back home to Earth. Turns out that Matt was just knocked unconscious. The next mission to Mars isn't until about 4 years from now so Matt has to figure out how to survive that long. He has 30 days of food and supplies, which he can stretch a little, with all the other crew members now gone, but it won't last him 4 years. Man, it's a good thing that he is a botanist. Maybe he can figure out how to grow something. But then, he still needs water and someway to extend his battery power for things like air and a place to live in. Jeff plays the head of NASA and Chiwetel is trying to work out a plan to get Matt back home alive. While scrounging through his long gone fellow astronauts belongings, Matt does find some music but, unfortunately, it is nothing but disco music! Somebody better rescue him quick! FYI: The movie is being shown in 3D but it is not essential that it be seen in that version. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language, injury images and some brief nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental-one viewing was good enough."

","Simply an amazing combination of human emotion, science fiction story, special effects, and let's not forget pure thrills! One of Matt Damon's best film characters. ps. My viewing was in 3D which I thoroughly recommend. Science fiction aficionados tend to be sticklers for logical foundation before they can enjoy the story's progressions and theme. I'm one of those and have abandoned many a film from my enjoyment list due to poor establishment of logic and/or plausibility.

","The Martian (2015) : Movie Review ""Space isn't that cooperative, but human beings are!"" While most space fictions deal with the list line, The Martian stresses the second line, that we have a basic instinct to help others. A mission to Mars, an accident and a struggle for survival! This is what The Martian is all about. <br/><br/>Based on the book by Andy Weir, The Martian had a great story to deal with; A man stuck up in Mars, his fight for survival and the efforts by the humans to bring him home. Just look at the basic plot, this thing has something out of the world. But the plot is so unique that, this thing can easily formulate a boring tale; this is where The Martian makes a difference. The movie is laced with situational wits from the start to end, blended in layers of thrill; the comedy timing of Matt Damon as Mark Watney being the most gripping factor. I didn't expect such a character building; those dialogues just changed the atmosphere. Thanks that, we have ample amount of men on earth (read NASA) to beef up the trill factor, discussing and making space related stuff. While these things stand on one side, the riveting screenplay by Drew Goddard is what makes the viewer stick to seat, we always love to see something that is novel and The Martian has novel stuff in abundance; especially the hypothetical science matter! Though Watney's struggle is layered with humor and positive attitude, there could've been a better emotional approach, still no worries! <br/><br/>Coming to the making side, Ridley Scott, the maker of iconic science fictions, builds The Martian to the status of a solid space fiction. He made the imaginary plot into a 'could be based on real life' movie. The visuals were stunning with a deep feel of reality in it, the imagery of Mars being the most realistic ones. Even the outer space visuals were of standard quality; 3D works were spectacular, especially the ones in the beginning. Music by Harry Gregson-Williams was good at parts while Dariusz Wolski succeeded in capturing fresh frames. Editing was crisp without any boring sequences and the visual effects supervisor requires appreciation. <br/><br/>Matt Damon offers his career best performance as Mark Watney with unexpected sense of humor; chances for an Academy Nomination are high! Without his interesting performance, the movie would've been dry. Other noteworthy performances were from Jessica Chastain, Sean Bean and Jeff Daniels. Even Chiwetel Ejiofor's Vincent Kapoor was notable. <br/><br/>Overall, Ridley Scott's The Martian is a solid cinematic experience that not only entertains but also has something different. A movie that is embedded on the victory of human will power and courage; there were sequences where my spirit raised seeing the efforts by fellow human beings to save one. Though predictable, the climax offered a sense of satisfaction and happiness. Damn so realistic was the making! <br/><br/>Final Note: Must watch in 3D, for the ones who hunt for something different! But expecting an 'Interstellar' will offer disappointment for sure. <br/><br/>The house was fully packed for the 1PM show in Cinepolis CCPL Mall, Secunderabad. Real D 3D experience is something to the mentioned about. <br/><br/>Thank You"

","This is an enjoyable science adventure movie, but not to be taken very seriously. It delves into some interesting themes about survival on a hostile planet. The cast is solid and the acting is quite good. Matt Damon can act. But when I see a science fiction movie, I may need a limit on how far my suspension of disbelief has to carry me. In this movie, two immediate issues arise which I fought the rest of the movie. First, Mars has an atmosphere about 1% of Earth--hey, there is no air or atmosphere to speak of there. So the opening crucial plot-determining storm which sets up the movie is not believable--there's just not enough atmosphere to throw boulders around on Mars like that. We have had video from Mars for decades--it's quite peaceful and uneventful there. Second, and more challenging than that for me, somehow with all the elaborate technology they brought to and set up on Mars for their little colony, there was no hardware for radio transmission in all their equipment. Really?? They set up a working colony on Mars and the only transmitter was on the rocket they would use to return to Earth??? Made for a challenging circumstance for Damon. Still fun and worth watching. I liked it a bit more than Gravity."
"Argemaluco","9","5","53","3 October 2015"," The Martian
","The Martian is one of my favorite novels, and I had the fear that its homonym film adaptation wouldn't reach the amazing details of the book, its accessible handling of complex scientific concepts and, specially, the main character's pleasant ""voice"", who we end up knowing intimately after sharing years of his thoughts and emotions. On some way, my fears were correct; screenwriter Drew Goddard necessarily summarizes the premise and sacrifices many situations which seemed indispensable on the written page; but what we have is still a fascinating tale about touching tenacity and triumph of the human spirit. It doesn't matter whether the main character lives or dies... what matters is the fact that he never gives up. I'm not going to point out the differences between the book and the film; I'm sure there will be many articles about that on the Internet, analyzing and comparing both exhaustively. I will just mention that, on the beginning, the screenplay of The Martian feels a bit rushed. But that's a minor complaint which doesn't darken the many pros from this film, such as the excellent performances from the whole cast, highlighting Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain and, specially, Matt Damon as the eponymous ""martian"", who perfectly managed to balance his character's optimistic personality with his fear and occasional discouragement. Ridley Scott's direction is brilliant, and the special effects transport us to Mars with an impressive realism and scientific discipline. I also have to point out the fact that there isn't any fantasy or science fiction in The Martian (with the exception of the existence of crewed missions to Mars). In other words, don't expect any aliens or space battles; just an excellent tale about heroic human beings with the powers of science and determination. And a good sense of humor in order not to get mad into the loneliness of the red planet. Where's Dejah Thoris when you need her?"
"fernando-mendonca","10","4","40","4 October 2015"," A little different from the book, still excellent
","It is remarkable that the run time of this movie surpasses two and a half hours. After watching I felt that there was many points missing from the book and this was just a bit short (without realizing how long I was in the cinema). The acting was really good, with one notable exception, but there were a lot of ""holywoodianisms"". I understand they wanted to change the ending and suppress anything more adult in order to appeal to teenagers as well, but the balance of hard science fiction with an inclusive form of entertainment proved to be really tricky. Those who enjoyed all the explanations and scientific reasoning in the book will miss some of that, and yet, might feel surprised to notice the overlooked emotional journey of the protagonist is also compelling.<br/><br/>The earth bound characters were very well represented, except for Rich Purnell, which was the only disappointment. This character went from a workaholic that most hard science professionals will recognize as themselves or a friend to a goofy sketch of it. The crew was really well casted, but could not develop much given their shortened role in the movie, which is justifiable keeping the runtime in mind.<br/><br/>Finally, in my personal opinion, the rescue in the end that shifts the mentality from following strict military operations rulebook to Hollywood heroism does not necessarily means that the people involved did not understood the aim of the story. It merely shows how much they need to bend in order to acquire a wider public."

","Greetings again from the darkness. With this week's NASA announcement of the discovery of water on Mars, it seems necessary to point out that director Ridley Scott's latest was not actually filmed on the red planet, but rather in the Jordan desert. OK, maybe not necessary, but it does serve as a reminder that the film (based on the popular book from Andy Weir) may be filled with science  but it's also fiction – hence the label Science-Fiction. If you were one of THOSE who actually paid attention in science classes and read the optional material, then you will probably find much fault in the details. For the rest of us, it's a pretty fun ride.<br/><br/>Space has long been a popular movie topic, and a key to such favorites as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Alien, Aliens, The Right Stuff, Contact, Space Cowboys, Armageddon, Moon, and most recently Gravity and Interstellar. And of course there are the immensely popular franchises of Star Wars and Star Trek, which both chose a different path than the ""grounded"" nature of the others. This latest film may actually have as much in common with Cast Away as it does with any of the space-based films.<br/><br/>Commander Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and her crew (Matt Damon, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Askal Hennie) are hard at work on their Mars mission when a severe storm causes them to evacuate in panic mode. When the storm hits, Damon's astronaut Mark Watney is lost and presumed dead. Once it's realized that Watney survived and has every intention of being rescued, the film kicks into gear.<br/><br/>There are three separate stories we follow: the ingenious and spirited survival mode of Watney, the politics and brilliance of the NASA organization, and the crew who now believes Watney's rescue is their responsibility. The NASA group is led by director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and includes support work from Chiwetel Ejiofar, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, MacKenzie Davis, Donald Glover and Benedict Wong.<br/><br/>Taking the approach of an adventure film with the MacGuyver of all Botanists, Damon's charm and humor stand in stark contrast to the annoyances of the two leads from Gravity, and provide a mass appeal that should make this entertaining for most any viewer. This approach allows us to imagine ourselves stranded on Mars, and whether we would panic or consider ourselves Space Pirates. There is also a lesson here for all students out there  pay attention in Science class! For the rest of us  ""get your a** to Mars""!"
"themadmovieman","8","6","74","30 September 2015"," Fun, thrilling and beautifully directed
","This is a hugely exhilarating, entertaining and captivating film. With top performances from everyone in the stellar ensemble cast, beautiful direction from Ridley Scott, a consistently intense plot and a great sense of humour, this is such an enjoyable movie to watch.<br/><br/>So, let's start with the most pleasing part of this film: the fact that Ridley Scott is really back on form. The man who made classics like Alien and Blade Runner should never have lost credibility in the way he has done in recent years thanks to a string of very poor- performing films, but The Martian is a timely reminder why Scott really is one of the all-time greats of directing.<br/><br/>The Mars landscape in this film is one of the most beautiful and pristinely shot I've ever seen on the big screen, effortlessly drawing you in and convincing you so well. In effect, this film literally transports you to another world, as this man's terrifying ordeal on a planet millions of miles away from Earth is just so incredibly captivating.<br/><br/>Following on from that, the performances here are all very impressive. Matt Damon is fantastic in the central role, brilliantly combining his character's clear fear of the situation as well as his maverick, upbeat attitude to everything, which makes him an absolute joy to watch.<br/><br/>Alongside Damon, there is a plethora of A-listers, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, Michael Peña and Kate Mara, and all of them are excellent. Everyone puts in an energetic show that corresponds perfectly to this film's brilliant blend of intense emotional drama and hilarious comedy.<br/><br/>Seriously, this film is really funny, and although the level of humour never detracts from the intensity of the plot, the fact that there is often such a light-hearted vibe to it all (helped from time to time by a bizarre but oddly perfect 70s soundtrack) makes it such an enjoyable film to watch, adding to the excitement of the story all the more.<br/><br/>So, now the story. This is yet another piece of this movie that works sublimely, as the screenplay is filled with fascinating dialogue throughout, and the overall premise of the plot is hugely enticing.<br/><br/>Based on Andy Weir's book, the story is always exciting, full of action and genuinely unpredictable suspense. It's said a lot, but this film, more so than anything I can remember in recent years, is totally unpredictable. There is nothing that even gives you a whiff of whether Matt Damon will live or die in the end, and that is massively impressive.<br/><br/>Finally, the plot is also filled with great emotional drama. Again, it's not so heavy that the movie loses its fun factor, but it really works well at certain points throughout, bringing incredible poignancy to such an entertaining film."
"RichardSRussell-1","9","4","42","4 October 2015"," A Terrific Adaptation of a Terrific Novel
","The Martian reminds us that the first word in ""science fiction"" is SCIENCE!<br/><br/>The film adaptation is largely faithful to the novel by Andy Weir. In either format, this a terrific story!<br/><br/>Of necessity in a visual medium, the movie doesn't spend any time on the equations or similar wonkiness that gave the book its signature credibility. It likewise culls some of the realistic personality quirks that got only a page or so in the print version, including the feuding nerds, the Aspergerite nature of the orbital-mechanics genius, and the vulgar cynicism of NASA's chief PR flack. They were practically cinematic from the get-go, but the movie runs 141 minutes as it is, and the tertiary stuff was what got the axe. The film also trades in the book's barely noticeable dust cloud at the end of Mark Watney's Martian trek for a more visually exciting use of atmospheric propulsion to effect the orbital rendezvous, which also has the salutary benefit of dramatizing the crew of the Hermes as having a significant role to play in the rescue beyond merely agreeing to do it.<br/><br/>You can search on line for more differences between the book and the movie and Weir's reaction to them.<br/><br/>To achieve a PG-13 rating (a move I reluctantly support in order to reach a wide audience), the screenplay (by Drew Goddard) neutered the novel's occasional (and wholly justifiable) profanity. (Shoot, I was really looking forward to Watney's typographical representation of boobs.) We do get a brief nude rear view of a body double showing a skeletal Watney after months on ⅓ rations, but that apparently wasn't enuf to push it into R territory.<br/><br/>In compensation for the cuts, we get the sort of things that movies are really good at: visuals! Looks like Mars, looks like space, looks like JPL, looks like science geeks. We're also reminded that a whole lot of mechanical problems can be fixed using only duct tape to make things sticky and WD-40 to make them slippery. And that it's a good idea to hang onto those decades-old Earth-based mockups.<br/><br/>The most engaging aspect of the book — the crew's fierce loyalty to each other — is preserved intact. However, aside from Watney (Matt Damon), mission director Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ojiofor), and NASA chief Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), the rest of the cast doesn't get much individual screen time. But even the tiny performances are pitch-perfect. It's relentlessly and unapologetically international and gender-neutral, as is science itself. Good! Better than good — perfect, in fact — is the tune played under the end credits: ""I Will Survive"".<br/><br/>You can see the movie in 3-D (post-production conversion), but there's no particular reason to do so. Arid, monotonously rusty desolation looks just as forbidding and depressing in 2 dimensions, and 3-D's wasted on anything occurring in space, where there aren't any referents to provide a sense of scale or depth.<br/><br/>This film marks a return to form for Ridley Scott after the regrettable Prometheus and Exodus: Gods and Kings. No, it's not Blade Runner, but who (other than Stanley Kubrick) ever gets more than one masterpiece in a lifetime? He'll just have to settle for it being the best SF&F movie of the year."
"nlasser","9","4","42","4 October 2015"," Enjoyable feel good movie
","The title basically sums it up - the movie is constantly upbeat, optimistic, happy and amusing. Watney (Damon) almost never losses his composure, constantly turns lemons into lemonade and so on. The rest of the characters all exhibit the same can-do attitude, and the way you go with this will probably effect how you experience this movie - a guilty pleasure ride of optimism and belief in the human spirit and scientific prowess of humanity (well, NASA...); or as a very long, detailed and visually striking infomercial for NASA and the Mars mission goal.<br/><br/>Assuming you have chosen the first option, Damon is optimal casting. His character plays well into the Damon persona, and seemingly requires little effort on his side. Watney is likable, cutesy and well, slightly boring - you couldn't call him a protagonist as he doesn't really change or evolve. But, then again, that's true for all characters in this film. What little conflict there is is played out in calm and polite conversations, a hymn of professionalism and technocracy. And they all come out the same as they came in.<br/><br/>From all technical aspects - visual, cinematography, acting, direction, score - it's well-made. It is entertaining, interesting, suspenseful almost throughout despite the obvious end (spoiler: he doesn't die on Mars). Towards the end the can-do attitude is a bit too over the top and the finale plays out a bit like an extended Macgyver times 6 episode. This, with the epilogue, are actually the weakest part of the film.<br/><br/>I went with my family, and my kids (10, 11) loved every minute of it and in particular the realistic aspects of the film. That in itself was worth the price of admission."

","This is a sci-fi movie set in the near future. The Aries III Mars mission goes wrong, and an astronaut is stuck on Mars alone for years. The movie tells the story of his survival and rescue.<br/><br/>Despite its space theme, it's an old-fashioned, American kind of movie, with the emphasis on heroism, self-reliance and knowhow. It's a big epic that presents in full glory what a Mars mission might be like. This movie is a paean to America's manned space missions, and will appeal enormously to those who believe in American's manifest destiny. Balanced against the heroism of the astronaut is the geekiness of the tech guys back at mission control. In some ways, this movie is really about them. A major theme of the movie is the straight-up belief in the virtue of science and technology.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is the competent, engaging, masculine heart of the movie. Because of the subject matter, he is in almost every scene. Fortunately he is still watchable as hell. He does a great job here, especially near the end. He's just a great actor.<br/><br/>I'd give this movie a 9, except for one point: it got slow for a bit. This movie is relentlessly realistic. It's almost like watching a documentary. Having said that, I was deeply moved at times.<br/><br/>Kudos to Scott, Damon et al. for making such a great movie."

I think Ridley Scott made a mistake when he took Matt Damon to play a main role. No offense and do not misunderstand me here. For me Matt Damon still ""Mann"" from the ""Interstellar"" (2014) and a little bit ""Max"" from the Elysium (2013). He played almost every year in the movie that connected to space adventure, sci-fi fantasy and surviving. Honestly, became tired and difficult to switch from one role to another.<br/><br/>2. The tricky and exciting part reminds me ""Interstellar"" (2014), when you feel lonely in a space, death simple everywhere and nobody can help you. It was not so obvious as in ""Armageddon"" (1998) and ""Sunshine"" (2007), but not same good as in the ""Interstellar"" (2014) for me.<br/><br/>3. During watching ""Interstellar"" (2014) I was nervous, feared, shocked and even cried, but in ""The Martian"" (2015) I except, predict, guess and anticipate. I think main character less scared, depressed and desperate. It's actually reminds me ""Gravity"" (2013), which sort of cliché.<br/><br/>As a result I think it is a great movie after which you will have a positive mood and Ridley Scott will have something to talk about with Michael Bay and Christopher Nolan!"

A severe storm caught them off guard. Actually, they knew the storm was coming, but had no clue to its severity. A little far-fetched unless the writer includes in his screenplay WHY the astronauts are able to receive storm information, but not the severity of a storm.

Hollywood producers don't know a well-written script from a poorly written script. Probably because they have the attention span of a two-year-old and don't read a single script they green light.

","One of the most important works of literature in the Enlightenment, Daniel Defoe's ""Robinson Crusoe"" (1722) tells the long story of a shipwrecked sailor on an island that in its isolation could have been the equivalent of the planet Mars in the era of Defoe.<br/><br/>Three of the most memorable parts of the novel are recycled in Ridley Scott's big budget film ""The Martian."" The stranded astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), counts off the ""sols"" or years on his wall calendar, just as Robinson Crusoe marks the passage of time on his island. Crusoe also buildings with great care a home in a cave. It is the abandoned spacecraft that becomes the domicile for Watney. Finally, Crusoe nurses along a plot of corn in his little garden, which ensures his survival. So too does Watney plant a bountiful crop of potatoes within his spacecraft! The first half of ""The Martian,"" which works closely to Defoe's novel and depicts the survival skills of Watney, is the best portion of the film. Unfortunately, the second half lapses into a routine and overly sentimental plan of NASA to rescue the stranded astronaut, turning the film into a ""feel good"" experience about NASA and American patriotism.<br/><br/>But the film undoes itself with incompetence of the space crew that abandoned Watney in the first place. The inept NASA administrators and scientists are even outhustled by Chinese scientists, whose technology in rocket boosters allows them to play a key role in the rescue.<br/><br/>While the cast is filled with good actors, including Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Jeff Daniels, and Chiwetel Ejiofor, the film by design is a vehicle for Matt Damon. Most of the other characters have throwaway lines or strained dramatic close-ups as the essence of their characters.<br/><br/>Lengthy portions of Defoe's ""Robinson Crusoe"" are boring because the intent of the author was to demonstrate the loneliness and slow passing of time on the island. By contrast, the long stretches of time spent alone on Mars are filled for Mark Watney by disco music! Even Watney loathes the sound tracks that were left behind by his commander. Unfortunately, the audience has to suffer right along with Watney. For audiences watching the film at home on DVD, be prepared to hit the mute button on your remote."

","When was the last time they made a simple and humane out-of-the world movie? The theories of rocket science definitely are marring the beauty of film making in all the recently released movies of this genre.The Martian is the latest entrant in the category.After nearly two and half hours of being grilled, you are left with little to cheer for in the climax.Acting, cinematography everything was alright.But the biggest failure of this movie is that it never is gripping at any point of time.When this movie earned seven Academy Awards nominations, I was a bit worried that The Revenant may get defeated by it.But after finishing watching it, I am sure, it has chances of returning empty handed.Go, watch this movie only if you have ample time to waste."

","Haven't left a review for a while, but as I gave this film 0 chances and now having watched it and feeling guilty thought I would say some positive things about it. I'm not sure if it was because I went in expecting nothing, but the truth is I enjoyed this film. It's definitely one for those who enjoyed Castaway. I don't usually like Matt Damon films but I found myself routing for him in this one. So there must be some serious acting going on there. The flicks between NASA and Mars keep you from getting bored and the supporting cast is top notch. All in all a good film. Humorous in places and some real applied science (Interstellar) makes the film believable and not at all like the space ballet thing which was Gravity."

","I've been a science and sci-fi nut for more than fifty years and this was a great movie that had superb cinematography and lots of emotion. To the commenter's that thought it was vapid or banal and not acted well, I don't get it. When you watch the real live astronauts do their thing you don't get a lot of drama even when there is drama. To be a space person you have to be cool and calm or you die. I watched Neil take his first step and found that to be extremely emotional at the time. This movie has that kind of action. Sure there was some things that didn't seem like it would work in a real space situation but who cares the movie needed some artistic leeway. All in all a great movie."

"jkikianis","8","1","5","17 December 2015"," Emotional Human Stories with a Thrilling Backdrop of the Cosmos
","Ridley Scott has time and time again proved his ability to produce many of the greatest films of the Science-Fiction genre. In many ways this film particularly feels like a Science- Non Fiction. From the first shot of the film to the very last, this movie sucks the audience into a two and a half hour journey of quickly adjusting emotional experiences. <br/><br/>The Martian is funny, inspirational, thrilling, heartbreaking, and heartfelt. This movie often acts as a celebration of the ingenuity and perseverance of mankind. All of the visual splendor of space travel and the endless hills of this martian world are extremely convincing and captivating in their beauty. Despite the movie often celebrating the advancements of science and the exploratory endeavors of man, all of the space and science take a back seat to the core drama of the story which is entirely led by Matt Damon. <br/><br/>This film shows Matt Damon at his best with a subtle but wonderfully complex performance. Damon doesn't give the showy Oscar-bait performance but a very sincere and naturalistic portrayal of an intelligent and determined man, a guy that an entire audience can relate to and feel like they know by the end of the film. Ridley Scott's directing is amongst his best in this film, with a seamless introduction of a large ensemble of characters. Scott managed to keep me interest both on Mars with Watney, with the rescue crew, and with NASA on earth. The movie captures a wide range of emotions and despite the fact that I could tell what the ending was going to be from 15 minutes into the film, it's predictability didn't bother me. It wasn't as much about any sort of ending but more about the journey. <br/><br/>The film suffers from having several common clichés that are very repetitive of films like Apollo 13. It also seems to suffer from having a few too many secondary characters. Ridley made the decision to introduce each individual character with a tagline and job position which become somewhat irritating after awhile. Despite these flaws this film was successful in keeping me riveted for the entire runtime and it will undoubtedly be a contender for my top 10 of the year."

","I read the book The Martian by author Andy Weir a few months ago, and my excitement for the film adaption was through the roof. I stood in line to watch it on opening night and had to sit beside a stranger in the front row (no I did not go alone, my sister was with me. Whatever, I don't have to explain myself to you) because the theater was so packed.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT for my review, IT WAS WORTH IT.<br/><br/>There was a lot of reason for my excitement.<br/><br/>1. Read the book. Loved the book.<br/><br/>2. Set in space. I'm a SciFi fan (as evidenced by my 5 part review of the X- Files), although it's only slight fiction.<br/><br/>3. THE CAST<br/><br/>4. Ridley Scott directed it<br/><br/>The novel reads like a laymen's science text book with profanities sprinkled in. The film stayed true to that idea with a little Hollywood magic sprinkled in. Matt Damon said it was meant to be a ""love letter to science"". I promised myself that this review wouldn't be a movie vs. book argument, so I'll move on.<br/><br/>The Martian is set in space, but it's more realistic with a greater attention to detail than any movie since Apollo 13 (1995). Although I did prefer the visuals in Gravity (2013), I'm aware that there were a few scientific inconsistencies in that film. As a result, I would describe the genre as more ""science"" than ""fiction"".<br/><br/>I'm a half decent writer, I used to do some acting, and I love the idea of directing, but I've always believed that my real talent is in casting. It's almost the only thing that I think about when I read a book. This is a blessing and a curse. Well, just a curse really because I highly doubt I'll ever actually be a casting director. 9 times out of 10 I'm supremely disappointed by at least one actor in the movie. I am happy to report, though, that this movie was PERFECTLY cast. Not a single actor was lacking or out of place. After watching the trailer the first time, I went through a period of uncertainty about the Kristen Wiig choice, but I am happy to report that aside from Matt Damon, she may have been the highlight of the film for me.<br/><br/>Although her screen time was somewhat brief (less than it was in the book) she brought wit and intelligence and heart to her character Annie Montrose, NASA's PR Director. <br/><br/>She wasn't the only actor that surprised me. Donald Glover (Childish Gambino) of Community fame was also great in his role as a socially awkward genius Rich Purnell.<br/><br/>I was happy to see Kate Mara in the film as well, what with the disaster known as The Fantastic 4 not yet behind her. I won't go into that, but I would like to state for the record that I liked that movie and thought that she was adequate as The Invisible Woman. Although a very dark part of me was happy when Kevin Spacey pushed her in front of a train in House of Cards, it wasn't because she's a bad actress, it was because I hated her character which is a testament to her talent. She didn't have many lines, but still came across as endearing here.<br/><br/>It is my expressed opinion that Jessica Chastain is one of the greatest actresses of our time. Anyone who can go from The Help (2012) to Zero Dark Thirty (2013) without missing a beat should be rewarded with all the parts ever. OK, so that's an overstatement. But she really is quite the scene stealer. As great as this movie is, it's inevitable that there was going to be some cheesy dialogue (space odysseys and survival stories have a tendency to include that). Unfortunately for Chastain, all of that dialogue seemed to land on her. She executed it with poise and a commanding presence though. Although, it's possible that the dialogue was very realistic. It makes since that the Commander of a manned mission to Mars would probably take themselves and their job very seriously, especially under the circumstances that Commander Lewis is subject to. She was the first character in the book that I associated with a certain actor, and reading her I immediately thought of Chastain. She is Commander Lewis.<br/><br/>I would be here all night if I went in to each individual performance because they really were all quite impressive, so I'm going to skip to the guy putting the people in the theater seats: Matt Damon. I've been a Damon fan since seeing Good Will Hunting in the 5th grade. Like Chastain, he is one of the better actors of our time and I thought his performance here was electric. Some people were concerned that teaming he and Chastain up and sending them to space so soon after Interstellar was a mistake, but I doubt that anyone was thinking about Matthew McConaughey after they saw this movie. Damon was completely captivating as Astronaut Mark Watney, a man who's marooned on Mars after his crew is forced to evacuate the planet. It truly is one of the better performances of his decorated career.<br/><br/>I give the film a solid 9/10. I'm not giving it a perfect score because my opinion was tainted by having read the book first. Definitely a must see and a lot more visually rewarding in theaters. Bottom line? The Martian is a BLAST! (Pun very much intended)."
"thomasroberts-95109","9","1","5","13 December 2015"," A brilliant watch
","Speaking as someone who has an interest in science but is by no means an expert, I went into watching this film with an open mind and with minimal expectations. I had read a synopsis before watching and didn't have massive hopes, however I am pleased to say I was thoroughly impressed. I'm not claiming that this will go down as an all-time great necessarily but I would recommend this film to anyone without hesitation. For a serious sci-fi film, I was impressed with the subtle attempts at humour that managed to make me laugh without detracting from the intended nature of the film and I was genuinely gripped from the off. You can become attached to the characters and it is a fairly well built up story line. Obviously I can't comment on the scientific accuracy but I didn't see it as completely far fetched and it made for a great film."
"bclarkeucas","8","1","5","6 December 2015"," Great plot, really catches your emotions.
","After Interstellar we all know how eerie and empty space can seem, and the martian perfectly builds on this. This is a must see film, for anyone that loves a film that catches your emotion it is great. Matt Damon does a great job, it's as if he really has been stuck on mars before. Something about the idea of getting stuck on a planet that is 4 years from home, with no help for 2-3 years that really gives you the shivers. It's action from the start to the end, it gets into the movie plot really quickly, which I like. It is long, but definitely worth it.<br/><br/>Pros -Great effects. -Great plot. -Great acting. -Funny. -Unique.<br/><br/>Cons I can't think of anything bad about it."

","I watched this movie with my four friends. It is just a sudden decision, no one saw the clip before watching it. And even nobody have ever heard of it. But I personally think this movie is worth its value, costing me 63yuan, which is more expensive than any of movie in theaters.<br/><br/>To make a short comment, I think the shot of it is extremely splendid. But the story line is a little bit simple and boring, so it sometimes makes me feel a little tired and sleepy. Personally, I suppose some parts of it should be cut but not be kept.<br/><br/>Additionally, in some scene, the speaking part or the texting part are just taking too much time, and the reading part does not have its effect to make us feel affected. If cut some part, I might vote it 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>But I have to say, in the last part, when Mark Watney (Matt Damon) was rescued by the captain and the whole world were yelling at the same time, I was touched deeply.<br/><br/>I have to say, it is the best science movie this year, but it is not better than Interstellar."
"beyondthescreen481","9","1","5","3 December 2015"," My Review of the Martian
","Gravity, Interstellar, and now The Martian. Three big space epics in three years. So how does this one match up?<br/><br/>""I guarantee you that at some point, everything is going to go south on you. Everything. And you can either accept that, or you can get to work."" -Mark Watney The Martian is a film about an astronaut on Mars, Mark Watney, who gets hit by some debris in a storm and is killed. His team leaves his dead body there and begins there journey home. But Mark is still alive. Now he has to get back to base, staple his own wound shut, and examine his options. Unfortunately, all of them result in his death. But he won't accept that. So he has to make contact with NASA, and figure out how to get food and water on a planet with no water, and food doesn't grow there either. Lucky for him, he's the greatest botanist on the planet.<br/><br/>So I'll say up front: I love this movie. What's not to love? There's a great cast playing great characters, the visuals are stunning, and to top it all off, legendary director Ridley Scott is at the helm. But like most films, it has it's flaws. Two of them, to be exact. First of all: in the climax of the film when Mark reaches for Commander Lewis' hand and slips, he grabs on to the tether. As Lewis is pulling Watney towards her, her head moves inside her helmet. The scene naturally, should have been tense and dramatic, which it was, until this happened. It looked ridiculous, and it made me laugh. Of course, I shouldn't have been laughing in that scene. Secondly, and most notably, there was a half an hour where the film just loses Watney. While the scenes on Earth were beautifully executed, the real action is on Mars. It was a significant blow to the film to lose Mark for so long. But none of that matters anyway because The Martian is in fact one of the greatest films of the year, overshadowed only by July's Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation."

","The Martian: Ridley Scott is back with a Sci-fi masterpiece! He is still one of the best directors of space movies. The movie is a love letter for technical geeks.

The most terrified scene impressed me a lot is Mark do the surgery to himself, so real, so shocked. The commander Lewis looks very sexy when she wears NASA hoodie. I suppose that she must work out regularly. Without the contribution of CHINA, the rescue could not be so successful. Shouldn't I be proud of my motherland? :) My questions are below: 1. Why is there no communication system in the living cabin on Mars? 2. There can not be a huge storm on mars, because the atmosphere on Mars is rare. 3. Why do not the spaceship come back for Mark immediately while the crews get to know Mark is still alive? 4. Why can not the spaceship land on Mars to get Mark back?"

","Movie Review – The Martian 12184434 Jeong Su Jin The Martian is a 2015 movie directed by Ridley Scott. Matt Damon is the leading actor in this Science Fiction movie based on the novel by Andy Weir. Even though it is a Science Fiction movie, it gives an impression of humanism that everybody cooperates to rescue one person and a lesson that a positive mind, and execution without hesitation will help someone to overcome their difficulties. Matt Damon's acting will keep viewers engaged in the story. Moreover, the background scenery looks real and it gives us the feeling that we are seeing the real Mars. <br/><br/>The film is set in the near future when people are able to explore Mars. Matt Damon plays Mark Watney, who is a member of NASA Ares exploration team which is sent to explore Mars. In the beginning, he is left by his colleagues because they think he is killed by a sandstorm. However, he is actually alive and struggles to survive while lacking basic things such as food or water and facing tough circumstances. Fortunately, he succeeds in sending a signal to the Earth that he is alive. Therefore, NASA tries to rescue him from Mars and everyone in the world hopes he will return safely.<br/><br/>Outstanding points that make this movie successful are the sets and special effects. It was actually filmed in the Jordan desert. The desert combined with Computer Graphics produced a realistic background. The props are also perfect, such as displaying real potato plot and showing space stations and spacesuits. Moreover, presenting real Mars time (SOL-solar time on Mars) makes the movie more realistic. These facts made story feel real and keep audiences absorbed in the movie. In addition, Matt Damon's acting is faultless. He shows his inner emotions well in the situation where a man is isolated in Mars for a long time. Viewers would sympathize with his solicitude and difficulties in a strange place.<br/><br/>I recommend watching this movie on the big screen because it has a better effect. It is a well-produced film in terms of technical effects and the framework of the story, so it will appeal to all audiences whether they are interested in science fiction or not. From an entertainment angle, the huge film production costs are truly worthwhile and it is money well spent."
"tenyearreunion","8","1","5","18 November 2015"," Unsure the first time, much better on the 2nd viewing.
","So I was recommended this film by those who had read the book. I knew nothing about it before I went in apart from the great cast and that the (sorry but true) once great Ridley Scott was directing.<br/><br/>I try to write non-spoiler reviews so I will not go into the plot, there are plenty of others before me who have taken the time to do that.<br/><br/>What I will say is that after I walked out the first time, I was a little underwhelmed. Not disappointed. Just I maybe expected a bit more jeopardy with a movie plot set on Mars.<br/><br/>Afterwards I realised why. The last space movie I saw was Gravity, which was, quite simply, armchair clinching! One dramatic, near death scene after another. I was being unfair to draw comparisons and I felt a longing to give it another go.<br/><br/>So, using my certain 'go as many times as you like' cinema card, I sneaked off and saw The Martian again. I enjoyed it much more on a second viewing. I soaked in the cinematography, the comedy, the soundtrack! The plot is really enjoyable and I could very easily watch this again. The Martian will probably be in my Blu Ray collection when released. Odd, you might say, considering I didn't rate it all that much after first viewing. I have a mantra, never really judge a film you've watched until a good 24+ hours later. Even films I thought were awesome first time may not beat the test of 2nd or 3rd viewings and drop a good few points.<br/><br/>After the DIABOLICAL and UNFORGIVABLE 'The counselor' Mr R Scott has gone some way to trusting his gravitas on a film credit again. Though in my book Mr Scott owed me £11 I spend on that excruciating experience.<br/><br/>The great Dr Kermode from Wittertainment believes if given a decent script, Ridley Scott can deliver a great film. This is proof of it. So I hope he chooses his next few projects carefully and send them back to the writers if they're rubbish.<br/><br/>Thanks."

","The underlying premise of a man being stranded in a hostile environment and having to survive isn't exactly new. But just like that other great ""marooned"" movie, ""Castaway,"" I was fully engaged and enthralled with what was happening on screen.<br/><br/>Damon gives a great sympathetic performance, imbuing his character with some snarky, albeit good-spirited wit, as he deals with the multiple obstacles the inhospitable Martian environment throws at him.<br/><br/>I was totally engaged watching him ""science the sh!t"" out of everything. I can't remember the last time the main character in a movie was a botanist, but it really works with Mark Watney. He displays ""MacGyver-like"" ingenuity to overcome the multiple deficits of being on Mars.<br/><br/>The production values, as is to be expected with Ridley Scott, are immaculate. All the visual and special effects look completely realistic, and the supporting cast all do a great job of keeping the movie rollicking at a quick beat.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" is a great adventure story with a ton of heart and intelligence, that, although it has no violence and the antagonists are simply the Martian environment and the limitations of humankind, had me completely glued to the screen."

The idea sold me 100% and I downloaded instantly. I was on deployment at the time for 7 months so I did a lot of reading on my down time. Let me just say this. I could not put the book down and I couldn't read it fast enough. It was that good!!! I was even more excited when I saw that the movie got a green light.<br/><br/>OK, the movie. Obviously, it would be impossible to cram every bit of detail from the book into the movie. But the film adaption was great. I did feel like as an audience member that we (the viewers) were just along for the ride. We were being shuttled from one event to the next. There was key things missing from the movie that explained a lot of the decisions the main character was making.<br/><br/>Overall, great movie, better book.

In what could have easily echoed Warner Bros.' award-winning space disaster epic, 'Gravity,' 'The Martian,' rather, not only evokes an optimistic outlook on space exploration but also injects a rebellious dose of realism and humor despite its eccentric protagonist being stranded 140 million miles from the planet we call home.<br/><br/>Reserving its 'Gravity' parallels to the beautiful CGI crimson storm of an opening sequence, echoing 'Alien'-like helmet lamps in the process, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) is subsequently forced to withdraw her exploration crew from the red planet. Although the team of Kate Mara, Aksel Hennie, Sebastian Stan, and a delightful Michael Pena escape Mars in one piece – Chastain's Melissa made the strenuous decision of abandoning Botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) after being separated by the storm and impaled by a radio antenna, suggesting his suit has been severely breached. Yet, the very antenna that stranded Watney also plugged the breach, which in itself is a miracle if it wasn't immediately overshadowed by the fact that he's also trapped on Mars with only enough sols (Martian days) of food to last just over a year; the next mission arrives in 4. Henceforth, Watney is tasked with growing food on a planet where nothing grows; finding water on a planet where none flows (as of filming); and communicate with NASA millions of miles away – all of which Watney accomplishes with a smile, witty self documentation, and survival proficiently that would make Les Stroud proud and Neil Armstrong weep.<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW HERE: http://indieadam.com/2015/10/01/the-martian-review-indieadam-tiff- 2015/"

","In short, it is yet another story of a castaway. This time he is on Mars, alone and left for dead. This film is the work of the master of the genre: Ridley Scott (Alien, Prometheus ...). The effects and scenery are very realistic. As a strictly science fiction movie, we can't ask for more. However, the drama misses the mark. The acting miserably lacks passion and intensity. Again Matt Damon, this Hollywood ""pretty boy"" plays out in one of his two trademark registers: the ""good guy"" or the ""eternal teenager."" This time he offers us the first. Never do we really believe in the hopelessness of our hero. One can only imagine what Leonardo DiCaprio would have done with this role. DiCaprio has become in my opinion, the best American actor of his generation. As for the others, a lot of talent is left stranded. Jeff Daniels, who is capable of so much madness on screen, is like a robot and unfortunately the immense talent of Jessica Chastain boils down to close-ups of her luscious lips. For a realistic glimpse of the future of space exploration, it is a very good film. Nothing revolutionary as was ""2001 ..."", but very competent. The drama though, misses the target and the film is far too optimist for my taste."

","Andy Weir's novel of the same name, originally self-published in 2011, was quickly optioned by 20th Century Fox as its popularity soared. Ridley Scott ultimately helmed its translation to screen which was released in October of 2015. It tells the story of Mark Watney, a botanist aboard the Ares III, a manned mission to Mars, who must, as he put it, ""science the sh*t out of this"", in order to survive. Audiences are treated to a lone man against nature whose superpower is ingenuity. However, the jocular tone prevents us from making a connection with Watney. Instead of seeing him agonize over lost family (he mentions his parents once but has no partner or children), wrestle with faith, doubt his abilities, or even feel the effects of a prolonged isolation since time whisks forward fairly briskly, Watney is neither given a chance to overcome a character flaw nor are we able to truly sympathize with his situation. His video journals are filled with too many jokes about disco music. In keeping with the lighthearted tone, we know all too well that he will overcome all obstacles and ultimately return to Earth. But we don't watch just to see him do those things, we watch to see our protagonist learn something of himself, or of society, making the climax all the more triumphant.<br/><br/>The film is more successful with its scenes on Earth. We are privy to the closed-door negotiations about how to retrieve Watney safely. They calculate the risks and benefits of telling Watney's crew he is alive, about advancing the timeline of their next mission, about skipping safety checks, about partnering with the Chinese NASA counterpart, and about the overall cost of resources to rescue a single man. These discussions were filled with drama. But again, as these discussions span the course of years, we do not feel like we are among the world citizens gathered in their public squares in rapt attention watching the live coverage of his rescue. <br/><br/>Though perhaps unfair to make direct comparisons to other films, The Martian does call to mind 2013's Gravity. Gravity, though perhaps suffering from its overt attempts at allegory, was both more visually stunning and engaging precisely because of its focused timeline."

","I think this is the first ever astronaut movie I've seen where no one dies. <br/><br/>The movie has good comedy and a predictable outcome despite my initial comments, however getting from A-B is beautifully done. <br/><br/>Matt Damon done a fantastic job,and his performance stood out against all others through his humour and video logs.<br/><br/>There is a couple of questionable performances by some of the supporting staff, however they don't take up too much of the screen time.<br/><br/>Its great to watch Watney figure out how not to starve, by making produce on a barren planet, then its all most heart broken to see it all blow up. Don't think he will eat potato again.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Its a good movie and is well worth the watch."
"AliceofX","7","1","5","11 October 2015"," Better Than The Book
","What I liked about the film was that, unlike the book, it had more gravitas. You felt the seriousness of Mark Watney's situation. It had more emotion and more human character. The film also had less swearing and crude humour, and I never thought that I would ever be saying that about a book.<br/><br/>But the film also inherited some of the books flaws. My biggest dislike is that it lacked a sense of time. You didn't feel just how very long he'd spent on Mars, you were just told that. And I think too much time was spent back on Earth and it really took away from the sense of isolation that should have been there.<br/><br/>My final big flaw is the uneveness of the film. I didn't like the beginning of the film as it felt rushed and they were just cramming everything in. The ending however I loved. It was exciting, nerve racking and everything you'd want out of a movie like this.<br/><br/>Matt Damon did a great job in correctly portraying everything that was likable about Mark Watney. And it's just nice to see a smart person that isn't another House-esque smug, arrogant Genius. The rest of the actors did a good job as well.<br/><br/>Overall I think I liked this movie better than the book. It's very recommendable."

","Respected and loved me dearly Ridley Scott managed to work through this project to remember about who he was at the very beginning of his career. Then he was directed, cause a person to fight for their lives away from home at a distance of hundreds of millions of kilometers. If while in the cult of his cosmic horror man had to confront an alien creature, then he will have to survive here for overcoming severe living conditions in a hostile environment for the human body. And having the experience of staying in the uninhabited planets, Matt Damon had to once again feel in the shoes of Robinson already present, where his main ally in overcoming hardships will unwillingness to die away from family and work, and the undying hope of salvation.<br/><br/>Given that everything that happens in the main action is set in one location and the changes themselves will be very few places on Mars, of course, in the world which have already managed to bury our Whitney and the ship ""Hermes"". Because of this talented screenwriter Drew Goddard (or might he ""Martian"" supply) had a little change, some episodes of the novel by Andy Weir, in order to show visuals harsh beauty of the landscape of Mars filmed operator Dariusz Wolski. The atmosphere of the planet on which we could once fly, was transferred majestically unfriendly. It follows from this fact that the material part is made for Hollywood, in a good way, qualitatively. Although portions of the equipment for themselves drawn attention to a lesser extent, when compared to the book, it is clear for what reason, but was saved most necessary. The soundtrack with the music selection pleasing to the ear, and in one of the scenes associated with a trip to Mars rover makes it sound smile, by the way, all the content is not very serious.<br/><br/>However, we must not forget that this is a misfortune turns people were completely ""ass"" (he ""Robinson"" in plain text and declares its position by contacting the heads of NASA). Here it was important to present in front of us is not surrendering a person to survive on the Martian station that the team under the direction of Ridley Scott later came true and realistic. For the hero feel anxiety, worry, worry, follow all his actions and think how would that not so he would not welled harm (here's what it means when you do not read the book and did not know her final). Also, absolutely all the characters Scott unlike Nolan participants flight to the black hole, looks much more like human beings, because of sneering jokes, just a word, without unnecessary pathos and exposure. And what comes from the Martian sarcasm farmer! Matt Damon all our people will handle the beds of potatoes, with the eternal smile on his face, and with the inner grief of his family and of mother earth.<br/><br/>Be sure, if you look, the only cinema on the big, huge screen! You make sure that the space fiction not forgotten how to shoot. And, perhaps, no, just smiles from the humor of an available here. Enjoy the music of the disco era (thanks for David Bowie and «ABBA», and not only them) from which drags the captain (Jessica Chastain) expedition, our hero she is slightly dislike. Of course, the arrangement does not claim to be the ideal of science fiction, but the flight itself, as well as staying in the open space is quite good shows at ""Gravity"" Cuaron (and indeed, they are similar in many ways, as by the Spirit). Especially with a warning to future generations about the dangers of the development of the universe, and with it, the film speaks about the most banal, the value of the life of one man, about joy not forget. As a whole most of the problems of colonization of new planets in the future. Few well as agriculture in the distant parts of the universe to us, and the people who sacrificed their time to save the strong spirit of botany too often used in emergency tape.<br/><br/>Strong representative of its genre in the category of science fiction films, which gives a realistic picture of Mars, with almost science-based! An important project for Ridley Scott to restore it in the eyes of the public and the world of cinema, with the actor, surviving on the remoteness of the fourth planet from the sun, play its one of the best and strongest roles in his career. Especially since one of the few film adaptations of contemporary literature, created with respect to the author of the book and its reader. Also, the viewer is not familiar with the novel, in my humble opinion, the end must remain satisfied by what he saw as the final one can only applaud in disbelief that happened a miracle. But those who do not like the picture, you can only sympathize, because they do not believe in the old days Ridley Scott and general brake. And he also had the chance, whom he took very well, and most importantly, right!"

","The Martian is about a crew of NASA astronauts in the year 2050 conducting a mission on Mars. The movie begins as Mark's crew tries to rescue him after leaving him behind after a severe storm. Mark's crew members left him behind thinking that he died due to atmospheric pressure. However, Mark managed to survive using all the practical skills he acquired during college and training at NASA. Mark needed to survive 561 sols, or days, with the food he was left at the now abandoned Mars station. The same crew that left him are now aware of his survival, and try to rescue him. Mark makes contact with NASA on Earth and is informed of how many sols it will approximately take for the crew's voyage. Each day Mark journals the days he has left and the progress he makes of farming and rationing food. Somehow, Mark used all his resources efficiently for survival of 561 days until his crew returned for rescue. By the end Mark barely makes it out of Mars with his crew mates that initially stranded him there in the first place. <br/><br/>This film is clearly well directly and detail oriented of each scene. The director did an entertaining job on the scientific knowledge a variety of different sciences such as botany, the study of plants. This was very important because Mars is considered arid and thought to be uninhabitable. His variety knowledge of chemistry and bacteria understanding helped him create water and food. ""You can't expect anything when you're there,"" was stated by Mark Watney to student astronauts by the end of the film. The movie clearly led up to that ending phrase since the audience did not know what other skill Mark would be hiding up his sleeve. The film indicated that they did the proper research with the book, making sure it was consistent for the film industry and the book readers. <br/><br/>The Martian had qualities similar to Cast Away, where the protagonist is on a journey back home. These types of movies are important because they all derive from the Greek Iliad the Odyssey. The Martian took into a futuristic twist to its setting. This film definitely appeals to young male teenagers and all movie fans looking for a good adventure. Although in some scenes, my eyes began to get heavy, the Martian needed some improvements regarding their storyline. The ending was very predictable and I already knew from the beginning that Mark was going to be saved. I suppose the director attempted to keep consistent with the book, but not all films have to follow the structure of the book. I would recommend watching this film if you are interested in science and beautiful scenes. The pictures and scenes are beautiful, however there are very few plot twists. Plot twists are what keep an audience interested and awake. In an interview the director, Ridley Scott states that ""I'm a movie maker, not documentation. I try to hit the truth."" From his film with the Martian, I can see how he tried to keep everything as realistic as possible. He made an accurate interpretation of our technology in the year 2050. From the small detailed to the NASA technology to the scenery of Mars, this film could honestly make the audience believe that this film is a documentary of the future. Scott's representation of the truth has entertained millions world-wide this weekend and has made me satisfied with my ticket purchase."
"rogerdarlington","Null","4","44","4 October 2015"," In some respects, even better than the enjoyable novel
","f you were an American astronaut accidentally stranded alone on Mars an average of 140 million miles away from home, how would you feel? Fear, rage, despair? Except for a few four-letter expletives, Mark Watney sometimes seems as annoyed by the limited choice of music he can access as by the likelihood that he will suffocate or starve. But, listen, this is a guy who has been carefully selected and highly trained - and, what's more. he's a botanist with a huge tolerance of potatoes and a sense of humour.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the novel by Andy Weir and, as I read it, I thought that it would make a good film - and it does. In some respects, the movie is better than the book, thanks in good part to scriptwriter Drew Goddard: a more dramatic opening and a slightly extended ending, less science and fewer calculations, less time on Mars, and more humour - and, of course, the music and the visuals. Visually, it is not up there with ""Gravity"" and I didn't feel that the 3D added much, but it does look good whether we are on Mars (actually Jordan) or in space or at mission control. And, of course, we would expect no less from director Ridley Scott who has given us such classics as ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"".<br/><br/>Some of the casting is excellent: Matt Damon as The Martian, Jessica Chastain as mission commander, Jeff Daniels as head of NASA. But other casting choices are odd: British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (whose parents are Nigerian) playing a character of Asian descent, Sean Bean as the only Brit at NASA - actually the flight director - for no apparent reason, Kristen Wiig wasted in a very minor role.<br/><br/>So this is not a knock-out movie like ""Alien"" or ""Gravity"" and it is a bit long, but it has the drama of ""Apollo 13"" and it is much more credible (and understandable) that the recent ""Interstellar""."

I am not a scientist, but i can guess the movie is full of imprecisions, nonsenses and ridiculousness.

"jmoneyjohal","Null","4","46","3 October 2015"," A ambitious, and endearing story, but a flawed one. Martian is a one time watch.
","Okay I am going to be in the very small majority that didn't love Martian, and believe me after reading the rave reviews etc, I really tried to love it but maybe it the sky high exceptions, made the film a okay/good watch at best .My theory for not loving the film is exactly what Matt Damon's character says in the film ""we got to science the heck out of this"", meaning for me the film had too much science, numbers, etc, I didn't find that kind of stuff that interesting this time around in Martian, but its surprising because, I thought Interstellar was amazing, maybe that was the Nolan affect, I don't know. But the film was still fairly good in my eyes, because,just think how hard it would be to be survive on earth if you very left with almost nothing and stranded on a deserted island.Now forget about earth, and think about the same conditions but on mars. Yeah its like a million times worst. So Martain does make for an endearing story, and the VFX in the film is simply amazing. The films starcast is also something to marvel over with the likes of Matt Damon,Jessica Chastain,Jeff Daniels, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. But as I stated above I had problems with the film that muddled my experience, but more on that later.<br/><br/>Story wise the film is about NASA astronaut Mark Watney, and how after a storm hit Mars, his team has to leave back for earth, but Mark gets hit by a metal object in the wind storm, and is left on Mars, after his team thinks he is dead. Mark however survives, and soon figures out through the help of his botany expertise how to survive on Mars for a long time. Soon NASA realizes that Mark has survived also, and they try in which ever way to help Mark, but it will take at least 400 days before they can send someone back to Mars to get him back home.The rest of the story is about if Mark can survive on Mars, and make it back to earth safely.<br/><br/>Acting wise the whole ensemble was pitch perfect. Matt Damon leads the way in one of his career best roles, his character is very endearing, and one feels like routing for him. Jeff Daniels has become the every so dependable actor and proves it again in this film. Chiwetel Ejofor is great, and his reaction in the rescue mission is priceless. Out all the NASA team members Jessica Chastain gets the meatiest role and is good.<br/><br/>See I believe and this is just my opinion so beware, that if your not into science or a science geek at many junctures your going to be left dis interested while watching Martain. The film gets too much into the nitty gritty science facts numbers etc , and at times it feels like the film is not moving or nothing interesting is happening. For example you felt bad for Damon's character, and when he grew crops etc you were amazed but after a point you feel as Damon's character has adjusted to Mars and has no desperation. Also a lot things happen in the film really easily like when Mark finds the camera etc.The film has so much dialogue at one point you feel like the film is moving at snails pace,the film definitely needs a shorter length. But Martain also has many amazing features. Like the VFX for example is outstanding, Mars, and space never seemed so real, and beautiful. The films beginning, and especially climax are great, and the whole Damon, and Chastain scene in the climax will get your heart pounding. There are many scenes that evoke some laugher, and many scenes where you feel like clapping when Mark comes through with a break through on mars. And films is very detailed in all its research, the films crew definitely did its homework.<br/><br/>Overall all negatives withstanding, watch Martian because one can see the kind of ambition that went into this Ridely Scott directorial, and there are enough good things in the film like the VFX, acting, climax etc to warrant one viewing, just don't go in the cinema hall with huge expectations. <br/><br/>3.25/5* or 6.5/10"

","Sadly I don't think the film has clicked in me yet, when the initial reaction would be 'WOW', but my reaction was 'okay' Now I am defiantly sure that The Martian was a terrific film, but I am not with it yet. I'm not saying it's a bad at all, but I have a few thoughts that may make more my level.<br/><br/>Firstly the film, tells the survival story of an astronaut stranded on Mars after his teammates believe he is dead and leave. Our solitary space man must then calculate how much time and food he has left, before he can be saved, leading him to grow potatoes on Mars's soil. Now this narrative absolutely had me, however I feel differently after viewing this.<br/><br/>The film is packed with great cinematography and special effects that gave you're a great idea of what the red planet may hold. I can promise that there are moments that will leave you breathless. Matt Damon portrays his character brilliantly (Not Oscar worthy but good), and great screenplay, with new dialogue not seen in many sci fi's. The film also is packed with comedic moments that give the film an entertaining vibe.<br/><br/>Although I will say that there are elements that I would change, but I fear I would make many fans angry. However, I recommend this to all major film fans, so you can decide what this film is. I give it an 8/10 but think the film could be more intense, exciting and enjoyable."

","This was a weird experience. I just expected it to be a pretty dark, serious film (along the vein of interstellar). I purposely always avoid trailer for fear of spoilers, and so I was not prepared at all for how light and humorous the film is. Upon checking the screenwriter being Drew Godard, it made sense, but i guess all the humor in a space film (just because Gravity and interstellar are so fresh in the mind) threw me off guard. I appreciated it as much as I disliked it. I felt like the humor was pretty off at times, and the film didn't warrant its running time. It tried to cram in a lot of characters. But on the flipside, there's such a genuine good-heartedness to the whole thing. It managed to make the earth scenes work, and of course Matt Damon's scenes are aces. I'm just not sure how much I liked it, but this is definitely less of a passion film than both Gravity and Interstellar. I don't see it making any big awards splash in a few months, it's just too light and dare I say it, disposable?"

","From BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Sir Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Prometheus), this cleverly titled space film I debated seeing at first, having average reviews, but I went for it. Basically a temporary artificial habitat called The Hub has been established on the planet Mars by the crew of the manned mission Ares III, they are to stay for 2 months and return to Earth in their orbital probe. However, 6 days into the mission the base is hit by a massive Martian storm and they are forced to abandon and launch themselves, to avoid the escape vehicle collapsing and leaving them stranded. While evacuating, astronaut Mark Watney (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Matt Damon) is hit by a large piece of debris and disappears into the rushing planet dust, he is presumed dead as his biomonitor is damaged, mission commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and the rest of the crew with their lives at stake are forced to leave Mars. Watney has in fact survived the storm and makes it back to the Hab, but he is unable to contact NASA, he calculates that he has 300 days of food, uses his knowledge as a botanist to make a makeshift farm in the central room of the habitat, and anticipates needing to survive at least three years before a return mission to the planet takes place. Mark makes video logs to keep up morale and plans to journey to the landing site of Ares IV, he modifies the rover for capability to travel long journeys. Satellite photos of Mars are received at NASA, engineers Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis) realise Mark is alive, they immediately attempt to establish contact, against the decisions of the Hermes spacecraft flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean), NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) orders that the crew of Ares III, currently travelling back to Earth, are not told. Back on the surface of Mars, Mark finds defunct probe the Pathfinder, he uses it to regain contact with Earth, using the probe camera and signs for a letter coding system, later on Mark establishes real-time text messaging from NASA in the modified rover. As Mark continues to grow his crops, a plan is formulated by crew supervisor Mitch Henderson and JPL director Bruce Ng (Sunshine's Benedict Wong) to send a space probe to Mars to resupply Mark to last up to four years until Ares IV can reach him, Sanders speaks to the press about the discovery of Mark living on the planet, and he authorises Henderson to send a video message to the crew to tell that Watney is alive. But probe inspections are skipped and it explodes during launch, Mark meanwhile suffers his own disaster as the airlock on the habitat malfunctions, it explosively decompresses, his crops are killed, his projected food supply is reduced and he resorts to strict rationing. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) offer NASA a lifeline, a classified booster can carry a payload, this can be sent to Mars to resupply Mark, or resupply the Hermes so that the Ares III can return to the planet and rescue Mark, Lewis and her crew agree to force Sanders to go ahead with the second option, by setting their craft into a gravitational slingshot back to Mars, the resupply mission is successful and the crew begin the return journey. Seven months later, Mark has driven all key life support systems to the Ares IV mission base, he strips down the Area IV launch vehicle (placed on Mars in advance) to save weight, following instructions from Kapoor, his spacesuit will be used to protect against the vacuum of space. The Hermes reach and orbit Mars, the Ares IV is launched remotely, but Mark's vehicle fails to achieve the altitude needed to be intercepted, an explosive device rupturing an airlock to release the ship's atmosphere and generate thrust is improvised to slow the Hermes down without wasting fuel, still too far away Mark makes the drastic decision to pierce his suit hand and use the suit's pressure to come close enough for Lewis to catch him. In the end Mark returns to Earth to begin ""day one"" of his new life as a NASA safety instructor for new candidates to the astronaut training program, and the crew members watch the news of the successful launch of Ares V. Also starring Kristen Wiig as Annie Montrose, Michael Peña as Rick Martinez, 127 Hours' Kate Mara as Beth Johanssen, Sebastian Stan as Chris Beck, Aksel Hennie as Alex Vogel and Donald Glover as Rich Purnell. Damon as the man trapped on the red planet is a great amiable character, making wisecracks to himself along the way, you definitely want him to be rescued, and there is great support from Chastain, Daniels and Ejifor. If you were to describe this, you could plonk together Cast Away and Apollo 13, but there is a film titled Robinson Crusoe on Mars you could mention as well. What is really good about this film is the choice of music throughout, the lead character is forced to listen to disco tunes, and the choices of songs used are inspired, including ""Hot Stuff"" - Donna Summer, ""Waterloo"" - ABBA, ""Starman"" - David Bowie, and the genius choice is ""I Will Survive"" - Gloria Gaynor. The first half of the film is really effective with the man, the ""martian"" of the title (no aliens are ever seen), desperate to survive working for his needs, the middle trails a little with scientific gibberish, but it picks by the last half an hour with the crucial rescue, overall it is a worthwhile science-fiction drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects. Good!"

","Before I went to see this in the theatres, I was expecting it to be a very good movie, and I had in my mind that it would be nominated for at least some Oscars and probably get the Oscar for best achievement in Visual effects. Now I'm almost sure this movie will not receive any Oscars. I didn't like the visual effects very much, but they didn't use a lot of CGI, so I'm assuming they were not trying to get that Oscar. I liked the cinematography, the acting was good too, but I don't think its going to give Matt a nomination for best leading role. Now about the story: I think they could have made a much better adaptation. I was a little disappointed with the movie, because I was expecting some deads. Nobody dies in the movie. Not even Sean Bean (this is almost a twist). I don't know. I liked the movie, but there is definitely something missing. I give it a 7/10.

","I just came from the theater and I have to say that this movie is hands down one of the best this year. It's dramatic, funny, and suspenseful all at the same time and it's filled with a ton of heart. This is a bit of a return to form for Ridley Scott in my opinion. I'm not as down on Scott as some people are but I have to admit that The Martian is easily better than his last few movies. If you haven't watched it yet then go ahead and watch the movie before you read any more reviews. I'll try not to spoil too much but do yourself a favor and go watch it. Trust me, it's awesome.<br/><br/>The story starts out with an astronaut named Mark Watney (Matt Damon) collecting soil samples on Mars. He and his crew mates are there as part of a NASA mission called Ares III. The mission seems to be going well until a massive sandstorm causes the crew to abandon the planet and head for their ship in orbit. Mark is hit by a piece of debris during the storm and knocked out. The rest of the crew believe that Mark is dead and make a hasty retreat from Mars. However, it turns out that Mark survived the storm and now needs to find a way to survive long enough for NASA to send a rescue mission to take him back to Earth. This involves using everything at his disposal to contact NASA, grow food, and avoid insanity.<br/><br/>This cast is probably one of the best I've seen in a movie in a long time. Matt Damon's Watney is easy to sympathize and empathize with and it feels like he's speaking to us throughout the film using his video journal logs. These are actually pretty hilarious and it's nice to see the character have such a good sense of humor about everything. The rest of the crew are also played by some absolutely phenomenal talent. Jessica Chastain plays the captain of the mission, Melissa Lewis. She's tough enough to make difficult decisions but she cares very deeply for her crew. That's probably easy to do when you spend two years of your life with these people. I'm a huge Michael Pena fan so I was glad to see that he played the pilot Rick Martinez. This guy is hilarious in everything he does and this movie is no exception. The crew is rounded off by the superb acting talents of Kate Mara, Aksel Hennie, and Sebastian Stan. What more can I say, they brought out the talent for this one.<br/><br/>Did you think we were done with the awesome cast? Oh no, not even close. The bigwigs and support crew back on Earth are also played by some truly great talent. Jeff Daniels plays Teddy Sanders, the director of NASA. This guy is a lot more likable than the trailers led me to believe. He's a serious guy but he cares deeply for the people working for him and has to make some pretty difficult decisions. Daniels does a great job portraying this balancing act that Teddy is going through. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays the director of the mission, Vincent Kapoor. Ejiofor is another one that has to make tough decisions but shows a bit more humor than his boss. There are so many talented actors in this movie it's a bit crazy. Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, Donald Glover, and so many more all did a great job in the film. Heck, it was nice to see Sean Bean survive in a movie for once.<br/><br/>Mars looks phenomenal in this film. I was a little worried that it would feel like Mark was in the desert rather than a desolate planet but they avoided that completely. This place screams loneliness but it's beautiful in a melancholy kind of way. I'm a big fan of the way they pulled it off. I also need to add that this movie is much funnier than I thought it was going to be. There are parts where I straight up had to laugh out loud from the sheer absurdity of what this poor man is saying to himself (or to us). One of the best parts of the movie is having Mark share his thoughts with us and make us laugh at his truly horrible situation.<br/><br/>I was expecting this movie to be good but it easily surpassed all my expectations. It keeps you on the edge of your seat but it also makes you laugh and smile. I have nothing bad to say about this film. It was close to two and a half hours long but it just flew by for me.

"name99-92-545389","10","1","6","9 October 2015"," The cinema of competence
","Neal Stephenson once wrote that the primary gap between those who like ""literature"" and those who like ""science fiction"" is in the attitude of the readers towards competence: there are people who like to read about humans who know what they are doing and DO it, and there are people who prefer to read about humans who dither, waste time, engage in self-sabotage, and generally screw up their lives and the lives of those around them.<br/><br/>Generally movies, IMHO, cater far too much to the second category --- even when we have substantially competent humans (for example John Maclane of the Die-hard movies) there are always a few scenes thrown in to show what a screwup he is in some aspect or other of his life --- can't hold his marriage together, can't communicate with his kids, whatever. <br/><br/>So it's (again IMHO) something of a pleasure to view a movie of unalloyed competence. We do NOT see stupid (and unrealistic and totally unjustified) self-sabotage in this movie. Not only does the hero (and the rest of his support team) know what they are doing, but everyone else ALSO acts like a damn professional. We don't see the female captain of the ship abandon her earth lover to fall in love with the first officer. We see people think about their wives and kids for a few moments, yes, then get back to work --- just like real professionals do in the real world. <br/><br/>Mine appears to be a minority (though not minuscule) opinion --- I'm seeing lots of people here whining about the fact that we never see our hero engaged in some sort of Hamlet-style bemoaning his fate, wondering whether he should give up, or crying over pictures of his family back home. Well, they're entitled to their opinions, but I'm also entitled to mine. And I say we need a whole lot more movies about professionals acting like adults, and a whole lot fewer movies of adults acting like overgrown children and engaging in magical thinking (ie the sort of idiocy that made Interstellar a good-looking pile of c**p)."
"mpotter-59254","8","1","6","9 October 2015"," The Martin Film Review
","The Martian a film by Ridley Scott couldn't have had a better lead up than the current findings of water on mars. This brought all the hype to a film that I found truly lived up to it. I found myself on constantly engaged in thought about the depth of this film. The star studded crew did an exceptional job in displaying the wide range of emotion. I will in further detail describe what made this class A film just so great. <br/><br/>This film follows astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) on his journey from being left on mars to the efforts to get him back on Planet Earth. In the opening scenes the team of astronauts including Watney are running tests on mars. While the team is working a big storm is moving and they forced to evacuate to the ship to leave. It was in that movement to the ship that Watney was struck by a flying object and knocked unseen into the unseen. The team lost track of GPS and were aware his suit was breached. They were forced to leave by the storm and assume Watney dead. The story then begins the story of how Watney must solve the problems of farming on mars and and making contact with NASA. He eventually does and then through online messages he and NASA begin to formulate a plan to get him food and bring home to earth. Within this you see the depth of the attention to detail with the interactions of other countries and the trials and strain that come with rockets. In the end the triumph is seen best by Watney back on earth. <br/><br/>What really brought this film together to me were actually a couple of different area. One being how realistic the entire space experience was. They really were able to capture that feel great and also how they were able to make all the scientific calculations explained so the movie goer would be able to follow. Another being how the storyline really displayed a good change of emotion and was really able to keep you into the film. There are everything from the super highs to the super lows with everything in between all mixed in with good comedy. The last part being the cast of the film. I believe all the actors did a great job in portraying their roles. With stars everyone would recognize like Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, and even a good role for known musician Childish Gambino. <br/><br/>Although this film I believe was a truly great experience I did find fault with some parts. I know the scientific community had gone into the fact that some of the things portrayed in the movie were inaccurate. Also we have a seen this story before in other noted movies such as ""Interstellar"" and ""Gravity"" for two recent space comparisons. But, overall this film was well worth watching and would be something I would recommend to give a couple hours for. Who knows maybe it will inspire you to be an astronaut that goes to Mars."

I really enjoyed this film I thought Matt Damon was great for the role and he made it a little bit funny which I liked but it was a long film which was not good for my back but I didn't mind. I would definitely recommend this film and I will probably watch it again, there's also quite a bit of suspense all throughout the movie which had me on the edge of my seat the whole time! I really liked how the focus wasn't entirely on Matt Damon but all the people in his life too. I do think the ending could have showed more of when they got home not skipping to the weeks or months later I think that is one of the best parts about a good ending overall a great movie."
"reviewsbycaleb","9","1","6","4 October 2015"," Hilarious, smart and pure entertainment
","The Martian is one of the best movies of the year and let me tell you why.<br/><br/>What Ridley Scott (Director), Drew Goddard (Screenwriter), Andy Weir (Book), and Matt Damon do with this movie is so unconventional and smile inducing, that it may redefine how some movies mix genres. I threw this under the category of Drama, but it wasn't a drama. I thought of possibly putting it under the comedy or thriller section, but The Martian is not a comedy or thriller nor is it just a mere mixture of genres to create a new Sci-Fi movie. So what am I trying to say? The Martian is a mixture of numerous elements that are authentically blended in a way that few movies can attest to. Consequently this makes it significantly harder to put a genre on it, but in this case, I think it's a good thing.<br/><br/>The Martian is straight forward in its plot. Mark Watney (Damon) is stranded on Mars during an emergency evacuation due to a massive storm. The other crew members (Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie) think he is dead after they see him get struck by debris from the ship and so they are forced to leave him behind. Damon's character is then stuck with the seemingly impossible task to stay alive on Mars with limited resources and a 4 year time period until NASA's next mission to mars.<br/><br/>With a premise like this, you're most likely asking yourself, ""Why is the first line of my synopsis 'Hilarious'?"". The answer is found in the witty writing and amazingly charismatic performance of Matt Damon. Damon's character in the movie has a line in which he says ""I'm going to have to science the S--- out of this"". He must have looked at the script and said the same thing, only replacing science with charm. Watney is an overtly intriguing character even though there is virtually no background given to us about him. Weir and Goddard resist the cliché of giving him a family in order to heighten the stakes so that we care about Watney more (even though it would have been very easy and realistic to do). Instead, we rely on Damon's charm and delivery of the character to hold the stakes.<br/><br/>The Martian also did not go for outlandish Sci-Fi lore in the obvious far or near future or a super realistic drama with buzz kill characters. Instead it went for a superior inspiration of a slight detachment from present realism. The situation, the people, and the overall movie has an ideal outlook where the best is made of every hardship, and out of every character. You are aware that it is kind of outrageous and not completely in touch with what realistically would have happened, but in the end that's why The Martian is so great. Damon may have had too good of a time on mars and because of this his dread may never have been completely realized. Executives of NASA and others are VERY selfless (not just in action but in actually caring for Watney) and use extreme measures and resources in the rescue attempt of Watney. However, in real life that may sadly be a bit far fetched. Maybe this is just what we need and are drawn to by the Martian though, watching people on screen see a massive need and doing all they can to relieve it.<br/><br/>The Martian is one of the best movies of the year, why? Matt Damon gives one of his most compelling performances and The Martian is a straight up good time while also intriguing to the mind. The film is also a great study on the nature of humanity and our desire to help one another."

","With ""The Martian"" Ridley Scott reminds us why we love movies so much and in particular he reminds me why I love space movies so freaking much! This is a great movie, there are no two ways around it. This is the reason why film fans around the world go to the cinema, we go to have these type of experiences. What a f**king blast! <br/><br/>Scott is finally back in his ""Alien"" or ""Gladiator"" brilliance and stages a picture that is proof of all his experience and genius. This film has so many surprises in it, it's not just Cast Away on Mars, that is actually an offense towards the film (admittedly, I am not a fan of Cast Away), but the point is that the film is funny, deep, smart, interesting and most importantly, thematically rich and vast. This is the proof of all the energy that Ridley Scott has always been accounted for, it mixes so, so many themes and ideas it's fascinating to look and see how organically it comes together. It does so much by doing so little: just a well placed and well thought shot once in a while adds layers upon layers to the film and encapsulates its messages and discussion so brilliantly.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it is really refreshing to see a guy stranded alone work through the situation in such a human why, with humor, drama and everything in the middle. This is how things would actually go and it is fascinating to watch at every moment. It definitely helps that the character work is absolutely outstanding. What an inspiring screenplay! Every one gets an interesting dynamic and arch, everyone manages to get a three dimensional dynamic thanks to just a couple of brief lines or shots that add so much. The amazing cast definitely helps and fortunately never feels distracting and instead adds a lot with a slew of really good if brief performances. Matt Damon has a great character to play, with an even better arch which is deep and explores everything about the premise, he rises to the occasion, it doesn't even matter he is one of the most recognizable faces on the earth, I just saw his character on screen.<br/><br/>He is certainly helped by amazing visuals; production design, cinematography and locations are all just one better than the other, not to mention music both in score and soundtrack choice. The CGI is absolutely seamless with the practicality involved. Combined they make for a visual treat that is really rare to have. When the tension was on it was really on, I was on the edge of my seat, I screamed no at the screen multiple times, I held my breath, it was amazing, most of all in its climax in space which is something really, really special. And once again I have to compliment the character work here because had it not been so f***ing good this would have ended up being another mildly interesting piece of no-tension-involved.<br/><br/>I understand how many people could blame the movie for being crafted in a slightly too mainstream way and using many staples (like crowd reactions, basic screen writing tropes or seen before characters), but to them I would say that actually this film is a reminder of why does elements have become staples in the first place: when used as well as here you don't even think of them as staples until you think back at it. They are so organically and respectfully integrated in the narrative they really did not bother me at all and I found the overall tone to work perfectly for every moment on screen.<br/><br/>What I might blame the film for is for not making some of the moments breathe and develop on screen. There aren't many believe me, but there is that small bunch of situations that were slightly accelerated and weren't given the time to develop and sink in because of some frenetic editing. I repeat that this doesn't happen throughout, it just happens a couple of times and the film is so good those moments really stuck out.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" doesn't have a dull moment, it is the best film 2015 has offered us alongside ""Inside Out"", it is so good I teared up in joy when the credits rolled and even more when the credits' song started which fit perfectly in and reminded me of what a picture I had just seen."
"stephendaxter","9","5","73","1 October 2015"," Smart, Funny, Intense Action and one of Matt Damon's best
","The Martian excelled at telling a gripping story with amazingly real characters, many intense edge of seat sequences all the way through and quite a bit of humour that also made the film surprisingly really funny. This film marks the return for legendary director Ridley Scott, who after a few misses has created yet another masterpiece that will go down as one of his best. Ridley Scott is known to be a master at making his films visually incredible and that is no different in this film, the wide shots in space are amazing and Mars looks so real that you wonder how they actually got to Mars to film this. This may just be the best space film to come out in the last few years, even though i loved Interstellar this may just be a step above and a little more polished. This film managed to still remain very smart whilst also dropping a lot of the complex science talk that weighted down Interstellar, making it very easy to follow (Yes i understand this film doesn't have interstellar travel to worry about) <br/><br/>What was amazing is how they managed to tell a very smart and coherent story about one man spending many years on a deserted planet in 2 hours and 20 minutes without feeling like too much time was skipped. From start to finish you have absolutely no idea what is going to happen next, you are so engaged in what is happening right now that you don't even think about what's going to happen next and that is just an example of great storytelling. What i also thought was a great element in the film was that it was not only about one mans survival but also about the struggles of the people back on Earth who have to figure out a way to retrieve him. And this allowed for the film to constantly swap back and forth between the two locations allowing you to see how everyone reacts at each moment of the film. And it felt very natural unlike some of the transitions between Earth and space in Interstellar feeling rushed and unconnected. <br/><br/>When you have almost the entire film featuring one man on screen you must have an incredible talent who can capture the audience's attention and keep them entertained the whole time. And Matt Damon manages to accomplish that so perfectly i can;t imagine anyone else doing a better job as astronaut Mark Watney. This is by far one of the best performances of his career and he has done a lot of amazing stuff in the past. He manages to carry the film on his shoulders with ease and was so fun to watch. He is such a world class talent to be able to portray this fictional character in a way that made me at many times think that i was watching some kind of true story, he captured all of the emotion and struggles this guy was going through so well, and just added layers to his character. Not only was this a serious and at times emotional film but it was also hilarious and much of those comedic elements came from Matt Damon. The quick one liners all hit and made the entire full theatre laugh every time. <br/><br/>But he did not do it alone, Damon was accompanied by one of the most incredibly talented supporting casts of the year and they only add to the enjoyment of the film. Heres some of the supporting cast to give you an idea; Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Kate Mara.... WOW thats big. And even more impressive is that every character seemed useful and wasn't just thrown in there for a meaningless cameo, they all had an important part to play at some point in the film and they all deliver on their performances. They add to the story, the emotion, the humour and were all great additions to the film. And seeing Kate Mara act in this film confirms to me that she was not part of the problems that sunk Fant4stic.<br/><br/>And i thought space could not get any more intense than it did in Gravity and Interstellar. But this film delivers on a level above those films, there were countless moments where i was frozen still due to the anticipation of what may happen next, featuring sweaty palms and all that. And these moments weren't just quick 3 minutes of intense dramatic action, it had me stunned for like at least 15 minutes at a time multiple times and had me in awe, holding my breath, and on the edge of my seat...... it was truly amazing. <br/><br/>So in the end this was a very smart, humorous, intense and entertaining adventure full of insane dramatic action, and emotion. Great characters, a compelling adapted script and beautiful shots makes this another masterpiece in the space film genre. - 9.2"

","just got back from an advance screening. Wasn't quite prepared for the ride. I am not a fan of Matt Damon's work on film, but found him very effective as the lost astronaut on Mars who has to survive. I was never bored, frequently on the edge of my seat, and the dialogue was extremely witty. Once the credits rolled and I saw the name ""drew goddard"" , all the dark and twisted comedic aspects of the film made sense. (Goddard did ""the cabin the woods."") This is a real crowd pleaser, with everyone rooting for Matt to come home. Most of us actually clapped at the end of the film.

","Went to the cinema today with the highest hope. Movie is a real SF experience. That means a lot of science that is very possible on Mars. And that is the best part of it. It is not a great cinema experience - it's slow, you can anticipate the next move and the end. The main character should be better developed especially in the emotional area. The only strong feelings that you can see are about the food and the disco music. Not a lot of introspection about solitude, anger and fear from death. The story could be a nice TV series where they could develop the story much better and in details. Visually you can really enjoy the red Mars scenery. That part is truly magnificent. Digitally accurate perspectives of the Martian surface are to die for."
"sohompramanick","10","5","77","30 September 2015"," Matt Damon's trip to Mars is a FANTASTIC lesson on self-belief, hope and humanity
","The Martian had three huge benchmarks to look up to when it comes space missions gone wrong – Ron Howard's Apollo 13, Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity and Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. Though there may be a few who may argue otherwise, The Martian is on par with these films in three levels – the technical aspects, visual effects and the performances. The Martian marks the return of form for Ridley Scott, after two middling efforts. He never loses the grip on the narrative, even when the film skids in a couple of scenes. He is ably supported by the writing skills of Drew Goddard (whose Cabin in the Woods still enthralls me) and the brilliant cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. The film is sprinkled with light humour as well as some deeply engaging scenes, which makes the runtime of nearly two and a half hours pass by easily. The climax sequence is truly harrowing, and the first thing I checked once I came out of the theatre is to see If I still have any nails left to chew!<br/><br/>Even the background score is apt and enriching to the experience. And of course, the visual effects are mind- blowing. Yes, Interstellar and Gravity still scores over in this aspect, but The Martian is no pushover, thank you!<br/><br/>But the biggest reason we are ready to invest in The Martian is because of the fantastic performances by the cast. In the lead is the Martian himself, Matt Damon. No less a hero than his macho Jason Bourne, Matt Damon makes for a believable protagonist whose fictional tale for survival is truly inspiring. Even when he cracks a joke every now and then, his eyes and body language make sure we can never make light of his pitiable plight. He is ably supported by a brilliant plethora of cast playing some wonderful characters. They include the steely crew commander played by Jessica Chastain and her motley crew of Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan, Jeff Daniels's play-by-the-book NASA director, Sean Bean's empathetic flight leader, Kristen Wiig's bemused NASA public affairs agent etc. Everyone is great, but if I have to pick up my favourite characters, it would be Chiwetel Ejiofor's sardonic but helpful mission director Vincent Kapoor (wonder why they didn't rope in Irrfan Khan!) and Donald Glover in his small role of carefree astrodynamics scientist.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of sci-fi thrillers like Interstellar and love special effects, The Martian should definitely be your watch- list this week. Even if you are not, just watch the film to learn how not to lose hope even in the bleakest of the situations, and that humanity still survives in the best of us. This trip to Mars is totally worth that huge IMAX ticket price!"
"sng-patterson","6","5","78","30 September 2015"," Ridley: oh dear
","Ridley Scott has a superb track record and I have seen nearly all of his films. <br/><br/>I read The Martian and eagerly anticipated the movie.<br/><br/>A strange disappointment. There is so much that is good (landscapes, the cast, much of the science) but the one thing missing, the key ingredient, is tension. The book achieves that by introducing cloud cover as our hero approaches his destination (bringing battery life to a halt) as well as car crashes, electrical failures, communication breakdowns with Earth and much else. Not in the film. <br/><br/>Why not? Was there so much else which needed to go in? Not really.

"kaustubh-rajnish","8","2","21","6 October 2015"," The Martian : A New Kind of Science Fiction
","Often you like or dislike movies based on the expectations you set for them. I have never been a fan of Ridley Scott and out of the 11 movies i have seen of his (he has made 23) I only enjoyed American Gangster. No, not a fan of Alien or Blade Runner or the horrendous Gladiator. To me his films are way too melodramatic and often have loose plot devices to set up spectacle scenes / money shots. <br/><br/>So when I decided to catch 'The Martian' on its second day of release, I had two expectations. There is a lot of accurate science in this movie (having read it somewhere) and the chances of me enjoying this were going to be low. <br/><br/>I was right on one count. The film has a lot of seemingly accurate science fiction (if that's not already an oxymoron). As far as Ridley Scott is concerned, this was a pleasant surprise. This is by far his least melodramatic movie I have seen and to me his second best effort to date. <br/><br/>After the poetic assault on our senses by Gravity and Interstellar - only two of the best space movies of all times, the Martian comes as a surprising and refreshing change to spaceman storytelling. It is a matter of fact movie. An astronaut is left behind on Mars. He has to figure out a way to survive and communicate with NASA. The other narrative is at earth where a bunch of interesting NASA characters (played out by an incredible cast) try to understand what can be done. <br/><br/>The focus here is on the story, on the characters. The edge of the seat stuff is there but restricted. To the extent that the stress inducing scenes were when NASA experts discuss whether they should or should not tell the crew that they left one of their own behind on a deserted planet. Hmmm.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, it is so matter of fact that I was hoping for something to kick up the excitement. But thankfully it didn't. Because like it or not we have had so many edge of the seat implausible thrill rides that for once you need an extraordinary story told in an ordinary way. This does not mean this is a documentary, it has its shares of thrilling moments but they come few and far between. It also has a great OST including an almost full length 'Starman' montage that I would go watch the movie again for. <br/><br/>Overall, it is a welcome change. Everything that happens is for you to see. There are no jump cuts, no music reaching a crescendo and definitely no unnecessary actions by characters that can complicate the proceedings. Matt Damon as the survivalist is perfect for the role. He brings a relaxed demeanor to the screen and a lot more humour than you can imagine. So much so that on the flip side, you don't really feel for him when the sh*t hits the fan (spoiler alert.literally). <br/><br/>Let's face it, he is stranded on Mars and there are 1001 things that could kill him instantly. But Ridley Scott never allows you to feel that dread. This is not that kind of a movie. These are scientists and astronauts and they remain that. Heroism is restricted to floating in space and opening a door because in real life sometimes that is heroism. <br/><br/>What stuck with me though was the film's attitude. A human attitude about survival, about being optimistic because that is the only practical option left. Hell, it's so optimistic that even the Chinese Govt are shown as selfless good guys which may not be a bad idea. Bravo, Hollywood. High time.<br/><br/>In the end, The Martian should not be missed. No it is not as entertaining as Interstellar and it is definitely not as edge of the seat as Gravity and nor does it get into boring existential questions like Solaris. This is a new type of science fiction. For once, it attempts to entertain you by showing smart people doing smarter things. And in today's geeky world it succeeds! Go, watch it. And here's hoping there are more like this in every genre.<br/><br/>KR<br/><br/>PS For Kubrick fan boys: Do enjoy the seemingly endless tributes to 2001 A Space Odyssey (Arguably the best space movie ever) esp. the ping that's heard every time the time line shows up."
"jimmiemalone","9","2","21","6 October 2015"," Ridley Scott is back.
","*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>With 'The Marian', director Ridley Scott makes a stunning comeback with the science fiction genre that he seems to have mastered (Alien, Blade Runner, Prometheus)<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney, who is inadvertently stranded on Mars, when his mission (aptly named Ares III after the Greek equivalent of the Roman God of war, Mars), has to be unceremoniously cut short. In the commotion of the abrupt departure, mission commander Melissa Lewis (played by Jessica Chastain), has to make the call to leave without him, when he can't be located during the rendezvous to the lander module, and is presumed dead by the crew, who then head back home aboard the 'Hermes'. <br/><br/>Unable to contact NASA and running out of rations, Watney harnesses his skills as a botanist, to grow potatoes within the mission's artificial habitat (HAB) by collecting soil from nearby and synthesizing water using Hydrazine from the mission site. He keeps video logs presumably for posterity, but more so to keep his own morale up. Over time he puts his considerable engineering aptitude and training to effect a survival plan until the next mission to Mars arrives 4 years later.<br/><br/>Back on earth, satellite communications engineer Mindy Park (played by Mackenzie Davis of 'Halt and Catch Fire' fame) deduces along with the mission director Vincent Kapoor (played by the always reliable Chiwetel Ejiofor), that he is actually alive, based on the differences in the time lapse satellite photography of the mission site. Without giving too much away, Watney is finally able to communicate with NASA and then begin the logistics of keeping him alive at least until the next manned mission arrives, and also a possible rescue mission which could involve the Hermes, who are on their way back home. The film draws several parallels from the true story of Apollo 13 (also set to the eponymous film by director Ron Howard in 1995), especially in regards how the engineers and scientists at both NASA and JPL brainstorm and improvise ways to help out Watney. The 'corporate suit' is played by Jeff Daniels (NASA director) who has to make the familiar tough calls of adjusting deadlines and logistics for the rescue, while being cognizant of public opinion (in tandem with the NASA media relations officer, played by Kristen Wiig).<br/><br/>The film is interspersed with several light hearted moments, with timely one liners by Matt Damon, and while the psychological strain of the sheer isolation is not in the same vein as say Castaway (2000), there are certainly moments where this is adequately captured when Watney has a few setbacks. <br/><br/>'The Martian' is based on the 2011 science fiction novel of the same name by author Andy Weir. NASA was consulted extensively for the scientific accuracy of the film which shows through and is made even more plausible because of the high production standards on a 100+ million dollar budget. <br/><br/>Ridley Scott has definitely redeemed himself with a couple of setbacks (by his standards) in recent years (The Counselor, Exodus).The film is a splendid celebration of human perseverance, ingenuity and the will to survive against overwhelming odds. With a running time of 141 minutes, it keeps you engrossed all the way and is one of the few films that warrants a 3D viewing."

","Awesome movie, something I'd watch again for sure. Infused with good morals, wit, great quotes and splash of amazing graphics. I was mouth agape throughout, the only disappointment was it ended. I even registered for the first time in IMDb and rotten tomatoes just to tell the world how good i feel watching it. I have to say, the only thing I did mind was swearing, but then again the poor guy was stuck on Mars growing potatoes :))) I really loved the part when he was back on earth: ""day one"", :))) Ah yes, and the great quality acting, Damon is pretty talented, somehow I saw the resemblance of DiCaprio, it may be just me :) That Latino actor Pena is really cute and funny.

","This is not one of those far fetched plots that drag on for hours like Interstellar or Gravity, this is a gripping and powerful space opera epic and its called The Martian.<br/><br/>The Martian was just one of the best three hour moments of my movie- loving marathon this year in 2015. Yes, that's how good it is. It is the best sci-fi space opera movie in the last three years. Gravity was just a beautiful technology show-off, Interstellar was a far fetched waste of potential and The Martian was just the amazing steps ahead of both those two movies that I, personally, don't like very much. The Martian is Ridley Scott's best movie, ever. I will be making that argument that it is definitely his best film that I've seen, not just my favourite, but his best.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's fantastic role and performance was not the only greatest thing about this movie, the co-stars were really good as well and I mean all of them, Sebastian Shan, Jessica Chastian, Michael Peña and Mara Bell (which excuses her terrible role in Fantastic Four this year). Ridley Scott's directing is at it's finest, he really knows which scene should be the most emotional or the most funniest and he succeeds in making it both memorable and great, I am going to remember every scene in this movie where I was laughing my head off and when I was tearing up, there were about one or two moments during the film where I was nearly crying man tears.<br/><br/>I never expected that much from this movie, but it still resides with me now, the story, the incredible cinematography, the amazing performances and the fact that this is not just one of those fun popcorn movies like a lot of movies were this year, this is one that I am going to remember about a decade from now. The Martian has to be one of my favourite movies this year, I guarantee that it will be among my Top 5 this year. I would strongly recommend that you go and see this movie, trust me, you will have a fun great time with it, just like I did.<br/><br/>10/10"
"paul-allaer","6","4","61","3 October 2015"," ""Castaway"" in space meets ""Gravity"": ""Luckily I'm a botanist!""
","""The Martian"" (2015 release; 141 min.) brings the story of Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon). As the movie opens, we are informed this is Acidalia Planitia, a plain on Marxs, and we see Mark and the rest of the crew picking up rock and sand samples. Then a sandstorm quickly moves in, forcing the crew to abandon the mission and escape. In the confusion, Mark is hit by debris and presumed dead. Except that he isn't. Mark realizes that the next mission to Mars won't get there until 4 years from now. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from director Scott Ridley, hardly a novice in sci-fi movies (Blade Runner, Alien, Prometheus). Here, he tackles the big screen adaptation of the popular book by Andy Weir. I did not read the book, so I cannot comment how closely the movie tracks the book. Second, seemingly no expenses were spared in the production of the film, and much of it is just eye-candy. Third, the parallels between this and other movies are so obvious: the initial two-thirds of the movie is basically ""Castaway"" in space, as we follow Mark in his quest to survive until the rescue comes, and the last third is even more blatant in going where ""Gravity"" has gone before. Fourth, kudos to Matt Damon for bringing a heartfelt performance. But what about Kristen Wiig? She looks lost and unsure why she's even there (compare this to her brilliant performance in the recent ""Diary of a Teenage Girl""). And didn't Jessica Chastain just do another space-travel movie? (Yes, 2014's ""Interstellar""). Fifth, there is a very nice orchestral score, courtesy of composer Harry Gregson-Willians. And Jessica Chastain's character loves 1970s disco, so we get a bunch of true-and-tried (or is that true-and-tired?) classics such as Turn the Beat Around, Hot Stuff, Rock the Boat, Love Train, and, yes, I Will Survive. Last, this film is rated PG-13. Not that it stops Mark from dropping the F bomb on several occasion (I thought the F bomb automatically earns a movie the R rating?).<br/><br/>""The Martian"" opened nationwide this weekend and the matinée screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was absolutely jam-packed. The audience loved this movie. As much as I was ready to also love it, I can't help but feel let down by the lack of originality, in particular in the latter part of the movie. It's like watching ""Gravity"" again, but not as good. I encourage you to check out ""The Martian"" for yourself and draw your own conclusions."

","The most unrealistic part of this movie, is not the fact that Matt Damon started a potato farm out of his own feces in space, but THE PREPOSTEROUS FACT THAT SPACE AND OTHER PLANETS EXIST!1! As a Christian Mom, I must tell you that the whole idea behind space, planets and even a globe earth is so unrealistic that I had to remove my 7 children from the cinema mid-way through and then perform an exorcism on them. I tried to contact Hollywood and demand this movie is removed from all cinemas within Christian governed nations but they wouldn't answer my e-mails or my calls. Alas I am here to try and convince all Christian citizens of the World, to avoid this movie like the plague. Also i'd like to inform you that NASA is a satanic organisation that throws arsenic in our water supply and that vaccines are made of sin. This movie proudly displays the ridiculous idea of space, which I am pretty sure is a myth (just like physics and sanitation). The only reason I am giving this movie is getting anything more than a 1/10 is because of Matt Damon.

Had the entire film been like that, it would have been a dull one note film. Instead, introducing strife and communications really added perfect texture to the film.

","I'm not really sure about this movie. It was good, it was really, really good, but it just didn't seem to have the impact that a truly great movie has. I would have to say that there is this indescribable element that any form of literature has that moves it from being just good to being something great, and I have to say that this movie does not seem to have it. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed it – the story was great, the characters were awesome, and it kept me glued to my seat right until the end, but there was something about it that upon leaving the cinema I simply could not say 'woah, that was one awesome movie'. I would be tempted to say that it was Ridley Scott, but then again he has made some pretty awesome movies in his time (Alien for instance).<br/><br/>I'm sure we all know the story to this film – it has been flogged enough in the cinemas, on the posters at tram stops, and almost anywhere else that a film can be flogged. Mark Whittney is an astronaut on one of the first expeditions to Mars but the crew are caught in a huge dust storm and are forced to flee. Unfortunately Whitney is struck by flying debris and left for dead. However it turns out that he isn't dead, so now begins the challenge of not only staying alive on a dead planet, but also working out a way to get home.<br/><br/>This is one of those films for science geeks because the book upon which it is based was written by somebody who was incredibly thorough with his scientific research. Sure, it is possible to grow food on a barren and lifeless planet, as long as there are nutrients to inject into the soil (there are) and water to feed the plants (he manages to create it). However we are also given more detailed look into how NASA actually organises their space missions (the generally send rockets up beforehand to leave supplies along the way).<br/><br/>The thing about this film is that it does capture that romantic idea of a mission to Mars. The thing is that it is possible, though such a mission will also be incredibly expensive. In a way Mars is the closet planet to us that will not kill us if we were to attempt to land upon it (Venus and it's acid rain, as well as its proximity to the Sun, just would not be a viable choice, and don't even consider Mercury). It is also a film about humanity's will to survive, with Whitney surviving on Mars a reflection of humanity's will to survive despite living in a hostile universe. However it also reflects humanity's compassion and willingness not to leave anyone behind (though of course the old debate of why risk the lives of others to save the life of one does surface)."

The rest of the cast are doing a good job as well, although personally I think that Mr. Sean Bean was a wasted talent in a what may be considered a second level role. He is much much better than that. So Mr Scott, you did a good job keeping the goofs to an incredible minimum almost non existent number.

","Ridley Scott and Matt Damon have collaborated together for what could possibly be their best movie in a long time. The Martian has moments that will sweep you off your feet and put you right beside Matt Damon's character who is stranded on Mars. What I love most about this movie is the way his character has been conceived. He knows he is screwed but he chooses to remain positive and ends up being extremely humorous. At 3 different times during the course of the movie he refers to himself as a Mars-colonialist, a space- pirate and Iron Man respectively and this justifies the fact that the man is trying his level best to instill within him a certain amount of confidence which in turn could enable him to remain alive and wait for NASA to rescue him. When NASA realizes that Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) is alive, chaos ensues and NASA's attempts to contact Watney had me in splits. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels have acted pretty well.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain has and will always remain a good actress. At least I feel so. She plays an astronaut who feels guilty for having left Mark Watney on Mars during a fierce storm which had forced her and her colleagues to abandon the mission they were trying to accomplish. What's ironic is the fact that Ms. Chastain and Mr. Damon starred in Interstellar too. In that movie Damon had betrayed Chastain's father. In this movie Chastain is determined to rescue Damon from Mars. Ridley Scott has directed a movie which is not tremendously preachy, isn't overtly emotional and has doses of unexpected humour here and there. And it abounds in space technology that the protagonist dabbles with in order to survive. For all the above reasons this movie is going to be wildly successful. And when the movie finishes you will have your feet back on the ground with a THUD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","For the crew of the Ares III, their mission to Mars is the stuff of legend. Not only have them successfully landed on Mars but have established a pre-fab community for the Astronauts to live and work during a 30 day mission to the Red Planet. Their mission is cut short when a severe storm appears suddenly and forces the crew to abandon their base for their escape vehicle as they cannot afford to have their only way home toppled in a storm. While preparing for their rapid departure, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck with a piece of debris and left for dead by his crew when his monitors fail to show any signs of life. Despite their best efforts, the low visibility and severe storm, compounded with the lack of vitals or ability to find his body, the crew reluctantly lifts off leaving Mark's remains on the surface. Mark however has survived, as the debris destroyed his monitors and left him injured, but very much alive and alone on the surface of Mars. Since he was struck by the radio dish, he has no way to contact N.A.SA. and his crew to inform them he is alive. Mark sets out to address how to grow food on the planet and to make sure he has enough air, water, and food to last until the next manned mission is due in a few years. The fact that the landing site for the mission is a longer distance than his vehicle is capable is a problem Mark figures he will have time to address, as is his need to contact those on Earth. What follows is a visually stunning, well-paced, and very well performed film with a terrific ensemble cast. The real star is Damon as he has to carry large parts of the film by himself and is utterly compelling at every step. Director Ridley Scott clearly is inspired by the source material based on the book of the same name, and never lets his impressive visuals overshadow the human drama of the film and the very real characters. I was very impressed by the film, enough so to say that ""The Martian"" is one of the best films of the year and may indeed be a candidate for the Oscars. Check out this film, you will not be disappointed. 4.5 stars out of 5.<br/><br/>Second Film Review: 'The Martian' By Sasha Glenn<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Andy Weir, ""The Martian"" tells the story of a man who becomes stranded in desolation on Mars and his ensuing battle to stay alive. After a storm breaks out on Mars, a NASA mission is forced to abort. In the chaos of escape, crew member Watney (Matt Damon) is believed to be dead and gets left behind. With just enough supplies to begin the task of survival, Watney embarks on an impossible seeming mission. The psychological aspects of the film are a mixed bag, at times seeming a bit unrealistic. A calm and logical scientist, Watney begins tackling one problem at a time. Slightly unsettling is the delay, or complete lack of ""space madness."" He doesn't really go into a panic the way one would imagine a person alone on an alien planet with no escape route would. It's possible this lends itself to creating a more realistic image of such a scenario, rather than playing into expectations previously set in film. However, Watney even goes so far as to make light of the situation in his video logs. The comedy element is really enjoyable, but it's a bit odd that he has so much humor while in peril. At times the scenes are slow moving and tend to drag on a bit. This element of monotony actually falls in line with what the lone crew member is experiencing. It is a well-balanced film, with just enough moments of action and suspense. It spares the audience of the drama which normally accompanies films about missions into space. It isn't full of sappy tear jerking scenes. Nothing is sensationalized. Even the soundtrack is very well done and not overbearing. The graphics are absolutely stunning, but what really makes this a great sci-fi is the immense amount of thought that was put into scientific accuracy. Weir and Director Ridley Scott worked collaboratively with James L. Green, Director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA to strive for a realistic depiction of survival on Mars. A long awaited for quality sci-fi, fans of the genre will breathe a sigh of relief. I give ""The Martian"" 4.5 out of 5 stars."

","Maybe it was due to a previous night of drinking, or to the comfortable seats, but I found myself yawning and I'm pretty sure the movie was partly to blame. It laid a nice premise but ended up so convoluted, technical, and dull, you would think it was based on a true story - fiction is usually more interesting. You have some pretty big names trying to make it work (Jeff Daniels), but it just seemed like a struggle to keep things interesting by constantly coming up with a new problem. At least in 'Cast Away' they could focus in on the main character. Here there are many parties to follow: Matt Damon, the NASA people, the crew returning to earth, and - unbelievably - the Chinese. Everybody is trying to grab a little screen time and it's just a big confusing mess, compounded by the length of time involved. They try to go all Disney with the emotional manipulation, but it really doesn't stick. I would rather watch Gravity again over this."

","This is a ""not bad"" return for Ridley Scott. He shows his chops in pacing and cinematography, while Matt Damon tries for humor and distress. Occasionally he succeeds, occasionally he does not. Damon's portrayal of a stranded astronaut on Mars is sometimes less stressful than that of those back home trying to bring him back. <br/><br/>Contrary to some reviews, I think the film finds many of its high points back on Earth with a performance like that of Chiwetel Ejiofo, who shines as Vincent Kapoor. This is the case with many performances in The Martian; it is the supporting characters who pick up the slack.

","I saw this last night at its opening. I was stunned by the book, but curious how they would pull off a movie given the book is basically the thoughts of one man stranded on Mars. This is not a story set in the future, but our own present day. We have the technology to send a manned mission to Mars but we lack the political will. Unlike Apollo 13, which bored me to tears, this movie is just captivating. The human interest is beautifully balanced with the technical aspects (many of which have quite rightly been edited out from the over-technical novel). Apollo 13 lost itself in trying to follow the wives' stories, which were all painfully dull. This film sticks to Mark Watney on Mars and the NASA scientists (geeks) trying to bring him home. The characters at NASA are brilliantly portrayed. This is a book written by a geek for geeks, in a world where clever scientists rock, but it also strikes a chord in the heart of anyone who loves storytelling and heroics. As to the cinematography...this will leave you speechless and forgetting it's actually just a movie. Quite wonderful. Do not miss this movie on the big screen."
"moviexclusive","8","4","72","29 September 2015"," Emotionally and viscerally thrilling, this outer space survival story has as much humour and heart as spectacle, and is easily Ridley Scott and Matt Damon's best work in years
","As tempting as it may be to compare 'The Martian' with 'Interstellar', the two couldn't be more different – and we mean that in a good way. Whereas Christopher Nolan's sci-fi odyssey got (literally) lost in space with its own quantum physics, Ridley Scott's stranded-on-Mars survival story stays rigorously grounded for pretty much its entire duration, relying on hard science and good ol' human ingenuity to pull off a high-concept premise with ambition, derring-do and genuine heart. It is less fiction than fact, but that doesn't stop it from easily being Scott's best film in recent years. <br/><br/>Scripted by Drew Goddard from computer programmer-turned-author Andy Weir's best-selling novel, it chronicles the ensuing days of a NASA botanist named Mark Watney (Matt Damon) in the aftermath of a sandstorm that forces his fellow Ares III crewmates to abort mission and head back to Earth, assuming because of a freak accident that he has been killed. Because his communication equipment has been damaged, Mark's best hope in getting back to Earth is to wait four years for the next manned mission to arrive – that is, if he can survive that long.<br/><br/>Mark's challenge is twofold – one, he has to make enough food in order to last 400 sols; and two, he has to drive 3,200 km across Mars terrain to get to the Schiaparelli crater where Ares IV is expected to land. Undaunted, Mark decides to overcome his first by growing his own food, an arduous feat which entails using recycled human waste to make fertiliser and burning hydrazine fuel to create water, in the hope of farming the potatoes meant for the crew's Thanksgiving dinner. As for the latter, well let's just say that the two Rovers which the crew left behind would need to do the trick.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to Mark, NASA is quite aware that he is alive, thanks to an eagle-eyed NASA technician (MacKenzie Davis) who spots activity at the Ares III Hab – though not before the presumed dead astronaut is duly mourned. Leading the rescue mission is the head of NASA Terry Sanders (Jeff Daniels), the team comprising of the head of PR Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig), head of Mars missions Venkat Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor), flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) and director of the Jet Propulsion Lab Bruce Ng (Benedict Wong). It is Venkat who surmises from Mark's movement patterns that he is attempting to use the unmanned Pathfinder lander to communicate with NASA, thereby allowing both parties to have a direct line to each other.<br/><br/>Not to give anything away to those who have not read the novel, it suffices to say that a freak accident forces a change of plans to retrieve Mark sooner than previously planned, the eventual rescue effort both an unlikely collaboration between two distrusting world powers as well as a demonstration of the selflessness of Mark's former crew members (played by Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan and Aksel Hennie). Those who have read the book however will notice that Goddard has whittled and condensed some of the details to give the film a leaner but much punchier narrative, and perhaps most significantly, abandoned the use of Mark's video logs which Weir had used in his novel as a framing device.<br/><br/>Quite astoundingly though, Scott's film loses none of the intimacy of its source material in portraying Mark's personality and emotional psyche. That is as much credit to Scott's ability to translate Goddard's writing into a spare but effective character study as it is to Damon's warm, sincere and effortlessly winning performance. Much of the movie is held together by Damon and Damon alone, and the actor hits the character beats perfectly with just the right balance of optimism and cynicism to pull off the good dose of wry humour that made Mark such an engaging person in the first place. It isn't difficult to root for someone in Mark's circumstance, but Damon captures his character's hopes, fears, disappointment and helplessness in such a tangible manner that it is hard not to feel an intimate connection with Mark.<br/><br/>On that same note, there is also much humanity in the interactions between the staff at NASA headquarters as well as Mark's former crew on board the Hermes spacecraft. It is pleasantly surprisingly that the former is devoid of any political agenda – even a controversial key decision which Terry makes midway into the film is less out of expediency than a genuine concern of the risks involved – and the latter, like we said earlier, proves a rousing display of team spirit. As much as there is spectacle to be had in seeing the execution of a rescue mission of a man on Mars, Scott roots his film in the heart of the people involved in the process, such that the suspenseful climax delivers not just a thrilling send-off but an emotional payoff.<br/><br/>Yes, it is pretty much a given that 'The Martian' will boast of Scott's striking visuals, and even with such heightened expectations, the 77-year-old filmmaker doesn't disappoint. Together with his 'Prometheus' cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and production designer Arthur Max, Scott makes the most of the picture's Wadi Rum filming location to create awe-inspiring images of one man against a harsh inhospitable environment, conveying both scale and isolation in breathtakingly elegant frames. <br/><br/>That Scott is still able to astound us with his vision of space is in itself a notable achievement, but 'The Martian' stands out as one of his best films for being much more than spectacle. This is a celebration of the triumph of wits and will against the odds, especially notable in its generous dose of humour and whimsicality. It is also tonally an uncharacteristically upbeat film from Scott, and a befitting shout- out to NASA and the brave men and women who have left our planet to find our place amongst the stars."

"rannynm","10","3","59","1 October 2015"," Possibly one of the best films of this decade
","Ridley Scott turns in his finest film since Blade Runner. The Martian is such a touching film, that its flaws can be easily overlooked and forgotten. The sheer message and theme of this movie and the way they're presented is what gives this movie its greatness. It's a movie that explores the human condition and has something positive to say about it. We need that in today's cinema and I thank the cast and crew of this movie for giving us this gem. It's an experience worth having.<br/><br/>The Martian stars Matt Damon in one of his career best performances as an astronaut who gets stuck on Mars when his teams leaves him behind, thinking he's dead after he is struck by debris in the middle of a storm. When he is able to get in touch with NASA, their higher-ups and a few other organizations, rally up to rescue him. I have to tell you that is NOT like Gravity. It is not a one-man show, though Damon does have significant screen time. There is an entire supporting ensemble that provides serviceable and strong performances. And yet, despite the acting of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, and Michael Peña, Matt Damon does steal the show. He is very committed with every character choice and really inhabits the man he's portraying. Damon doesn't layer him with underlying sadness or anxiety, instead he shows us the determination of a man who has weighed his options, and has chosen to do something about his situation. Towards the end, when he finally breaks down, it hits us harder. We get choked up seeing this person who has stayed strong for so long and then finally lets out what he's been holding back. It's a powerful thing.<br/><br/>Secondly, the film has an amazing tone. With a soundtrack filled with Gloria Gaynor, ABBA, and David Bowie, the fun of this movie won't go understated. The soundtrack compliments the numerous comedic moments that come at a rate that could have this film labeled as a sci-fi comedy. It is funny and entertaining and will have you dancing or humming along. It's good Scott gave this movie this tone because it matches the lasting message he wants us to have - that even though the situation is bad, a combination of survival instincts and intelligence can get us through it. And, with the love and care of others, a seemingly insurmountable situation becomes surmountable. <br/><br/>I'll tell you my favorite part. There is a moment in the movie when NASA is having trouble getting supplies to our protagonist and the issues are being broadcast. A major science organization is watching it from China, and they decide to help out NASA. There are no hard feelings, ill will, prideful rejections or rivalries going on. The Chinese organization asks for nothing in return. It is just two organization banning together for the same cause. It is beautiful and speaks volumes, especially considering the public perception of American-Chinese relations. <br/><br/>Now there are those who may say that the tone demeans the more dramatic moments, but I disagree. The dramatic moments in this movie aren't really all that dramatic anyway. They're more like lighthearted drama if anything. There is one moment in the movie in which we abruptly and rather un-smoothly get shown the inevitable ""problem"" within the film. The Debbie Downer that the protagonist must overcome to make his victory that much sweeter. I'll admit, it isn't presented in the best way, but that's not the most dramatic part of the film. That comes at the time our main character believes he's about to go home. That moment is built not by the tone of the film, but by the performance of Matt Damon.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the only criticism other than the aforementioned is the pacing of the movie. It's about 10 minutes too long. There are many throwaway scenes, scenes that aren't necessary and could be done without whether because they're repetitive, or just get in the way of Scott getting to his point quicker and more effectively. The problems ensue towards the end as well, when the pacing suffers and so does the tension. It is so close to being what it should have been, but I wasn't hanging on as much as I could or should have. That's because of the moment of comedic relief that is added and the same with many of the scenes I mentioned. There are some scenes that are necessary, or helpful, but could be trimmed down.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the flaws are minor and able to be overlooked. The Martian is still one of the best movies of this decade. With that said, I give this movie 5 out 5 stars and, due to some surprisingly frequent language, I recommend it for ages 13 to 18.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Willie J., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."

","I superduper love the book. Andy Weir's book is practically celebrating the geeky nerd in me, but I am under no illusion that Ridley Scott can just take huge chunks of Mark Watney's thoughts and monologues, shoot them and wala the movie would work. It wouldn't. The science experiments, the guess and check methodology and the constant hypothesis testing do not make for anything cinematic and most people will go into deep space slumber by Sol 47. What Scott and his team did is to take all the compelling narrative elements and propel them with an authoritative drive, and The Martian becomes for me, this year's most undeniable supermassive monster-tainer of the nth degree. <br/><br/>The narrative is not new. I am sure anyone can see this is a concoction of Robinson Crusoe, with a heavy dose of Apollo 13 and Gravity. I love this genre tremendously and I am now going to tell you a secret - I love watching terrible movies like Deep Blue Sea and Anaconda. There, I said it, and I don't care if I lose your respect :). There is something so primal, singular and compelling about a character solving problems to survive in the face of insurmountable odds. In The Martian, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. This narrative can be found in many films and it is IMHO best articulated by this quote - ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying."" If you know where this is taken from, we must be related in some way :). Watney articulates the same sentiment in the epilogue of the movie, which is not found in the book.<br/><br/>How Scott succeeded in reining in his usual self-important space opera mumbo jumbo is already cause for celebration. His hand is light, sure and every creative choice he made serves the story. We get wide vistas of Mars and the spacecraft, but somehow Scott stops himself from underscoring them with his usual larger than life signature. By doing that the story of one extraordinary man on Mars becomes front and centre, and bigger than everything. The cast is solid all round, especially Matt Damon who carries the movie on his everyday man's shoulders. His smarts and snarky personality shining through. We rise and fall on his little successes like repurposing his excrement as fertilizer and we laugh with him through his not too outrageous notion of colonization. <br/><br/>For once, and for such a welcome relief, this movie is populated with super-intelligent people who don't do stupid dumb things like touching unknown objects or walking into unknown territory. This particular genre is full of these stereotypes but you will find none here. There is not much melodrama here to manipulate you emotionally. You are not going to see a scene of an insufferable wife calling from Earth to make sure Watney doesn't give up (watch Everest for that and I don't mean that in a bad way). What we have here is a tenacious man solving problems like how to make water, grow food, and communicate with NASA on an unforgiving planet. There is no monster, no inner demons, no anger towards God, just one man who is ready to ""science the sh*t out of it"" as he ""gets busy living"". <br/><br/>Who would have thought watching a man's constant efforts to stay alive for another day makes for such compelling cinema. Some of the great stuff in the book like the broken drill bit and the accident with the rover on the final trip to Ares 4 didn't make it into the film, but I am not taking any points away. This is a superb tribute to human ingenuity and will probably make young people want to study harder. It may not have pushed the envelope in terms of cinema but it succeeded in what it set out to do - a supermassive feel-good visual extravaganza. I am so glad I sat between my wifey and a geeky teenager. The dude was gasping in wonder and cheering animatedly through some of the amazing scenes. This type of special effects money can't buy. My wife said that boy is probably me when I was a boy. She is right."

","Ridley Scott will direct your eyes to the most beautifully landscaped Mars you will ever encounter. On top of that, Sir Scott also directs a perfectly paced film, with enough chaos to enthrall you and enough drama for you to care for (most) of the characters. This leads me to my only negative point of the film and that is the space crew. Whilst two of the characters are well characterized, the remaining three you give little care about; and that is big with some of the more suspenseful moments. However, even though our female character is shown in full detail, you can't help but think she's been taken from the 'female, no emotion, strong willed' template that plagues so many lead female characters in clichéd thriller films. <br/><br/>However, besides characterization, nothing will come close to the adventure this film gives you. It's full of everything you would want, and may even be the best film of the year thus far."
"galahad58-1","9","3","60","3 October 2015"," Space Odyssey Saved
","I am going to start out by saying that I was going to avoid this picture until it hit Netflix. Why? Many reasons: let me start with Ridley Scott - one of the worse directors in cinema - ever. Scott has been involved in very few good films - with Alien and Blade Runner being his only two really good movies. Scott has made some of the worse movies to ever hit film: Exodus, Legend (one of the worse movies ever), Prometheus (a joke of a film), Robin Hood (beyond ridiculous), Body of Lies, Matchstick Men, Hannibal, White Squall, 1402 and the ever dreadful Thelma and Louise. With Scott's track record I was very reluctant to spend money on a film with his name on it.<br/><br/>Reason two: Matt Damon. Besides the Bourne series, Damon has made a lot (a huge amount) of bad movies on par with I Bought A Zoo, The Brothers Grimm, Monuments Men, Elysium, etc.<br/><br/>Reason three: Jessica Chastain - in her entire body of work, only The Help was a good film and she was a supporting player.<br/><br/>Reason four: Kristen Wiig - the queen of foul mouthed, bad comedy. Every movie she has made is for low brow, ignorant people.<br/><br/>I went to this movie because I like Sean Bean. I like his screen presence and (with a good script) he has great performances. I also like Chiwentel Ejiofer. Just to see the performances by these two actors was the reason that I went to see this film.<br/><br/>Now folks have been comparing this movie to Interstellar and Gravity. It is not close. Interstellar was a garbage movie with major scientific flaws, big gaps in logic (which can kill a space film) and a terrible story. Gravity was one of the worse hyped-up pieces of garbage ever made - an astronaut who just breathes heavy, cannot function, knows nothing about survival, and in the end falls hundreds of miles to Earth and survives - garbage.<br/><br/>The Martian goes back to what you would believe in a space odyssey: the main character is afraid of dying, but he allows his intelligence and training to help him to survive; there are people who are intelligent and thought provoking at NASA (which a lot of movies make them out to be idiots and heartless); there is a lot of good characterization in the film which give heart to the characters and it makes you care about what happens to them; there is a lack of the dumb - very dumb - acts of God/space/climate that always happen where members of the rescue team will die or that will jeopardize the mission (Mission to Mars, Red Planet, for example); the rescue attempt is presented in a reasonable manner and logical manner utilizing good science; there are a few F-bombs thrown out there, but it is saturated like most of today's movies (because of ignorant screen-writers who do not know what to write); the movie does not do the Game of Thrones routine with mindless sex and nudity every ten minutes (most movies today have to stop the action/story for sex and nudity to appease the clichés present in movie making today); the landscapes, the modules, the ships, etc all look great and they look functional and real.<br/><br/>This is the type of movie I had expected from Scott after Alien and Blade Runner. This is the type of acting I expected from Damon after Good Will Hunting, Saving Private Ryan and the Bourne series. This is what I was hoping Chastain would do after her breakout in The Help.<br/><br/>Overall I give it a 9/10. It is one of the finest space/science fiction films that I have ever seen - on par with The Right Stuff, 2010, Moon and Apollo 13."

","You can't help but to compare The Martian with recent Sci-fi films of it's caliber, such as Gravity and Interstellar and I feel The Martian comes in-between the two, while at the same time, trying to be a combination of the two.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays an astronaut who gets left for dead on a mission to the forth planet from the sun, where he must find a way to survive until he can be rescued.<br/><br/>In the course of four years he had to create a farm were nothing can grow. Is the science accurate? Doesn't matter, as a lover of science fiction it was so exciting watching the movie start from what we know to be true about Mars and develop to what is, at least for now, fiction. It was very lowbrow to make it as real as possible.<br/><br/>And it does not hurt that Matt Damon is such a charming actor. Listening to him explain the mumbo jumbo was entertaining like it supposed to be and he was very humorous as well. <br/><br/>The other side of the film is NASA's rescue attempt of the hero. I thought it was very realistic, as the world all together watched The Martian become the most famous man off the planet. While the politics discuss in getting him back was possibly more accurate than the science, which there was a lot of.<br/><br/>Though the actual visual effects where not that impressive, director Ridley Scott has always been more about the Art Direction, which was vastly impressive, and very similar to the last movie that tried to portray a real look at exploring Mars, Mission to Mars back in 2000. The scenery on Mars and the ship used to get there, was so attractive it distracts from all the flaws in the science and visual effects. <br/><br/>And the movie was suspenseful throughout, I could not wait to see what would happen next.<br/><br/>Though the 3D in the film was not that impressive either, I still felt it was a good two hours and twenty minutes to sit thorough.<br/><br/>They Sci-Fied the Sh#!t out of this one!"
"jfeilteau","10","3","60","2 October 2015"," Cast Away meets Apollo 13
","Cast Away meets Apollo 13 is the best way I can describe The Martian. Ridley Scott gives us the story about how an astronaut is presumed dead on Mars and how he must now survive on Mars until NASA can send help. First off this movie has a stellar cast. Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean (who I was surprised to see in the movie) and Chiwetel Ejiofor. All of the cast has great chemistry with each other, but Damon is the one who shines and gives an Oscar worthy performance. Scott perfectly captures what is it is like to be on Mars and how helpless we would be in that kind of situation. The movie is also really funny, in fact more funny than most of the comedies that I have seen this year. <br/><br/>But its not all fun and games, when Damon is pulling a piece of shrapnel from his body your not laughing. When very suspenseful events are going down your not laughing. This shows how great Scotts direction is and how he is able to blend drama, comedy, and suspense perfectly. In the end I had a great time with The Martian it is Ridley Scott's best work in years and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone."
"eddie_baggins","8","3","60","1 October 2015"," Scott's back on form thanks to an Oscar worthy Matt Damon and a feel good tale
","Well this is refreshing. After years of average (Exodus, Prometheus) to downright terrible (Counselor) films, long serving and renowned director Ridley Scott has with this feel good blockbuster of the year created his most proficient and memorable movie experience since he thrilled the world in the early 2000s with his Russell Crowe star making vehicle Gladiator. Yes sir ladies and gentleman The Martian shows us all that the grey haired director has a few tricks up his sleeve yet. <br/><br/>The Martian is in many ways Scott's most readily accessible film. It's a long film (perhaps slightly to much so) and many of its scenarios are the very definition of 'it could only happen in the movies' but for all the minor quibbles this is a feel good film, of which is a rarity of Scott's filmography and a film that will likely thrill audiences the world over despite there never really being any doubt as to where our final destination will end up.<br/><br/>Adapted from Andy Weirs well loved novel that at one stage started its life as an ebook, this Cast Away on Mars tale is unafraid to show its colors from the outset and with very little lead in exposition and bare bones backstory, The Martian builds its tale around unbridled hope, a large dollop of humor and technically sound filming that's anchored by a Matt Damon performance that could well see the well loved actor play an important part in the upcoming awards season.<br/><br/>Perhaps wanting to do an undercover sequel to his Interstellar character of last year ( complete with fellow cast mate Jessica Chastain) The Martian once more sees Damon marooned on a distant planet but this time there's no mere cameo as Damon holds the very film on his considerable shoulders. <br/><br/>He may have been a significant reason as to why the Bourne series is such a phenomenon but never before has Damon had more to do here and he nails every aspect of Mark Whatley. Whatley - a man who conveniently seems to know everything about anything - needed to be a man we care and root for and thanks to Damon we do. It may take around 40 minutes or so to completely win us over but when Damon starts to dance along to a disco dittie in his rover you can't help but enjoy every last minute of Whatleys battle to survive. <br/><br/>It's not the classic some of the pre-hype may have made us believe but The Martian is a great big budget sci-fi blockbuster that within it holds a standout turn from Damon who outshines anything else with the film that includes impressive vistas and a somewhat underused support cast. After some lingering doubts, fans of Ridley Scott can rest easy knowing the man who bought us Alien, Blade Runner and a number of other film classics is not done with making quality films. <br/><br/>4 delicious potatoes out of 5"

Special effects were very good, and they are used here to support the story, which is very simple, but very intriguing. The only complain i had for this movie is kinda bad module work, when they show a moving vehicle on Mars, sometimes it looks too fake, maybe because it was in 3D. Matt Damon carrier this film in a superb performance -it's not Oscar worthy, but a very solid job, he delivers. I also liked Jeff Daniels acting, great work. Others were very solid. Pacing of this movie is superb, at running time 2 h 10 min. it runs very smoothly and doesn't drag for a second.

"bryank-04844","9","3","60","2 October 2015"," 'The Martian' might be one of Ridley Scott's best films.
","It's no doubt in my mind that director Ridley Scott was the perfect person to direct 'The Martian', which was based off of Andy Weir's 2011 novel of the same name. His brilliant story telling and eye to make a desolate planet like Mars look beautiful is simply majestic. Scott is mostly known for directing 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner', which kind of makes him one of the Godfather's of science-fiction, but he has a few other gems on his resume too, all in different genres. With a movie like 'The Martian' that is in the sci-fi realm, I was pleasantly surprised and overjoyed to find the film quite funny with a very feel-good quality to it, which is something that is not really present in Scott's sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>So I'm glad to see that the humor from the book transferred to film very well. 'The Martian' centers on a group of scientists and astronauts who have been doing research on Mars for a number of months including a cast of Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Askel Hennie, and Matt Damon. A few minutes before a giant storm is set to hit the crew, they decide to pack up and leave Mars early, in fear that the storm could tear apart their ship and housing. As they are walking toward the ship, a satellite flies off one of the structures and hits Damon's character Mark Watney, sending him flying a few hundred feet back.<br/><br/>Due to the darkness and debris that is flying around, the crew cannot find Watney easily and if they don't get on their ship and take off, they could all be stranded there. It didn't help that Watney's vital signals went to zero. Thinking Watney is dead, the crew heads home, but to everyone's shock and awe, Watney survived and is actually quite healthy. The problem is, he has no way to contact Earth or get home. Not only that, he only has a finite amount of food left, so being a Botanist, Watney tries to grow food, phone home, and get off Mars.<br/><br/>Luckily, the folks at NASA back home have a plan and so does Watney, but can he survive the number of days it will take to be rescued? Don't get me wrong, 'The Martian' is as intense and suspenseful as it is funny, which writer Drew Goddard, perfectly mixes these two aspects into one excellent screenplay, and it's here that we really connect with each character, no matter how small or big their roles are. We mostly communicate with Mark through a series of hand-held security cams, as he talks to us on what he's thinking and planning.<br/><br/>Instead of slowly going insane, we see him logically solve each problem in order to get home with a bit of wit and humor, which was a nice breath from the usual gloomy and dreadful scenarios we've seen play out in films like this before. The visuals are stunning in this dry landscape and was filmed in Jordan as well as on sound stages in Hungary, where almost everything looked to be real and done practically. It certainly pays off in the final version. Even though the film is roughly over 140 minutes long, it seems to only last an hour, and you don't want to leave Watney's side for a minute. That's how likable he is and to Matt Damon's credit, he just nails the role.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels, Donald Glover, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Sean Bean also show up throughout the film, and in one case Sean Bean has to explain to a group of scientists a moment in the 'Lord of the Rings' film, which is probably one of the better things I've seen in a while. I'm happy to say that the 77 year old Ridley Scott has not lost his way at all. 'The Martian' might be one of his best films, one that well made and acted on every level.<br/><br/>MUST-SEE!"

And you feel like OK it's not going bad , but you kinda feel pretty sure it'll be sorted out, which makes the surprise and shocking factor go minimum. And also what made me feel a big gap is the lack of lead actors appearance of his psychical and psychological change. a few ""fuck"" word is not enough! another slim guy showing in the back is not enough, too."

","3 October 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Martian. People as a race seem to thrive on stories of our exploration into space........and a good disaster. Ridley Scott has taken the two and rather splendidly put them together. As we were once enthralled by the true story of Apollo 13 and their struggles to get home, we are now gripped by the fictional tale of Mark Watney who is left behind, presumed dead, when a storm forces his fellow crew members to abandon their mission on Mars. However, and this is not a spoiler........Watney is alive!!!!!! This is the tale of his survival and the gargantuan task of bringing him home. Although this is very much a life and death story I was not sat on the edge of my seat. Ridley Scott takes us gently but firmly through the journey travelled by all characters and delivers us most definitely to a conclusion. Even though it is well over two hours long this film did not seem drawn out and there were many small moments of humour to break the tension. Harry Gregson-Williams, who scored the soundtrack, was interviewed on radio 2 recently and gave a short but candid look into how you start to score music in comparison to timing of the filming. However it is that he manages to do so, he manages it superbly bringing a sympathetic yet dramatic edge to the cinematography, that combined with a jaunty disco soundtrack rounds of an excellent evenings entertainment........plus it's always nice to watch Matt Damon on the big screen!!!!"
"mcintoshrg","9","3","61","3 October 2015"," A captivating film that inspires us to dream big and ignore the cynics
","After a summer of slim picking for moviegoers, The Martian (dir. Ridley Scott) represents a breath of fresh air at odds with the film's setting. It returns us to space for the third time in as many years, and proves the stronger of the thrilling Gravity (2013) and the sometimes mystifying Interstellar (2014).<br/><br/>Set in a not-too-distant future where humans have launched manned missions to Mars, we soon find our hero, astronaut and botanist Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) left behind on the Red Planet in the chaos of a brutal windstorm, his mission team traveling home and presuming him dead. Incommunicado and alone, Damon is left with only scarce resources and his own ingenuity to survive in a hostile environment.<br/><br/>The atmosphere can be heart-pounding, and the visuals are spectacular. But it isn't all action â€“ in fact there's surprising humour â€“ and it's at those times that the considerable strength of the cast is allowed to shine. Damon is notably supported by Jessica Chastain (Interstellar, Zero Dark Thirty), Kate Mara (House of Cards), and flight director Sean Bean, whose fans will delight in a winking Lord of the Rings reference â€“ and also in his not adding to his extensive personal death reel.<br/><br/>It's Ridley Scott at his finest. And it's a movie we need. Like Apollo 13 a generation before it, it inspires confidence in human collaboration, resourcefulness, and scientific exploration at a time when we face formidable global challenges of our own but popular discourse remains dominated by the parochial. One of the best outcomes of The Martian would be to prompt us to dream big once more and ignore the cynicism that too often passes for wisdom.<br/><br/>Though the movie comes in about 20 minutes too long, at 141 minutes, I give it an unreserved recommendation."

","It seems the fascination with tragedy in space has reached an apex with the release of three highly anticipated ""outer"" space dramas in the last three years: Gravity, Interstellar, and now The Martian. Let me start off by saying that the Martian resembles both films in its content, but its delivery is quite different than the other two. It's all about ACTION. It's not long before the film starts that the main problem of the story is presented: Mark Watney is left alive on Mars. The rest of the film focuses on Mark's astuteness on the desolate planet while the folks at NASA scramble, to find a way to bring home before he runs out of food and water. My grade? 8, because it's not anything audiences familiar with the genre haven't seen before. It is delivered with first class acting, that's a given considering the all-star cast: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, and that dude with the blonde hair from National Treasure. Not to mention the directorial talents of Ridley Scott. If you're bored, go see it. If you're not, wait for the next space adventure. It should be just as good."
"charzhino","7","3","61","28 September 2015"," Potential not reached
","Non-spoiler review. Having seen an early screening here in the UK, The MARTIAN was one of my most anticipated movies this year. Sci Fi is one of my favourite genres and its great we get a big budget space epic for the 3rd year in a row after Gravity and Interstellar before it. I wasn't a big fan of Ridley's last 2 movies Prometheus and Exodus Gods and Kings, both had great potential but failed to deliver. The MARTIAN unfortunately for me falls into the same zone. It is a better film no doubt than those 2 and the quality of characters /story is much more simpler and coherent but it doesn't reach the full potential I hoped it would. I have read a lot of comments from reviewers before watching it saying the film plays it safe and its clear to the viewer as the film progresses (I haven't read the book).<br/><br/>The premise of the plot is straightforward and easy to pick up and it provides the viewer with clear audible dialogue and exposition behind the motives of every action that Matt Damons character undertakes. The science behind the set pieces which form the pillars of the film are accessible to understand for the most part. The visuals are aesthetically pleasing to the eye, especially the terrain of Mars and some shots of the spaceship floating through space, I would say the 3d did enhance these scenes. <br/><br/>However without revealing spoilers, I just didn't become invested in the plot to care enough at the end. The film relies heavily on a formula which is pretty much, problem arises, problem solved, problem arises, problem solved, etc. There are 1 or 2 dues Ex machina moments which come out of the blue simply to drive the plot forward. In this sense the film starts becoming noticeably predictable as it runs its lengthy 2hr 15min course. I felt the dramatic moments on the script should have been focused more on how NASA and the crew debate the ethics of risking 6 astronauts and billions of dollars in space tech against the possibility of saving 1 stranded astronaut 50 million miles away. Overall it's an enjoyable movie, with dry humour and some neat moments throughout illustrated brilliantly by the acting of Matt Damon, but ultimately isn't the thrilling, edge of your seat, tension mounting space epic I was hoping it would be. For me Interstellar is the much better comparison and I would say Gravity is about par if not slightly better than The MARTIAN. Final rating 7/10."

","A manned mission to Mars is forced to leave the surface because of a storm and return to Earth: astronaut Mark Watney, abandoned because he is believed killed in the storm, survives, and is forced to rely on ingenuity to restore communications and create food and water from Mars' barren surface until a rescue mission can arrive.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott is a director about whom I have very mixed feelings. I have the utmost respect for his ability to put stunning visuals on screen, but I have found many of his films sorely lacking in narrative credibility. In The Martian â€“ all 141 minutes of it â€“ I have to award him full marks. Yes, it looks great, but I expected it to. Where it succeeds magnificently is in how it tells the story. This varies between the high excitement of the set pieces (the two major sequences which bookend the film, and several smaller ones along the way), the lucid portrayal of what could have been complex technical recounting of the procedures Watney (and others) follow in order to solve problems, and the emotional impact of his predicament on Watney. This latter element is dealt with sparingly, but hugely effectively.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also used effectively, with unknowns shouldering as much of the weight as names (and there are some big names in here). But most credit goes to Matt Damon, because much of the film is a one-man show, and Damon hold s the stage with ease.<br/><br/>There are moments when the 3D is effective, but Scott doesn't make full use of it at all. Don't bother seeing it in 3D.<br/><br/>This was a good film, and I look forward to seeing it again."

","This film is all about PURE ACTION and SCIENCE FICTION entertainment! Is not just about the action, but also about the intelligence and super stimulating surprising and creative problem solving skills in our hero protagonist. Tension spills every minute in this movie. Tension to whether Watney can be extracted from Mars. How will he get food? How can he communicate? Will he make it? Can NASA figure it out?<br/><br/>Thought dead, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left behind on MARS. The rest of the crew, commanded by J. Chastain, continue on with their mission. Meanwhile, Watney must face a planet with no water and no oxygen, where nothing can grow and be creative with his science knowledge and adapt and survive. Watney gets to be the first true MARTIAN. Watney though, never shows psychological distress! If he is to survive and defeat the clock-ticking of running-out-of food, oxygen, etc. he must be efficient in his energy and mental resources. It's inspiring to see that Watney keeps his enthusiasm,despite the clock ticking â€“ running out of food,oxygen,etc. He even enjoys the martian breathtaking desert and alien mountain views.<br/><br/>This movie is sooo thrilling! Explosions, injuries, astronaut waste, potatoes, ketchup, and disco music. And lots of martian dust, lots of martian stormsÂ… and of course realistic NASA technology. The world building is fantastic (Riddley Scott did the same for the Moses movie). I love the realistic lab on Mars, and all the instruments, equipment, transportation, etc. AMAZING!! And the planetary surface, the clay-red landscapes,etc.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain does a fine job, is so refreshing to see her as commander of the space ship, opposite from her role in Interstellar. One strange character, but key in Watney's rescue, is the eccentric Rich Purnell (Donald Glover) the astrophysics/astrodynamics scientist. He's irreverent. Down-to-earth and messy! Purnell is the one who sends rescue plans to the Mars crew (Jessica Chastain and the rest of the MARS mission group that left Watney behind because they thought him dead). But his character has a very low relevance otherwise.<br/><br/>So overall, please go ahead and get immersed in this spectacular and desperate race for survival of a Martian!"
"jroskey","8","2","34","4 October 2015"," Awesome but long movie. Kept my interest throughout!
","Slight Spoiler Alert. No spoilers but I go in detail into some of the 'true to science' stuff.<br/><br/>Just watched Matt Damon in his new movie 'The Martian' with my youngest daughter Olivia, where they leave him on Mars thinking he's dead and he has to survive. Not too action packed, but it kept me interested. Good movie. LONG movie, but good. It was like 2 and a half hours long! They stayed true to space and physics, outside of a couple of 0G maneuvers the crew did once or twice that seemed .. off, and the Wind Storm, (Mars has 1% of Earth's atmosphere, so even if you have 100 mph winds, that has the same force as a 1 mph wind), Outside of that it was true to science. He had to survive and was smart about MacGyvering what he needed, (Yes he used a lot of Duct Tape). He grew potatoes for the most calories,not the best for oxygen production, but best in caloric intake.So, true to science, for the most part, and kept my attention, and Matt Damon's humor himself and the character made it for me. Just was long. Daughter said the same. Oh and the 3D stuff was awesome as in any space movie too!"

","After the past two years with Gravity and Interstellar coming out, two of the greatest sci-films in history in my opinion, I was eagerly awaiting the next huge space sci-fi epic. Along comes The Martian with one of the best ensembles of the year and a sci-fi genius in Ridley Scott directing. A story about a man stranded on Mars after his crew assumed he was dead and you get Matt Damon to play the lead? Count me in. The verdict? I really liked The Martian. It's really funny, highly entertaining, and beautiful to look at, but I wasn't blown away.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is more than worth the price of admission. For most of the film, he has pretty much no one to act off of, which is something I think people are overlooking. The ensemble back home and his crew on their way back carry a load of screen-time, but this is Matt Damon's movie. Whether it's Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Jessica Chastain, or Michael Pena, the cast is on top of their game. I think where the film lacks is surprisingly its directing. I know it's based on a book, but there were plenty of scenes that I wish lasted longer but were short and vice versa. That's the case especially toward the end when I'm supposed to feel a rush of emotion, instead I felt letdown that I didn't get to see more of a scene. But the film does a great job of bringing to life scenes that should seem boring and dry. For example, all of the scientific centered exposition never feels overwhelming. That can be contributed to Ridley Scott's directing and Matt Damon's likability as an actor. That's one of the things The Martian does extremely well, it's really well paced in terms of entertainment level. You don't feel the length.<br/><br/>So perhaps it's more of editing issues instead of Scott's actual directing I had a problem with. Another thing that let me down was how little Damon's crew was in the film. That dynamic between all of them could have been explored whether it be flashbacks or just through the NASA message system. Especially when you have people like Jessica Chastain, it just seemed like a bit of a missed opportunity. No matter, The Martian still should most definitely be seen on the big screen. The Mars scenes alone are visually breathtaking. I don't know how much is green screen but I felt like I was on another planet. In terms of the special effects and CG, iv'e seen better. Again, we have been spoiled with space in film so I can acknowledge this film looks great. It just doesn't hold a candle to Interstellar or Gravity. But it's hard to pick apart this film. There really isn't much wrong with it, it just didn't blow me away like it did for others in the film community.<br/><br/>+Damon's Oscar worthy performance<br/><br/>+Mars has never looked better<br/><br/>+Humor<br/><br/>+Ensemble<br/><br/>-Underused supporting crew though<br/><br/>-CG has been better<br/><br/>8.3/10"

We use lot of energy and resources from earth to bring back those people safely to earth.<br/><br/>We read stories and watch films like aliens come to earth. Some of the alien life fights against human life. Some of the aliens are very powerful naturally. I am sorry mentioning this. It's our life style to invade all other places for resources.

","After going to see The Martian I was pleasantly surprised at hoe good a film focused on Matt Damon being alone on Mars could actually be. But to get one thing clear from start to finish you do know what the outcome of the film will be but the ride is really really good.<br/><br/>To start off the acting is really good from Matt Damon, he kept it funny, interesting and some good dramatic acting as well. The supporting cast was also very good with no real performance that was disappointing. This has some things down to the writing I have heard from other reviews as the script was really good and light for a movie surrounded by a character being left on a planet on his own. So Drew Goddard does deserve credit for his writing after the very popular book. <br/><br/>Cinematography and visuals of the film are brilliant, not once did I feel like Mars is pretty boring when watching the film. The film being set in a lonely planet it is still really cool to see vast mountains. This all adds to the desertion and the scale of the planet. The film deserves some credit for the visuals which are up there with the visuals in Gravity or interstellar which is similar in its space setting. Perhaps not as good throughout the film but still fantastic cinematic experience. <br/><br/>After already stating that anyone going to see this film you will already predict the outcome but when engaged with the film you don't really feel disappointed you feel like you was with Matt Damon on another planet. you are immersed in the film it is brilliant to watch. This would be a criticism of the film but when watching you don't dwell on this. however a real criticism would be the film is quite long at two hours twenty minutes and some scenes back on earth could be cut down a bit as we came to see Matt Damon on Mars and we want to see Matt Damon on Mars. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this film in the cinema was one of the best films of the year so far and if your a fan of space this is the film for you. <br/><br/>8/10"
"jadepietro","9","2","38","4 October 2015"," Saving Private Damon: Space Version
","(Rating: â˜†â˜†â˜†Â½ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is highly recommended. <br/><br/>In brief: Ridley Scott's epic film may not be the most original of tales but it is done with style and technical expertise making it gripping drama.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+<br/><br/>Our obsession with Mars and space exploration has been instilled with us for decades, particularly starting in the mid-fifties. From Marvin the Martian to War of the Worlds, from Total Recall to Forbidden Planet, from Robinson Crusoe on Mars to Lost in Space, we are eager to travel the unchartered frontier to seek new thrills. Now we can add to this roster of space adventure sagas yet another entry, The Martian.<br/><br/>ï¿¼A man lost in space, left to his own wiles to live in space. Such is the less than original premise of Ridley Scott's The Martian, a solid and engrossing tale of survival. In this outer space epic, there are no aliens preying on human flesh or starship battle wars. The dangers in space exploration are evident and shown as real and probable. This is the type of film that computer nerds and sci-fi geeks will love, most moviegoers will greatly admire, and some may get a little bored with the film's lack of action sequences until the film's concluding rescue mission.<br/><br/>The Martian is more of the well crafted filmmaking we have come to expect from Ridley Scott. Scott is a talented and astute director and his detailed vision and style is in every frame. In this sci-fi film, he emphasizes the science more than the fiction. He seems a tad preoccupied about the film's authenticity with its scientific concepts and mathematical theories. The Martian takes its subject seriously and celebrates human ingenuity and man's inner courage against all odds with a sincere and honest depiction of one man forced to come to terms with his own mortality.<br/><br/>ï¿¼That man, namely Mark Watney, is played by Matt Damon. Left behind after being caught in a storm, the astronaut is left to his own devices. Damon plays his character very well. He becomes the center of the film as he narrates his dilemma via a video log as he counts the days and his rations. His dialog serves as exposition and very clearly explains to the movie-going audience his intriguing thought process. The actor brings his boyish charm and likability to his role. His performance helps to ground the film and gives the audience a hero to root for. There is also fine support from Jessica Chastain as the ship's commander and Chiwetzel Ejiofor as Watney's NASA connection to Earth.<br/><br/>ï¿¼The film is technically superb. Its visual effects are impressive throughout and the photography by Dariusz Wolski excels on the three dimensional elements very effectively, with its wide depth of field when showing objects and astronauts floating effortlessly in space or panning the vast panoramic views of the red planet. But the script by Drew Goddard, based on Andy Weir's best seller, is less effective with its stock one dimensional supporting characters that rarely register any sense of reality or personality (the closely-bonded crew, the professionally trained personnel at NASA, the young obsessed genius physicist, etc.) <br/><br/>While the film is very well cast (Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, and Kristen Wiig), the actors are not given much to do dramatically than look stern or stoic. It's all a kinda Saving Private Damon's scenario, but it is gripping entertainment nevertheless.<br/><br/>ï¿¼The Martian is an intelligent and imaginative retelling of one man's will to live, well worth the trek.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

","If you like the space adventure genre then this is the movie for you. With Rigley Scott's masterful direction and Matt Daemon's expectedly solid performance, I was temporarily transported to a different world. Less so than Interstellar but still so. Some of the science was incomprehensible to me but that didn't interfered with the experience. Now for the annoying parts - some jokes, reactions and dialogs are clichÃ©s. I expect more from Mr. Scott. The most annoying part was the - don't read this if you don't want to learn about any twists or turns - the Chinese intervention. It was too contrived and seemed more like a paid advertisement in the middle of an intelligent movie than a natural flow of the story line."

I actually thought this movie was going to as boring as Gravity, but somehow this is really different. This is the story about a guy who is stuck in Mars for quite a long time. Everybody on Earth thought he was dead, but he was alive the whole time. I just can't believe that he survived after a long time being in there, he even grew his own food in a place where nothing grows, as Matt Damon says. I am definitely thinking Oscar nominations which include best Director: Ridley Scott, Best actor Matt Damon, Best visual effects and cinematography, and etc! This is a must-see, don't miss it!!"
"cshark72","7","1","14","5 October 2015"," Life discovered on Mars!!....... Human life
","*** Contains Spoilers****** Gravity was great! Wait,Â…Â…. this wasn't Gravity. But I'm sure that ""The Martian"" will get comparisons to Gravity in most every forthcoming review. It's almost as if someone said, ""OK Gravity was a huge success, so let's make another lost in space movie to make some money on this year!"" OK, notwithstanding that bit of cynicism, the Martian is a pretty good overall family movie with some really spectacular space special effects as one would expect in the ""Post Gravity"" era of movie making. I saw the movie in 3D to maximize the experience of these types of effects and it was worth it just from that aspect. The story is a feel good rescue story that doesn't leave you wondering about the outcome. So it's fairly predictable and you won't be blown away by any huge plot twists. The redeeming factor of the story is more of being able to witness the process of how the cast thought about, and went about solving the problems they encountered. It was interesting to think about some of difficulty of the math involved under such immense pressure of survival, and the prospect of trying to grow plants with the resources available. Also intriguing to me was imagining oneself in the situation of ""the only human"" on an entire planet. So from this standpoint it was a bit of an intellectual thrill, if not so much a mindless action thriller. The Martian fell short in the acting and connecting emotionally for me. For example, Damon seemed a bit too robotic and unemotional about his dreadful situation. Throughout the movie, he did entertain with various hilarious one liners, but you never sensed the deep fear and dread that one would feel in that situation from him. Also, when the rest of the crew learned of Damon's character still being alive, there was a fairly non-inspiring response. This would normally be a very traumatic news event to people that had feared his death, and been in such a long journey to another planet with him. More powerful displays of raw emotion and fear throughout would have served to draw in more concern and built a stronger connection to the audience. Also, the beginning of the movie starts quite quickly with the peril of a Martian storm that threatens the mission in progress. More time prior to this to develop the character of Damon and others would have helped as well to bring in a connection from the audience. You didn't get a chance to care too much for any of the crew, as we didn't know much about them, their personalities, family connections etc. prior to the storm's arrival. All in all I would recommend seeing this movie, I'll give it a 7/10. Perhaps a twist or two, and a bit more character development would have made it an 8 plus for me."

Some narrative parts have been left out, otherwise the movie would have transformed into a trilogy, or would have been 4 hours long. ðŸ˜€<br/><br/>In order to add a little bit more dramatic effect Mr Ridley Scott changed the story in a few occasions. It's not something very important, so don't worry. Also I personally would have preferred a different cast. Let's say I was surprised by the director's choices for some of the supporting roles. But then again it's not something that alters significantly the plot. <br/><br/>I would have tried to preserve more from the book's language but I guess they had to adjust it here and there in order not to have to change the PG rating of the movie. ðŸ˜‰<br/><br/>I say again, read the book also.

","My curiosity towards Mars started from the time the rovers Spirit and Opportunity first left the tire marks on the Martian soil. I was so excited to read about the planet get to know more on it since then. To begin with the color of the planet itself is striking as we all know it's a red planet it would attract anyone. People of Earth have shown enormous interest on Mars cos it showed signs of life in it. Glaciers, Ice Caps, Water and many images are proved factual, in years it could be our next home. When a novel named The Martian was released in 2014, i was very much eager to read about it unfortunately i couldn't, also came a rumor that a movie would be released by mid 2015 based on the novel, and what can i say it was worth the wait. Mark Watney the first man to have got lost in the planet of mars. Not literally lost but was left behind by the Ares 3 crew when a strong storm hits the planet and blow the mission. Mission commander Lewis was forced to evacuate mars when Watney was hit by an antenna and flown far away from the MAV the launch vehicle. Luckily he survives. The movie is about the survival and the hope of getting back home. The presence of mind of Mark Watney portrayed brilliantly in all aspects, burning the hydrazine to make water (though he blew it up once) and finding the path finder we the key. The space suit was never so cool, just like the iron man suit. I cannot say it's not possible to grow potato on mars since it's never been tested yet, but the entire sequence is so relevant to science, and the ''in your face Neil Armstrong'' was the dialogue of the movie. The rescue mission sling shot rounding the earth and turning back to the Mars by the Hermes was simple but shot so dazzling, it's all credits to the writer of the novel Andy weir his imagination is splendid. Though the movie doesn't explain a lot of things from the books within 2 hours of time it has done the best any one could have done. Award The cast is as brilliant as it's supposed to be for a science fiction. Matt Damon & Jessica Chastain were already used to the space tech from the interstellar, though Jessica had not worn a suit in interstellar, How cool conspiracy it could be made if you relate Interstellar and the Martian that if Mark Watney was not rescued but he flew to some other planet with the help of Ares 4 MAV than coming back to earth and then led the mission of interstellar accidentally to the same planet where they find Mark Watney lying in the unageing bed, Anything is possible in space. The conversations at the NASA are pretty decent and it's to the point, though the movie is self centered with Watney and his log book it's really amazing to witness the beauty and the calmness of planet mars. I couldn't have missed a first day first show of the movie, I am glad to have a space buddy yashas who as aeronautical engineer keeps tab on all space tech and anything which flies above the earth surface, who accompanies me in all this crazy stuff. <br/><br/>I did not want to review this movie nor rate it. It's probably one such movie where you don't find or can't find any flaws. Someday when the manned mission is successful to Mars we all will look back at this movie, someday when a man makes mars his home we would imagine the life of mark Watney this movie has a lot of lessons which someday will come to all help. One might even screen this movie in Mars some day, and people would watch it eating potato fries. I Believe in Mars."
"MattBirk","8","2","58","3 October 2015"," Being Trapped on a Planet has never seemed so Fun
","The Martian has been one of the most anticipated movies of the year, so did it deliver? It certainly did, not only was the movie intriguing from beginning to end, but it also gave us a different perspective than we were used to for science fiction genre movies. We see the moral complications as well as the psychical complications from having to save a man stranded on Mars. Not only is the movie about surviving on Mars using some serious brain power, but his survival also resides on NASA and their abilities to rescue him. It's this coordination between the two that is the engrossing part of the movie, Mars may be tens of millions miles apart, but the movie makes it seem so much closer. <br/><br/>That being said, what makes The Martian great is the scientific accuracy that went into the making of the movie. The movie has already been described as one of the most scientifically accurate movies of all time and you can kind of feel it throughout the movie. And being described like that only boosts your reputation for the better. We are basically shown how to survive on Mars and it's unlike anything we have seen before. If anything, it doesn't even seem all that bad, the movie spins his survival in an uplifting and optimistic way. It's this type of tone that is going to make The Martian more appealing to the masses than if it were spun in a darker, less optimistic way.<br/><br/>But if I had to sum up what I didn't like about the movie, it would be that everything was 'too safe'. He solved his problems a bit too fast for them to feel like actual problems. The food, water, oxygen, communications, and heat problems are all (for the most part) solved quite quickly in the movie. I just didn't feel like he was in any real danger for the long term. (But that might just be the point of the movie, the solutions to the problems weren't there real danger, but rather the limited duration of those solutions). Everything was cleaned up too nice and clean, it would have been nice to see him in some actual peril or desperation where he breaks down emotional and rather than physically. But again, that might be the point of the movie (or how the book was), it's sort of like a party out there on Mars for Dr. Watney.<br/><br/>The Martian isn't quite as raw as Moon or flourishing with bigger ideas like Interstellar, instead The Martian is a unique tale of survival where smart thinking is the focal point. Certainly one of the better movies of the year (but not quite the best), but one thing is for certain, The Martian is a definite crowd-pleaser!"

In the lead is the Martian himself he is like buzzlightyear in his suit, Every human being has a basic instinct: to help each other out. If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that it's found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just don't care, but they're massively outnumbered by the people who do. ~ Mark Watney, The Martian i haven't read the book. ., Matt Damon makes for a believable protagonist whose fictional tale for survival is truly ingenious and he makes fun of his lonely time he is a one man a team action man with a plan with mcguivers or bear gyrils survival instincts in tow , his eyes and body language make sure we can never make light of his pitiable plight he has food for thought on how to survive as he is a botanist trials a scheme using a type of energy that is dangerous but as he realize that there is alternatives to energy supplies to get from a to b earth is watching wondering ho and learning to communicate through though full mirror imaging things he fly around thinking of home which makes the Even the background score is apt and enriching to the experience. And of course, the visual effects are mind- blowing runtime of nearly two and a half hours pass by easily. . the martian is no pushover with the experience and the musical score it has big shoes to fill . Yes, Interstellar and Gravity still scores over in this aspect, but The Martian is no pushover, thank you!<br/><br/>. He is ably supported by a brilliant plethora of cast playing some wonderful characters. They include the steely crew commander played by Jessica Chastain and her motley crew of Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan, Jeff Daniels's play-by-the-book NASA director, Sean Bean's empathetic flight leader, Kristen Wiig's bemused NASA public affairs agent etc. Everyone is great, but if I have to pick up my favorite characters, it would be Chiwetel Ejiofor's sardonic but helpful mission director Vincent Kapoor .they didn't rand Donald Glover in his small role of carefree astrodynamics scientist who knows the distance in his role to create a flyby to mars <br/><br/>The climax sequence is truly harrowing, and the first thing I checked once I came out of the theater is to see If I still have any nails left to chew! so with the song life on mars booming in the background<br/><br/>Matt Damon's trip to Mars is a FANTASTIC lesson on self-belief, hope and humanity. its the best ridley science fiction since his alien its the best mars film ever and its this years best film so far with 6 academy nominations will Matt Damon win a academy award its touch because this is one hell of a film and with Leo doing his best work so Matt might just miss out .

"ron_20078","7","2","58","2 October 2015"," The Martian- Almost Perfect
","With a tremendously exciting plot and stellar star cast, The Martian proves to be another feather in Hollywood's cap in terms of visual spectacularity. The third magnum opus in the space department in as many years, after Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity(2013) and Christopher Nolan's Interstellar(2014). The trailer looked real bad-ass and the idea of a human being stranded on a far away planet, presumed dead, was enough a reason to rush into theatres. It didn't disappoint, but it could have been better. <br/><br/>The master of grandiloquence, Ridley Scott, was in a spot or so after a couple of dull movies. He's right back on the map with 'The Martian'. An adaptation of Andy Weir's novel of the same name, the story deals with astronaut and botanist Mark Watney who is left stranded on Mars after a fierce storm forces his team to abort the mission and run for cover.. err cover is only 140 million miles away. So for the next few minutes, all we see is Mr. Lonely alone on a planet of 140 million square km area. (Thank God the man is Hollywood's most bankable actor, for Matt Damon makes it not only watchable but enjoyable). The rest of the star cast play their part pretty well with their limited screen times. Jessica Chastain has come a long way from catching Bin Laden to commanding the Hermes on its Mars mission and is always a treat to watch. It's a pity that Irrfan Khan had to back out of the movie as he would have been an excellent fit as Vincent Kapoor, although Chiwetel Ejiofor does a fine job himself. The movie remains gripping throughout its entire runtime of 141 minutes. That the story is scientifically/factually correct and plausible unlike some of Scott's previous Sci-fi offerings makes it unique and exciting. <br/><br/>The only little hitch is that it struggles to adapt the book in some capacity. The story seems rushed in parts giving a feeling of incompleteness. You cannot help but notice the obviousness that a lot of important part is skipped out in order to fit in. The emotional touch fails to connect to an extent to which it should, given the situation. The epicness of the primary plot has a reduced impact than expected. That said, certain concepts and ideas are refreshingly innovative, something that is a constant requisite in a Sci-Fi movie. <br/><br/>The climax seems a little clichÃ©d and over the top, but overall the movie is worth every bit of its 2 hours and 20 minutes. Not to mention a must see for all the nerds and geeks who can later scratch their heads over possible goofs and plot holes. <br/><br/>Final word- Interstellsar>Gravity>The Martian. (Although if given a choice between Gravity and The Martian to watch again, I'd choose the latter)."

The cast is stacked with Matt Damon as the stranded astronaut, his NASA bosses which includes Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean and Kristen Wig. The rescue crew features Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña and Kate Mara among others. With so many big names, it's amazing how well the characters are portrayed and the amount of time spent is measured just right for each. <br/><br/>As always with Ridley Scott, the visuals are stunning, from the lifeless yet beautiful landscape of Mars, to the high tech rovers and space stations. Still, practical sets and effects aren't ignored. The original musical score flows wonderfully in the background, a touch of 'Alien' here and there.<br/><br/>There are highs and lows, moments of triumph (growing potatoes) and helplessness (the base entrance malfunction and explosion), but overall the film is more feel good adventure than a typical bleak sci-fi drama. The comedic dialogue, not often the case with recent Scott projects, was surprising. Science heavy at times but not too distracting. Tension is regularly relieved by the witty Matt Damon, Ejiofor and his team, even the soundtrack plays it's part with classic disco hits and of course some Ziggy Stardust too. It all results in the runtime of over two hours flying by with it's perfect pacing and by the end of it, i actually wished for a bit more. <br/><br/>However the tone at times became super cheesy, such as the Chinese space agency who come to the rescue with valuable technological assistance, and the eye rolling scene where thousands of people cheering in the streets of England and China during the rescue mission being televised around the globe, it felt silly and odd.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not a masterpiece, but The Martian is an entertaining, weird mix of science and laughs that somehow works well without the need for predictable blockbuster clichés."

","THE MARTIAN - Its like a Grand , Epic , Feel good space adventure. Not in the arena of Apollo 13 or Gravity or Interstellar. Those movies were too intense to be compared with this. By that i means its too quirky. A lot of humour has been injected so that all the time audience feels the entertainment and doesn't get too much confused by the scientific discussion. Seriously MARS haven't been such a safe place before. Its not like the characters in the movie doesn't get hurdles in their way , but i didn't find them fearing those hurdles. Every time any problem wake up too quickly the person facing it dig outs its solution too with a smile in his face. I am not saying that i don't liked the overall humour. Surely i was enjoying that but also those jokes were reducing the intensity of the film. Ridley Scott is not a kind of director who gives back to back hits. It has been 15 years since he directed GLADIATOR which won the Oscars. Last time he made a great movie was in 2006 when he made American gangster , after that BODIES OF LIES was good , ROBIN HOOD was above average , PROMETHEUS was below great (i almost thought he had made a comeback) , but then he made THE COUNSELOR - the worst movie of this carrier , and then comes the Big Budget flop EXODUS . But guess what he has made another comeback with THE MARTIAN. MARTIAN is like anti - interstellar film , which is actually not a bad thing as many persons have not liked Interstellar because of too much scientific talks(probably above their intelligence level - not director's fault) and lack of humour (cant impose jokes everywhere). So here is the solution. A movie with a lot of humour and comparatively less scientific talks also which are not to be taken seriously as there is great performance by Matt Damon to watch. But yes there are parts where i liked Martian a lot . Growing potatoes and producing water in Mars has been my favorite. Although its an anti interstellar film but the cast has been inspired from it. As Mat Damon and Jessica has been part of both the film. MATT DAMON is one actor in Hollywood with whom every director likes to work , and in every big director's filmography there always exist one film with Matt Damon. Here also he spread his charms , totally enter into the character although never we can see him in much of an scary mode. I think he never get scared. Not even if he is alone in a big planet without enough resources. Chiwetel Ejiofor as head of the mission on earth is a great watch with comic lines too. I know its shocking , but in reality every single person in the movie was cracking jokes. Rest of the cast although have big names but i m don't really getting anything to write about them. Visual effect are good , i mean really good but not great. Actually every single thing in the movie is really good but not great. But i guess this will definitely get the nomination of best Visual Effects. For the category of best movie ? I don't think so. For best actor ? No to that too. As actors performing good in movies which are not nominated themselves did not get much of a recognition. As there always is a tighter competition in best actors category then best movie. Take example of Matthew McConaughey from Interstellar who was even better then Matt Damon in this. And whats with those old disco song , they made the movie a light hearted affair. Don't take me wrong. I really enjoyed the film , its just that the Bench Mark for space movies has been set too high. And with Martian Ridley Scott played too safe. Nevertheless its a really good but not great movie to watch. 8.2/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR"

","Every movie that has been based of a novel gets often a little work on. So does this one. I read the book, and some parts of the movie are slightly different than what has been told in the movie. <br/><br/>Not that this is a bad thing, but a particular scene comes to mind where I thought to myself, hey this ain't correct. The book described it completely different and from what I think this has to do with the fact they wanted to enhance the character in question. (Although I ticket the spoiler part, I don't want to give away the spoiler itself).<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was quite good, and from what I read out of the book, I had a simular idea about it in visualisation, so I am glad I think the same as Riddley Scott I guess. Great acting, great camera work, and the idea of the go-pro's as camera's really helps you to emerge yourself into the story. <br/><br/>The downside is that there are parts of the book Scott obvious found not interesting or had no idea how to work it in the final product. For once, the journey of Wattney to the Ares 4 was cut very short, while the storm there plays in the book a vital role. It was a scene I was hoping for, but not given for example.<br/><br/>Overall, I still give the movie an 8 out of 10, due to the fact it brought the book completely to live without making it overcomplicated."

"grumpyduck","9","2","59","2 October 2015"," A Return to form for Sir Ridley Scott.
","Ridley Scott in a return to form absolutely nails Andy Weirs' best selling novel in an sprawling survival tale on the distant planet Mars. His use of 3D makes you a visitor to the sprawling Martian landscapes, putting you right in the heart of the action, whilst Matt Damon, with an outstanding performance, makes the abandoned astronaut Mark Watney someone you root for throughout the entire 140 minutes. Damon's easy going manner, the gorgeous cinematography and solid support from the rest of the cast make this an absolute treat. Toning down the science of the brilliant novel for the masses is a masterstroke in screen writing and the inclusion of some fantastic pop songs bolster the great score. I was a little disappointed that some parts of the novel were skipped over but all in all I loved it."

","The Very Good: Ridley Scott continues to prove himself a steely-eyed missile director. Great eye candy. Worth 3D tickets for the Mars landscape shots alone.<br/><br/>The Good: The acting was excellent on all counts. Matt Damon makes a perfect Mark Watney. (Don't let Interstellar skew your viewing of this movie. Very different character.) Jessica Chastain was great all the way up to her character, Lewis, pulled a Captain Kirk (which was not the actress' fault.) Boromir and Will MacAvoy made great bookends. The Operative was essential for this flick. Well played! <br/><br/>The Ugly: Drew Goddard should be stabbed with the same pair of scissors he used on Andy Weir's story. It lost a lot more than a couple of f-bombs while carving this turkey into a PG rating. I understand plot points must be trimmed for a film, and the first half was reasonable, but the second half I raise a glass to toast the anguish and head-banging-against-wall that Mr. Weir must have endured during the making of this film.<br/><br/>The bottom line: Go see it... then read the book (if you haven't already) so you can enjoy the *story* part of the story too."

","I read the book and I loved it. I was super excited to see this film and it did not disappoint. Of course the movie is going to be in a different format than the book since a great majority of the book is Mark Watney's point of view (which would be really boring if we just saw him talking the whole movie). Despite the change in format and a few minor changes to some of the scenes, it was a great movie. It was funny, thrilling, and heartfelt. The movie removed about 90% of the technical explanations so if you read the book and you were looking forward to that, you will be disappointed. <br/><br/>My girlfriend is not into sci-fi movies but she came out of the movie talking about how much she loved it. It seems as though it can make anyone fall in love with science despite their background. All-in-all, I would say, go see the movie and bring your friends (no matter what their background is)."

","There was so much buzz going on about the Martian in the internet for the past week. These commotions made me book the ticket for the first show, first day. And it did not disappoint me. The Martian delivers a strong message that willpower can even defeat Mars. Ridley Scott, has developed the movie at a very intense emotional level that we forget to laugh at the jokes sometimes due to the desperate condition of the Martian.<br/><br/>Matt Damon delivers the performance of his lifetime as the Protagonist of the movie. He pulls of the character so intensely that we fall in love with the character that whenever he suffers from a tragedy, the audience gets disturbed too. Donald Glover brings in some unexpected comedy that puts up a smile in the face of audience. The rest of the cast has delivered an excellent performance regardless of how big/small their role is.<br/><br/>Visual Effects is mind blowing in all the way.

"muvi-fan-73","9","2","59","2 October 2015"," highly recommended space ride!
","The movie is about a man played by Matt Damon, who is left behind on planet Mars by the space crew which visits the planet and returns to earth, they think they lost him in an accident. Matt Damon has to survive a long time before anybody finds he's alive and rescue measures are adopted. He is an intelligent botanist who uses his own poop to grow potatoes on Mars, thus colonizing the planet; he also learns to establish contact via older but easier means. First mission to send extra food fails and crops are also lost in some kind of accident. But a total different strategy to save him totally works out. He also becomes a pirate, enjoys a status of iron man. The same crew, who left him, brings him back.<br/><br/>The Martian offer's much more that is shown in trailers, for me it was a ride full of enjoyment and not even a single moment of boredom. The director of NASA is a good constructed character that rules to save astronauts', by not sending crew back to extended mission, thus not jeopardizing their lives. The tolerating audience of west is great, when it comes about religion (cross). If his information would have been kept classified still it would have been great script to save humanity from any type of let down. The decision to bring him back is left on crew itself. I would have added an extra mark if the script worked out well, so as to confirm his death by crew members as the return could have delayed. For Mars with thin atmosphere it would have been an ethical thing to do, still a highly recommended movie to watch."

This movie is just the narrative where the common man will understand the universe in such delightful humor, especially after Interstellar confused our basics. What a brilliant story with some funky disco music in the background and some brilliant performances from the lead cast ably lead by Matt Damon who takes his performance so lightly that you forget that he is the the only living organism in MARS. The supporting cast with Jessica Chastain and Michael Pena add some depth to the Hermes( The Ship)and on the ground we have a Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel The intelligently woven script with some witty lines makes the movie very interesting but not gripping and a tad bit long. This is definitely Matt Damons movie and he should be knocking the doors of the awards at least deserving of a few nominations.

"Ramascreen","Null","2","60","30 September 2015"," A monumental cinematic achievement
","The year's not over yet but if I were to form a list today, THE MARTIAN most definitely takes the top spot. It's the best movie of 2015 and quite frankly, it's the best Ridley Scott movie since ""Gladiator."" It's no secret that I found Scott's movies to have been quite disappointing over the past fifteen years or so, ""Kingdom Of Heaven,"" ""Body Of Lies,"" ""Robin Hood,"" ""Prometheus"" for example — they just existed — they didn't leave a mark nor carry a lot of weight. But I had hope that the director who gave us such classics as ""Alien,"" and ""Blade Runner"" would return to his form and I find that in THE MARTIAN.<br/><br/>Based on Andy Weir's outstanding debut novel and adapted by Drew Goddard (""Cloverfield,"" ""Cabin In The Woods"") Oscar winner Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney who's a member of the NASA crew that explores the planet Mars. A storm forces them to leave their mission but a debris hits Watney and he's presumed dead as his fellow crew members leave him behind. But surprise! Wanted survives, he must now figure out how to continue to survive on that desolate planet where nothing grows and his food supplies are dwindling while at the same time figure out how to make contact with NASA. Mark Watney relies on his wit, his botany skills, his courage and his strong determination to get through each day as NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring him home.<br/><br/>What's funny about this is that a couple of years ago, Alfonso Cuaron's ""Gravity"" was also the best movie of that year in my book, and last year, Matt Damon played a character in Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" that somewhat went through a similar situation as his ""The Martian"" character, Mark Watney although they're not exact copy. But the point is, THE MARTIAN, at the heart of it, is a survival movie, just like any other survival movies you've seen about one person stranded on some island or some deserted place. What makes THE MARTIAN unique is that it's unlike any other sci-fi movies, mostly because author Andy Weir impressively did his best to make every aspect and every element of this film as accurate as possible. The extensive research is remarkable. In addition to that, the film feels like a series of solving math problem, one after another. Every time there's a glimmer of hope, a problem comes along and complicates the situation again, but it only pushes the characters to brainstorm, to think outside the box and reach out to other help.<br/><br/>THE MARTIAN is a monumental cinematic achievement. From the story to the performances to the production design to the VFX, to the editing to every little detail of technical standpoint, everything about this film embodies excellence. It gives us what ""Interstellar"" could not, because Nolan's movie meant well, but the concept unfortunately trumped its story whereas ""The Martian"" has them go hand-in-hand. And perhaps some audiences might view this movie as a bit political especially with the scenario of NASA getting assistance from China's space program, but I think anybody from any background could view that as basic morality, the things that we humans could accomplish if we were to focus on a common goal instead of making it be only about a space race. It's amazing that even some smart nerd in Pasadena could bring positive contribution or an idea to the table. The movie is about a collaboration of all these people just to bring one man home, so it's more or it's a much bigger picture than just about Matt Damon's Mark Watney. THE MARTIAN is epic in every sense of the word, it will make you applaud at the end, it deserves a standing ovation.<br/><br/>I hope THE MARTIAN would reignite today's generation's interest to once again dream big and look to the skies. Not everybody is going to be an astronaut or work for NASA's plan of someday putting a man on Mars, but personally, I think films like THE MARTIAN, stories such as this, solidify what I've always strongly believed to be true, science is sexy."
"oh_stranger_oh","5","2","61","3 October 2015"," A good space flick, not a great one
","The human fascination about the 'Red planet' is not young. The fourth planet of our solar system always stood out as the best chance of human race migrating to any other planet nearby other than earth. Now as the scientists claim they found the water fountains in there, the fascination in coming years will only grow.<br/><br/>Coming back to the movie, 'The Martian', to be honest I am little disappointed, though all the other reviews I heard or read went gaga over it. I mean after all it's a Ridley Scott movie with Matt Damon in it. But in the end it felt like just a feel good space flick where everything falls back into pieces, eventually as all optimistic audiences will speculate. Personally I felt it's like Apollo 13 meets Gravity with a happy ending. I have nothing against happy endings but there must be a limit of optimism. Another movie to glorify NASA and makes people think that they are still pretty much into business and soon as Matt Damon said, Humans will grow crops in Mars and eventually colonized it. <br/><br/>About the actors in this movie, Matt Damon, in present days, arguably the most complete actor of Hollywood and he did not let you down as far as the acting is concerned. Always a fan of Sean Bean form the days of 'Golden Eye', in short and pivotal role he as well proved his worth. Jeff Daniels as the director of NASA and Jessica Chastain (Interstellar fame) as the captain of the spaceship were outstanding. Never liked Kate Mara and Michael Pena, so as usual they are disappointing. Chiwetel Ejiofor played Vincent Kapoor, a Indian origin NASA scientist for unknown reason as any other Indian actor could play that role, especially when there are lots of Indians working in NASA, an Indian face would have been good.<br/><br/>Last but not the least; I heard lots of people are comparing Interstellar with this one. Let me tell you guys, these 2 are completely different movies. May be a few of the star cast is repeated in this movie but this one is just about space travel not about time & space travel. My rating is 2-1/2 out of 5. See if you must, but for me it's a good movie but not a great one."

","With the novel being already quite famous, The Martian was already surrounded by a good vibe. The movie delivered what exactly the trailer promised. With Ridley Scott in the director's chair hardly few things could go wrong (forget exodus;-)). Narration and screenplay play a major part in this movie. Visual effects are a plus point especially in the climax sequence which is shot to perfection. <br/><br/>The plot is hardly anything more than what is shown in the trailer. Matt Damon gets stranded in mars after a NASA expedition gone wrong. With the crew on another mission, its up to Matt Damon and his intelligence and experience to survive in mars until the rescue arrives. There is a whole lot of tongue in cheek humour in the movie which keeps the audience interested. Though there are a few over the top and cheeky sequences, the screenplay is pretty decent. There is a whole lot of science and biology involved to satisfy the nerd brains. In time to come there might be articles pointing out the scientific inaccuracies but lets face it no science movie can be perfect. The movie does not go overdramatic like other science fiction by trying to introduce an antagonist role when there is no need of one which is the biggest plus point. <br/><br/>The star cast of this film is pretty huge and is bound to attract a huge number of audiences. Many of them get a very little screenspace as expected. Matt Damon appears in a very cool role after a long gap. Chiwetel Ejiofor has a major role and he reminds us of his '2012' performance. Jeff Daniels has nothing much to do apart from keeping a stern face. I felt Jessica Chastain role could have been written better. Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sebastian Stan , Kristen Wiig and Aksel Hennie just increase the star power. Oh and BTW, Sean Bean lives;-) The only downside of the movie is it is a bit lengthy. But the movie is awesome enough to go and have a nice Mars experience."

","After delivering space epics like ""Alien"" and sci-fi classics like ""Blade Runner"", Ridley Scott is back top of his game in what is his best film since Gladiator and possibly the aforementioned Alien. The Martian is not the film you might expect from Scott, the man who for the better part of the last decade has had films rife with clunkiness. I was amazed at how tonally the film never puts a foot wrong. It's pitch perfect, no pun intended. Everything in the film is juggled and distilled with a precise purpose of how it affects the mood of the piece. Nothing is extraneous. It doesn't compromise any of its many intertwining elements. It doesn't sacrifice its aims for adding humour, suspense, character definition if anything they add to it. The biological, chemical and mathematical elements crucial to the plot are captivating because they're so carefully infused and engrained with this tone Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard have created.<br/><br/>It's funny, intense and everything in between because it of how well-crafted the film is. For such an enormous cast, Scott gives them all their moments to shine. It's an ensemble piece in every sense of the word with Matt Damon being the anchor that holds it all together. The soundtrack is the cherry on top. You would really have to go digging, or snark up big time to find problems or flaws. It put a smile on my face that still hasn't left. A wondrous joy. Sublime stuff Mr. Scott. More where that came from, please. <br/><br/>P.S. Never has an Abba track been so elegiac. I never thought I would type those two words in the same sentence."

Really difficult to find anything you can fault with this movie!<br/><br/>Having seen both films it's inevitably going to be compared to: Gravity & Interstellar, I feel I'm in a position to compare - and on first viewing (watched them all once, and at the cinema) this one knocks the socks off Gravity and encompasses the 'wow' factor of Interstellar but with a much more 'human' plot which is far easier to connect with. I bet the book is a fantastic read, but even without actually reading it I'm guessing this is a really good adaptation which helps bring the pages to life.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to experience what cinema is all about: taking us out of our ordinary lives and whisking us away for 2 hours or so...

Going in I wasn't sure what to expect, I thought what can you do for two hours on a desert planet? Well, it turns out that it's something good because The Martian is one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>I mean seriously, this movie is so good in so many ways I couldn't believe it. The cast, first off, were amazing, you've got people like Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels and of course Matt Damon; they all do an amazing job in their roles, you couldn't fault them. But obviously one man has to carry the movie and Damon does it brilliantly, playing a man completely alone, isolated on an entire planet having to use only the stuff that was left behind and his own intelligence to survive, incredible acting there, especially with some of the darker moments when you can see this man is about to break but carries on relentlessly.<br/><br/>The story is also a fascinating one, there wasn't any point where I was bored watching The Martian; you mostly wanted to be with Damon on Mars watching him do various things as it was both thrilling, exciting, relieving and funny, yes that's right, this film is hilarious, it's just a fantastic script, the movie handles it's comedy really well and some parts are just so uplifting and makes you smile. The Earth scenes are entertaining as well, they didn't drag at all, watching these NASA guys trying to work out if they can actually save this Mark Watney from Mars and balancing that with handling the press and media it makes for some good acting and screenplay.<br/><br/>One other thing that surprised me was the music, the original score was amazing and adds real feeling to the scenes and then I'm not going to spoil it but you are going to remember the soundtrack and songs they use in The Martian.<br/><br/>The only negative I can say I had with this film was just the opening, I felt that from the very start to when the crew actually leave Watney on Mars it felt a little off or choppy and just wasn't as good as the rest of the movie but that may just be me, it didn't bother me too much because that's only like ten minutes of set-up.<br/><br/>In the end I loved The Martian, it's definitely one of the biggest surprises for me and like I said, one of the best films this year."

","Just seen it! Brilliant! Great story, great acting, great directing, great cinematography and much more - a feast for the human eye. <br/><br/>Matt Damon's acting is excellent throughout, at times delivered with his own charming sense of humour and he is the linchpin that holds the film together complimented by the rest of the cast. It's far from being completely focused on Matt Damon; the story is well balanced between all the varied scenes and to me Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Kate Mara and Chiwetel Ejiofor really stand out. Great casting and, of course, great directing by Ridley Scott. <br/><br/>The scenery, CGI, 'hardware' and props give the movie gravitas and an unquestioned sense of feeling real absorbing you into the story and adding a sense of gravitas. The overall production is a credit to everybody involved and an an unreserved success. <br/><br/>Not perfect but a masterpiece of entertainment, storytelling and celebration of the human spirit. Beautiful and at times very touching. I command you to go and see this movie! A Classic and a Masterpiece."
"jen-lynx","9","1","37","4 October 2015"," A smart and upbeat SF story makes for a great come back by Ridley Scott.
","Ridley Scott's latest Science Fiction film, ""The Martian"" (2015), is everything I want in a Science Fiction film. It has intelligent, science based themes, just enough action and suspense to keep one interested, and plenty of humor to lighten the mood. Having just read the novel by Andy Weir, I knew this film had the potential to be great. Weir's novel of the same name is a hilarious, but thoroughly researched investigation of how one person might survive alone on Mars, and how by working together, the rest of the world could find a way to bring him home. The movie stayed very true to the essence of the book.<br/><br/>Matt Damon stars as Mark Watney, the astronaut left behind for dead on Mars after a storm forces a hurried evacuation. He couldn't be more suited for the role. Watney was the Botonist and Engineer on the mission. The ability to make things grow and fix whatever is broken are two skills that come in very handy, for obvious reasons. Watney is highly intelligent, creative, and has a wicked sense of humor. We also see NASA and JPL frantically working on Earth to find a way to save Watney. The crew on the original mission also get into the game.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. A great comeback for Ridley Scott, some decent acting, a fabulous script adaptation, and great cinematography make this a must see film for those into the genre and even those who aren't. I wasn't a huge fan of the music, but the disco references were great and one perfectly placed Bowie song made up for an otherwise lackluster score. I also felt with so many characters, some were not fully developed. That said, this is definitely one for the collection.<br/><br/>P.S.: The book is a fun and easy read. If you like the movie, read the book!"
"svrao-131-445888","9","1","37","4 October 2015"," A film about the Indefatigable Human Spirit!
","The Martian is a film about space travel & space exploration. It is a film about amazing technology & innovation. <br/><br/>But above all that, it is a film about the Indefatigable Human Spirit. When Mark Watney is left for dead on Mars, he uses every neuron of his ingenuity and every ounce of his skills to find ways to survive, communicate & eventually escape the planet. He does not stop to bemoan his fate. Instead he goes into high gear using all the skills that he has been trained for, to literally ""Science the s... out of this""! Whether it is growing food, making water, finding the path finder & communicating -- all of it is done in a quiet, intelligent almost self- effacing manner. <br/><br/>On the Earth side, there is the same unwavering desire to rescue this man against all odds - time, money & even science! The band of scientists & engineers led by Vincent Kapoor show that same dogged spirit when they try everything in their power to pull off the most daring planetary rescue.<br/><br/>On the Hermes, when the crew realizes that their colleague is alive on Mars, they unanimously decide to go back and rescue him, knowing that it could be seen as mutiny and they could lose their entire career & even their life to this mission.<br/><br/>That is why, for me this film goes beyond science. It glorifies/typifies all the things that are good about the human race. It inspires and gives hope that good things can happen when we collectively put our hearts & minds into something.<br/><br/>Finally, this film would not be quite so amazing without the heroic performance by Matt Damon!! And he does all this with such grace and humor that you can't but help empathize & root for this ""conqueror pirate""! In the scene right before he is rescued, he cries in sheer pain & relief that this ordeal is about to end, and you cry with him. When he jokes about being a pirate, you laugh with him. When he grows potatoes and calls himself the best botanist on the planet, you rejoice with him. That is the power of Matt Damon's Mark Watney. Truly an award winning, memorable performance that will be remembered for a long time. <br/><br/>The Martian is one of the best films I have seen in a long time."

It's gives a new meaning to what we know as 3D. Truly the best I've ever experienced. This movie is 100X Better that Gravity, which was terrible on so many levels.

Being left out & all alone in an inhospitable planet surely sounds like the worst predicament, however the mood the pace and the thought is positive and happy. The protagonist learns to accept the situation, make the best of what he has got and move on with hope. This is one of the best power of mind movies I have seen. <br/><br/>Often, when we are hit a bad patch, we have 2 choices, either we move on or we give up. This movie is about survival at its best. Matt Damon adds life to the character Mark Watney. You just cannot not like him and go on a journey with him. His advice to the future group of budding astronauts is practical and valuable. <br/><br/>This is one of those movies where there is no right or wrong, no villains, no monsters, just nature, man and his emotions.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view - visual, cinematography, acting, direction, and score – I'm pretty sure this movie will be an Oscar contender. The cast is awesome and support each other seamlessly."

The movie was as good as Interstellar and Gravity. This Sci-fi Space drama by Scott has made options for Oscars Jury nominations. The screenplay was adapted in a way it should be.

"EzioMonty117","10","1","41","4 October 2015"," One of the best of 2015 with some problems
","The Martian is a great but not overly perfect movie with Matt Damon, i saw this movie, a day after it's premiere here in Norway, and i'm impressed. This movie successfully brings back the routes of Ridley Scott after his disappointments like Prometheus and Avatar. Here's why this movie is great.<br/><br/>The story follows Mark Watney, an astronaut who after failing a mission on Mars due to a storm and his crew member left him behind, he is the only one on Mars and must use all his food and shelter on Mars to live and give contact to everyone on Earth that he is alive and that he isn't dead, while on Earth, they must find solutions to help Watney get back to Earth.<br/><br/>The direction of Ridley Scott in this movie is spectacular, this film is very funny and as well as emotional. The humour is all done perfectly, especially the tone of the film being rather different than most science fiction movies. The music is great as well, with music by Abba and Gloria Graynor and it's orchestral by Harry Gregson Williams is great as well being rather epic than it's movie.<br/><br/>The performances especially Matt Damon's performance is one of the best of this year along with Julianne Moore in Still Alice. Matt Damon's wit and sarcastic personality makes his character likable and interesting. The film's visual effects is stunning, Mars looks so real and space is fully detailed. The scientific accuracy is pretty accurate, NASA status of this movie does it perfectly.<br/><br/>I have never read the novel so i can't compare it to the movie. The film isn't perfect though. The film's biggest issue is the film's length and the sequence where people on Earth from Times Square and Trafalgar Square are seen watching NASA talking about the savings of Mark Watney, i thought it was awkward and the film, even though 141 minutes still felt long, the film's characters were less exciting than the main character but Chiwetel Ejiofor and Aksel Hennie did pretty good, but i thought Jeff Daniels and Kristen Wiig were not a good cast for the characters, but that's just me.<br/><br/>The Martian is not perfect, but it is one of the most entertaining films this year along with Kingsman. The humour, drama, direction, visual effects, scientific accuracy, likability, music and stunning art direction is great, but it's length, conclusion and some of the casting and characters were not my taste. Check it out, even the 3D is good.<br/><br/>10/10"
"keithlovesmovies","9","1","57","3 October 2015"," The Martian Review
","When Mark Watney's (Matt Damon) fellow astronauts, Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), Rick Martinez (Michael Pena), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie), leave him behind on Mars thinking that he is dead after facing a fierce storm. Because of a minimal amount of supplies, Watney must used his smarts and his spirit to find a way to survive. Meanwhile, on Earth, members of NASA along with a team of international scientists must work hard to bring him home while his fellow astronauts must come up with their own plan for a rescue mission.<br/><br/>One thing I liked about this film is that it didn't take itself too seriously. This film tries to be many things, a sci-fi film, a drama, and has quite a surprising amount of comedic moments to lighten things up. What I liked about that was they never felt out of place in the context of whatever was happening at the time. I also thought it did all of these very well without overdoing any of them as well. This is all thanks to the great story here with a lot of realistic and accurate (as far as I know) depictions of science and science-y stuff. In essence, it focuses on a man's fight for survival and to return home to his family and also the exploits in where the people on Earth must go through in order to try to bring him back. The film presented this in a very straightforward way with Watney cobbling things together to prolong his survival and the various factions of people below working together to build all of these things in order to help him. The film goes about this in a very captivating way with Matt Damon's performance as Mark Watney and the great script and dialogue. Watney's positive attitude about getting out of his predicament was quite infectious as despite everything that was happening to him, he still kept trying. What makes his performance even better was that I don't think it would have been the same if here were played by someone else. From his successes to his failures, there was always some comedy to be had because of it. Because of it, you would sometimes forget that he was still on Mars. The film did not miss a beat when it focused on the people on Earth. The story remained captivating then because of the great sharp dialogue and all of the supporting performances by Chastain and also by Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kappoor. I thought the music in the background kept viewers in the mood but never overpowered the scene. The film had some good pacing as everything flowed nicely and the editing left nothing that felt unnecessary and you forget that the film is just over two hours long as the time just flies by. I can't believe I haven't mentioned the visuals yet because they were beautiful as they really captured the barren landscape that is Mars and the space stuff isn't Gravity or Interstellar quality but it was pretty good too. Sure the story got silly a few times but I didn't mind. The film also had a running gag (that I will not spoil) that I also enjoyed. Overall. I did not think I could find a film that I would like more than Ex Machina but I am happy to have been proved wrong in this instance.<br/><br/>Score: 9.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com"
"tessahathaway","7","1","57","3 October 2015"," Questions
","I have a few unresolved questions about this movie: <br/><br/>First, wouldn't he have lost a lot of bone density and strength given the fact that he's on a planet with a high gravitational pull and has lost a noticeable amount of weight from having to ration his food supply?<br/><br/>Also, my biggest concern: wouldn't he have gone clinically insane?? I mean, I get it. He has some contact with people through messaging and he talks to himself with the video, but the sheer fact of being the only living thing on an entire planet for a year and a half would be enough to drive any person insane, good sense of humor or not. <br/><br/>It was a great movie, don't get me wrong - kept me on the edge of my seat, holding my breath, all that, but those questions really stand out to me..."
"aorta-tw","7","1","57","2 October 2015"," Quite entertaining movie, but not so much on science part
","Yes, it is quite entertaining as a rescue movie, with the scene in space.<br/><br/>The starting scene didn't spend much time and directly led us to the main part, surviving in Mars, a difficult planet.<br/><br/>The flow was quite smooth and some humorous jokes did well. The ""I need some hot stuff tonight"" part made me laugh so hard.<br/><br/>We all know in mind that he will be rescued successfully in the end. It makes the desperate part not so strong that we can always expect someone to make solution to the difficult situation.<br/><br/>Not really scientific, like the Interstellar did, that you just ran into some trouble and just wait for solution as you can expect.<br/><br/>Quite entertaining actually, but don't expect too much on scientific theories."
"peggyatthemovies","8","1","58","25 September 2015"," The Martian - a hopeful survivalist tale with a good sense of humour
","I've always had mixed feelings about Director Ridley Scott and his films. Some are fantastic and some..are not. Here he is back once again to exploring a familiar territory – space.<br/><br/>""THE MARTIAN"" truly strikes cinematic gold here with what could be looked as a quasi-instruction manual on how to survive surefire death on Mars. Though this adaptation of Andy Weir's novel (which I haven't yet read) is the best thing Scott has given us in quite some time, he still goes where others have gone before – only this time, with a perky, life-affirming attitude.<br/><br/>The concept is catchy and simple: While on a mission on Mars, a major storm hits the crew of the Ares III facility causing them to abort and head for their escape rocket. As Commander Lewis (Jessica Chastain), cyber-whiz Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), flight surgeon Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), pilot Rick Martinez (Michael Pena) and chemist Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie) head out into the vicious winds of Mars where botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit by debris and disappears. The others think he's dead and leave without him. But guess what?! He's alive! And in order to survive he must ""science the shite"" out of the remaining supplies in a lab that was created to last only 31 days. His wit, scientific know-how and vlogs are what sustain him until the people at NASA – including NASA director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), mission director Dr. Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and flight director Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) – can figure out how to save him. Add in the back ground techies Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis) & Rich Purnell (Donald Glover) who literally come up with the live-saving idea that make it possible to go back and get their man!! All the while they make this trip to Mars almost scenic as you can almost feel the atmosphere while watching.<br/><br/>There are shifts here between humor, heart and suspense which are all handled quite well. Plus the soundtrack..ohhh the soundtrack... with it's precise way that it works in the disco from the made-fun-of play-list of Lewis' – with just a sampling is ""Waterloo"" (ABBA) ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" (Thelma Houston) and Vicki Sue Robinson's ""Turn The Beat Around"" – is not only truly ingenious but yes, fabulous as well. It hits all the notes at just the right moment in Watney's journey, giving us a look into his in-the-moment feelings in a perfectly stated way.<br/><br/>While this film is almost all Matt Damon, his very adequate supporting cast really gives the film a huge boost..along with the fact that it engages us intellectually, but not over the top as they make it all relatable and with a dose of humour I just loved. So it makes it hard to even list the one small unfortunate thing about THE MARTIAN as it's good..really good.. it does stop just one step short of being electrifying. And in this case..that's still not a bad thing.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"nravilious","8","1","58","1 October 2015"," A space adventure with a human touch
","Ridley Scott, one of the most well known and respected directors working today combines with Matt Damon donning a spacesuit once again. A big budget then, and lots of publicity. Does the film live up to its hype?<br/><br/>Scott's 4th sci-fi if my math(s) is right. He clearly knows what he's doing, but Prometheus was no better than average, so a great film was by no means guaranteed. Blade Runner and Alien are both icons of the genre, but for my money, Gladiator is his best film by some margin. The Martian doesn't knock that off of my personal top spot, but it definitely holds its own among the also rans like the aforementioned icons and Matchstick Men.<br/><br/>What's good about it? I think this is an example where most things are done really well, with each element having a positive impact on the end result. Let's start with the writing. The source material from Andy Weir (which I've not read yet) is highly regarded and it's been adapted by Drew Goddard, who has some great TV shows and films on his CV, not least Alias, Lost and Daredevil. His impressive provenance means the script actually feels well crafted for a change rather than something that's been knocked up on the back of a fag packet. It helps no end, and the frequent bursts of humour are well judged. Balancing the humour, Scott says the film is a love letter to science, and these elements are pitched just right.<br/><br/>Other stuff...the 70s music is apparently faithful to references in the novel and is surprisingly enjoyable, and the sound design throughout is great. The picture is vibrant and pin sharp (I'm guessing Scott doesn't have to skimp on equipment) with some superb cinematography - a couple of shots of the earth seen from space easily rival the spectacular images in Gravity.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is extremely likable in the lead role (making up for being a bit of a tool in Interstellar) but this is as much an ensemble piece in my book as much as it's a spotlight for Damon. The film is littered with sparkling performances from a very talented cast.<br/><br/>So I guess you're waiting for the but. Has to be one or two, otherwise the film would be 10/10 right? Well it's really just minor quibbles about my favourite area to focus on, the story.<br/><br/>As I've already said, the writing is great overall and the script is highly competent. But under close scrutiny, there are a couple of flat spots and at the other extreme, a couple of moments of jeopardy that feel forced. I don't know how reading the book compares, but on screen these moments smack of someone arbitrarily throwing in some danger to keep the plot going and the tension high. The moments in question just didn't feel organic enough for me, so as a result, I was jerked out of the film a bit and not fully invested in the scenes that immediately followed. I'm sure other people wouldn't be quite so critical, but I personally wasn't as lost in the story as I wanted to be. I'd probably rate Gravity a little higher in that respect and also in regard to its emotional punch.<br/><br/>As I said, these are minor quibbles only and I strongly recommend you go out and see it unless you hate sci-fi. Try and avoid spoilers, too. I tried, but managed to learn about two major plot points, which was a shame. Ah well."

","I waited for weeks to see this movie and when it came out I went first night. It was well worth the wait. I enjoyed it. I was sorry it ended. I wanted another mission or chapter. What Mark Watley had to endure was so realistic - honest - and so macho. I would only hope that if I were in his shoes I could attempt to try and do the same. I know now that NASA has always been fascinating and that I didn't learn all I needed to know to travel in space from high school. The information presented at different times was perfectly timed for the better understanding by the viewer. GREAT one liners. The movie, landscape, machinery, uniform-suits, equipment and difficulties were so real - that during the movie I found myself thinking how I would do it - and I was there helping out. The movie captivates you and holds you on another planet yearning for survival and with guts and gumption to go for it. Fantastic movie - will see again - AND BUY THE DVD!"

But sometimes drama went to hight which resulted in doing of impossible things. The things i liked about the movie was awesome direction by Ridley Scott, and all the actors have acted near to perfect in this movie. They the graphical representation was her o correct of every vehicles that was used in the movie and also detailing bout the planet Mars, it showed all the problems related to a space launch and what could actually happen in Space and planet like Mars. But there are too many errors in the movie too like during the time it gets too dramatic in the end and shows the stuff that could really not happen or is not possible but in the end it's just a movie. The ONLY SIN IN THE MOVIE IS: THEY HAVE NOT SHOWN THE GRAVITY OF MARS CORRECTLY. Bottom line: You should go and see this movie, its one of the best movies this year."
"Nixon_Carmichael","9","1","62","1 October 2015"," An achievement in filmmaking. Almost seems ""based on true events"".
","Obviously this is a work of fiction, based on a work of fiction, but The Martian is shot in such a way that it seems like it could be based on true events. Ridley Scott is back in a big way.<br/><br/>The movie starts off by hitting the ground running. There is no set up involving drama surrounding who will be included on the mission to Mars and who will not. From the opening scene we are involved in the storyline, there is no filler here.<br/><br/>After a disastrous event, Mark Watney is presumed dead and wakes up to the realization that his crew had inadvertently abandoned him, and he's now the only living organism on the red planet. Rather than wallowing in anguish and despair, Watney decides to use his scientific training, ingenuity and equipment at hand to attempt survival. Though his sanity starts to wane, he develops a rather irreverent sense of humor, which he eventually unleashes in a variety of ways.<br/><br/>Everything in the film is approached in a grounded and factually sound way, not a pseudo scientific or pseudo intellectual, Christopher Nolan sense. Where films like Interstellar are fantasy spectacles masquerading as grounded, true to life movies, The Martian plays out essentially just as it would in the real world. There is no futuristic tech or sentient computers to be found here.<br/><br/>I can only say that I highly recommend this film if you are in the mood for something that is both entertaining and different."

Watching documentary footage of real people both in NASA and among the public becoming tearful at the successful landing of Apollo 13, just made me so aware that the scenes of the public anxiously waiting for Mark Watney to be rescued weren't real. It took a number of viewings for me to finally develop that suspension of disbelief to enjoy the ending. But every time I've watched it I like it more and more.

","Charismatic leading actors can elevate films of they are well cast and 'The Martian' illustrates this point better than most. Matt Damon has enough screen presence to carry this mess off and carry the audience along with him.<br/><br/>A large and illustrious production team also maintain acceptably high production standards and fairly imaginative production design work.....although at no single point did I think that anything looked like it couldn't have easily been filmed on Earth in a studio on a sound stage or semi dessert location. There wasn't a single moment of remarkableness in the visual design of the film.<br/><br/>The artistic designs of the space vehicles and space travel seemed particularly unremarkable compared to other contemporary space sci-fi films.<br/><br/>The script was miserably distracted from the fairly routine ""Lone survivor"" narrative structure of 'carrying on surviving at any cost' main plot by silly space stories about loads of mundane things: such as extremely likely threats and risks to possible near-future spacefarers; and scientific/engineering challenges, being treated utterly incredibly and implausibily.<br/><br/>I did not find this ratio of straight and silly to be a harmonious tonal balance.<br/><br/>Thank heavens for Matt Damon. The stand out feature of this feature film. All the other actors could have been ""anyones"", their characters certainly were.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott made excellent films, sadly, he now seems to make indulgent films referential only to his own preoccupations. How will his 21st century ouvre be compared to his 20th? My answer is frankly: ""unfavourably"".<br/><br/>I rate a 4/10 for a film that greatly disappointed me, but I'd recommend this firmly to Matt Damon fans and indeed, with rather more qualification, to anyone appreciative of star power/screen presence/ leading actors"

I find that there are very lack luster reactions (or no reactions at all) from certain characters in moments that have been greatly built up. Err, to name a few...<br/><br/>1) Mark Wattney's family? Nope.
2) The crew finding out Wattney was ALIVE. No kiddin' right?
3) Wattney & CDR Lewis speaking again before launch. Um, the fact that this is the first time Wattney has heard another humans voice in literally FOREVER.
4) The crew reuniting with Wattney - overall could have been way bigger and was cut too short.<br/><br/>Either way, the film was still outstanding. To be fair I could see how some of those missing aspects would have potentially made the movie too lengthy.<br/><br/>Also was really cool to see Donald Glover in this! Would absolutely recommend."

","This movie explores the mental and physical, stresses of dealing with survival in bleak conditions. Matt Damon does an excellent job showing the emotions and thoughts that come with such a situation. Don't pick it apart, just enjoy it. Supporting cast does a great job and you almost believe the story as it goes on. And really happy that this movie was shot in my country Jordan in Wadi Rum where you truly feel that you're on Mars.
The only downside of this movie was the the illogical scietific things that Damon did, like planting Potatoes in space without testing the PH of soil or even if it's possible to plant there, and using his feaces as fertiliser? really? wouldn't that be toxic?
Overall, it's really good movie to watch as it keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the times"
"manuel_medeiros","8","0","1","7 November 2019"," It's sci-fi cinema done right - pleasantly surprised
","I don't argue for the movie's accuracy in terms of the challenges of space travelling. Although I have heard Neil DeGrasse Tyson claims this is one of the best movies he has seen on that front. But personally, as long as it looks / sounds fairly plausible on screen... it really does not affect the film's entertainment values. Nor does not having read the book it is based on.<br/><br/>As for the film itself - I was a bit sceptical about The Martian because, despite being directed by Ridley Scott, I am not traditionally a big fan of sci-fi movies. But was pleasantly surprised by it.<br/><br/>Given how much of the movie is focused on the survival of a man who is stranded on Mars (the remainder on the way to get him out of there), it was very entertaining to see him adapt, innovate, fight boredom... everything to survive. On his own. And those scenes were never long enough to bore me. Not sure if it's thanks to the script, the acting or the directing - but it delivers!<br/><br/>I care less for the heroics involved in the attempt of saving the astronaut but the depiction of his own struggle back in Mars is spot-on. And keeps you rooting for him throughout.<br/><br/>Overall solid enough to be an 8 or higher."

","I love this movie and have watched it several times. The whole case is terrific and the science is better than most, as several scientists have pointed out.
True there are some conceits here, but a movie without conceits is either a documentary or very boring or perhaps both.
The design of the spaceships and the other hardware was first rate; I don't know that there was hardware we saw that couldn't actually exist in the near future.<br/><br/>Mark's emotional progression was very well done. There would definitely be some very high highs and some very low lows during that ordeal!<br/><br/>I did end up hating the NASA director (Jeff Daniels) because he seemed to embody the worst of the recent NASA managers with his decision making.
If I had been Mitch Henderson, my response to being asked to resign by the NASA director would have been to say 'I'll put my resignation on top of yours'. Not sure if future space travel will include a NASA manager in charge. Might be more realistic to have a corporate person in that position.<br/><br/>I do wonder about the reviewers who tried to point out inconsistencies. One being that Mark could have just replanted everything after the storm destroys his crops.
I think this statement completely ignores the fact that when Mark established his 'farm' he was working off the food supply left from the original mission with only some slight rationing. His energy levels would have been at their highest. Existing off mostly potatoes by the time the HAB was compromised he would not have had the energy or the will to re-establish the farm. With a supreme effort he was able to get to the Aries IV MAV. There he got better food (you can see he is having an actual meal) before he had to strip down the MAV for his launch.
So there were certainly some conceits made as this was a movie, but his inability to restart his farm was not one of them.
I think it was certainly a satisfying movie and will undoubtedly watch it again."

","My Grandma sent this movie up for Christmas 2 or 3 years ago. She had seen it, and said it was quite good. (I had seen it in the cinema fliers when it first came out, but hadn't thought it interesting.) After Grandma's recommendation, I was expecting it to be good.<br/><br/>I was blown away! I had expected it to be good. But it was really, REALLY good! Greatly exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>The story is this: in 2035 (the year isn't mentioned in the movie - only the bonus features, and apparently the novel (which I haven't read)), during a manned mission to Mars, a massive and powerful sand storm forces the crew to evacuate the planet. Unfortunately, one of the astronauts, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) suffers an accident in the storm, and is (justifiably) presumed dead. They are forced to leave without him.<br/><br/>However, Mark is not dead. He manages to make his way to the Hab that the crew had been staying in, where he fixed his wound (the only hard-to-watch scene in the movie). He must try and survive on a desert planet - and try and make contact with NASA. Meanwhile, by viewing satellite images of the Hab (showing equipment moved since the crew of the ship - the Ares - evacuated), realise he is still alive. They begin planning an attempt to save Watney, AND try to make contact with him.<br/><br/>The movie's plot is brilliantly constructed and executed. Many condemned the film's light tone, but I actually quite enjoyed it. It's a refreshingly uplifting movie. If you want a horror movie, go watch ""Alien"" or something.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is great, as is the sense of humour. It's surprisingly genuinely funny. But the special effects are breathtaking. They're truly GREAT.<br/><br/>Overall, The Martian is an extremely enjoyable and entertaining science fiction tale of survival that is VERY scientifically accurate (much more so than your average sci-fi). It's highly recommended."

","Based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel of the same name. The Martian directed by Ridley Scott stars Matt Damon as the stranded astronaut on Mars who is presumed dead. What he does to survive and what NASA does to ensure his return to Earth forms the crux of the story.
Hope and the will to survive is something which keeps us going even in the toughest of times and this movie exactly shows us that, never to give up even if everything goes south. 
I haven't read the book so i cannot say anything on that, but the movie on the whole is just exquisite and a treat to watch. All the stuff shown in the movie right from growing crops on mars to creating water do have scientific backing and are realistic somehow which is one of the biggest highlights of the movie. The movie is believable and although it is a work of fiction, it can be very real. 
The movie has some amazing VFX to boast about to go with the great story and narration. The climax in particular is so good that i had my mouth open in Awe of the whole scene. 
We have had movies like Gravity and Interstellar in the past couple of years and it will be safe to say that The Martian overtakes both of them as it is more of a complete movie than the other two. Collections won't be a problem as it is gonna shower the box office with a lot of money. It's a visual and mental treat, so do go and watch it peeps and bask in the awesomeness of it. <br/><br/>P.

Probably the best space film I've seen. How do you top that?<br/><br/>You go in a completely different direction. Instead of exploring planets... Why not get stuck on one?<br/><br/>Yep, that's what The Martian is about and I honestly didn't have too high expectations for this film. But I just had to watch it since Matt Damon was in it and he's probably one of the best actors out there. <br/><br/>When I exited the theater I was honestly. Just baffled. Here I thought I had seen a film you couldn't top, Interstellar. The Martian gave Nolan a run for his money. <br/><br/>The whole movie is centralized around Matt Damon and is basically a solo performance by him. And he didn't disappoint. He engaged and immersed millions of people into a traumatic and emotional outer space experience and I have to say. The video effects are scary real. <br/><br/>I just don't have any words to say about the Martian, just a beautiful film.

","Congratulations to Ridley Scott, this was a great one! <br/><br/>I love good science fiction movies, but they are so hard to find. In most ""science fiction"" the ""science"" is thin at best and an excuse for special effects or some absurd action.<br/><br/>The Martian is different and it really is a great one! When it started out with this unrealistically strong sandstorm I was ready to bury my hopes, but then it got better and better by the minute. there was one more inaccuracy that was initially a bit off-putting - the non-martian gravity, but apart from that the science was sound. And better yet, it was the core of the action. Getting stranded on a distant planet is challenging :-) and the challenges in the movie felt like they were the real thing. How to survive? How to get food? How to take off? How to reach earth? All these are tricky to figure out and it is a blast to watch a bunch of smart, friendly and cooperating people figure them out - always with that smirk that old-timers know from the heroes of the Apollo days. Yes, they've got the right stuff and they need plenty of it to ""bring him home"".<br/><br/>Apart from this technical side, there is something even more wonderful about this movie. Through the extremely intelligent choice of (sometimes very bad) music and little hints here and there it has a curious ""retro"" feeling. It almost makes you feel like this is an alternative reality, playing out sometime in the last decade of the previous century, in a world where after the moon landings we did not stop but just made the logical next move to go to mars. And somehow this feels so right and so upbeat, it is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>In any case, the Martian is a joy to watch from beginning to end. After all, whan did you last see a movie that let kept you excited with the intricacies of celestial mechanics?"

We're supposed to believe that the rocket nose....in order to save weight, jettisons the hard cap and replaces it with....wait for it....CANVAS.
If you do the math, the only speed quoted, which is BEFORE the maximum thrust, converts to about 2600 kilometers per hour.
Now I've put my arm out the window at about 150 KPH and had the hair nearly blown off so I'm pretty sure 2600 KPH is more than a little improbable.
Since the entire movie is predicated on hoping we will believe at least some of the science why couldn't they have just picked a smaller number to reduce it which didn't entail removing all the windows and the nosecone 'cause I'm pretty sure they'd be necessary at 2600 KPH....just saying."

Mark (plot spoiler revealed in previews) manages to make contact with Earth and we have a subplot to break up the monotony of a one man play.<br/><br/>The film is designed primarily for science geeks.

","With 1100 reviews, I suppose that few people may read this, but here goes: Fantastic sets and special effects. I wish I had seen this on a big screen. I am sure that it has been compared to everything from ""2001"" to ""Apollo 13"". It seems a bit tedious, but that might be because of the 3 hour cable broadcast time if you don't DVR it. An astronaut presumed dead is accidentally left behind when a long-term Mars Mission is aborted due to an intense hurricane force Martian sand storm is encountered. The first third of the movie centers on how Astronaut ""Mark"" manages to set up housekeeping, grow his own crops, and re-establish communications with Houston Control. Then it shift gears and become a rescue mission much like Apollo 13. There are equipment failures along the way and the mission crew almost commits mutiny when they decide to double back and rescue the stranded man. Smart and intelligently presented by Ridley Scott but not everyone's ""cup of tea"". I enjoyed it but found many badly-answered plot hole questions: There seems to be an unlimited supply of oxygen in the space suits. Maybe they can manufacture it in the suit? The ""Power of Duct Tape"" creates a perfect air seal. (I guess it really is the handyman's secret weapon?) A partial nudity shower scene is really unnecessary. Even after a clear plastic seal blows out, the entire craft doesn't fog up and blow apart? Oh, well, enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect it all to make perfect sense."
"zianimustafa","8","0","1","19 January 2018"," The Martian Damon died in a challenge inside and outside the film.
","The movie Mars may not be a logical or purely scientific film, but certainly succeeded in satisfying everyone as a film science fiction exciting. The film is directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon and Jessica Shastin. It is believed that Mark has died and left alone on Mars, and begins a struggle to survive while trying to communicate. On earth, in the hope of saving him, Marc remains without a thing in this planet, which is twice as large as the Earth, and there is nothing but himself and what the crew left before the forced departure.<br/><br/>One of the film's problems that you may read about is the storm that led to Mark's departure in the first place. Mars's atmosphere is about 1% as compared to the Earth, so Mars winds, which may reach 100 mph ""which is rare in the Mars climate"" would be like winds at ten miles an hour on Earth, Flying a paper plane in the sky not to fall humans.<br/><br/>Beyond that film is excellent in almost all respects, since the beginning of the film can not stop stunned by what Ridley Scott of visual effects, and continue to amaze something something with the stages of passage of the film. The film begins in a desert desert similar to the environment of Mars, as we know from the images of him, red, arid, empty, filled with horrifying silence.<br/><br/>The film moves to two stages. The film then moves to two sides, the psychological aspect of Mark being that he has nothing more than he can think of getting to his home and family, and the aspect that makes him one of the most responsible and discoverable people. Here lies the details, the film may not be perfect in writing. Both are in these two sides.<br/><br/>When you see a movie that tells the story of the horror of loneliness, you have to think of two aspects (psychological and physical). The physical aspect I thought for a moment was that Matt Damon's work was a mighty example until I knew that the whole thing was just an effect on a computer, which increases visual dazzling and its effects and reduces The actor's creativity and sacrifices for the role.<br/><br/>
In an interview with Matt Damon, he said he wanted to lose weight for the role, but director Ridley Scott stopped him. ""He talked to Ridley about losing weight for the role, because I had already done it for the movies, Almost a month ago I said that the time is perfect. I can lose 30 to 40 pounds and start shooting from the end scenes back to the beginning until I get back to my normal body. ""Riddle Scott"" replied ""F * ck that"".<br/><br/>As for the psychological side, yes, there was a conflict, and yes, Dimon was good at it, but it was not enough for me to see the dramatic dramas, being on Mars, knowing that you are 140 million miles from Earth, home, home, family. Because you will not see human beings after today in your life, it is very frightening once you think about it, so I had a desire to stress on a dramatic scene that would be screaming and whining and then supplication and crying. but it's okay.<br/><br/>Some may notice the American championship in the film, or even the mathematical complexities, when we calculate the number of years between Mars and the Earth or the speed of Mark's or even attraction between the planets and others, but the film certainly did not make it more sophisticated than the movie Nolan among the stars, Understand some of them and do not mind their presence, because it will not actually stop them, in turn will increase the quality of the scientific background of the film, which puts it in a challenge with the scientists who will see it.<br/><br/>The film is not the ideal film in all its analogies, but it is certainly interesting to the viewer, a victory for Ridley Scott the rest of the workers, from the voices to the visual effects and even fashion .. A poetic and objective film at the same time, and above all we can not but stand in hugs for the creativity of Matt Damon and his grandmother to portray The scene of the dramatic car and the rest of the film with complete creativity.

"gavinp9","8","0","1","2 January 2018"," Great, realistic, space adventure
","'The Martian' is based on Andy Weir's excellent novel - one of my favourite books from last year. It's a very simple concept - in the near-future, a manned-mission to Mars goes awry and Mark Watney (Damon) is presumed dead, as the rest of the team returns to Earth. However, rumours of Watney's demise were exaggerated and he just manages to survive, only to be faced with the conundrum of how to stay alive on a freezing planet with almost no food, water or oxygen until he can be rescued?<br/><br/>It's beautifully shot, with Jordan a good stand-in for Mars on most occasions, and the CGI doing the rest. And there's obviously a few shots of Earth from space - always a great perspective to see. Scott directs well, with the pacing good, and time spread across the strong cast - Chastain, Peña, Mara, Stan and Hennie on the spaceship home; and Daniels, Ejifor, Bean and Wiig at NASA - showing how everyone involved deals with the initial tragedy and then attempted rescue mission(s).<br/><br/>However, the film belongs to Damon, who has to use all his charm and skills to make one man talking to a video journal interesting. The film's possibly 15min or so too long, but luckily, it's a great book & a good screenplay, so there's plenty of levity to go along with the serious life-or-death/fingernail-chewing moments. Tense/great final 25min or so. Never quite reaches the heights of the book, but comes very close."

","Some reviewer on this site said don't trust any reviews that give this film more than 2 stars because they aren't genuine. Well let me say having just watched it that I wouldn't trust any review that give it less than 7 stars. If this was La La Land I would have agreed as that was overrated rubbish but this was superbly crafted wonderfully acted and a joy to behold. Not at any time during its 141 mins was I not totally engrossed and exhilarated by this total cinematic experience. I'll even go as far as to say this maybe the best film that Ridley Scott has directed."

Bottom line, though, they adapted this REALLY well. Scott captured what survival and problem solving looks like, and managed all the excitement/humor/humanity that made the book great. I would have loved a little more explanation and a little less self-seriousness, but there's no way not to enjoy this ride."

Sort of a mix of Castaway and Gravity with Matt Damon taking on the deserted Hanks role, explaining things to a video diary along the way after he is left stranded on Mars and presumed dead by his crew. With meager supplies he must find a way to contact Earth, make oxygen and grow some food. Its very funny.<br/><br/>This did feel a bit too long but in saying that I also can't think of any scenes that were unnecessary.<br/><br/>Great special effects and finally a movie using CGI and green screens to enhance the movie not just BE the movie as is often the case these days, where movies forget about a story and just become special effect extravaganzas.<br/><br/>It did get a bit over-the-top towards the end with Damon in his Ironman reminiscent suit but I went with it.

"PHILLK69","3","0","4","29 October 2017"," Clunky Mess not deserving of any Oscar nominations
","Cant believe this was nominated for 7 Oscars. <br/><br/>Matt Damon plays a scientist of sorts, in fact a botanist who after an accident is left on mars alone ,to survive he starts fertilising potatoes with his own excrement . What started brightly decent soon descended into a clunky mess which left me rolling my eyes. The scenes on earth with NASA were cringey and i was saying to myself no one talks like that in real life, it was like i was watching a Judd Apatow film ,Kristen Wiig has about 2 lines of dialogue but appears in the background in almost every scene looking on the verge of a stroke ,then there's Damon who had zero background to his character -are we led to believe that a scientist left on a distant planet thousands of miles away from home , doesn't suffer any adverse affects other than weight loss, doesn't feel any anger or anxiety or any other emotion, to cope he just makes corny jokes and listens to disco music Absurd premise with no depth or emotion and if wasn't directed by Ridley Scott it would of passed through the cinema without notice. Scott is the most overrated director going."
"thebricks","6","0","1","17 September 2017"," Sadly, a movie that gets dated very quickly
","Dialogue is pretty much the downfall of this movie. It has fantastic cinematography and special effects. The cast is fantastic. However, as someone that went to a reputable university, unfortunately, the movie chose to give the characters in the movie the same sort of personality and culture that you'd see on a college campus. I've never worked for NASA or any engineering firm, so maybe it's realistic, I'm not sure. In a way, I thought it was a kid's movie. Mark Watney doesn't act like a grown-up, no one in NASA acts like a grown-up, it almost seems like the only mature people in the entire film are Jessica Chastain's character and Bill Pullman. <br/><br/>Mark Watney's character is absolutely obnoxious. He was obnoxious in the book too, but the director should have had the discretion to change the character to be a bit more mature and human. At no point is suicide ever discussed by anyone in the film, nor does Mark ever come to terms with the fact no one may ever come back for him. He just acts like a little kid who has been left home alone, one big party. This is all made more convenient by the fact that he conveniently has no family or loved ones, despite being a Botany Ph.D. and an astronaut with a great job.<br/><br/>I bought the blu-ray thinking it would be great for my collection, but this thing is going to get horrible real fast. It's most certainly not a classic, nor is it even something I'd show in school. It's a shame, because the film certainly could have been a lot better."
"Thomasccooke","9","0","1","8 August 2017"," Thoroughly enjoyable, beautifully shot movie
","This was a great adaptation of the book, which I read and thoroughly enjoyed before the movie was announced. <br/><br/>I've seen both the theatrical release and the extended version. The extended version just added a little more to the story, didn't really add much to the overall effect of the film, although there was a very funny, very inappropriate insult that was cut from the theater version to insure the PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Realistic sets and ship designs, and a great execution of the Mars surface. I thought Damon was perfect as Mark Watney, the right blend of intelligence and humor. The rest of the casting was excellent as well.<br/><br/>I'm surprised and a little dismayed at some of the reviews who claim that the science in the film wasn't realistic. If you do a little research, you'll discover that all of the orbital mechanics as well as the challenges on the Martian surface are accurate, and that the complex series of steps needed to mount an expedition to Mars are realistic.<br/><br/>I thought that the thought process of NASA and JPL were very realistic in how to handle the situation both scientifically and as a public relations disaster, and that the differing viewpoints were solid in their reasoning.<br/><br/>As a film it was well constructed, good pacing, with moments of real emotion. I'll concede that Watney's ""Iron Man maneuver"" at the climax of the story was a little over the top, and probably would not have helped him.<br/><br/>I truly took the movie as a testament to the better parts of humanity--our ability to think and reason and work together.<br/><br/>So, don't go into it thinking this is a Hollywood edge of your seat disaster movie, or fanciful ""hyperspace"" adventure, it's a rational, thoughtful adventure."

","This film is quite enjoyable as there are many creative solutions presented by the main character Mark Watney (Matt Damon). The cinematography is fairly good and capture many aspects of space. There are some parts of the film that are not scientifically correct, but they are not glaring and do not take away from the film that much. The movies action pace is perfectly done as it changes speeds quite well. Shares a fair amount in common with Apollo 13, even though one is history and the other is fiction.

","First of all I don't get why there are so many bad reviews about this movie, I think the plot is sound with strong characters and performances all round! I found myself enjoying this movie from the opening sequence to the credits, it makes sense from a scientific and technical point of view whilst maintaining an engaging plot with likable characters, interesting story and even has a good mix of humor thrown in for flavor.<br/><br/>Everything from the crew abandoning their crew mate after he is given up for dead and then the struggle of the lone survivor having to use the resources he has at hand to survive in a completely hostile environment really got me into this film; I found myself enjoying their successes and wondering what was going to happen at other times.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone, it will entertain you while keeping your interest; I didn't really find myself at any time bored during this film."

","Better read the synopsis before watching The Martian. I did not. That's why I thought it would be some fun sci-fi movie about astronauts landing in Mars and having to defend themselves from the attack of creatures from another planet. Well, that wasn't what the movie was, and I wish it would be. The first hour of the Martian felt long, dragging and utterly boring. Matt Damon, left alone by himself in Mars spends the first half of the movie regurgitating technicalities to a camera where he records himself while explaining what he has to do to survive alone in this new ""home"". If he didn't it would be just impossible for people to understand all the things he is doing. In the second half the movie, a rescue mission gets ready to pick him up, so they talk an talk and talk again in endless meetings about what needs to be done to save their man while the world is watching. Although this second part is slightly more entertaining than the first one, I really could not wait for the movie to finish. Boring! It's all i can say."

","If it's a cold rainy night and you have nothing to do, curl up with a bag of popcorn, and you'll find this film is an OK diversion, but if you're expecting the next Apollo 13, or Stanley Kubrick classic, you will be disappointed. <br/><br/>The basic plot is the typical adventure, action, suspense formula with rather predictable turns and barely enough of predicable problems which the scientists will have to solve just in the nick of time. <br/><br/>The real problems with The Martian are centered around the script and character development. The script could have been written by seventh graders who were given bonus points for trying to write as many cliché lines as possible. What's worse, is the fact that none of the characters including that of Matt Damon's have any real development as people with whom you can empathize. Good dram is always more than the actions of the plot. Good drama is about people and their relationships, conflicts, struggles, etc. We know nothing about these people and therefore can never develop the empathy necessary for good engaging drama. <br/><br/>Lots of great visuals, some bad disco music, and an OK story line."
"mymtproject","7","0","1","21 November 2016"," Basically it's ""Cast Away"" set on another planet
","I saw this movie with friends and enjoyed it, although I found it to be strangely reminiscent of CAST AWAY, staring Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>The best parts are when the stranded Astronaut uses his scientific knowledge growing potatoes to stretch his food supply and his calculations in seeking out and finding/reactivating the Pathfinder lander. Those scenes illustrate the kind of psychology one would need to survive while being stranded on Mars with limited resources. Damon does a fine job in these moments. The rest of the movie is kind of melodramatic, even thought Jeff Daniels made a convincing NASA Administrator. The ending is a bit silly, as tearing his spacesuit would have killed him rather quickly, not propelled him far enough to reach the ship commander. A lot of that was just the melodrama to make it more exciting. I understand the book ending was much different.<br/><br/>Overall a decent movie and an excellent one for planetary colonization enthusiasts to watch. There is a good bit of science fact mixed with the fiction part. It's basically CAST AWAY, except on Mars. <br/><br/>For movies of this genre, I prefer the setting of MOON as a more possible scenario with the mining operation. Just my personal take."
"PogoNeo","7","0","1","24 October 2016"," 2015 vs. 1953
","If you are either a cinema enthusiast in general or just a science fiction flicks fan, and somehow was able to sit through the entirety of ""Project Moon Base"" (1953) telling a story about an orbital survey mission changing into unplanned Moon landing, you can come to this conclusion: there are just light years of filmmaking between similar themed 1953 and 2015 movies. That first one does not get even the basic science elements right and has naively stupid and childish script, resulting in a picture just doomed to not withstand the test of time; while the newer ""The Martian"" is both so accurate / logical as a non-documentary feature can be and is technically at the highest levels<br/><br/>Unfortunately that great distance shrinks noticeably in the middle of this newer movie, when the first part of the absolutely thrilling and entertaining Robinson ""The Martian"" Crusoe hits the scene of kindergarten-like pandering to the Chinese audience. (Because let us Hollywood executives and investors do not forget, that our beloved comrades on Mainland China have more cinemas than we here have in The-US-Of-A-Land and that only thirty something foreign titles per year get a full distribution in China). It slowly but inevitably shifts from an excellent survival drama with educational values to a mediocre drama with more adventure driven orientation, sticking mostly to the entertainment side. Practically it is no longer a drama but a tragedy- a tragedy of a downfall from a possible 10 / 10 picture to a flick with a score of only 6-7 / 10. For example they start to put all those ""classic"" (boring) songs, and not just in fragments. Why, just why did they use the excellent ""All Along The Watchtower"" by Jimmy Hendrix in the trailer (and for that purpose even creatively remixed it a little), but in the movie itself they took the path of least resistance of using that kitschy ""Starman"" by David Bowie (and in its entirety)?<br/><br/>And that final rescue attempt, with more and more layers of obstacles? Were those space cowboy stunts really conceived some time before 2015 and not in 1953?"
"DuskShadow","6","0","1","29 June 2016"," MATT...DAMON (in Team America voice) a pawn for new age space interest?
","Okay so randomly a frigging BOTANIST is brought to a desolate wasteland of a planet, and then left behind and somehow survives. THIS WAS FROM A STORM THAT ALL of the other astronauts fled for fear of their very lives, and the botanist survives...<br/><br/>WTF?!<br/><br/>In comes the fact that of all the things not on a mission that is needed for him to survive, there are bits of wood from the one token chicano guy, in the form of a wooden cross among his affects. Nobody else had religious iconography, what the hay? Then the loner breaks up the cross to use as fuel to create water for his botany experiment. He creates water like its nothing, making something NASA would not have done, at least in the film, seem ASTOUNDINGLY simplistic, for a guy whom is supposed to just be a botanist. This is beginning to reek like Gravity did.<br/><br/>Still it distracts from all the classic low brow Damonesque slurs and cussing that has been a mark of his in acting since Good Will Hunting. ENTER THE KAKA STORM!<br/><br/>So after digging into whats supposed to be dead soil, burying feces, by burning the lone Mexican's wooden cross, the stranded man creates virtual mini hydrogen bombs in an oxygenated environment (*faceplams*). The far too average spaceman then points out that the astronauts were supplied with a highly radioactive substance, that after hardly any use, is just dumped onto mars underneath but a few feet of ground. So already humans turn the world into a garbage dump, but its okay because Damon uses it to warm himself while humorously listening to Hot Stuff by Donna Summer.<br/><br/>Then pausing for comedic effect. <br/><br/>THIS IS STUPID! Damon is literally spending most of the film on candid camera like its a reality TV show. Are we to be impressed by an actor trying so blatantly to survive upon an alien word, on a screen within a screen? Not if one has respect for themselves, let alone the art of acting. <br/><br/>SO then the man with the one trait he claims to have utmost expertise in just happens to dig up his crop of potatoes after barely 48 days, with potatoes bigger than some fists. FORTY EIGHT DAYS?! Either nasa found the one strain of miracle grow anywhere potatoes, or they cheapened out on the healthier organics for these space cadets' mission. Thems some gmo tatter tots, WIll Hunting. <br/><br/>Onward with the stupidity. So back on earth the mission command wonders where the leftover cadet is going to journey to, and instead of using most ANY of the sophisticated equipment to plan his course, they just run off to the cafeteria and use a ruler on a picture of craters and it just happens to do the trick. Really? Then comes the use of simple phrases to communicate over a vast distance, one lame nerd whom derides the point of trying at all like a useless emo teen star, and as we were about to be unintentionally woken up form this bullmess, the director just pulls folks back in. I can just see people in the theaters when this movie came out. Deplorable.<br/><br/>This was all less than one hour into the film. I had wanted to quit, but kept watching, and was just bored as hell.<br/><br/>Then there was more pointless babble and posing and fame from afar snap shots, then planning and untold amounts of cash spent to save one fool take form. Then came poor planning, unlikely execution and a lot of destruction of expensive equipment and wasting of air in an oxygen-less environment. He is then saved, comes home, time passes, the world is distracted from all its real problems blah blah. Later on Damon sits and marvels at a little sapling, reminding him of his martian poop factory for potatoes, all the while admired by the most racially mixed group of young astronauts jogging by him, which still was not that diverse at all. Now I already knew this was gross fiction, but come on, space programs are about as diverse as a teen clothing ad from the mid 90's. IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.<br/><br/>Waste of my time by modern cinema, YET AGAIN! We already messed up one corner of the universe, we don't need another done in by:<br/><br/>MATT...DAMON.

Would have been nice to see a real philosophical discussion from Jeff Daniels' character about the harsh reality behind ""what are you willing to pay to save one man's life"". Is it worth $2 million? $20 million? $200 million? Could you have a gotten a Starbucks or Tesla owner to step up and foot the bill for a space launch?

","It is a story theme I have seen many times before under various premises complete with the heroic last minute rescue. The overall plot reminded me of old Lost In Space episodes where the crew gets in some hopeless situation and clever little Will saves the day with some outlandish and risky solution. <br/><br/>The movie is predictable, overacted, full of corn ball clichés and completely far fetched for non fantasy(attempts to be realistic) based science fiction. For example, our lead is able to find a probe from a failed mission sent many years earlier, dig it up and it works just fine? How was a ready to launch rocket placed my NASA for a future mission with no debris around it and why wouldn't a storm knock it over like it almost did to the current mission's rocket when the crew escaped at the beginning? I could go on and on.<br/><br/>I was not even wowed by the special effects and found them inferior to ""2001 a Space Odyssey""(I mention this film because comparisons where made) which was made decades ago with far less technology.<br/><br/>On top of all that it was just tedious and I had to force myself to watch to the all too predictable ending. <br/><br/>My ranking is low because my expectations were high based on ratings and accolades about how great this film was."

"milancicovic","2","0","2","26 March 2016"," The Martian: 2 stars for the effort, nil for everything else (idea, execution, ...)
","The review contains some spoilers!<br/><br/>I wish Matt Damon carried on with his ingenious surviving tactics, fighting depression, fighting for each day until his death on Mars. I can understand that American military would send a chopper to rescue a soldier left behind (it costs them a little if they fail) but to spend huge sums to save an astronaut who by definition are meant to live and sometimes die in outer space is a bit like Saving Private Damon on a grand scale. Hence I see this flick as an American movie that is short on ideas, and would rather use clichés than be different.<br/><br/>So everything was fine until he got in touch with Earth: from there on we got inter-departmental fighting at NASA, young black scientist who is of Nobel Price winner stock, a bit clumsy and with some unorthodox ways of explaining his theories to bosses (but everything is allowed if you can save boss's bacon), then help from, basically, an enemy (Chinese - and it looked like a big favour but you wouldn't guess that because the Chinese involvement was described in about 2 minutes, probably in as many minutes as the clumsiness of young black brilliant scientist etc, please see above). And young blonds with big glasses to look like scientists, hilarious.<br/><br/>The key mystery here was: is this a fairy tale or Sci-Fi drama? I watched the Stardust the other night and it didn't feel stupid if I believed that you can actually fly to the stars if you light a Babylon candle (not just because I never had a Babylon candle in my hands). But The Martian wants to convince us that if you are stranded on Mars and you don't have a rocket, enough fuel, etc, you should look for a box with rubber bands (like those ones your grandma used for jars) and, after performing some mathematical calculations involving the gravitational forces, air density, the thickness of the rubber bands, their length and quality (throw away the Chinese ones), you can actually build a launcher that would take you to space. Unfortunately, I had rubber bands in my hands so it feels stupid to believe it. Some people are saying that the things described in the movie did happen, and maybe they did, but 50 years ago. They also made different films 50 years ago.<br/><br/>All in all, as my teacher used to said, 2 out of 10 for the effort."

","Some young goofs are up on Mars. They are warned that a storm is coming. The resident botanist suggest the wait it out. The commander decides they will escape. So in the middle of the storm they walk to their rocket when one of the guys is it by an antenna and left for dead while the rest fly off to their space station.<br/><br/>Next day the guy, Mark the botanist, wakes up, injured but alright. He checks supplies, knows that the next mission to Mars will be in 4 years, so he starts growing potatoes inside the base using Mars soil and astronaut waste. He has no way to communicate with anyone. So he digs up the Rover from the 90s. Eventually someone at NASA notices that stuff is moving around on Mars and they figure he's alive, but they don't share it with the rest of the crew on the space station. Through the rover he communicates with JPL, which is actually staffed by people who look like they could be scientists and not by a bunch of teens. Meanwhile NASA politicians and scientists think about what to do.<br/><br/>Their plan to send Mark supplies fails. So do some other ideas. Until some other young guy figures out that the space station can meet up with Mark if it changes its path and if he manages to make it to another rocket on Mars and use it fly near the station's orbit. But of course there are many complications along the way. But the space station crew does decide they will go and get him.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book and I'm not concerned whether this movie's science is realistic or not. The movie works for a while, then it stopped working for me. I did appreciate the science but then they ruined it when some astronaut no less tells another to speak in English. Is there some law that mandates writers include that stupid line whenever a character explains something complex? I also enjoyed the politics. The NASA boss and his sidekick are more concerned with appearances and PR than with solving the problem at hand. Casting is a joke. There are perhaps two main actors who looks like they belong at NASA/JPL but several background actors do. For a space movie this one offers few cool space sights, all there is is reddish sand. The resolution reminded me a bit too much of the worst space movie of them all, Gravity.<br/><br/>That said, this movie is probably an excellent family movie, and it is a remarkably healthy movie for Hollywood standards. But even then I can't imagine the kids or anyone else not getting bored at some point. The Martian is about 45 minutes too long, it just doesn't come to an end. It has epic ambitions but the story isn't nearly as spectacular as the filmmakers think it is. I was hoping for some twist, for aliens to appear, something that would propel this movie to excellence. But it never happened."

","Dull and far too long, Ridley Scott's space opera has virtually no suspense and little by way of emotional involvement; where tears of joy should be flowing, all you feel is cold and disinterested. Matt Damon (usually reliable; here, vapid and one-note) plays an astronaut/botanist who is left for dead on Mars by his crew (led by Jessica Chastain, equally monotonous--where is the adventurous actress from ""The Tree Of Life"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty""?) and is forced to use his gee-whiz skills to survive while NASA figures out how to get him back. There seems little at stake in Scott's dramatic telling: every calamity that befalls the main character is simply another setback which seems to have no impact on him: you're given the notion that rationing is forcing him to thin out, yet Damon's physique never changes; and for all the talk in Drew Goddard's screenplay about the tremendous stress Damon is under, he shows very little sign of it. Goddard's script (based on Andy Weir's wildly popular novel, unread) is filled with lots of technical jargon and celebrates the geekiness of the characters (the absentminded genius geek here is played by a wasted Donald Glover) but they're not nearly interesting enough to sympathize with or even caricatures you can laugh at. And the film's basic conceit--long-term survival on another planet--seems too spurious to make an entire film from; you're left to assume the science of the endeavor has its basis in fact and that the jargon bandied about is enough above the average viewer's head (at least it is to this head) to seem realistic. But who knows? Sure, ""Insterstellar"" had just as much conjecture as ""The Martian"" but Christopher Nolan's sincerity and heart won you over. Here, Scott's technical bravura is on full display but he has little interest in being anything other than a technician--what should be a lush, romantic, crowd-pleasing adventure instead is rendered limp and hollow, an exercise gorgeous to look at and not much else."

Not that the attempt was impossible, just that he would or should know they would find him while preparing for the mission and help rather than send them 3200 kilometers from him.

","The Martian is a reasonably well-crafted survival movie about a space mission gone awry, leaving botanist/astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) behind on Mars to fend for himself. The movie focuses first on Watney's determined use of his scientific knowledge and awareness of the NASA Mars program to maintain his existence, interesting efforts that both segue into and provide time for the second area of plot development, the predictable NASA parries and thrusts to communicate with and ultimately save him. The film shows due respect for scientific method, logical problem-solving and human ingenuity, but loses momentum as we work through the rescue planning process and its travails and successes. The end is ridiculous enough to once again propel us back to the land of astro-cowboys and movie illogic of which this is hardly a cinematic first. Ridley Scott, unsurprisingly now, has created a movie that will generate an excellent revenue stream, leaving us with a comfortable notion of human goodwill and cooperation (even the Chinese government plays nice in this film) from which smiles and nods are fully expected - almost demanded - and more difficult possible realizations are left unexplored.<br/><br/>The film, which I streamed at home, is fine enough to look at, the digitized version of Mars invoking the feeling of dry desolation and, easily enough, the loneliness and depression that one might feel in Watney's position. Unfortunately, the short scenes and rapid changes in camera position, fitting for the energetic survival activities on which Scott focuses, never allow for a deep examination of Watney's almost-certain growing desperation. The difficulty of his situation is obvious, but we are never privy to his quiet fear, until perhaps just before the final sequence. This is a failure attributable to all aspects of the film: writing cinematography, Scott's direction of Damon, and the choices made by Damon himself, as the lead actor. We as an audience, then, are always too optimistic and/or involved in the details as the film progresses, chuckling as Damon makes multiple jokes about the musical taste of the mission commander, hardly ever feeling as though this could really end badly. The film generates identification, but not empathy.<br/><br/>The rest of the acting ensemble is not very effective, both due to the perfunctory script and their limited efforts to read more into it. Scott has us believe that they are true soldiers, unwilling to even mention in passing any possible concerns other than the problems at hand. There is seemingly no cinematic time for disturbing tangential insights into what all this expense and risk is worth. Why the hell are we exploring Mars anyway, in this near future universe where budgets are spoken of as a concern, but cost-benefit and human risk - and the problems right here on Earth - do not appear to be worth a few minutes of discussion? Thus, we have Jeff Daniels punching through his lines as head of NASA as if he is late for dinner, Jessica Chastain trying half-heartedly to be a macho spaceship commander and Chiwetel Ejiofor alternating between nerdy ground program commander and improv comedian. This is entertainment, after all, Scott appears to be telling us, not an examination of a difficult situation from multiple perspectives or an existential conversation about the value of space exploration. <br/><br/>All-in-all, this is a decent popcorn-muncher for the local Cineplex or for a night of home viewing when one does not want to be intellectually or emotionally taxed. However, one might expect more from the 78-year old Scott as he nears the end of his career. Is it too much to hope that he try - the attempt is all I ask - to craft something nearer to Blade Runner, The Duellists or the original Alien, with the huge budgets at his disposal?"

","I have learned over the past couple of movies that trusting the critics isn't the best idea. Critics loved Boyhood, I saw it, thought it was bland and boring. Critics loved Inside Out, I saw it, thought it was good, not great. Critics loved The Martian and I thought it was very much a ""conveyor belt"" movie, if that makes sense. It has very predictable elements, characters, scenarios, and dialogue that I just found it all very clichéd. <br/><br/>The main protagonist is Mark Watney (Matt Damon), an astronaut who also happens to be a botanist. After a bad asteroid storm hits Mars, which he is exploring in the year 2035 with other astronauts, he is hit by debris and knocked unconscious. He is left behind by the other astronauts, who are forced to leave due to the unstable conditions of the planet. When he wakes up, he discovers he is alone and he must figure out a way to survive with limited food resources, dropping oxygen levels, and no communication to planet Earth. Using his knowledge of botany, he figures out ways to grow potatoes utilizing what resources he has, at the same time he tries to find ways to communicate down to Earth.<br/><br/>If the movie sounds like a cautionary tale of a planet with limited resources and dwindling clean air, you definitely are correct. I'm not a political person by any means, but the environmental messages come through, at times a bit strong. I found the movie to be very paint by the numbers. All the characters just seemed like cardboard cutouts and nobody had a unique or interesting personality. There's not enough there to make me care about anyone and what's going on. It's all very predictable with generic dialogue and foreshadowing of what's about to happen. Also, the movie drags on and gets very boring. ""Cast Away"" I think did a better job of the ""last man on earth/mars/island"" scenario better. I just got very bored with the disco music, the journal entries, the potatoes, the driving around Mars, etc. Little to no character development hurt this as well. <br/><br/>Worst of all, this movie is so far-fetched that even if you suspend realty and go in with the expectation that yes, this is a fictional story, you still just shake your head at some of the situations. On a huge planet with no maps or anything, you can find and dig up EXACTLY what you need to get you back home? Please... <br/><br/>Maybe the book is better. The way the story unfolds it seems like it would work better in book form with longer exposition. As a film though, I found it contrived, preachy, far-fetched, and boring. Oh, and most definitely NOT a comedy."

The story is compelling enough, but not since Armageddon has there been a film that insults you more with its pretence at science.<br/><br/>My favourite part is where an actor with a likely IQ about 80 plays a rocket scientist who notices what everyone else misses, in true magical negro fashion. His computer programme tells him that the ""calculations are correct"" - really. Who wrote the software? Is this some kind of AI?<br/><br/>The film also tried oh so hard to be funny, but fell flat every time. Imagine All Is Lost with our man constantly telling bad jokes to himself. It has some of the most nauseating and character inappropriate lines in film history. ""Science the s**t of out this"" and ""thankfully I'm the world's greatest botanist"" come to mind. Oh, and ""Check the math"". I hope no gardeners watch this because there are so many things wrong with the potato subplot that I could fill this review with them alone. The most obvious one is that the potatoes are clearly peeled and vacuum sealed/frozen, and would never shoot. Suspension of disbelief is hard when the film's only explanation is ""greatest botanist"".<br/><br/>The goal here is to make scientists ""hip"" and make them seem above the same personal motivations that other humans share. In an age where so many have jumped on the climate change bandwagon because that's where the money is (without offering solutions, just scares) it's pretty obvious that your average scientist is not only not above reproach, but as corrupt and personally incentivised in their decisions as the average banker. That's the propaganda angle.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's performance was uninspiring. He's not the most likable at the best of times but in this cocky vanity piece, where the actor didn't even bother to lose the weight for the weight loss phase (obvious body double used) he is particularly grating.<br/><br/>The Martian is the kind of film that makes you feel you are done with Hollywood.

It was suspenseful, but at some point you begin to realize, out of all the possible endings, how it is going to end, how it has to end, as more and more is revealed. And the actual very, very end is very poor. Fade to black would have been better. The only character really developed was Matt Damon, as he got to talk to himself a lot. But sadly, the others did not get to show their stuff. Sean Bean, a great actor, was like the Tin Man. Jeff Daniels has more range than this, although his role wasn't the most exciting; much could have been done with it. And I agree with another reviewer; the disco thing was WAY run into the ground. Subtle is always best... Of course the production values were all good, with a few exceptions, which is why i felt like I was watching a real life story, and it seemed, whether or not it is really true, like NASA was actually on their game here, although anyone to do with NASA is probably laughing their arses off at the errors. It is far less a sci-fi movie than a suspense, castaway, or rescue movie. I was hoping for a great sci-fi movie but it wasn't one, by any stretch, except for being set on Mars, which was no biggie as it was done so well and we've seen so many moon clips. The best sci-fi movies have heart, like Interstellar, 2001, Cloud Atlas, and The Fountain, (and The Martian cannot even be put in the same league as those; not even close) but this had little heart, beyond the task of trying to rescue the stranded guy. Would they, after spending SO much to get to Mars and put up a habitat, have risked so much and spent all that money to try, esp with the many obstacles? It did keep me in my seat and I did so very much want to see the outcome. So that is a big plus, but a lot of movies have that and a great movie it doesn't make. I know I am complaining about a lack of tried and true Hollywood plot devices, but sometimes there is a need for them (never thought I'd say that!). Even Castaway worked on so many better levels than this. I kept hoping there would be some of that here, but it was The Right Stuff on fast forward, without the characters.

Attention to detail was lacking, for instance with how the astronauts moved about inside the space craft. On two occasions I noticed they adjusted their speed without actually touching anything and most of the time it was quite obvious they were attached to some pulley around their waist (and this was inside the craft where they weren't wearing any propulsion suits). This lack of attention to detail should immediately bring this film down, as it should in any film, and was a surprising flaw from a director so experienced in space films. But the story line was a bit...immature as well.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS in the next paragraph** For instance, relying a young, brainy, eccentric scientist to come up with a plan to save the day is pretty typical. Or the commander instructing her chemical expert to make a bomb from equipment on board to blow out part of the craft to slow it down...that's something from a Micheal Bay film. <br/><br/>All things said I did the enjoy the movie. It didn't blow me away but it was enjoyable, charming, Matt Damon's character's humor (actually the whole movie had comedic moments) was all an unexpected pleasantry and it was interesting to see what plan the characters would come up with next.

","I saw this film yesterday. The poster of the film is highly related to what is all about. An astronaut, Matt Damon, is trying to survive on Mars after his crew has left without taking him. The scenery of Mars came to me very interesting as we have never seen it before. It was very bright even brighter than many places on earth. As well as getting attracted by the charm of a science fiction movie, I also found some technical issues that clung to my mind. I want to list them here because this film is supposed to be more realistic than Star Wars or Alien.<br/><br/>First, astronauts are walking on Mars as they walk on earth. Is there no difference in gravity? Are they exactly the same? I thought they would bounce like on Moon. Second issue is about the pressure and air inside where they live. They have a huge place and plenty of air that fills it. Outside there supposed to be a strong vacuum due to very low space pressure and this pressure difference is not well reflected in the film. When Mark blows up the Hab he uses a tarp(!) to seal the entrance instead of a huge metal door. That was unbelievable. Further, he inflates the hab again with plenty of air and adjusts the pressure to that of earth's so that he can take off his helmet. After all these, there is only a little swelling on the tarp door. Other than these, the thunder on Mars came to me a bit exaggerated. There shouldn't be such strong atmospheric conditions.<br/><br/>As far as actors' performances are considered. Matt Damon is as good as he can be. Jessica Chastain is charming. Jeff Daniels plays a dull and carefree administrator of NASA. He is good if that is what he is supposed to play. Donald Glover plays an arrogant researcher named Rich and he teaches the head of NASA that spacecrafts can do gravitational slingshot as they turn around planets which everyone knows from documentaries. <br/><br/>I reduced some points due to these silly mistakes. I gave 7 out of 10."

","Saw this with very high expectations ...at midnight.....was impressed but In the end I felt it wasn't as exciting as other stand alone space flick alike interstellar, Graviy( which was overrated in my opinion but still worth it in 3d and Apollo 13 ....the story is pretty much what you see in the trailers, and you know how it will end but this film starts out very well....the storm in the beginning was great and how Damon's Mark Wattney grew the potatoes was fascinating and also how he made the water. When most of that is over, the viewer is left wanting more though. Ridley Scott's direction was top- notch and encompasses all the characters and sub plots very well unlike a few of his recent movies. Matt Damon's performance is awesome and he does very well. He might even be nominated for an Oscar next year. The rest of the supporting cast are in brief roles and some don't really have much to do except crack a few jokes, however, barring Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels. I actually felt Jeff Daniels' character could have had more negative shades to actually steer the plot better. The Cinematography was brilliant but it's the background score which disappoints as there is no transcendent track which gives you goosebumps or adds to the galore.<br/><br/>Plus points - + Matt Damon as Mark Wattney + Brilliant first half + Cinematography + Funny yet inspiring + sound mixing Minus points- - Uneven pacing - disappointing background score<br/><br/>Final Rating - 4/5 3D level - UNNECESSARY"
"barev-85094","Null","0","4","11 October 2015"," Matt Damon stranded on Mars -- Oy vey! ~ An epic piece of Wishful Thinking
","""The Martian"" or Matt Damon stranded on Mars<br/><br/>by Alex Deleon, stranded in Hungary<br/><br/>Viewed October 09, 2015, in 3D at Cineplex, Györ, in dubbed Hungarian version. Director, Ridley Scott, RT 141 minutes. A Twentieth Century Fox release. <br/><br/>SITUATION: The not too distant future where planet Mars has not only been reached from Earth but where NASA has already set up a more or less permanent Space Station from which the surface of the red planet is being explored for potential colonization by refugees from Earth. A gigantic sandstorm comes up and the exploratory NASA spaceship has to blast off to escape while they can. In the storm one of the crew is lost and left behind for dead -- the indestructible Eathling, Mark Watley (Matt Damon) -- <br/><br/>When it is found that he has survived a desperate rescue mission is organized To Bring him back Alive ...(Echoes of Frank Buck) -- Well, To start with, the Hungarian title ""Mentőexpedició"" (Rescue Mission) is far more apt than the misleading cheap-shot American original ""The Martian"" -- which might lead one to suspect that this is a picture about Red blooded Aliens from the Red Planet when, in fact, this is Reality Sci-fi and, let's face it; Matt Damon is as purely down-to-earth American as the all American boy Jack Armstrong -- and equally red-blooded, as we shall see in an early scene where Matt, with professional surgical dexterity, deftly (and painfully) removes a heavy metal shard embedded in his side during the furious Martian sandstorm that opened the picture and left him stranded there for the next two hours. Brain surgery self- taught -- right? Well, heck ~ wasn't Matt a self-taught PhD mathematician in ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997), so, why not a skillful self-taught surgeon eighteen years later? <br/><br/>To add to the other-worldliness, the picture was filmed entirely in Hungary, in and around Budapest, except for the outdoor Martian landscapes which were filmed in the other worldly deserts of Jordan right here on Earth. The new ultramodern Budapest Music Center ""MuPa"" on the Danube served as the location for the Chinese Space Ministry in Peking, and the plaza out front for the Square in Beijing where Chinese throngs cheer the Rescue mission on before a worldwide TV hookup. Also for the interiors of the NASA command center in Houston. All the other spaceship and astro-interior scenes were shot at the state-of-the-art KORDA studios just outside of Budapest. Wouldn't Stanley Kubrik be jealous if he were around today to see such facilities available for such Megascale screen fireworks? -- and what would this film have looked like if Kubrick had made it ...<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong ~~ I am not knocking the picture itself, which I enjoyed thoroughly in 3D at a state of the art Hungarian cineplex -- even dubbed into Hungarian which didn't matter much in a movie where the dialog is secondary, and may even have muttered out some of the incidental trivial chitchat back at NSA HQ, inserted to make the product more palatable to the Sitcom trained masses. Damon was endearing as a stranded space age All-American astronaut and is being pipped for Oscaramity 2016 -- but any other competent actor (e.g., Cruise, Depp, Denzil, Pitt) could have done as well given the one dimensional material -- not to knock Matt who is gaining versatility with maturity.<br/><br/>Fantastic special effects with that special Ridley Scott large-scale touch (Think, Blade Runner, 1972, or ALIEN, 1979) and credible (if not 100 % accurate) scientific detailing on space travel, some interesting side roles back on Earth, and a subtle call for more cooperation with RED China, coupled with the sneaky feeling that at the rate we are currently destroying our own planet we better find another one pretty soon, Mars being our current best bet -- make this movie a winner from stem to stern, given the usual suspension of belief required when viewing such an epic piece of wishful thinking. Think again -- already, if you have the bucks -- you can sign up for a privately funded Earth orbiting tour. Can The Moon or Mars be that far off ... Alex, Györ, Hungary Ocober 11, 2015"

","When the wife wanted to see this movie, I was skeptical. I was really exhausted with seeing sci-fi movies that go nowhere in plot, story, or depth. So when I heard about this movie entitled 'The Martian', I was reluctant to see it. <br/><br/>Going into the theater with the mindset that it was going to be another stereotypical, cliché sci-fi flick, much to my pleasant surprise I was sorely mistaken.<br/><br/>There was an A-List cast; each actor gave a splendid performance, playing off each other and lending to an overall magnificent performance. The focus on the plot was clear; nothing detracted from it. But would you really expect anything less from veteran director (I discovered at the end credits) Ridley Scott? Scott is a director who is very passionate about his profession which is clearly seen in this masterful work of art.<br/><br/>When this movie is over, you'll be leaving the theater pleased with your decision. I do suggest, however, that you buy yourself and your date the XL popcorn and soda due to the length of the film - but its got depth, so a lengthy movie such as this is okay."
