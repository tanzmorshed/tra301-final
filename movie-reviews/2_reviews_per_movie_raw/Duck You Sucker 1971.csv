"SquirePM","10","183","214","20 July 1999"," Probably the best unknown movie ever made.
","Here is a tragedy -- a great film doomed by a terrible title.<br/><br/>I saw this movie as ""Duck, You Sucker"" in the theater in 1972 or '73. I still have images and haunting music burned in my brain from it. It has, for one thing, one of the biggest real explosions ever filmed, an absolutely awesome blast using real high explosives that makes today's fiery spectacles pale. I think the whole production company was stunned by it, certainly Sergio Leone was, because he gives it the full treatment: multiple cameras and angles, wide shots, lots of screen time giving us lots of looks. And it's worth it. If you're not a war veteran, you've never seen anything like this.<br/><br/>But this film is much more than its fx. It's a deep, moving story told on the grand scale, with Oscar-class cinematography. It is both a major outdoor adventure and a small, intimate story. It has some of the quirkiest scenes, blackest humor and darkest betrayals, too.<br/><br/>Don't look for it on TV, unless Turner Classic Movies shows it ""uncut."" It was horribly mutilated in editing for television, and therefore unpopular and rarely shown. Get the original theatrical version, and watch it undisturbed. A party atmosphere would ruin it for you.<br/><br/>It's on my top-20 all time list!"
"DrLenera","Null","121","146","23 April 2005"," Leone's most underrated film,a rich masterpiece which gets better and better with each viewing
","It's generally thought that this film is Leone's weakest major film,and it is far less well known than the Dollars trilogy and the two Once Upon a Times. In actual fact,this is a masterpiece that deserves to be far better known and regarded than it actually is. It sees Leone attempting new things such as character development and political comment,while refining elements from his earlier films. It's really the bridge between Once Upon A Time In The West and Once Upon A Time In America,and it contains a great many elements of both films {which let's face it,despite both being Leone films are quite different}.<br/><br/>It starts in humorous vein,right from the opening sequence of the dirty,very poor Rod Steiger character Juan being taunted by some rich folk aboard a lavish carriage,the camera showing lots of close ups of mouths and eyes in what almost seems a parody of Leone's style. Juan is much like Tuco in The Good the Bad And The Ugly,loud,simple and very funny {he's even often accompanied by comical music }.Juan's first encounters with the other main protagonist,IRA man Sean {James Coburn} are treated like comical duels,and as they go to rob a bank it seems the picaresque tone will continue.<br/><br/>However,about a third of the way through the film becomes more and more serious. As Juan,thanks to Sean,becomes more and more involved in the Mexican Revolution,the tone becomes darker as more and more scenes take place at night and there is serious tragedy. The change in tone may jar to some people,but one can see the mature,contemplative Leone of Once Upon A Time In America reveal himself before our eyes.<br/><br/>Of course there are still some great action scenes,such as the taking of a bank which is superbly cut to Ennio Morricone's music {listen for the cheeky quotes from Mozart!},or Sean and Juan machine-gunning what seems like a whole army. There is as usual a great deal of violence,but it's less personal and graphic and instead is shown to have more consequence. The film's plot does move rather slowly,with Leone taking his time as usual,but this mean we can more enjoy the mannered Steiger and the laid back Coburn as one of the greatest partnerships in cinema history.<br/><br/>Of particular interest are the several flashbacks dotted throughout the movie,shot in dreamlike slow motion and usually set to what is quite simply one of the most beautiful film themes EVER {Morricone excels himself with the score for this film}. Representing Sean's past,they ask as many questions as they answer,Leone trusting his audience to work things out. The final one is missing from many versions of this film,a tragedy because as well as being sublimely beautiful {and ambiguous,is it Sean's memory?,a marijuana-enhanced hallucination?,a vision of Heaven?} it adds yet another element to the story.<br/><br/>A Fistful Of Dynamite {well,the French Once Upon A Time..The Revolution is the films' best title}is a masterpiece,it's extremely entertaining whilst also being full of complexity. Things become clearer and more interesting on second and third viewings. Don't expect the operatic ritualism of Once Upon in The West or the comic crowd pleasing of the Dollars films,but if you watch this you will be watching a cinematic master at the height of his powers."
"Bob-45","9","105","128","8 October 2004"," Sergio Leone's Sad, Funny, Beautiful Epic Western
","Coming off the triumphs of his ""Man With No Name"" series and his frustrations with the cutting of ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" Sergio Leone directed the big budget, epic western, originally titled, ""Once Upon a Time in the Revolution"". Since ""...West"" had been released by Paramount and United Artists was releasing ""...Revolution,"" some executive decide the rename the movie ""Duck! You Sucker!"" after the phrase Sean (James Coburn) uses repeatedly before blowing someone or something up with dynamite. Likely the same executive choose an advertising campaign reminiscent of ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly,"" creating caricatures of Sean and Juan (Rod Steiger) adding the caption ""...the master of adventure, Sergio Leone"". Well, I doubt many theater audiences knew who Sergio Leone was, since he was yet to be recognized as a directoral genius the equal of John Ford or Howard Hawks. Worse, the advertising implied ""Duck! You Sucker! was a laugh romp, a parody of Leone's early masterpieces. This impression was made even worse when the film failed to perform. In any event, ""A Fistfull of Dyanmite"" was a dismal failure at the box office and Leone never made another big budget western drama.It's too bad, because ""A Fistfull of Dynamite"" is Leone's trueist work, his most accurate vision of life, politics and revolution. Neither Rod Steiger nor James Coburn were strongly associated with westerns, even though both played strong roles in earlier films (Steiger in ""Run of the Arrow"" and ""Jubal,"" Coburn in ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""Ride Lonesome"". Worse, Steiger's Juan looked like something of a buffoon and the movies villains were bland and underdeveloped. However, I believe this was Leone's intention: corrupt politicians and Prussian officers are pretty well interchangeable. Kill one and another pops up. This isn't a very satisfying truth, but it is truth, nonetheless. Juan is a peasant, a bandit with a large family of bandits. Sean is a Irish Republican Army terrorist, an explosives expert. In Leone's world, or at least in all his films, there are only two types of people: predators and victims. His major characters are all predators. The only thing that distinguishes his protagonists from his antagonists is that his antagonists start with a large body count and his protagonists usually spare the innocent. That works with a taut enough storyline, but ""...Dynamite"" covers large areas of real estate and the goal is never clear. Juan didn't plan to become a hero of the revolution, and that is small payment for his losses. When one looks at history, the rewards of revolution and warfare are never worth the sacrifices, for just as we kill one bastard, another takes his place.<br/><br/>I think ""A Fistfull of Dynamite"" largely reflects Leone's fate as well. Leone proved he was the greatest western director in less than four years with only four major films. Yet, he was hardly appreciated during his short life and only a few films after his magnificent achievement. ""A Fistfull of Dynamite"" is also Leone's saddest movie. A beautiful, big budget metaphor for a man's talent wasted by underappreciate film executive and smug, self-serving critics.<br/><br/>Coburn should have won an ""Oscar"" for ""Dynamite."" With the exception of some tabletop model trains, the effects are convincing and exciting. The color cinematography is phenomenal, clearly the equal of ""Once Upon a Time in the West. The sound and music (by Ennio Morricone) is phenomenal, as usual. While not as satisfying as Leone's best films, ""A Fistfull of Dynamite"" is an exemplary film. I give it a ""9""."
"ereinion","10","61","77","25 September 2004"," Leone's most profound work
","Even compared to his most stunning classics like ""The Good,The Bad and The Ugly"",""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and ""For a Few Dollars more"",this film comes off like Leone's most mature and profound work. The theme is revolution.Parallels are drawn between Ireland and Mexico,two countries in violent uprising at the time.These parallels show that revolution is revolution,pretty much the same everywhere you go.It takes its casualties and destroys the lives of its survivors.<br/><br/>James Coburn does his best performance ever in what I see as Leone's attempt to toy with the image of his stereotypical hero like Man With No Name.Coburn's Sean Mallory is Man With No Name caught in the grip of reality,as much as Steiger's Juan Miranda is Tuco shown in the same light.<br/><br/>All actors do a great job and Domingo Antoine is chillingly effective as the monstrous half-German colonel Ruiz,riding a tank which makes him synonymous with the Nazi Germany and SS,adding more menace to the overall demonic image.Romolo Valli is also great as the leftist doctor who is the brain behind the revolutionary force in a small town where Juan and Sean plan to strike,both from different reasons. His betrayal of his comrades is the greatest shock in the film.<br/><br/>The flashbacks are among the most meaningful I have seen in a film and complement the story very well.As Mallory reaches into his difficult past,we first start to gain sympathy for him.The action scenes are overwhelming and exhaustive.The climax adds to the flow of strong emotions throughout the film as it is very dramatic.Steiger's justified and merciless revenge on the evil colonel gives compensation for Mallory's death and is maybe the most violent killing scene ever in western cinema,even beating ""Bonnie and Clyde"".Still,in the end,one cannot help but feel despair and pity as Juan is left on his own to ponder about it all and reflect on his own fate.Here Steiger really shows his greatness and is along with Coburn unjustly snubbed for a major award.<br/><br/>All said,this film still has enough comedy,fun and light moments to bring you joy.I strongly recommend this picture to lovers of true western and fans of Coburn and Steiger.From here,Leone strayed into obscurity with his gangster epic ""Once Upon a Time in America"",making this his final swan song.10/10."
"bob the moo","Null","36","47","6 June 2005"," A typically strong Leone film with added interesting political content
","John Malloy is an IRA explosives expert, on the run in Mexico. Juan Miranda is a Mexican bandit with no interest in the political upheaval in his country and only a dream of hitting the large bank his father once failed to rob. When the two meet, Juan sees John's explosives as the way into the ban, but John has no interest and it is only when Juan frames him for the murder of some senior soldiers that John relents. Arriving in the town, the bank looks like a simple hit if they can find some way of distracting the masses of soldiers that now control the small town  luckily the revolution is in full swing and rebels are in great demand; but it is not long before Juan's idea of a simple bank robbery sees him up to his neck in a struggle that he has no interest in.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have said how strong the Leone formula is and I won't be able to add much to their words but for me this is a fine film mainly because it takes apart yet another of the cinema myths of the noble revolutionary fighters and has a fascinating thread of political commentary running all the way through it. It doesn't open this way though, rather it starts with Leone's usual brand of wit and confrontation between John and Juan and it all feels like it will be similar (and just as good) to some of Leone's other westerns. However, about an hour in, it becomes more interesting thanks to the rather shocking portrayal of the revolution (on both sides) and the ripping into the ideas behind it. It only adds to the basic plot and, when it becomes the main focus, the film is stronger for it, although Leone's Marxist views may be a little hard to swallow for some viewers in the west. That said, it does still work as a typical Leone western and fans of his will still love this film.<br/><br/>The cast is good but you gotta wonder how those accents would have been mauled if the film had not been as roundly good  certainly Coburn's attempts at an Irish brogue are not the most convincing I've heard. Other than that though he is good in the lead role, coping well with making an IRA character ""likeable"" without damaging the cynicism and regret that exists within him. His flashback scenes are convincing even if it is not that important to the main thrust of the film. Steiger is less serious at first but develops his character well, despite having to cope with a ""road to Damascus"" moment as part of it. He is consistently amusing as a character and he does tend to dominate his scenes to good effect. Support is fine but really these two men are the film and they do it very well, coping with the laughs, tension and political commentary equally well.<br/><br/>Overall, a typically strong film from Leone that has all his usual formula touches as well as plenty of commentary of value. The direction and use of music are as good as always and the cast cope well with the demands of the script. Reviewers who have taken this as an attack on John Ford's idea of the revolutionary Irishman are perhaps a little off since the film only confirms Ford's usual pointing out of ""printing the myth"" but it still has plenty of value and interesting political commentary."
"Fella_shibby","7","10","11","29 May 2020"," One of the best Zapata western with lots of action n explosions.
","Saw this for the first time recently, the original 157 mins with Eng subs.
Honestly i did not enjoy this as compared to other Leone's films but the comic timings of Steiger n the screen presence of Coburn made it watchable.
A rapist Mexican thief and an ex-Irish Republican Army revolutionary join hands to rob a bank but involuntarily gets inducted in the Mexican revolution.
Although the last train blast scene looked very fake of that of a wooden train toy, but the film is loaded with action, specially the explosions n artillery guns' scenes reminded me of Rambo.
The film is a lil tedious, apart from the two lead characters, none of the others r memorable, the villains r not given enuff time n ther r no showdowns like most western films. The flashbacks scenes were lousy as two men run behind a woman n later one by one they both smooch her, wtf man.<br/><br/>Steiger's role reminded me of Eli Wallach throughout the film but he acted good."
"Quinoa1984","10","52","71","6 August 2005"," One of the best westerns/war films made in the 70's: brutal, violent, funny, poetically tragic, etc...
","With Fistful of Dyanmite (a.k.a. 'Duck, You Sucker', a.k.a. 'Once Upon a Time in the Revolution', the second part of a 'trilogy'), legendary Sergio Leone puts together something experimental, even more so than the other films in his catalog. Here he now deals with war, but he still has the crime elements of his 'dollars' films; it somehow makes a very clear cut balance between bits of comedy within the tragedy worked in the story; it isn't very brutal, but it is graphic in the genre sense of the time. It's also one of his best films, if you happen to see it within its full running time (like most of Leone's films, this suffered drastic cuts in American versions, reducing critical character points and other Leone surprises).<br/><br/>A Leone film, however, can only be as strong as the leads pushing it up, as in the dozens and dozens of westerns and other films that inspired Leone. Here he uses two character actors (for the most part of their careers), but indeed very good and astute ones at playing their parts. Rod Steiger, who has been in classic films like On the Waterfront and The Pawnbroker, here is slightly like a maturer version of Tuco from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: he's still a bandit, with pillaging and beating and raping his way across the countryside, but he's also got a family to look after, who within his anti-hero heart are the most important things to him. Steiger's Juan is usually either surprised, quietly delighted, or agitated off to certain degrees. He plays this for all it's worth, but he also finds the best notes in the moments when he brings out laughs, and in the more sorrowful moments later on in the film.<br/><br/>There's also James Coburn, veteran of many, many films, given one of the great themes of any character in a Leone film by composer Ennio Morricone (there's some sort of instrument or distortion of one in his theme that calls for complete, unusual attention on the viewer). Coburn's Sean (err, John, depending) is a character with some ghosts, perhaps, in his past, and who unlike Juan is more interested in 'other' interests. Although Juan tries not to notice it until the sequence at Mesa Verde (which I won't reveal), Sean has been through a revolution in Ireland, and understand more or less what happens with it. He brings in Juan, after a rather strange yet hilarious encounter, into his web of revolutionary fighters, which doesn't go over to well with him at first. As their story unravels, Coburn still plays it like a pro, being the straight character to Steiger's very theatrical-like performance. He doesn't quite have the mystery an Eastwood or Bronson had in the other Leone films, but he does carry a certain quality about him that puts him in a needed place in the Leone cannon.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, one must not over-look how complex a film like this is in some ways. Leone was not originally the director (it went through the hands of Peter Bogdanovich and Sam Peckinpah before coming to him, coincidentally the opening scene with Juan is a cool homage to the Wild Bunch opening). Yet somehow he puts his stamp, and wonderful mark, on Fistful of Dynamite. This time more history is worked into the film- unlike the civil war acting like a harsh backdrop to the more 'fun' elements of the adventure in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, the war in this film affects the main character, and adds a serious tone to an otherwise standard genre picture. <br/><br/>The Steiger character, along with the audience, gets a look at a massive amount of death, or rather the images of the dead: a tower filled with soldiers blown at night, the powerful pans and camera moves across the bodies, real combat, and the suggestions of what goes into the revolution. But its not just the violence of battles that get into the film, its also the personal attitudes during the revolution- the bourgeois vs the peasants (one of Leone's masterstrokes at close-ups in montage is displayed when Juan is on the train with the near monstrous American wealthy early in the film). Leone manages to work in various and cinematic explosions, in-depth or testing close-ups, and sweeping long shots of soldiers, landscapes, and struggle.<br/><br/>Coming back to Ennio Morricone's score- this time, Morricone experiments with some styles of his talents. As when Leone uses a funny, almost cartoon-like, image above Sean from Juans' eyes of a 'Banco' sign (akin the a 'dollar' sign above cartoon characters), Morricone adds a church organ and choir to go along with it. There are also the uses of themes throughout the film, as in Leone's other films, that act like striking, beautiful calling cards. The opening theme is pounding; Sean's flashbacks are given the sumptuous qualities that go with the best (and worst) nostalgia; the scenes with action and suspense, though almost a little standard, still work far better than many standard score of today. <br/><br/>Fistful of Dynamite is entertainment on an epic scale, with a broader and somewhat deeper sub-text, and it comes out with flying colors. Some may not take to it; it could be argued that Steiger, much like Eli Wallach, isn't very convincing as a Mexican bandit, or that the shifting in tones is a little much, even conventional in a weird sense. But it's hard to argue the sense of control that Leone has over his environment in the film, the assuredness of style, and that at the least the parts are greater than the whole. For me, it's a film I've seen twice in one week (once to soak in and get more of the enjoyment, the second time to get even more out of it, and to notice the visual details), and I hope it gets better the next time around."
"hokeybutt","10","62","87","29 July 2004"," Another Sergio Leone masterpiece... Duck You Sucker!!!
","A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE aka DUCK YOU SUCKER (5 outta 5 stars)<br/><br/>I think this is Sergio Leone's third greatest movie... right after Once Upon a Time in the West and The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.  Most Leone fans rank this film a lot lower... but I think that's because they are only familiar with the shortened two hour version.  Also, for the record, I absolutely loathe the re-titling... A Fistful of Dynamite... how lame!  At least the original Leone title, Duck You Sucker was... distinctive.  Even the French title (translation: Once Upon a Time... The Revolution) is kinda classy. But AFOD???  Gimme a break!  This movie has absolutely nothing to do with A Fistful of Dollars so why even try to make the comparison?<br/><br/>Anyway, I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theatre in 1972 (age 12).  I am pretty sure that what we saw at the time was the lengthy, uncut version... and I don't remember being bored at all.  (The most common complaint about this movie is that it is slow and boring... heck, that's the most common complaint about EVERY Leone movie.)  Rod Steiger and James Coburn play Sean and Juan, respectively a poor Mexican bandit and a fugitive Irish terrorist... who meet up in Mexico and become involved (against their wills) with revolutionary warfare in that struggling country.  The movie is exciting, funny, dramatic, suspenseful and, well, just plain brilliant. This is Ennio Morricone's greatest film score and the way it meshes with Leone's visuals is simply amazing... particularly in my favourite scene... the bank heist.  Juan and his young sons break into the Bank of Mexico, shoot it out with the guards and go from door to door, searching for gold and finding only political prisoners, until finally... oh, I can't give it away!  See it for yourself.  This is a movie filled with classic scenes: Coburn's arrival on the ""motorsickle"" and his confrontation with Steiger's gang... Steiger and Coburn with their machine guns... Steiger's final act of vengeance (which is severely chopped to bits in the short version... robbing it of its vicious power).  Its been said that Steiger's comical accent is stereotypical and insulting... but I say NO!  He is playing one of the richest and most complex characters of his career... with some of his greatest speeches (""And what happens to the poor people?  They are DEAD!""). Not to slight James Coburn, who also does a fantastic job, but Steiger is the star of this one."
"funkyfry","9","37","51","9 October 2002"," 100 proof dynamite action film by genre master Leone
","Excellent action film with Steiger over-the-top but Coburn right on the money as bandit/revolutionaries in Mexico.  More gunfire and explosions and less balmy confrontations than in other Leone pics.  I'm stuck on a second viewing by how much of a ""70s"" film this is, and how much real cinematic value and interesting ideas Leone has put into the film despite its basic action-film plotline.  Rumors say Malcolm MacDowell was the original lead -- very intriguing possibility.  The look on Steiger's face after he finds out he's risked his life to rescue a bunch of dirty prisoners is priceless."
"ChungMo","10","37","52","28 November 2003"," Just saw the restored print
","It's a shame that most people will not get to see this film on the big screen. The new print makes the film look like it was shot recently. The sound has been re- mastered also and is 90% perfect. A few of the restored scenes help the film along although they add to the already long running time. It is slightly different from the LaserDIsc version that came out a few years ago especially the end scene. However, one friend (a film reviewer) told me that it's the same version that he saw when it came out in 1972 for two weeks before it was pulled, re-titled and cut.<br/><br/>I have to say that this film is one of Leone's best and I now rate it above ""Once Upon a Time in America"". It's not an easy film and there are a few ""flaws"" but in a strange way it is the most human film Leone made. Coburn and Steiger both come off as real people despite the occasional lapse in accents. It's amazing how much time Leone gave to searing close-ups of the two actors and how they were able to convey so much of the story in silence. The story is very subtle and very unsubtle at the same time which can make following the film hard if you are expecting the ""hello stupid"" storytelling we get these days. Leone did the same thing in ""Once upon a Time in the West"" and ""America"". There's a storytelling genius here that's all the more amazing if you consider that Leone was operating out of his native language.<br/><br/>What makes this film stand out is the outright message Leone conveys with the story. He didn't do that with any of his other films.<br/><br/>A few words on the restored scenes. As with other Leone films that have undergone editing by American distributors, the removed scenes are a mixed bag. Some scenes were removed for length purposes, others for content reasons and some I suspect were removed because they were perceived as not up to the quality of the rest of the film. This was certainly the case for ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"". In ""Duck, You Sucker"", the restored opening helps the film's message which is probably not what the American censors though it was. The stagecoach robbery rape scene, which in the American version was edited in a way to suggest that Juan is really a gentleman thief not a rapist, is problematic unless you read it as a political comment and even then it's tough to take. The churchyard sequence, which is completely absent in the American version, is one of Leone's clumsiest scenes and it's absence didn't really affect the film. Some of it is out of focus! The ending sequence was apparently reedited by Leone after the opening in Europe and exists in several different versions over there! The version we see here is very, very long but illuminates the main characters motivations better then the American version.<br/><br/>Hopefully this limited re-release signals the soon arrival of a DVD version.<br/><br/>Update, July 2007: Finally, the DVD has been released. After watching the restored, restored version I have to add that the film really holds up. This version is identical to the screened version except for one minor, yet important difference at the very end. A crucial line from the American version has been restored. <br/><br/>The extras deserve some mention. First of all they all have a copyright of 2005 which indicates that the release of this DVD was delayed for some reason. The interviews are very interesting but each extra is heavily inter-cut with scenes from the film, the clips are frequently unrelated to the topic and often the same clips are repeated in each extra! You get to see James Coburn running in a field in Ireland over and over. One extra tracks the different versions that exist of this film, shows stills from scenes that Leone cut before the premier in Italy (the negatives of these particular scenes have apparently been destroyed) and leads into a rumination on the Sean/John confusion. The writer of this extra then comes to the conclusion that ""Sean"" isn't the James Coburn character! I don't agree at all but it's a useful extra.<br/><br/>A DVD to own."
"The_Void","8","38","54","7 July 2006"," Kind of like The Odd Couple, with explosions
","A Fistful of Dynamite is often seen as the black sheep of Sergio Leone's commercial releases; and there's a good reason for that, as despite the fact that it's still a spaghetti western; it's a completely different kettle of fish to both the Dollars Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West. A Fistful of Dollars features common western themes such as bandits, guns and bank robberies - but, as he did with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; Sergio Leone has implanted war themes into the plot, and we've also got the bizarre idea of one of the major characters being an IRA bomber! All this stuff doesn't quite come together cleanly, and as the tone of the movie changes often; it seems obvious that Leone has bitten off a bit more than he can chew...but luckily enough, A Fistful of Dynamite remains a fun movie for most of its duration. The plot follows a bandit named Juan, who bumps into a dynamite-laded bomber one day in the desert. Spotting an opportunity for robbery, he manages to recruit the IRA man to his cause; but he doesn't count on being dragged into the revolution that's going on at the same time.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie features some very astute elements of tongue-in-cheek humour, and it seems obvious that the director isn't intending the plot to be completely serious. However, at around the halfway point; the movie turns in completely the opposite direction, and the fun and silly first half gives way to a more deep and serious finale. For me, this is the movie's main problem; I like a movie that's unpredictable, but this change in plot feels disjointed and doesn't go down well. The second half of the film isn't as enjoyable to watch either, which harms the fun. However, Sergio Leone's direction is as impressive as ever, with some lovely wide angle shots capturing the beautiful landscapes; while, of course, Leone enjoys giving full focus to his actors for some extreme close-ups. Like the movie, the cast is a mixed bag. James Coburn looks the part, but his silly put-on accent makes him feel like he's having a laugh at times; and similarly, Rod Steiger dons an arguably even sillier accent and doesn't quite get away with it. Overall, A Fistful of Dynamite is not a film to please all viewers. I found it to be enjoyable despite many niggles, but I can understand why a lot of people disagree."
"murtaza_mma","10","10","13","2 February 2013"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Sergio Leone's thought-provoking masterpiece featuring an unforgettable Rod Steiger performance
","Duck, You Sucker (1971) aka A Fistful of Dynamite is an underrated gem that undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone. Anyone who has seen the ""Dollars Trilogy"" can easily mistake Leone for a mere showman, but those who have had the privilege of watching his more personal works like Once Upon a Time in America would know better. Leone was indeed a master showman but he knew well how to blend style with substance.<br/><br/>In the ""Dollars Trilogy"" style clearly is the real driver but deep down there is strong sense of realism that a keen eyed viewer wouldn't find hard to discern. The conspicuous levity only serves the purpose of a translucent film used to hide the naked reality so as to protect an average viewer from getting jumpy at its very sight. In Duck, You Sucker this translucent film only happens to be a fraction more transparent than usual. In other words, Leone chooses to be a bit more direct in his presentation of realism: most evident in the firing squad sequences. Duck, You Sucker thus serves to be a perfect amalgamation of style and substance.<br/><br/>In many ways, Duck, You Sucker happens to be Leone's darkest work. And how could it not have been? For the movie revolves around a highly unlikely union of a Mexican bandit and an Irish dynamite expert caught in the turmoil of the Mexican revolution. The only thing that unites these two completely different personalities is the fact that one is called Juan and the other, John. Juan sees this coincidence as a divine signal. That their union is meant to serve a much greater purpose: to rob the great bank of Mesa Verde. The loquacious Juan desperately tries to convince the taciturn John, but the later remains uninterested. Thus ensues a tantalizing game of cat and mouse between Juan and John as the two try their best to outwit each other only to be united by an eternal bond of friendship.<br/><br/>There are scenes in Duck, You Sucker that will stay with the viewer for ever. There are dialogues/monologues (spoken as well as unspoken) that will leave a lasting impact on the viewer. Juan's commentary on his own understanding of the word ""revolution"" is one. There's is another when a caged bird defecates on Juan's head and the bandit looks up and says: ""For the rich, you sing!"" Ennio Morricone's mystical music will continue to haunt the viewer much beyond the length of the movie. The movie's use of non-verbal language is probably as strong as the use of verbal one: best explained by Rod Steiger's expressions of elation, shock, disgust and self-pity. Duck, You Sucker is Sergio Leone's second best work (after Once Upon a Time in America) and features an unforgettable performance from the great Rod Steiger who is well complemented by James Coburn--in arguably his best role ever. Duck, You Sucker will serve as an elixir for any intelligent viewer and offers enough food for thought to keep him occupied until long after the film the over.<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

","I was lucky enough to see a newly struck print of a two and a half hour version of this film just yesterday, an immaculate print, as part of a Leone film retrospective here in Austin TX. I will not give a synopsis of the plot; what's important to note is that all the Leone hallmarks are there -- brilliant production design and camera work, carefully structured narrative, epic scale -- and some of the strangest music ever created by Mr. Morricone. The leads seem miscast, particularly Rod Steiger as the accidental Mexican revolutionary, but he gives an energetic performance that the film can hang its rather large weight upon. <br/><br/>I saw 'Good, Bad...' and '...West' immediately before I saw this picture and it is very much from the same cloth and in the same league as those two films -- more comic, a bit flawed and crude perhaps; but really it's evidence of an artist working on a grand scale and well worth your time.<br/><br/>If you consider yourself a fan of Mr. Leone's, do give MGM an email and demand the DVD release of this neglected, fascinating movie<br/><br/>Hopefully this picture will get the home video release it deserves. The VHS version of this film is much shorter and far more confusing -- a typical case of a long movie's being shortened in hopes that it will do better business, and being ruined in the process."

","Sergio Leone sums up the entire Italian film industry by starting the film with a beautifully framed and composed shot of...Rod Steiger pissing on some ants. And thus starts his fifth and final Spaghetti Western that some people declare a classic while others declare it a failure. Sure, it's got virtually no plot and just sort of meanders along for two and a half hours, but it's got Rod Steiger as a Mexican and it's directed by Sergio Leone - it's great!<br/><br/>Rod plays Juan, a bandit leader who tricks his way onto a lush carriage full of rich folk who treat him like he's some kind of disease (amazingly acted by Steiger as he plays up to their bigoted expectations), before turning the tables on them and robbing them of everything they have - including the carriage. It's not long after that Juan meets Sean (or John), who of course is an ex-member of the IRA and loves blowing everything up. <br/><br/>Sean/John is played by James Coburn who is literally dressed from head to toe in dynamite, and Juan has a religious experience when he realises that Sean is the key to the bank that Juan has always wanted to break into. The problem these days is that the Mexican revolution is going on and there's soldiers everywhere...and Juan does not want anything to do with no revolution...<br/><br/>Although Leone takes his sweet, sweet time digging a plot out of this one, it's such a delight to watch Rod Steiger being Mexican. He slides from wide eyed peasant innocence to rage and his interactions with Coburn are hilarious (usually because Coburn tells him to shut up most of the time). And the cursing! Eeh - the language!<br/><br/>Speaking of Coburn, he's having a problem with flashbacks throughout the film - Irish flashbacks involving David Warbreck! Warbreck would go on to be a leading man in Italian films shortly but here he just seems to be involved on some confusing romantic love triangle mixed with paramilitary business. Were they sharing that woman or were they all into each other?<br/><br/>There's no iconic gunfights here but there are some large scale battles and a lot of epic tracking shots that depict the carnage of the revolution. Italian minatures master and awesome director in his own right Antonio Margheriti provides the tiny train special effects.<br/><br/>I haven't mentioned a story because there isn't one."
"stamper","5","21","38","26 October 2003"," Plenty of explosions, but none of them will blow you away
","I've seen quite a number of Sergio Leone's films by now and I must say that I found this one to be the worst yet. I admit that I've seen worse films in general, but in no way can I recommend this one to you. If you want to see good Leone catch one of his films from The Man With No Name Trilogy or maybe even Once upon a Time in the West. I found the latter to be quite disappointing to be honest, but it was still better than A Fistful of Dynamite. There is almost no excitement, no coolness and the west is somehow robbed of it's roughness and interesting nature by motorized vehicles. Now I know that this is not supposed to be a film about gunslingers, but one about revolution and even in that aspect the film fails. First of all, the four flashbacks, which are supposed to give the film more depth, are misplaced, with the exception of the last two. They do not add anything to the film, or the preceding events and only make sense when (or if) you watch the movie until the end. Secondly, the film is just too long and not exciting enough to make you want to see the whole 158 minutes of it. Thirdly, I found it a bit strange that Coburn's Irish accent is apparent at one time and absent the next. Fourthly and maybe most sadly, the music of Ennio Morricone did not (as in many other movies) add anything to the experience, except maybe that it showed that the film is of mediocre quality in each end every aspect. No wonder scores from this film are likely to miss on any of Morricone's Best of records. Last but not least, I felt that as the film went on (or better dragged on), twists occur that made absolutely no sense to me. Concluding this comment I must say that this is a film I could have easily left off my list, but Leone is just too catchy a name for me. This one tumbles into oblivion rapidly after seeing and is not likely to be seen on any list, not even biggest disappointments. Films that have more famous names, though perhaps got better ratings by me, will have places on that list, like Once upon a time in the West (6 out of 10). The verdict for this one:<br/><br/>
5 out of 10"
"petra_ste","10","7","10","31 July 2014"," If you shoot me down, they will have to change all the maps
","Bridges are linked with death in Sergio Leone's filmography: the ""flyspeck on Headquarters' maps"" contended between Union and Confederacy in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly; the arc-like structure from which the brother is hanged in Once Upon a Time in the West; the bridge from which Bugsy emerges armed with a gun in Once Upon a Time in America.<br/><br/>Leone's best bridge sequence, however, happens in Giù la Testa (also known as Duck, You Sucker!, Once Upon a Time the Revolution, A Fistful of Dynamite): an exhilarating set-piece in which Mexican bandit Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger, chewing scenery with glee) and Irish revolutionary John Mallory (a magnificent, melancholic James Coburn) face a whole army and blow up a bridge in the most cathartic explosion ever committed to celluloid.<br/><br/>Leone's most nakedly political movie, in which the director's obvious sympathy for the revolutionaries clashes against his pessimism and distrust of revolutions as social movements (see the memorable moment where Mallory tosses Bakunin's essay in the mud after Juan's shockingly eloquent tirade), Giù la Testa features one of the Italian master's best scenes, rivalled only by the graveyard sequence in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Under a pouring rain, Mallory spies a mass execution; when he witnesses the forced betrayal of broken doctor Villega (a great Romolo Valli), a flashback finally reveals a defining event of his past. It's a gorgeous moment, enriched by Morricone's haunting score: cinema doesn't get any better than this.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Wulfstan10","10","9","14","17 May 2005"," Another Leone Masterpiece
","At first, I was going to rate this a 9 because I felt like my praise for this film was influenced by the fact that it was made Sergio Leone, one of my absolute favourite directors, and that it would seem odd to give so many of his films a 10. However, the truth is, his films usually are that great (with the exception of his pre-Fistfull of Dollars movies) and upon further reflection, I realized that I really do think this film deserves a 10.<br/><br/>This film certainly has a much more profound, and very moving, exploration of the main characters' lives and relationships than Leone's prior films. This is one of the key elements here as the story really gets deep into the psyches and emotions of Juan and Sean, revolves heavily around the development of their relationship, and truly explores their places, roles, and goals in life, as well as how Juan must figure out and cope with his future.<br/><br/>The film is profound in other ways, going deeper than the surface of politics and revolution. As is usual with Leone, nothing is clear cut, and even though the film makes the revolution appear justified in theory, with the rich and powerful being pretty darn bad, the ""good guys"" and the revolutionaries are themselves complex and not entirely noble (although I should point out that this is not entirely original since the earlier A Bullet for the General showed similar complexities in the same subject, even if it seemed more political and pro-revolution). Juan and his family are essentially bandits, interested in enriching themselves rather than improving society, yet they are protagonists and they become accidental revolutionaries, showing that revolutionaries weren't always fighting for just reasons or ideals. Moreover, revolutionary leaders are shown as flawed and in some ways weak and hypocritical while the revolutionaries are not above spilling a little extra blood.<br/><br/>The film is also the first of Leone's films to have an ending that is in some ways truly sad. The ending in Once Upon a Time in the West had some sadness to it, but it was greatly mitigated and had a different emphasis and focus. Here, one really feels Juan's loss after his life has been turned upside down; his family (who were the entire base of his existence) wiped out, the new friend, whose relationship with him, the film portrays, dead; and with him stuck in a role that he does not want or really understand. The film thus greatly touches upon the nature of, and meaning in, human existence in a way that really is not obvious, at least until the very end.<br/><br/>Rod Steiger and James Coburn really help bring out this strong character exploration and emotion. Both are at their very best in this film, imbuing their characters with great life and making them utterly compelling.<br/><br/>Duck, You Sucker also has Leone's trademark artistic directing and cinematography. It is not chock full of the incredible scenes and images the way the two immediately prior films are, but one only need see a few scenes to know who made it. The opening is typical Leone in that it shows something strange and in a way that does not immediately tell the viewer what is actually going on, drawing the viewer in to find out what he or she is watching. The scene in the coach, with the emphasis on the people eating, is also very effective.<br/><br/>The music is, as usual for a Leone/Morricone collaboration, great and highly effective. It's even more unusual than the music in the Dollars films, and I think some find it odd or unsettling, but it is highly effective."
"monsieurdl","3","21","40","3 April 2008"," How is this movie a masterpiece? Drawn out beyond reason...
","After reading some of the comments on this movie, both good and bad, I would have to say that the good comments have to be based upon certain scenes rather than the whole movie itself. Taken in its entirety, this movie far too drawn out and agonizing to be considered a masterpiece by any stretch. The beginning of the movie was merely a tease, as anything that happened beyond it reflected a constant interaction with people of the Mexican Revolution with the two main characters. This interaction never seems to go anywhere beyond leading to more explosions, people getting shot, or being rounded up. When the movie finally gets to the end with the major confrontation, my interest was so low that I was ready to be done with it and watch something else. Another Leone film that is comparable in length, Once Upon a Time in America, has a great story which is aided by its compelling characters. This movie has none of those qualities, and that is very unfortunate."

They team up to steal the bank of Mesa Verde and liberate political inmates . Both of them , are opposite characters , the peasant Steiger is simple-minded , hot-tempered , foul-mouthed , rough , ragged , short stature , while the Irish terrorist and explosives' expert James Coburn is sceptic , mild-mannered , elegant, high stature and he's trying to forget his bitter past . Both actors seem to enjoy immensely themselves . They are two heroes similar to Quijote (Sean Malloy) and Sancho Panza (Juan) . The picture contains action , explosions , train crashing , Leone's trademark humor and lots of fun . There are moments with comedy but also tragedy like is reflected on the shooting execution , massacres and the heroic sacrifice on the railway . It's his more personal film , more politics , more sensible and human touch although also has more flaws than former movies as the ¨trilogy of dollars¨ : ¨For a fistful of dollars¨ , ¨For a fistful of dollars more¨ and ¨The good , the bad and the ugly¨ .<br/><br/>There're some Irish flashbacks filmed in slow-moving , resulting to be a little embarrassing with certain remembrance to ¨Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid¨ though substituting the palling Burt Barachach music for the moody and striking Ennio Morricone score . At the beginning , Leone only wished the film production but the conflicts with the initial director Peter Bognadovich made Leone took the direction after thinking his best friend Tonino Valeri (My name in nobody). Most part scenes that the main actors didn't take part were shot by Giancarlo Santi , Albert Martino and Antonio Margheriti for the special effects .

","Giù la Testa is set in Mexico where Irish IRA explosives expert John Mallory (James Coburn) is on the run from one revolution & fight but soon finds himself in the thick of another when he teams up with Mexican bandit Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) & his gang, Juan forces John to help him & his gang rob the gold from a bank in the city of Mesa Verde using explosives but soon both are considered hero's for their antics. Drawn into the revolution Juan & John become important figures & commit themselves to the cause against oppression & their capitalist leaders...<br/><br/>More commonly known amongst English speaking audiences under titles such as A Fistful of Dynamite & Duck, You Sucker (worst title for a film ever) this Italian production was co-written & directed by Sergio Leone & despite the whole world & it's brother seemingly liking it I personally hated Giù la Testa & it's as simple & straight forward as that. When originally released in the US Giù la Testa was heavily edited to a little over two hours & I thought it was that shorter version I was going to watch last night but due to a mistake the version I saw was the life sapping two & a half hour plus cut which bored me to tears, hell I was sat there watching this & for the last hour all I could think to myself was how much more of this crap do I have to sit through. I know Giù la Testa has a good reputation but I really saw nothing here to enjoy or recommend, I thought the tone was very uneven, I thought the plot was weak & could be more accurately described as a collection of loosely connected incidents, I thought the themes about revolution, war, redemption, running, honour, family & betrayal had little dramatic impact & it bored me stupid. I can't stress enough how bored I was watching Giù la Testa & the worst sin a film can commit in my eyes is to be boring.<br/><br/>The film has a few sporadic moments of action, there's a few explosions, some shoot-outs & a crashing train but they are few & far between. Despite what anyone says the violence is tame, there's no blood or gore for instance. I will give Giù la Testa some credit for it's nice production design & cinematography, the film certainly looks nice if nothing else but that's not really enough. I mean if something bores you to tears it doesn't really matter how good it looks, does it? I don't quite understand where all the love for Giù la Testa comes from, I honestly didn't enjoy it at all & after a fairly striking opening thirty odd minutes I found myself losing all interest in it & becoming increasingly bored. It's never a good sign when you sit there & just keep saying to yourself that you wish something would just finish!<br/><br/>Although set entirely in Mexico Giù la Testa was filmed almost entirely in Spain apart from some studio work in Italy. As I have said the film is visually nice with some nice cinematography but it's just so dull & boring. Rod Steiger & James Coburn make for decent leads.<br/><br/>Giù la Testa is a film with a good reputation that I hoped I would enjoy but at over two & a half hours it bored me half to death, nope I am sorry but I don't have any love for Giù la Testa at all. I am sure there is an audience out there for a film such as Giù la Testa but it's not for me."
"classicsoncall","7","2","2","1 October 2018"," ""Listen, it takes one bandito to know another.""
","Well, I finally got around to this movie, and I'm glad I did, but in the end I was left unimpressed. It's a fairly long and meandering ramble concerning displaced IRA revolutionary John Mallory (James Coburn), and an unwilling Mexican one named Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger). The title of the picture is referenced a number of times, usually in connection with Mallory advising his erstwhile partner that something was about to blow up. It may be I lost my focus a few times because the movie didn't hold my interest much, even with Steiger and Coburn in the lead roles. The two Johnny's never really seemed that charismatic in a story that brings them together as partners though much of the time they act individually. I am in fact a fan of Leone's Dollars trilogy, but for me this didn't measure up. Maybe it was the political context, as I prefer the kind of antagonists that are destined to reconcile matters in a final one on one showdown. This one closed with Steiger's character looking somewhat puzzled, and for that I couldn't blame him."

","Okay, I'll give Rod Seiger credit for portraying a Mexican bandito with some conviction. That's it. This celebration of cruel violence, massacres, and interminable firing squads was weird and ultimately stupid. It was sort of a ""buddy"" film, where mass murderers Coburn and Steiger carried off a sort of romance by way of flashing their toothy smiles at each other to register approval or admiration. <br/><br/>Particularly disturbing was when Steiger, as a stinking, fat, slobby, unwashed, disgusting bandito decides to rape a well-dressed society woman. First, he exposes himself as he approaches her, and we are expected to believe that she was impressed and actually wants to be raped. Yes, this was quite disturbing. Steiger's character also had a young son, about eight years old, who was a natural killer and was not opposed to shooting unarmed people. Thus, when he himself was gunned down, we were supposed to feel pity. I didn't. <br/><br/>It was also stupid when Coburn's character opened up his trench coat to reveal sticks of dynamite and vials of nitro glycerin; one drop of which would explode upon hitting the ground, causing a large crater. This was intended to discourage the banditos from shooting him. He handled the nitro so carefully; yet he carried the vials while speeding along on a motorcycle over a bumpy, pothole-infested mountain trail.<br/><br/>Also annoying was the out-of-place ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" style score, which kept popping up at inappropriate times, like during a massacre. The vocal, ""Shom-shom-shom"" was very weird.James Coburn, as usual, offered little more than horselike teeth, flashed liberally. Rod Steiger was the cute mass murderer. Yuck."

Steiger and Coburn's characters are unappealing and strictly one dimensional. Steiger's performance could easily be interpreted as a weak Eli Wallach impersonation. In addition, both Steiger and Coburn's accents are unconvincing and forced. Coburn's frequent flashbacks grind the story to a halt and add little. The editing is very choppy, the numerous closeups overdone, and the 157 minutes of explosions and executions seem endless. - MERK"

But ""Duck You Sucker"" aka ""Fistful of Dynamite"" isn't in the same league.  It's no wonder Leone gave up on the genre and didn't direct another movie for thirteen years.<br/><br/>Leone's trademark style, with breathtaking visuals and intense, brooding characters is completely missing from this film.  The story doesn't have any focus, and there's a whole lot of bad dialogue.  The film actually has more in common with Leone's plodding debut, the abysmal ""Colossus of Rhodes"", than it does with his Eastwood/Bronson westerns.  No style, no substance, and none of the great humor of his previous films, I strongly suggest you skip this and go rent ""Keoma"" instead.  Now there's a real 1970s Spaghetti Western."

","Whilst I did not start watching Euro ""genre movies"" until 2011,there was always one Italian director who I would constantly hear getting mentioned by directors and Film buffs:Sergio Leone.Despite all of the praise ,Leone somehow ended up being a director that I decided I would start watching ""One of these days.""Luckally for me,that day arrived a lot sooner than expected,when I was surprised to discover that a friend had kindly sent me a DVD of a Leone film.Feeling that the perfect moment had arrived,I got myself all set to experience a Leone Spaghetti Western for the very first time.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>After being given a seat in an expensive carriage,due to the owners feeling sorry for the poor ""pesant""Juan Miranda suddenly bursts into action,when his family appear from out of no where and take control of the carriage.As Miranda's family take anything of value from the train.<br/><br/>Leaving the now empty train behind in a celebration mood,Juan and his family can't believe their eyes when they see a masked man riding a motorbike.Pulling out his gun,Juan shoots at the motorbikes tires and stops Sean Mallory in his tracks.Calmly getting off his back,Mallory slowly walks over to the near-by empty carriage and chucks a stick of dynamite inside!.Gobsmacked that someone could blow up a section of the carriage so casually,Juan keeps Mallory under guard so that he is able to take a look at all of his personal documents.Nearing the bottom of the pile,Juan suspects that he has struck gold,when he finds a paper the shows that Sean has a wanted bounty on his head relating to some activates that happened in Ireland.<br/><br/>Before Juan and his family can begin to consider a way to make some easy money out of a wanted man,Mallory unleashes his ""trump card"",which is that he is completely covered in explosives from head to toe underneath his clothes,and that if anyone even tries to kill him he is more than happy to set off the next ""big bang"".<br/><br/>Feeling that he should try and use Sean's skills to his advantage,Juan begins to try and become Sean's best new ""friend"".Relaxing for breakfast,Juan surprises Mallory and his own family when he suggests to Sean,that due to the Mexican revolution beginning to gain momentum Juan feels that they both have a fantastic opportunity to get rich.Remembering all of ""The Troubles"" that he himself had experienced during the revolution in Ireland Mallory instantly turns down Juan's offer.Not taking no for an answer,Juan's family follow Sean to his ""hide out"",where they help him to blow up a building which is filled with opponent's to the Mexican revolution.<br/><br/>Feeling uneasy about Juan pulling his family head first into being part of a ruthless ""revaluation"",Sean does everything possible to deter Juan from becoming an accidental participant in the revelation. Sadly for Mallory he discovers that he is one step behind,as Juan gets drawn more and more into taking himself and his family down a revolutionary road that is filled with darkness and despair.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Since having heard quite a bit about the violence in Sergio Leone's films,my initial expectation was that this wonderful film would have a high count of bullets & octane.At around the half way point of the film,I began to relies that instead of going for a ""smash and grab"" approach.Leone had instead made something extremely thoughtful which has themes and ideas that become noticeable on repeat viewings.<br/><br/>Looking at the excellent screenplay it is very interesting to see Dario Argento's (who had earlier been one of the main writers for Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West) almost forgotten 1973 film The Five Days of Milan as a non-Western companion piece to this film,with Leone and Argento both attempting to show ""the truth"" behind revaluations and giving both of their films a strong comedic side.<br/><br/>Whilst Argento goes for a much more slap-stick approach to the comedy.Leone goes for a wonderfully dry sense of comedy which perfectly blends into the movies very serious moments.For the main centre theme of the film,Leone brilliantly shows the ruthlessness of a revaluation taking place,as Juan Miranda (played by a brilliantly intense Rod Steiger) starts to unwittingly get pulled into the events that are taking place around him,as his refusal to let John Mallory (played by a fantastic,bitterly regretful James Coburn) ,who is still disgusted at what he saw of a past revolution-first hand travel on his own come back to haunt him.<br/><br/>One of the most chilling images in the film is of a mass grave shooting,that has Leone deliver a perfect wide tracking shot to show the terrible genocide that is engulfing the country.For the tastefully done special effects and action scenes,Leone brings director Antonio Margheriti (who would later make the sadly under rated 1970 Spaghetti Western And God Said To Cain)into the mix,who gives all of the special effects a tremendously realistic gritty look.<br/><br/>Along with Margheriti's effects work,Leone shows that for his last ever Spaghetti Western he is going to do everything to go out with a real bang,as the gripping first 30 minutes of the movie show Juan and his family rob a carriage filled with the elite (that also features some shots that Peter Jackson re-did in the final Lord of the Rings film) bare,which whilst being a fast paced thrilling part of the film,also allows Leone to show what Juan is about to lose."

"trajan44","5","8","15","22 July 2012"," It's not a Spaghetti Western or any kind of Western, it's a Mexican Revolution Drama.
","The main problem with this movie is that it starts out as a Spaghetti Western, but after the first hour of the movie turns into a ""historical event"" drama. Think of ""Reds"" or ""Dr. Zhivago"". Rod Steiger was in ""Dr. Zhivago"" but here he plays a Mexican peasant turned bandit. Rod Steiger does not look like he is from Mexico, but he is very convincing nonetheless. His character Juan is crude and simple, but not stupid. James Coburn is also convincing as well. His character John is from Ireland and is an explosives expert. So the acting from both of them is top notch. Which is good, because there isn't much acting from anyone else. With perhaps the exception of the doctor, all the other characters are stock characters and aren't developed at all. A majority of all the lines in the movie belong to Steiger and Coburn. It really is an unintentional buddy movie between their two characters, and it's pretty good in that respect. Unfortunately it is unlike most other historical event/epic movies in that there aren't the usual supporting characters. The setting is the Mexican Revolution but it doesn't get into details, it just takes place somewhere in the middle of it. There also isn't any female characters, hence no romantic situations. This is probably another reason why it didn't do well at the box office. It is not a Western. None of the usual themes are present. ""The Mercenary"" is a spaghetti western that takes place about the same time period, say circa 1914. It takes place in Mexico and Texas. Both movies show an early automobile, early machine guns, but ""The Mercenary"" (with Jack Palance) is a true western. Sergio Leone starts this movie out in the spaghetti western style, then changes it. Big mistake. Spaghetti Western fans would have felt cheated, and people who enjoy historical epics would have felt cheated since it doesn't have the usual themes associated with that genre. I'd agree with some other reviewers that it is a collection of memorable scenes and sequences, but that as a movie it doesn't cut it. The drama does get heavy, but then the Mexican Revolution was sad times. It eventually devolved into a multi-faction civil war. Also seems like there were bad leaders on both sides.

","This movie totally confused me.<br/><br/>It had one of the best critical summaries of revolutions and politics delivered by any film, in a couple of sentences from Juan about half way through the film.<br/><br/>But it also seemed to make a hero out of a rapist and a guy who blows people up and who both mow people down with machine guns from a km away.<br/><br/>It was made at a time when the IRA where blowing (often innocent) people up in England and in Ireland and it SEEMS to sympathise with the idea that it is alright by placing the hero, with a ludicrous Irish accent (why not just get a funking Irishman to play the part) in the context of extreme fascism.<br/><br/>Say what you like about the British but the film's attempt to compare the conduct of the British with a regime that killed hundreds of prisoners with machine guns and wandered around shooting victims in the head to be on the safe side, made me a little annoyed.<br/><br/>But, as i say, the film confused me, because it was extremely unclear whether it was a critique of revolutions (as well as the obvious disdain for fascism), a critique of the violent methods of revolutionaries or a critique of the violence used by the two leads. Or all three.<br/><br/>And Juan never seems to complain to Sean Sean Sean for convincing him, in an extremely underhanded way, to become involved in a conflict that leads to the death of his whole family (A family containing a son who kills unarmed people (who are duckheads but nevertheless, we don't normally sympathise with characters who kill people just because they are rich duckheads right? They normally need to have done something pretty terrible to justify being shot in the face by a 9 year old).) In previous films, Leone does a good job of convincing you that nearly every person Clint or Bronson shoots, deserves it or is involved in a fair fight. When you have a hero who mows down hundreds of people from a mile away with machine guns and dynamite, a hero who only gets upset when he himself is identified as an IRA member and does nothing to protect the other members identified and a hero who never apologises to bloke whose entire family was killed because he was tricked into becoming a revolutionist, it's difficult to feel anything positive for the lead.<br/><br/>But we can find sympathy for WW2 pilots bombing Germany and Japan, why not Sean? Because he smiles when he does it. And it's such an obvious and uncomplicated smile, that leaves such a bitter taste in the mouth, i can only think Leone didn't know the answer either. It's a hard question after all."

","Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a masterpiece. His other Westerns range from good (""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"") to bad (the two ""Dollars"" films) to ugly (this one). The opening shot has Steiger, doing an Eli Wallach impersonation by way of Strother Martin, relieving himself on a tree and goes downhill from there. It moves very slowly and lacks any drama, humor, or plot elements to sustain interest. Some scenes go on forever and the last hour of the movie becomes so dull and repetitious that it is almost unwatchable. Leone used extreme closeups to good effect in his earlier films but here he just goes overboard with it. Ugh!"
"yuppidu","10","7","13","10 February 2007"," It is a legend!
","This Sergio Leone film is definitely the least seen of all his westerns. For some reason, this film is largely forgotten. It is never shown on cable, and the video was out of print for many years but has recently been re-released on both laser disc and video. Hopefully now that it has been re-released, it will start getting the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>This movie is the exception to the rule that Leone gets better with time, but it is only a slight exception. After all, it's hard to beat Once Upon a Time in the West. Perhaps the slight imperfections comes because it was not originally a Leone project, and so he did not have quite as much control as usual.<br/><br/>This film, despite its name, is not a spaghetti western. It is what is called a ""Zapata Western"", after the famous Mexican revolutionary. These films are characterized by the simultaneously friendly and antagonistic relationship between a local bandit , and a foreigner who is an expert at revolution. In A Fistful of Dynamite , Juan Miranda (Ron Steiger) is a Mexican bandit who runs across Sean Mallory (James Coburn), who is an IRA terrorist on the run. After some initial hostility and a few explosions, Juan convinces Sean to rob the Bank of Mesa Verde. Sean, however, arranges things so that Juan frees hundreds of political prisoners while looking for the safe in the bank. After that, Juan slowly turns into a full- fledged revolutionary, while Sean loses his revolutionary fervor.<br/><br/>To contrast this plot with a few other Zapata Westerns, in The Mercenary, a Mexican who starts to get involved in the revolution is helped by a clever mercenary who treats himself to the Mexican's water, women, and gold. Quemada! ( also known as Burn! which stars Marlon Brando) is the story of a British officer (Brando) who helps start a revolution in the Antilles sugar farms by duping the soon-to-be leader of the slaves to rob a bank, then defend himself, and then defend his people.<br/><br/>One of the interesting things about A Fistful of Dynamite is the weird, offbeat, yet beautiful Ennio Morricone score. From the Main Title's refrain of ""Sean. Sean Sean Sean. Sean Sean."", to the March of the Beggars (Juan's Theme) croaking ""wop. Wop. wop."", Morricone created something different than the usual spaghetti western, yet just as fun, and certainly just as moving.<br/><br/>The music is well suited to the equally quirky direction by Leone. This movie is full of fast zooms, extreme closeups, exaggerated, cartoonish visuals and sounds. A good example is the scene in which Juan is traveling with the upper-class snobs, who proceed to stuff their faces with all sorts of food (which Leone shows in extreme close-ups), and make fun of Juan and the poor Mexicans like him. The same phrases are repeated over and over, faster and faster, until the train is finally stopped by Juan's men. And one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Sean first reveals his incredible array of explosives, and the camera zooms to Juan's amazed eyes.. the organ music swells, and we see Sean standing there with a banner floating above him which reads ""Banco National de Mesa Verde"". It's one of those things that Leone does that reveals exactly what a character is feeling, even though nothing has been said. And, of course, a banner floating in midair above someone is just never done in movies. When Leone does it, it is surprising and hilarious.<br/><br/>A Fistful of Dynamite is a film unique in the Leone body of work. It is a comic film, yet serious at the same time. Even though Juan is the comic character, in this film the comic character is every bit as important as the serious one (John) (as opposed to The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly or Once Upon a Time in the West ). It is Juan that we see develop ideals, while at the same time Sean loses his (""When I started using dynamite, I used to believe in a lot of things. All of it! Now I believe only in dynamite""). In elevating the comic character to the equal of the serious one, Leone creates a film that is sensitive as it is cartoonish . ""What about me?"" we hear Juan ask at the end of the film. After these sad parting words, that Juan realizes that now he must fight by himself, thus losing his comic, sidekick quality, and becoming a serious John-type character. This is the only time that such a switch happens in Leone's oeuvre, and I'm glad it does"

","I managed to watch this all the way to the end, but had I not been stuck at home sick in bed, that would have never happened.<br/><br/>Good grief, the film grinds on endlessly with little or nothing really going on on screen. There's plenty 'o explosions and summary executions, but precious little plot or dialog. Just hours of meaningless - contextless - violence.<br/><br/>Scene after scene shows looooooooong closeups of Stieger or Coburn saying nothing, doing nothing, just standing there staring at somebody or other and maybe sweating a little, while this insipid bubblegum music played in the background. And then there were the utterly pointless flashbacks - I think there were FOUR of them, that added nothing to the plot save to drag things out even more.<br/><br/>It was a hackjob from beginning to end, as evidenced even by the title ""Duck, You Sucker!"" Yeah, real classy."
"tieman64","Null","6","11","15 September 2007"," The ""Lucas and Leone"" effect
","With the first ""Star Wars"" trilogy, creator George Lucas borrowed from Leone, Kurosawa, Ford, Tolkien etc and created one of the best slices of pop art, a bouncy myth (at once futuristic, medieval and topical - ie Vietnam), which resembled the kind of postmodern comic book that the ""Kill Bill"" movies would beat like a dead horse decades later.<br/><br/>Fast forward some years and Lucas decides to revisit the universe of ""Star Wars"". He wants to create a prequel trilogy. Problem is, he's a different guy now. He's grown and matured. End result, he decides to give us a Greek Tragedy rather than a Hero's Journey. The heavy, darker side of the myth.<br/><br/>And so the Taliban-like rebels of the first trilogy are replaced and contrasted by showing us the evil workings of the American Empire. And yes, the prequels are overtly anti-American. In this context we can almost read the destruction of the Death Star as a 9/11 event.<br/><br/>George Bush, I mean Senator Palpatine, comes into power, assumes executive control and promptly wipes out the Jedi (who are stand ins for America's exoticized enemies). The democratic Old Republic then gradually dissolves into a far reaching Imperial state, whilst the beauty of their spaceships, the artistry of their cruisers and the elegant designs of their cities (as shown in the prequels) is slowly replaced with the cold, bland, mechanical or bureaucratic look of the Empire (originals). Free thought and individuality is then removed (clones/stormtroopers) and the Imperial Empire is born.<br/><br/>Note also how the logical, scientific approach to the Force (medichlorians - a play on the word mitochondria) present in the Old Republic, gives way to the mythical religions and rationalisations of the Force in the originals. The Prequels are the ""age of Reason"", populated by thinkers, scientists and agnostics. But when society crumbles, the age of mystics (of hope and religion) is reborn.<br/><br/>How does something founded on beautiful ideals (The Old Republic/America) become so evil? Lucas hits the nail on the head throughout the prequels. Politicians and people ignoring the plight of small nations and species. Large Trade Guilds exploiting and bullying the weak (notice that the enemy is merely a conglomerate of super-businesses, traders and corporate monopolies). Power is centralised. The media is blacked out or fed lies. Arms deals are conducted in proxy (Afghanistan, Lebanon, Vietnam, Iraq are all proxy wars) and everyone not of your religion (Lucas' Empire is comprised of stuck up Brits) is swept aside.<br/><br/>Today, the American Empire has military bases in virtually every country in the world. No other country has this privilege. It also has the CIA, not only a body which is completely unchallenged and unanswerable to anyone but the President, but one which has become quite adept at instigating coups and installing puppet leaders in foreign countries.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite all the interesting thematic stuff present in the prequels, they're all hokey failures. Lucas fell into the trap that a lot of authors fall into. Authors often develop a series of books which become successful and connect with an audience. But great artists don't like to repeat themselves. So as the author progresses and grows as an artist, the tone and content of his series changes. Eventually the reader no longer identifies with or likes the way the characters (or author's voice) has changed. <br/><br/>Audiences want familiarity. Artists want to experiment, to challenge perceptions...but they love their fan-base too. So in an attempt to win back the reader, the author then reverts back to his simple minded, fun storytelling, while subversively inserting ""intelligence"" into the thing. The result is a strange mix which again doesn't go down well with the reader.<br/><br/>Because of his financial success with the originals, Lucas is one of the few directors to have a ""series"" of his own. His evolution as an artist is exactly as described as above. His prequels are an odd mix of old George and New George, of adult smarts and teen fun.<br/><br/>Of course the second problem is that an ""adventure serial"" just can't hold the weighty themes and Greek myth overtones that he wants to insert. The prequels had to be far darker (like the Godfather trilogy) in both tone and style, less roller coaster and kiddie oriented, for his story to work dramatically. <br/><br/>My point with all of this is that Sergio Leone went through the same artistic evolution. He started out making a group of fun, cartoonish pop westerns, and then transcended the genre with his masterpiece, ""The Good The Bad and The Ugly"". But no one took him seriously. No one would finance his ""serious projects"". So throughout the rest of his career he gives us over-long, somber pictures which try to be both fun and light, while also being political, Marxist, historical and important. This results in a weird cocktail of flawed movies peppered with greatness. Of movies at once childish but longing for an adult sensibility.<br/><br/>It's also interesting to compare Leone to John Ford. Ford's ""action westerns"" became dated and stupid the moment Leone started his ""Dollars trilogy"". Leone then went on to emulate Ford with ""Once Upon a time in the West"", a melancholic pastiche of countless other westerns which uncomfortably jumps from somber meditation to comic book spaghetti. Meanwhile, Ford had dropped the ""action western"" and started making meaningful, subversive westerns (Liberty Valance) of his own.<br/><br/>8/10- A masterpiece with a bit of an identity crisis. It has it's flaws, but I'd argue (I can't due to IMDb word limits) that it's better than both ""Once Upon A Time In America"" and ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", both of which are suffused with nostalgia, yearning for the tropes and images of the western and gangster movies of Leone's childhood. They're Tarantino territory: films about films."
"inspectors71","3","8","17","19 April 2016"," A Fistful of Idiocy
","Junk.<br/><br/>Sergio Leone was an acquired taste--his ""Dollar Trilogy"" runs the gamut from lean/lyrical to surreal/stupefying. Leone comes a cropper with his elephantine ""A Fistful of Dynamite,"" a low-brid combination of political revolution, infantile plotting, and dreadful performances.<br/><br/>Although ""Duck You Sucker"" (the alternate title) tries to be a message film, all we get is incoherence, with buckets of blood and one of the weirder musical scores I've heard. Rod Steiger and James Coburn are trapped in bad make-up and/or bad accents as they slaughter and butcher and incinerate roughly a third of the Mexican Army in the 1910 Revolution. <br/><br/>I kept hoping, during what seemed to be a week of movie watching, that some of the old surrealistic, alternate-universe, western magic would appear. <br/><br/>All I got for my effort of watching A Fistful of Dynamite was a weak headache, and I felt sad for Sergio Leone because, although he wasn't a great director, he had a knack for big storytelling.<br/><br/>And that knack wasn't apparent in this incomprehensible and artsy- fartsy bloodbath."
"Steffi_P","9","4","7","16 July 2007"," ""My country is me and my family""
","This was a picture Sergio Leone never intended to make  he began as producer, but to cut a long story short got roped into directing it. In spite of this, coupled with the fact that he was getting seriously fed up with the western genre, Duck You Sucker is perhaps Leone's most personal picture. He turned it from being yet another Zapata western (see Quien Sabe?, Il Mercenario and Companeros) into a statement against the genre.<br/><br/>The intended message of Duck You Sucker is, in short, an even-handed condemnation of the left and the right, the moral of the story being that it's best not to get involved, and that the home and the family are what matters most. A rather dubious philosophy when taken to such extremes, but a real tonic when you look at how preachy some of those Zapata westerns were. Personally though, I'm more drawn in by the delicate humanism that was maturing with Leone's work. There were occasional emotional moments in his earlier films, but now Leone is really giving them time and complexity. Take for example the scene where Juan and John discuss the realities of the revolution at the camp  you can really believe in these characters.<br/><br/>Like his final film, Once Upon a Time in America, this one can be seen as almost being a love story between two men. Not in a literal sense of course  it's not homo-erotic  but in the way it's structured. Juan and John are opposites thrown together by fate, are antagonistic towards each other at first, but somehow a bond develops between them and they become inseparable. There's also the back story with Sean (the other man in the Ireland flashbacks), with whom John obviously had a similar relationship.<br/><br/>As far as his technical style goes, this is actually one of Leone's most perfectly constructed films. The editing is all spot on, and incredibly rhythmic. Although it's a lot subtler than in the dollars westerns, watch closely and you'll see he still choreographs the opening credits in time with music. Duck You Sucker is one of the best examples of what Michael Powell calls a ""composed film""  that is, one in which every aspect of the image  movement, editing and even the colours and arrangement of objects and people  responds to the music are the collage of sounds. Powell himself was one of the best directors of composed films, Robert Wise was another, and so was Leone.<br/><br/>A brilliant example of this compositional style, and one of my favourite moments in all cinema is when Juan realises John's potential as a dynamiter, and the Mesa Verde bank logo appears above his head, just as Morricone's music references Bach's Toccata. A lot of people really hate that bit. Yes, it's completely over-the-top, almost cartoonish, but this is really Leone saying ""Hey, this is cinema, we don't need rules!"" Having said that, there is one sequence along these lines which I dislike, and that is when the bourgeois travellers are demonising the peasants whilst stuffing their faces, and we see all these close-ups of their mouths and hear the same words repeated over and over. It's such an obvious, boring device, and not really very effective.<br/><br/>A big weakness with Duck You Sucker is that, being caught between the old and new Leone styles, sometimes it doesn't really know what sort of film it wants to be. Leone's westerns, for better or for worse, stuck to the formula of a hero and a villain pitted against each other from the start, destined to meet in a final showdown. As his films progressed he concentrated more on social drama and character development, and Duck You Sucker certainly continues this trend. However, it is still tied to the old tradition and consequently has a few token villains  but the nazi-like army officer Ruiz and the governor whose face is on all the posters while they are necessary background figures, don't really belong as characters. The drama in Duck You Sucker is fully formed  Leone had fully developed the humanistic element in his films by now  but at the expense of making the action elements feel tacked on. Also despite the picture being in part a statement against political violence, the action scenes are still done in an exciting, heroic fashion.<br/><br/>An awkward Leone picture to pigeon hole, but still a very enjoyable one. It's the closest he came to making a ""message"" film, even if it is the ultimate political anti-statement. It has its flaws, but it looks great, and has a brilliant pace to it. Both Rod Steiger and James Coburn have been criticised in the lead roles, but I think they're both perfectly cast. Considering the circumstances in which it came about, Duck You Sucker isn't half bad."
"Sonatine97","9","4","7","22 July 2000"," Goodbye Horse, hello Motorcar - another revolution!
","Of all Leone's supposed ""spaghetti"" westerns it is this that is perhaps the most undervalued & least revered, which is a huge shame, because ""Fistful of Dynamite"" is on a par with the Dollar films and almost reaches the stratospheric heights of the WEST & AMERICA movies.<br/><br/>It's interesting how his westerns are like chapters in history - consider WEST as being a true cowboy western of the late 1800s, AMERICA covers Chicago gangsters of  the 1920s and 60s; while DYNAMITE acts as a fulcrum between the dying western era of the late 1890s and the birth of a new 20th century revolution of the motor car.<br/><br/>And this allegory is visualised quite perfectly by the two main protagonists, Steiger, an old style cowboy cum Mexican bandit unaware that his era is almost over. And then we have Coburn as the 20th Century Man: a new modern breed of terrorist (or bandit if you like) with new-found technologies (liquid dynamite in a bottle) and early materialism (the motorbike replacing the horse).<br/><br/>Steiger has no greater desire than to rob banks and take care of his family just like hundreds of bandits before him, but realises very slowly that the world he lives in is in turmoil and change is on the way.<br/><br/>The Mexican Revolution is like an American version of WW1 where the new supercedes the old and Steiger finds it more & more difficult to realise his dreams. That is until Coburn rides into view.<br/><br/>Steiger is impressed with this Modern Man, seeing him as some kind of Saviour to replenish his thirsty desires. Yet Coburn has seen it all before - the killings, the revolutions, the plottings back in Ireland as a member of the IRA fighting for a cause just like the Mexican Revolution he now finds himself immersed in.<br/><br/>After a hesitant start they become firm friends but each has his own reasons why he does what he does. In spite of Steiger's viciousness he really only cares about family values. If the government had treated people such as himself with these values & virtues then he wouldn't have to resort to such extreme measures.<br/><br/>By the end of the film and numerous gunfights, betrayals & escapes they both realise that this particular revolution is too big even for them and they decide to go North and head for America.....<br/><br/>A classic Leone film typical of the man, although not quite so operatic or vast as the earlier WEST film and even though we are given enough background on both characters we still feel remote from really caring for them, unlike Bronson, Fonda, Robards & Cardineli in WEST.<br/><br/>BUT Steiger gives a wonderful performance as the ""little man"" fighting for (and against) change, fighting for his family and later, fighting for his people. His faith in God severely tested during one memorable scene in the cave hideout where his family have been massacred through betrayal of a friend.<br/><br/>Coburn's performance comes a close second. He is like a middle class intellectual compared to Steiger's working class hero and yet they both seem to depend on each other.<br/><br/>Leone has this wonderful talent with character development and how he can pull at our heart strings as our heroes suffer the kind of inhumanities they hand out to others.<br/><br/>DYNAMITE lacks the style of WEST & AMERICA, and the flashbacks are a little lumpen & crude. The settings also seem a little less grandiose & beguiling compared to the refined township world of Jill McBaine from WEST.<br/><br/>The music from Morricone (who else!?) is a little more eclectic & scatty than his previous works: for the first time he adds some random sound effects & chants which goes against the operatic style of the master. But having said that, there are some excellent & familiar haunting scores interlaced between the avant-garde.<br/><br/>A very good movie overall but doesn't quite convince or hang heavy in the mind like WEST. <br/><br/>****/*****"

"whitdenton98","10","3","5","21 January 2014"," Sergio Leone's Best Film You Never Saw
","I hadn't heard of Duck, You Sucker (which is sometimes known as A Fistful of Dynamite) at all until I got a box set of Sergio Leone films for my birthday. It came with the obligatory Dollars Trilogy with Clint Eastwood (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly), but it also came with this movie called Duck, You Sucker that I hadn't ever heard of. Well, last night I popped it in and watched it. What followed was one of the most wonderful, thoughtful, and awesome westerns I had ever seen. The film is about a low class bank robber named Juan (Rod Steiger) who teams up with a charismatic I.R.A explosives expert named John Mallory (James Coburn) to heist a large bank in Mexico. Yet, instead of that they get thrown head over heels into the Mexican revolution. One of the reasons I was so blown away by Duck, You Sucker was the fact that it was so different then most of Leone's other westerns. It had some similar parts to it, but it really felt completely different than his Dollars Trilogy or Once Upon a Time in The West. It dealt with much more political subjects and seemed to go a lot deeper into character than most of his other films. Don't get me wrong, I love his other movies to death. Yet, this one was different in such a good way. It starts out with Juan boarding a stagecoach filled with rich white people, all of them looking at him in disgust and being generally racist and elitist. This was when I started to see Leone grappling with issues like class discrepancy and stuff like that. I thought he was just touching on a subject like that. No, about halfway through the film it starts really dealing with the Mexican revolution and how it affected the Mexicans. One shot shows soldiers just massacring rebels in pits, and not just the adult men. Women and children are not spared. The film isn't all horrifying war stuff like that though. It somehow manages to take comedic scenes, exciting western action, and very emotional and in depth scenes and marry them in a beautiful way. There are certain parts that are very cool classic Leone western scenes. Then there are these very touching exchanges between Juan and John that are just beautiful. There's also a series of flashbacks that give John's character some background. They all take place in what we think is Ireland and are all done incredibly well. The amount of range this film has is fantastic. I honestly can't recommend it enough. Another great thing here are the explosions. Nowadays we have CGI explosions in our movies. It's amazing to see that when stuff gets blown up in this movie, it's for real. The explosions look so raw and real, because they are. It's better than CGI could ever do. There's one scene in particular where a bridge is blown up. It's one of the most incredible things I've seen on film. One trademark of Sergio Leone films are the musical scores done by Ennio Morricone. You probably have heard The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly one, or maybe some of the others. They all have a very distinct sound. They remind me of a warrior marching into battle, or two men facing off in a gunfight. The score for Duck, You Sucker is one of Morricone's best. It started off kind of slow and I was quite skeptical, then it get's better and it really grows on you. To tell you the truth, I'm listening to it right now. When the movie started out it seemed like any other Leone film. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing. But it seemed like it could be a For a Few Dollars More-esque bank heist western. I really liked that movie so I was excited. Instead, I got a politically charged and very emotional film with a lot more thematic weight than any western I've seen in a while. I haven't seen all of his movies so I can't say for sure, and I'd want to watch this again before I made any judgments, but Duck, You Sucker may be my favorite Sergio Leone film. And this is coming from someone who genuinely loves The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Again, I'm not too sure about that yet. Duck, You Sucker is different then most classic westerns I've seen because it mixes great western style and tropes with heartfelt messages and serious character development. If you haven't noticed by now, I really loved the film. I'm surprised this hasn't reached the level of notoriety that many western (particular Leone) movies have gained. It's better than many, like High Noon, that have become quite famous. With Duck, You Sucker, Sergio Leone proves yet again that he is a master of the genre. If you haven't seen it, I urge you to do so as soon as you can. Duck, You Sucker is terrific."

","Well, I just watched most of a well rated Sergio Leone film, ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" (American title.) I do not believe I have ever watched more than a few minutes of any of his films, even though I have really enjoyed Crint Eastworld in most films, especially the ones that ""make my day."" But the Spaghetti Westerns really do not make my day. The acting seems like it is from another planet, apparently due to the direction and script. One cannot even imagine real humans behaving the way Leone portrays them.<br/><br/>But, this one promised to be a bit different. James Coburn, a favorite, is an Irish revolutionary, and Rod Steiger, is a Mexican bandido, ""perfectly cast,"" until he breaks into ""Joey Doyle,"" in the middle of the Mexican desert. I assume Leone uses a dart board in casting. Again, in this movie, the people act in a manner that is way beyond the extent of my imagination. The mayhem is without concern or remorse, and wholly gratuitous. There is no humor in the film.<br/><br/>But, worst of all, Leone must send someone to the record store, to pick out a music score, without telling them what kind of movie it is. The music is so intensively and continuously inappropriate that it is too much to have occurred by accident. The music in the other spaghettis was bad; but, this one is awful--so awful as to be a complete distraction.<br/><br/>I always check the duration of a movie; but, tonight I forgot. I was sure it was two hours. But when an additional half hour almost flew by, I checked. This monstrosity appears to have left nothing on the cutting room floor, and it runs, with voluminous AMC commercials, to 3 hours and 15 minutes.<br/><br/>As a consequence, I will never know the ending; but, it will be tragic, for the characters and the audience.

"mentalcritic","8","4","8","24 February 2005"," A step back for Leone
","Fresh off his artistic success with C'era una volta il West, Sergio Leone began to create another ""trilogy"", of which Giù la testa is supposedly the middle chapter. Unfortunately for Giù la testa, it never really comes close to the dizzying heights Leone reached with C'era una volta il West. Which is a pity, because C'era una volta il West is a timeless classic that, in one ten-second shot, slaps the viewer in the face so hard their eyes will rattle for weeks after the fact. Indeed, Giù la testa marks the first Leone film I watched while doing other things where I was more engrossed by those other things. I therefore have little apprehension about labelling it as Leone's weakest work, although his weakest is still far above the strongest of some directors I might mention.<br/><br/>At its heart, Giù la testa is a comment about the effects revolutions have on ordinary, regular people. It depicts two men, a Mexican tribe leader of some sort, and an Irish terrorist. After demonstrating his ability with explosives to the Mexican leader, the Irishman is co-opted into serving the Mexican's political goals. It is here where Giù la testa starts to get muddy. The exact cause of the Mexicans is never fully established, and who they are fighting against is hard to figure out, too. In later sequences, we see an army that looks vaguely German, but we're never quite sure exactly why they are fighting these Mexicans. There does not seem to be enough explanation.<br/><br/>Another weakness of Giù la testa is the truly abominable score music. During any scene in which the Irishman has a flashback to his past in the UK, we hear repetitive vocals that we are to believe are Irish/Celtic in nature. What they really are, other than dated beyond belief, is annoying. They sound more like something one would hear in a trashy 1960s sitcom such as Gidget. That's not to say the score is all bad. There are some themes that suit the on screen action well, but this is hardly what we could call Ennio Morricone's best work. Especially not after the aforementioned C'era una volta il West. Indeed, the ""keep your loving brother happy"" scene haunts memories thanks in no small part to the droning guitar sound of the score. Giù la testa has no such moments, although it does have a missed opportunity in its place.<br/><br/>Like all Sergio Leone films, the big strength of Giù la testa is in the cinematography. There was a reason why the 2.35:1 frame was invented, and it was Sergio Leone. Some have come close to matching his sense of scene composition, but none have consistently performed photographic miracles like Leone. Leone is a stunning example of why Pan And Scan should be outlawed under penalty of death by being cut in half. Other minor strengths include a very calm, balanced performance from James Coburn, who took the role because Henry Fonda told him that Leone was the greatest director that he (Fonda) had ever worked with. High praise indeed, given that Fonda had worked on around seventy films at the time C'era una volta il West was released.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Leone would return to form with the third installment of his ""three historical periods which toughed America"" trilogy, namely Once Upon A Time In America. But lest anyone think I feel this film is all bad, let me reiterate that if every director's off-days were like Leone's, Hollywood would be facing much less derision. Giù la testa, for all its flaws, earns a solid eight out of ten from me. Three of those points are for the cinematography."
"bkoganbing","5","6","14","1 October 2008"," ""Hey Firecracker""
","Duck, You Sucker which is the title of this film that I first saw it under takes place in revolutionary Mexico of the teen years of the last century. It's a time we've become somewhat familiar with in America due to films like Viva Zapata and any number of films about Pancho Villa. This film is not quite as good as Viva Zapata however.<br/><br/>It's from the guy who made the spaghetti western and Clint Eastwood popular in the USA, Sergio Leone and stars Rod Steiger and James Coburn and a cast of unknown Europeans mostly Italian. Coburn plays an Irish Revolutionary who's finding things a bit hot over in Ireland with His Majesty's Home Office breathing down hard in search of him. He's an explosives expert, hence the name Steiger gives him of firecracker. Coburn is almost, not quite as laconic as when he was in The Magnificent Seven and was the one with the least amount of dialog.<br/><br/>That's all right because Steiger more than makes up for it. I'm sure Rod wasn't given all that much direction by Leone as to character. So he does the next best thing, he bellows his way through the film when he's not dispatching members of the upper classes into the next world with abandon. The two form an unlikely partnership and strike many a blow for liberation of the masses before one of them is killed. And they do look like they're having fun while doing it.<br/><br/>There's nothing much more to tell about Duck, You Sucker. It's got the same look and feel as all those Clint Eastwood films Leone did. In fact that's my main problem, the man is great at creating atmosphere and does wonders with a camera. But he's no actor's director. It's why his films are so short on words.<br/><br/>But I'm one who thinks Italians ought to stick to grand opera as the art form they do best because it's their culture and leave westerns to Americans. But some folks like Sergio Leone and if you do I'm sure you'll like Duck, You Sucker more than me."

","Many truly epic scenes that could easily have been made into a very excellent movie. It needed a better ending. The ending could have been very quick and satisfying. Lose all the background music and start over with one guitar, maybe. There are periods of comedy in the movie and some great scenes with probably thousands of extras, but every time it starts to get good the director inserts some slow motion flashback that is of no value to the audience. Coburn and Steiger are good but they do not need the accents. The close ups of eyes is overdone as one would expect in a spaghetti western. If one half hour was cut from this film and good background music was written this would be an Academy Award contender."

","God! If I read one more review if this film describing it as too slow or that ""I didn't understand the mood change from comic to serious"" one more time, I will put my foot through the computer screen.<br/><br/>If you want the director to spoon feed you and explain every twist & turn or signpost every plot point in bright red neon, then go and watch some of the derivative rubbish (Transformers, Spider-man 23, Die Hard 45)they often churn out nowadays and avoid this.<br/><br/>Leave everyone else to enjoy a challenging, thought-provoking and intelligent film that allows us to think for ourselves rather than having everything explained to us.<br/><br/>One of my favourite parts of this film is when Sean (or John) is about to blow the bridge to slow down the oncoming troops. In the build up to the explosion the music adopts an almost jolly, yet slightly ironic tone as Sean (James Coburn) stuffs cotton wool into his ears. The almost jazz-style piano figure pauses briefly as the explosives plunger is depressed and the mother of all explosions occurs (to the surprise of the actors as well, judging by Coburn's reaction).<br/><br/>This tremendous explosion and the subsequent massacre of the Mexican troops by both Sean & Juan's machine gun fire is accompanied by a soaring, beautiful score by Morricone. The staggering beauty of Morricone's score coupled with the savage massacre occurring at the same time is a brilliant, oddly moving experience that grabs you by the throat. I challenge any viewer not to be moved emotionally by this scene...it is simply genius! A work of true brilliance......highly recommended!"

","This was showing on ITV4 this week, I taped it off the TV years ago, lost track of the tape, and sort of forgot the movie existed. I'm glad to say it was as good as I remember it being, and Morricone's soundtrack is an absolute cracker, one of his best and featuring a lot of choir work, electronic effects, etc. Watching it now, it's clearly a Tarantino favourite and there's bits of it in most of his work. It's probably ignored today because it doesn't quite fit in with Leone's other work of the period- the dollars movies, etc, and doesn't have the usual cast ensemble, but despite his dodgy Irish accent which seems to come and go throughout the movie James Coburn (John) carries it off well, and Rod Steiger (Juan) gets away with it too, despite unfeasibly good teeth in the many close-ups. Highlights? The awesome floating banner appearing above John's head when Juan has the revaluation that he is the key to robbing the bank. The firing squad scene, with the imagery lifted from the Goya painting and combined with the soundtrack and the close ups of Coburn is one of Leone's crowning moments, and the whole movie is probably the best cinematography Leone ever did. Watch it, you won't be disappointed."
"MovieButts","8","2","3","17 June 2019"," Zany, Emotional & A lot of fun. But a little long in the tooth.
","From the opening scene you can tell that Leone wasn't meant to be the director of this movie. Why you ask? Because a lot of the image compositions are off the wall. In some cases improvisation can lead to a mixed bag of results. In this case it comes out as one of Leone's Most experimental. From the choice of shots, The tone and of Course Morricone's extremely underrated score; Giù la testa is a real treat for fans of the craft.<br/><br/>If you were going in expecting a film about the Mexican revolution I think thats where you may be let down by this film. This film is self professed above everything about friendship. The two leads of Juan & John are the focus, the revolution was always meant to be an interesting background for an age old tale.<br/><br/>My only real issue with the film is its length. Now don't get me wrong I love the long ponderous scenes where two people are together and happy to sit in silence. I think these moments are where the mad cap score of Morricone's really hits the heart. Unfortunately for me the film hits its emotional climax about 25mins from the end. A place where I would have left the film satisfied. I do not have an issue with the ending or resolution I just think that this restored version may have left this film a little too long in the tooth.<br/><br/>Its not a perfect film, however I think most of its flaws are more charming than detrimental. And as a result this is my favourite Leone. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see the result of an artist trying to combine having fun with emotional resonance.<br/><br/>8/10"
"mark.waltz","8","2","3","9 November 2016"," You get two revolutions for the price of one.
","My first spaghetti western is a classic, one that seems long by looking at the running time, but grabs you immediately and does not let go. A Mexican bandit hooks up with an Irish revolutionary and gets more than he bargained for as he ends up becoming a hero to his own people reluctantly, not even wanting to be. At first glance, Rod Steiger seems an odd choice to play the Mexican, but he is not only convincing, but extremely funny and likable even playing a rather disreputable character. Teamed with James Coburn, he's fiery, while Coburn is passionate but subtle as the Irish revolutionary who shows him more than a thing or two about carrying a fistful of dynamite.<br/><br/>The film starts off with Steiger as a passenger in the carriage heading over the Mexican wilderness, and the sudden arrival of Steiger's familia, presented in a way that is fast, furious and funny! Yes, it's violent and cruel, ending up with surviving naked men and one scantily clothed woman heading back in the wilderness with the open wagon suddenly tossing them over, a symbolism of the ghastly poor getting it over on the cruel and idle rich. But then along comes Coburn as a man on his own mission, telling Steiger and the gang, ""Duck, you sucker"", blowing things up in the cleverest of ways.<br/><br/>If other spaghetti westerns are as entertaining as this, I'm about to go on a spree, especially those directed by Sergio Leone. I'm glad that Clint Eastwood is not in this one, having pretty much been a part of the beginning of the genre, but not right for any of the roles here. Steiger and Coburn are as different as can be, but they play off of each other nicely. This is an exciting adventure and buddy film that brings two culturally different men together to share common ideals that may seem foreign to the common man not into fighting a revolution, but remaining potent and stirring nearly 50 years later."
"Leofwine_draca","8","2","3","16 July 2016"," Two and a half hours of gritty war action
","Sergio Leone's unfairly maligned fifth western is at least equal to his earlier films, if not scaling the epic heights of his masterpieces. We're in familiar territory with the story of two men, the opposites of each other, who team up as unlikely partners and end up getting involved in something far beyond their reaches. Unlike his earlier Eastwood westerns, Leone's film is far more reaching and personal than before, and with a darker edge. It's also his most political film, as it charts the struggle between the army and the revolutionaries. Once again it's perfectly made, with a great evocative Morricone soundtrack, and uses extreme close-ups and the like for style. Don't go expecting any stand-offs, however, as this is more of a war film, and has great scenes like Steiger and Coburn taking on the brunt of the German army alone in the mountains.<br/><br/>Rod Steiger takes the lead role of the Mexican bandit, playing much the same part as Eli Wallach would have done. He really seems to be putting his all into the role and having a good time, and his spirit rubs off. All this and he has an accent similar to the one Pacino uses in SCARFACE. James Coburn is his complete opposite, an Irish (!) IRA member who is an expert in all things explosive. The two make a real fiery partnership and a supported by a strong Italian cast, once again. Cult favourite David Warbeck pops up in a small but key role in flashbacks as a friend of Coburn's.<br/><br/>The action scenes are violent without being excessive (like in a Peckinpah film), taking things one step further from Leone's previous work. Times have changed so the film has a harder, rougher edge, almost nihilistic in feel. There are some impressive explosions to note as well, and exploitation fans will be surprised to see Antonio Margheriti (one of my favourite Italian directors) listed in the crew as the special effects man. A miniature train crash is unmistakably his work. While being a technically-proficient piece of work, A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE also has important questions to ask the audience which elevates it above similar B-movie fare, and flies by at a mere two-and-a-half hour running time."
"Tweekums","8","2","3","3 June 2016"," A Fistful of Dynamite
","Set during the Mexican Revolution in 1913, Juan Miranda isn't too worried about politics so long as there are valuables to be stolen. Shortly after robbing a stage coach he and his family cross paths with John Mallory, an Irish terrorist on the run who just happens to be an explosives expert. John tells him that he is going to work at a local silver mine but Juan has other ideas with John's help he thinks he can rob the bank in Mesa Verde; something he has dreamt since he was a youngster. John isn't so keen but ultimately the pair end up in Mesa Verde and attack the bank only to discover that there isn't a single peso inside; its vaults are instead being used to house political prisoners. This is the first of many major confrontations with the authorities and reprisals are inevitable by the end Juan isn't so worried about getting rich but by getting even.<br/><br/>This is another solid western from Sergio Leone; as one would expect there are some good laughs to be had; it is also its serious moments though the film doesn't shy away from showing some brutal moments; most notably when large numbers of people are gunned down by the soldiers. It isn't totally on-sided though; soldiers are gunned down and blown up by the protagonists in situations where they don't have a chance. There is plenty of action in the film's two and a half hour run time as well as some deliberately slow moments. Leone makes good use of the Spanish desert as a substitute for Mexico. Rod Steiger does a great job as Juan; it is hard to believe he is the same actor who appeared in 'In the Heat of the Night' thanks to the totally different accent and a scruffy beard. He is ably supported by James Coburn, who plays John. Overall I'd certainly recommend this even if it isn't quite as entertaining as Leone's best known westerns; it is a shame this one isn't better known."

","In Revolutionary Mexico, Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) boards a passing coach. He is constantly insulted by the rich passengers for being a peasant. The coach is stopped by bandits and Miranda turns out to be their ruthless leader. John H. Mallory (James Coburn) passes by on his motorcycle. The explosive expert is an Irish Republican wanted by the British government. Miranda is awestruck by his explosives and sees him as the key to breaking into the Mesa Verde National Bank. To Miranda's horror, the money is not there and all he finds are political prisoners. He becomes an unintentional revolutionary hero.<br/><br/>First, let's talk about the title. I like the Dynamite title which would work better as a sequel. The Duck title is stupid and relegates it to a bad B-movie. It's not necessarily the best line anyways. It stuck out like a sore thumb in the movie. It sounds like a TV edit for Duck, You Fcker. The Once title fits the Leone trilogy but it should be called Once Upon a Time in Mexico. The movie's main drawback may be that the bridge is actually its high point in terms of violence and dramatic flourish. It's those two men against the world. It's visually compelling. It doesn't get better than that. Certainly, the train explosion looks very miniature. I wonder why they couldn't do an actual derailment since the train wreckage seems to be very vast. Maybe it's an old wreckage. At least, the bridge demolition looks very real and very amazing. The actors are good. I like Steiger. There is a mixture of humor and violence. It's a Sergio Leone special."

Coburn may read Bakunin, but he is haunted by the violence of the Easter Rebellion. Steiger is driven by the desire for wealth, but he doesn't want to destroy the world he has grown up in, he wants to be part of it.

The same (censored) thing starts all over again!""<br/><br/>From the very beginning, the film will shamelessly attract your attention. It is opened by the close-up of the urine stream, drowning insects on the tree. Close-up shots on details, especially the face and eyes, are a kind of trademark of Sergio Leone, and he uses them skillfully and frequently to show the atmosphere and more accurately depict the psychological state of his characters. For the fifth consecutive time, music was entrusted to the legendary Ennio Morricone, but it is so different from the music in the previous films that by style I would never have thought that Morricone was in question. Moreover, it did not fit in with the movie, and it irritated me so much that I was tempted to watch the film without sound.<br/><br/>This time, instead of a gunslinger, the main character is an explosive specialist, an Irish revolutionary who is forced to leave his homeland, and goes to join the revolutionaries in Mexico. Along the way, he meets Mexican bandit and tricks him into joining him and helping the cause. Although it definitely is Western, this film greatly differs from the classic representatives of the genre, because it is also socially and politically colored war drama, as well as a psychological study of morality, family, friendship and searching for oneself. The presence of humor somewhat dilutes the rather heavy atmosphere of the film and makes it, in my opinion, much more relaxed than this story deserves, but also significantly more fun.<br/><br/>The biggest drawbacks of this film are John's flashbacks, which, although they support the characterization of his character, completely derail the movie from its path, and the last one, in my opinion, is unnecessarily disgusting and more appropriate to some pathetic romantic drama than the war western, as well as totally inappropriate music, which may not be bad in itself, but it does not fit in this movie. If not for flashbacks and music, this movie would stand shoulder to shoulder with other Leone's masterpieces, but these two flaws totally ruined the overall impression.<br/><br/>7,5/10"
"sharky_55","8","1","1","23 February 2016"," Duck, you sucker!
","This is not a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. Instead of a nameless stranger wandering into some town in the west and gunning away all his problems, we open on a naive Mexican peeing into the ground and playing his dumbstruck role quite well. We can tell by the way the camera focuses in extreme close-up on the beady eyes and mouths sloppily consuming food of the high class passengers of the carriage that Juan is fiercely envious and furious at the state of affairs. And their dialogue confirms it too, mocking and racist, and he is forced to goofily play along so he can take his revenge. Later on, he has a passionate monologue about his distastes for revolutionaries and the thinly veiled false promises they deliver, but somehow gets swept up in one anyway. It is unusual for Leone to be political; one might suggest that he finds a common view in Sean Mallory, the jaded, cynical Irishman who has experienced betrayal in his homeland and wants to create change elsewhere. The events bring these two unlikely characters together. <br/><br/>There are arguably more visual flourishes than ever before. Leone has always let his images tell the story; it helps when your main characters talks more with his gun and hat then with his clipped, minimalistic dialogue. This is more of the same. There is that infamous moment where Juan connects the dots and sees the criminal potential in Sean's explosives expertise, and Leone highlights this with a cartoonish, flashing banner above his head like a casino neon sign screaming 'Jackpot'. When he first arrives at the famed Mesa Verde National Bank, his eyes light up and Morricone adds this dramatic organ piece that seems fit for a lavish cathedral. It is as if the riches that lay waiting inside attain an almost religious type of love and desire - he wrings his hands like a giddy child discovering a stash of candy. And Leone as always loves his zoom in closeups - he lets his actors freely emote, especially in the eyes - there's that great shot of Juan peering out from the slit in the poster, with a premonition of his future choices. <br/><br/>But as they get deeper and deeper into the revolution, it becomes clear that things are not what they seem, and their choices have morphed into bigger and more dangerous consequences. After a thrilling large- scale action sequence that involved blowing up an actual bridge, they return to find their families and comrades slaughtered and there is this long, moody period where the characters are silently grieving. Early Leone would not find the time for this. There is also Sean's flashbacks which have a hazy, dreamlike quality - they litter the film throughout and continually haunt his memories (perhaps at times lingering a tad too long), whereas previously they had been mostly a technique used to boost the intensity of the climatic encounter. In one moment, they hit Sean with such startling potency that the edits hammer into him like the rattle of a machine gun. And there is darkness and edge to their actions that seems so far removed from the sun-baked plains of the western; a grim execution by firing squad in the rainy night that reminds me of Goya's The Third of May 1808, while our pair watches from afar. This sort of helplessness is something that Leone had not always considered for his heroes (or at least, anti-heroes). Eastwood had carried with him an air of coolness and invincibility. <br/><br/>It certainly is stylish and a lot of fun. We chuckle along every time Sean walks away with a swagger and utters those titular lines. Morricone's soundtrack is walking the same walk - there is no twisting flute or cacophony of whistles to accompany that lone figure on the plains. The heavy bass-line of 'Invention of John' over the opening credits seems to be constantly building towards a climax, like a cowboy strutting his step. He isn't afraid to juxtapose mass murder with these stirring strings - it is a victory, but at what cost, and for what gain? As I watched this, I was asked by a young friend whether they were the good guys or the bad guys. It seems to be a moral quandary that never really is broached. Is revolution stylish and elegant, or is it a brutal act of violence? Can we blame Juan for getting so caught up in these events, just after he rants about the impossibilities of revolution? Maybe he should have ducked and not let his sense of responsibility get the better of him, else he finds himself an unanswerable question at the end of the film."
"ironhorse_iv","7","4","9","11 February 2016"," For the most part, it was a dynamite film! Yet, there were a few duds in it as well.
","Made after the success of the 'The Dollars trilogy', (1964's A Fistful of Dollars, 1965's For a Few Dollars More and 1966'sThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and a few years after one- off success of 1968's 'Once Upon a Time in the West', 'Duck! You Sucker!' was director Sergio Leone's last Spaghetti western. It was, as well, one of his most overlooked films. I think, one of the reasons why this movie didn't really shine and became an overnight success, was because, of the odd title. Known as 'Giu La Testa'(Keep your head down') in Italy, the title didn't really translate well with the American audience. For me, 'Duck! You Sucker!' sounds more like a Blaxploitation movie, than a Spaghetti Western. It's sound too cartoony. Because of that, I really didn't like the title. I'm one of those critics; that agrees with the studio. They should had retitling the film. They should had changed it to 'A Fistful of Dynamite'. That title works so much better, because how much this story, remind us, of Leone's older films, while, also giving us, something new. Better yet, I would rather see the movie be call, by its French title, 'Once Upon a Time in a Revolution', because it match so well with Sergio Leone's other 'Once Upon a Time' films. Though, all of those 'Once' films, widely differ in location, character and time periods, the recurrent themes of time and memory, plays a big part of these films. Not only that, Leone's style alters sharply here. It's here, where you see his bitter metamorphosis from Spaghetti Western to gritty post-modern Polizieschi crime drama. In scope, Sergio knew, times were indeed changing. Audience weren't as interested in Westerns, anymore. Sergio was able to show, with this Zapata film, in a metaphor way. He shows that the 19th century, primitive frontier life was indeed dying, to make way, for the 20th century, complex, and post-industrial revolution life. The way, he use weapons like dynamite, trains, machine guns, and tanks as a metaphor to bring the end of western is haunting. It's scary, when you think, deep around it. After all, a lot of his dark imagery here, remind us, way too much of massive World Wars imagery that later would come alive. Still, it wasn't that dark, there were a lot of cool, bloodless action moments, extreme close-ups, semi smart dialogue, great epic scope in cinematography, and funny moments to make it, a more rounded picture. Also, the moody soundtrack by composter Ennio Morricone was beautiful and simply wonderful to listen to. It match the film, so well. Set during the Mexico Revolution of the 1910s, the film tells the story of Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger), an amoral Mexican outlaw, and John Mallory (James Coburn), an ex-Irish Republican revolutionary, trying to rob a bank, only to find themselves, accidentally and involuntarily becoming heroes of the Revolution. I love the allegory that Leone is using with these two main protagonists. Miranda is the old, Mexican bandit unaware that his era is almost over. And then we have Mallory as the 20th Century bandit, unaware where his love for technology is going to take him. While, it's might be hard to cheer, for two main characters who are technically murderers, rapist, and terrorists. At least, the movie gives them, enough positive depth and character development to overlook their dark side and faults. However, it's hard to understand what motivates them to do what, they do, since both Mallory and Miranda hates revolutions. Despite that, both actors in this movie were amazing in their roles. James Coburn is able to show how haunted, his character was, with his past, while also dreaming of living the American Dream. I love the scene where he was in the pub, looking at the mirror at his betrayer. Very moving. Then you got Rod Steiger, who pretty much seem like a real-life Mexican bandit. Despite the fact that he is playing off, a carbon copy of the Tuco's buffoon type character from 1966's 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. He was still able to pull this off with his strict method acting. After all, the character was originally written for actor, Eli Wallach, instead of him. Lucky for him, Eli Wallach drop out, during the early stages of production. That wasn't the only time, he got lucky. The studio save him, a second time, when Leone wanted to replace him, with Wallach, after they butt-heads over Steiger demands on Leone to film his scenes with natural sound. Once again, Steiger won out, and Wallach was cause to subsequently sued, when Wallach had to dropped out of the other project when Leone promise him, the role. While, Steiger and Leone didn't get along, I thought, personally, that he had great screen chemistry with his co-star, James Coburn. Both, seem to work best with each other. However, other than them. Most of the supporting characters were very bland and underdeveloped. Another conflict, I had with the movie is the pacing. Like, any other of Sergio Leone's movies, this movie also suffers from a long seat. It was slow and tedious, at parts. 157 is a lot of minutes sit through. I know, not all U.S versions of this movie has that long of a run-time, but most modern DVDs has this same copy, in which I watch this film. All, I know, about the other copies, is that it's 22 minutes, shorter with awkward editing. The ending is also disappointing. Without spoiling it, it's bittersweet, at best, but also a bit anti-climax. Overall: I wouldn't call this my favorite Leone film, but it's still worth checking out. There's just something very appealing about it. Check it out, if you want. Just note, it does have problems."

","Warning, spoilers<br/><br/>Leone once described his feelings for this film as those of a father towards a disabled child. It's a movie with some interesting political themes about the futile way revolutions beget other revolutions, but don't expect any answers!<br/><br/>A great moment comes near the start when, out of the smoke of a bomb blast, James Coburn rides into view on a motorbike. It is the first time we have seen a petrol-fuelled vehicle in a Leone film, and it marks his goodbye to the horseriders of the western.<br/><br/>Rod Steiger, with an even more outrageous accent than usual (The Specialist, anyone?), picks up where Tuco left off in Good,Bad,Ugly. We see the film through his dumb eyes, and there are some standout scenes, especially the sparring between him and Coburn which is great to watch.<br/><br/>Morricone's music is woefully undervalued here (eclipsed by his other western themes). It's quirky, moving and downright cool in places. I challenge anyone to watch the whole build up to the bank robbery set-piece (with the little boy and the train) and not be riveted by the music and editing. (And I'm sure Goldfrapp lifted half the tunes for her albums!)<br/><br/>Other set-pieces - Steiger speech about revolutions, the bridge massacre, Steiger's discovery of his dead family, the shocking mass graves, and Coburn's nitro glycerine antics (literally a walking bomb) are among Leone's best work.<br/><br/>There is alot of humour and fun in the first half, which gives way to pathos and scenes of brutality in the second as Steiger's character finds himself a reluctant hero of the bloody Mexican revolution.<br/><br/>It is not a perfect film - it has MANY flaws. Structurally it has big problems (but i do hear rumours of a special edition somewhere). That aside, it is quite haunting once you have seen it - especially as a kid. I also don't think it is a film you will necessarily enjoy/get first time around. However, wait a few years then see it again - trust me it'll be worth it!<br/><br/>It's also good to see its growing influence upon films today - ""Three Kings"" being a recent example.<br/><br/>Leone was an amazing filmmaker, and this film contains his best and worst. The film also has more resonance now in the current political climate - the ""terrorist or revolutionary"" question is neatly left for you to decide.<br/><br/>

"Rogermex","10","3","6","30 May 2016"," An epic adventure, and a very dark, wonderful drama.
","This is one of Sergio Leone's great masterpieces, maybe third in rank after ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America. ""But please don't consider it ""third rate"" - if you value Leone, you will be blown away.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Mexico during their revolution. James Coburn,in probably his greatest role, is a dynamite expert who flashes back traumatically to his past as a revolutionary in Ireland. Though Coburn is amazing, Rod Steiger is his equal as a Mexican bandit with his own views about revolution. In fact, in one moment of rage, Steiger's character ""Juan"" sums up ""revolution"" so effectively that""John"" (Coburn) tosses his copy of Bakhunin into the mud.<br/><br/>The cinematography is fantastic, the music by Ennio Morricone (what else to say). The staging of the scenes is magisterial, ala Leone.<br/><br/>Essential to the story is the theme of betrayal and the karma of betrayal, both on a personal and political level, which enriches the depth. It has some of the most horrendous images of counterrevolutionary mass slaughter and political execution you might see.<br/><br/>It conveys very well that if you are up against a fascist (""Nazi"") - you know what you do? You kill the mofo.<br/><br/>There are scenes of tragic sadness, and there is, all the way through, great humor.<br/><br/>Leone's facial close-ups are used very effectively, most especially in the flashback scenes to betrayal in Ireland. Do NOT MISS the extremely subtle eye-gaze movements in those scenes, they are absolutely crucial!<br/><br/>I watched this film on the big screen many years ago, and just viewed it online again today. I have never forgotten it, it is seared in memory.<br/><br/>Got a light? ""Duck, You Sucker!"""

","I had just purchased and watched the film, Duck, you Sucker and it really wasn't what I had expected. It was signature Leone, but held an almost dark mysteriousness to it. The comedic moments are frequent in the first half, but as you get closer to the ending, the rampant emotion leaves you in very solemn mood. It was great overall, not as long as I was expecting either, but that is what I love about Leone's films, the patience. All acting was great, and the music (allthough you cant beat ""ecstasy of gold"" in GBU) was pretty good. The explosions were epic and the scenes memorable. It is now a favorite but don't expect a ""feel good"" movie, whatever that is.<br/><br/>oh yeah, take note of steigers performance and think about pacino in scarface. ring a bell?

"vaughan-birbeck","Null","3","6","24 February 2004"," A descending spiral of violence [SPOILERS]
","As other reviewers have noted this is a great Leone film. For too long it has been in the shadow of the 'Dollars' Westerns. With some restored footage the story now makes more sense and the mood of the piece has become clearer.<br/><br/>The film appears to start as broad comedy, with the robbery of a luxurious stagecoach, but there are dark undertones even here. As the passengers describe Juan (Rod Steiger) as an animal they stuff their mouths with rich food and wine (in wonderfully revolting extreme close-up), revealing their own base natures. Soon the passengers (including a Catholic Bishop) are stripped of all symbols of their status and dumped naked into a pig pen.<br/><br/>A massive explosion announces the arrival of Sean (James Coburn). Juan sees Sean as a magician, a partner sent by Providence to help him achieve his life's ambition: to rob the Banco Nacional at Mesa Verde. Sean won't join forces with a 'chicken thief'. A tit-for-tat battle of explosives and guns again seems light-hearted. Eventually Sean wearily agrees to help Juan 'get inside' the bank. What Juan doesn't know is that the bank is now a prison. He finds no money but frees plenty of political prisoners and becomes a 'great, grand, glorious hero' of the Revolution. From being a happy-go-lucky bandit Juan is now committed politically.<br/><br/>It's at this point that the mood of the film changes. We have seen some evidence of the Revolution in Mesa Verde: martial law and a small execution squad. As the film progresses the Revolution becomes an impersonal killing machine: Juan's children are murdered; Sean refers to a body of soldiers he intends to kill as 'a few uniforms', their individual identity is lost; a Revolutionary leader betrays his people who are executed in their dozens; towards the end of the film thousands are being slaughtered in huge pits by soldiers using machine-guns and rifles. The amusing earlier scenes are a distant memory.<br/><br/>It is this change of mood that makes the film I know as 'A Fistful of Dynamite' so powerful. The flashbacks in which Sean remembers his younger self enjoying life with a good friend and a beautiful girl extend the themes of disillusion and betrayal that are played out in detail in the main story.<br/><br/>
At the end Juan is left totally alone, his children are dead, his closest friend is dead, all he has left is a life of mourning and regrets. This is a bleak ending to a very pessimistic view of the corruption and loss of ideals, and the unbreakable cycle of brutality that always seems to follow when we listen to 'the people who read the books'."

What on Earth were they thinking? If they ditched that tune and put some simple guitar music in there, it might actually improve the tone of the entire film for the better. To be honest, because it's Leone and because of the rating here, I thought it would be great and I was severely disappointed.<br/><br/>It was way too slow, way too long, too many close-ups, bad casting and the score, oh God, just no.

Highly recommended for fans of the western genre - one with an Italian/Mexican spin."
"MartinHafer","7","2","4","23 March 2013"," I felt I was watching a film by the other Sergio.
","""Duck, You Sucker"" (aka, ""Fistful of Dynamite"") is a film directed by Sergio Leone with music by Ennio Morricone--the same team that brought some amazing Italian westerns to the screen--such as ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). However, here the film is very different--and it felt like I was watching a film by the other but less well known 'spaghetti western' director, Sergio Carbucci. That's because most of Carbucci's westerns have a strong revolutionary bent and usually are about Mexico during the time of their revolution against Diaz in the early 20th century. His heroes are revolutionaries--ones with a strong political agenda at the onset or ones who develop ideals through the course of the film. This is EXACTLY what happens in ""Duck, You Sucker""--and it really seemed odd for Leone. Not bad necessarily--just quite odd with its socialist/Marxist tone.<br/><br/>The film stars James Coburn as an IRA terrorist who somehow has made it to Mexico--along with all his explosives. It also stars Rod Steiger in an odd role, though Steiger loved doing strange roles that tested his range. Here, he's sort of like a mob leader and family patriarch rolled into one. He is the character who evolves (like Carbucci's heroes) from a common thug to a revolutionary during the film.<br/><br/>So, did I like it? Well, not especially--though it's certainly better than the average western. The problem for me is that Leone set the bar so high with ""Fistful of Dollars"", ""For a Few Dollars More"", ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West""! These are probably the four greatest Italian westerns--all by one director! But, because these films were so good, ""Duck, You Sucker"" can't help but disappoint. Good, but certainly not in the same category as these other films--mostly because the pacing was slow (even compared to the above movies), Steiger's accent (according to IMDb it was dubbed) and odd chemistry make this good but no more."

","I've seen all of Leone's films including 'Colossus of Rhoades' which is actually a better film than this one. 'Sucker' is bloated, has a meandering plot that limps to a resolution of sorts. There is no central antagonist or specific challenge for these characters per se. It's all rather vague.<br/><br/>Morricone's music has it's moments & while I don't think it's a terrible soundtrack it's numbingly repetitive, overused to the point of irritation at times.<br/><br/>The Flashbacks work to a degree but remain amorphous & offer not much in terms of backstory or character development. I get that Coburn pines for that time & this woman & his friend., betrayal is a part of this but nothing is made very clear or compelling.<br/><br/>Coburn & Steger are respectfully fine on their roles. No other characters are built into any kind of reality, thus interest falters due to lack of any attempt for instilling character background or motivation or connection to the central protagonists in any of these characters.<br/><br/>Leone made some great films., 'For a Few Dollars More' IMO being his best western, lean, mean & full of style, action & outrageous / enjoyable characters. This is the director attempting to stretch a bit with a political message & characters than perhaps evolve more as people. Problem is, Leone was better dealing with archtypes and mythology.<br/><br/>I just ordered this on DVD because I am a Leone fan., as well as a fan of Coburn & Steiger and there are numerous individual moments I really enjoy., the stand-out is Steiger's speech concerning the 'revolution' when he say 'my family is my country' he rejects all political manifestos., to which I heartily agree.<br/><br/>Now, this is not a film I'd recommended to a neophyte coming into Leone or Italian westerns in general because it reflects very little of the best that Italian westerns offered as well as what Leone offered in terms of his unigue style.<br/><br/>You want enjoyable then watch either of the other Sergios: Corbucci or Solima both these directors were more consistently entertaining in terms of pure cinema & they knew how to build characters & have them evolve. Leone's real skills were in his visual prowess & myth making abilities., best enjoyed in his earlier westerns."

","Also known as both 'Duck You Sucker' and 'Once Upon A Time... The Revolution' depending on territory and, even, theatrical run, 'A Fistful Of Dynamite (1971)' is probably Leone's most overlooked movie - aside from, perhaps, his first, 'The Colossus Of Rhodes (1961)'. It's by no means inferior to his other work, however. Set during the Mexican revolution near the turn of the twentieth century, the piece uses its time-period to portray Leone's underlying thesis that revolution is inherently violent. It follows two men who become caught up in the conflict and form a friendship along the way, with this dynamic being the driving force behind most of the narrative. The initially rather unlikable characters soon start to become rather empathetic, and their shared adventure becomes increasingly engaging as it goes on. At least in its full version, it's often an almost sentimental affair - especially during its slow-motion, near ethereal flashbacks. It's also a very brutal one, with plenty of mass shootings and pseudo war sequences. It almost revels in the destruction it sees on screen and it's as big an event as you'd expect. Yet, it doesn't quite feel like anything the director has done before. The picture is, essentially, a series of set-pieces that escalate until the narrative crescendos with its most personal, though still explosive, moment. It's unsurprisingly well-made and features yet another excellent score from Morricone, too. In the end, the movie is an entertaining time right the way through. 7/10"

","Another wonderfully ground-breaking western from Sergio Leone with a memorable score from Ennio Morricone - this time with Rod Steiger as a bit of a low life bandit who encounters James Coburn - a IRA explosives expert on the run from the British. The story is told in tandem timelines as we discover just what brought Coburn to revolutionary Mexico in the first place and the current scenario as he and Steiger gradually develop their relationship from potential bank robbers to something way more sophisticated and inter-reliant. Along the way we've got plenty of humour, action - explosives galore - with some fine photography of the locale. At times, it can be a little too unnecessarily violent - particularly once they become more involved in the revolution; but Steiger and Coburn are great."

","Sergio Leone is a giant went it come to westerns but he only directed seven films. Three of which I have watched over and over throughout my lifetime. They were the ones with Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>A Fistful of Dynamite was released in 1971. It was his only movie he made in the 70s. His next release and final film would be the gangster movie, Once Upon a Time in America.<br/><br/>This movie in a sense is a bridge from his spaghetti westerns to the flawed gangster epic he made in the 1984.<br/><br/>The movie opens with crude amoral Mexican bandit Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) robbing wealthy passengers on a train and raping a woman which is done in a slightly comedic style. Once Upon a Time in America features one of the most disturbing rape scenes of 1980s cinema.<br/><br/>Set in 1913 with Mexico in the midst of revolution. Juan cares little about politics, he wants to rob for money. When he meets laconic but haunted IRA explosive expert John Mallory (James Coburn.) Juan seizes a chance to rob a bank.<br/><br/>However the bank is being used as a prison and Juan inadvertently ends up being a hero of the revolution as hundreds of political prisoners are freed.<br/><br/>A Fistful of Dynamite is an overblown and erratic Zapata western.

","The cover of this DVD gives the incorrect impression that ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" is a comedy. There are comic elements in the movie but the overall it is a fine multi-layered story. <br/><br/>Rod Steiger plays a Mexican bandit who dreams of robbing a large bank. When he meets an Irish explosives expert (James Coburn) working in Mexico he sees his chance to bring his dreams to reality. However the country is in the throes of a revolution and both their plans are changed forever by the intrusion of this conflict. <br/><br/>The film features some typical Leone touches such as a long opening scene with a surprise twist and an Ennio Morricone score. The film is over two and a half hours long but apart from one sequence it doesn't feel too long as the plot twists and turns with plenty of action sequences as well. There some interesting themes explored such as friendship, loyalty, treachery and sacrifice. <br/><br/>There were some parts of the movie I didn't enjoy as much. The score is a bit annoying at times (the ""Sean Sean Sean"" song in particular!), Steigers Mexican (Russian?) accent is more distracting than Coburn's passable Irish one and the series of scenes where Steiger tries to persuade Coburn to help him rob the bank drags on for too long. <br/><br/>There are some great action set pieces of battles, prison breaks and train crashes. It differs from Leone's Westerns with Clint Eastwood by painting on a broader canvas, using the revolution as a background. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of Leone's better-known Westerns ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" is definitely worth seeing."
"Cristi_Ciopron","2","6","20","15 April 2009"," About the scene of the rape
","Leone had some flair for melodrama; a lot for the action. And none for the comedy; his comedy looks peculiarly sloppy and shallow the way Pasolini's orgy named SALO looked sloppy. This one is the only European western (i.e., western made by the European connection) that truly and decidedly bored me.<br/><br/>That's the western that starts abruptly with Steiger pissing and worrying about the weather; Steiger plays a dingy bandit who works with his family. Coburn, almost more simian that ever. The movie is generally sloppy and unsatisfying, the satire seems gross, ostentatious and too heavy—handed.<br/><br/>The good Steiger looked like Sancho Panza. He's too neurotic to cheer a scene; Coburn is not, yet he's mysteriously unlikable in Leone's movie. When Coburn chides him, Steiger looks like a Doug Heffernan impersonator. I believe Steiger was a good actor; but here both the script and the directing were too downright silly to begin with.<br/><br/>Leone was a decadent who enjoyed to depict sexual abuses; he does it in several movies. Remember De Niro being asked—'Are you coming?'. De Niro is twice a violator in that very movie; Volonté is a violator in the 'Monco' installment of Leone's trilogy, and Steiger is a sordid rapist in this film. This was part of the westerns' real world—yet Leone visibly liked to film such games.<br/><br/>The only well—made scene is the rape, and the symptoms of attraction and sexual chemistry between Steiger and the arrogant lady—his victim. The theme is pretty common in this genre of socially aware forays into the interaction of classes; the lady, depicted as repressed and sex—hungry, is obviously turned on by Steiger's presence since he gets in the diligence.<br/><br/>Their dirty, scandalous game, their interaction is interesting. He shows her the penis, she stares .<br/><br/>'The lady and the brute' pattern asks that the haughty and repressed, spiteful and hypocrite lady be intensely attracted by Neanderthalian men. Well, Leone knew how to film this.<br/><br/>After the rape scene, Coburn enters and the movie goes revisionist, like in Peckinpah, Altman or Huston ."

","Why does the Mexican ask to be on the coach, which he knows his family will hold up a few miles later? His being inside does not in any way assist the operation. So why does he do it? And why would they allow him to get on, considering it is clearly for rich people only? Why would he think they might let him on? See, this kind of nonsense is repeated in scene after scene. The Mexican family even seems oblivious to the fact they are dropping like flies. In one scene, one of them is blown up, and the rest of the family even seem to find the event comical. I don't care if the writers had some underlying theme of the unlikely hero, or about fighting revolutions. It's just stupid. Stupid beyond belief."
"soundoflight","5","4","12","3 June 2018"," Glimpses of something, but ultimately a mess...
","I read that Leone only made ""Duck, You Sucker"" because he couldn't make what he really wanted to do (""Once Upon a Time in America"") due to various issues with funding and rights to the material. I don't think his heart was really in this one. The film lacks the careful craftsmanship that his other films have. Perhaps there is a diamond in here somewhere, something that others are seeing, but it wasn't polished enough to be clear to me. <br/><br/>The best Leone films are very deliberate. Almost nothing is wasted, every shot and scene has a purpose and every shot looks like a professional photograph. I cannot say the same about ""Duck, You Sucker."" The filmmaking here seems a bit tired. A lot of effort was obviously put into special effects and explosions, and I think that dragged down the rest. Call it the ""George Lucas Effect."" I had no idea Leone pioneered that too. <br/><br/>What makes the other Sergio Leone films special to me is that they are in many ways ""films about films."" They offer a stylized look into American culture from a very European perspective. If that's present here in ""Duck, you Sucker,"" it went over my head."

If you are driving one train into another over that much track, there is no way to predict exactly where they will collide. It's absurd.<br/><br/>2: After such a crash, with one train doing at least 30-40 mph even with it's brakes on and the other train running full-out, how exactly did so many soldiers live through it? They would surely all have been killed instantly.<br/><br/>3: A minor point, but after Steiger blows away the German officer, firing something like 100 rounds into his body, Leone shows us a closeup of the body, and there's not a single bullet hole to be seen, either in his face or torso. That one REALLY bugs me.<br/><br/>There, I said it.

"FinnurE","6","3","8","14 September 2005"," Sergio Leone's Ambitious Personal Statement towards Contemporary Politics
","Sergio Leone's ""odd film out"" is at its core his answer to a wave of leftist Zapata westerns that had been making their way to the screen from 1968, with movies such as The Mercenary, Bullet for the General and Companeros. The message in these movies is clear: The working class should unite against the tyranny of the bourgeois upper class and all will be well, even if you die fighting for the cause. Sergio Leone obviously didn't agree.<br/><br/>Duck You Sucker utilizes the tropes from these movies: The rich upper class being dismissive and oppressive to the poor everyman, the European soldier of fortune, the salt-of-the-earth Mexican bandit, the fighting spirit... a little about the fighting spirit though: The film's first half has a mischievous sort of tongue-in-cheek atmosphere and moments of physical comedy reminiscent of the aforementioned films of the same genre. The action sequences are presented as fun and exciting, but in between those scenes, with increasing frequency the peasant gives us an insight into his (and Leone's) view of the revolution. The peasant is in general an anarchist opportunist who places more value on kinship and survival than on political reforms and class distinction.<br/><br/>The attack of the bridge in which an enemy battalion is massacred marks the point at which most of the other Zapata westerns would have ended: At the moment of glorious triumph! We've won the bad guys, we will thrive! But what's important is the aftermath: The richer, more powerful upper class government strikes back, with a vengeance. Blood begets blood and for all involved the revolution is a disaster. The final hour is as gruelling as the first hour is light-hearted. It begs several questions: Is the end worth the means? Is violence the only way? Is it possible to form a fair government at all? I've talked a lot about the film's themes and message. But I haven't really touched upon the actual quality of the film itself and how it gets its message across. The fact is, Duck You Sucker is ultimately slightly less than a sum of its parts. The film's set pieces are extremely impressive and photography and music are enjoyably eccentric. The pairing of Rod Steiger and James Coburn is odd but only adds to the bizarre feel of the whole thing.<br/><br/>Its problems are numerous, however. Steiger's accent is borderline hilariously inaccurate for a Mexican, I honestly don't know where it came from but I'll be damned if it wasn't the inspiration for Al Pacino's Tony Montana! Coburn's Irish accent wanders in and out during the entire movie, seems like he's really struggling with it. The continuity is at points extremely muddled, providing for an unnecessarily confusing narrative. At one point an entire scene is apparently dropped and the frame flip-flops into another scene! This edit was not the result of censorship to my knowledge. I can only assume that the negatives for the scene were lost before editing began or the crew simply forgot to shoot it! Leone's films tend to be slightly loose in their narrative, and many events happen off-screen. In Once Upon a Time in the West & America it works, here it occasionally becomes a nuisance.<br/><br/>The switch from comedy to drama half-way through is abrupt to say the least. I suspect that was the idea, but add that on top of the confusing narrative and it almost feels as if we've entered a different movie. I'll have to give it credit for this, though; very few film-makers dare to even attempt this! The comedy sometimes goes a little over the edge, although nowhere as blatantly as the title itself! Duck You Sucker is an extremely unfit and clumsy title for the film, and its alternatives Once Upon a Time... The Revolution and A Fistful of Dynamite don't quite cut it for me. The gist of the Italian title is basically ""keep out of trouble"".<br/><br/>Duck You Sucker is, if anything, a genuinely interesting film. Even its flaws are interesting. Don't hesitate to give it a spin, but temper your expectations. Once Upon a Time in the West it is not."

","Leone's most audacious exercise in parody is also his most sincere.  Never has his treatment of subject matter been so apparently flippant - two larger than larger than life heroes, one sounding like a rump-scratching Hispanic Clouseau, the other offering a splendid take-off on Welles' more hesitant blarney; ludicrous extensions of narratively marginal scenes; jokey effects undermining solemnity (especially when Sean becomes Juan's ministering angel, a day-glo celestial banner above his head); Morricone's most daringly inappropriate score, jaunty 'Sean Sean!' theme, plenty of silly, bathetic, intrusive noises, a gloriously disrespectful impromptu variation on EineKleineNachtMusik in the middle of a heist.<br/><br/>As ever with Leone, though, the key to his film's soul is Morricone's music, and amidst the sarcastic invention and absurd kitsch, there beats a reluctantly sentimental heart.  Leone's films are full of tension, contradiction and disruption, and A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE is no exception - characters who are plausible and motivated in one scene, may be allegorical, abstract or merely the butt of a visual joke in the next.  But here he has created two of his most believable and likeable characters.  This is some coup in that one is a murderer-rapist and the other is an IRA terrorist, but their burgeoning friendship and sublimated romance provides an oasis of humanity in a desert of chaos, murder, war, fascism, betrayal, rupture, dislocation.<br/><br/>Leone's films have been called camp, and this is a flamboyantly gay film, from the fetishisation of uniform and costume (Coburn, possibly the only actor in the history of cinema completely at ease in his masculinity, is as beautiful as ever here, long, loose and lovely in white and boots, a bondage merchant in a sweaty oater, an outrageous moustache amplifying those incomparable horse-teeth when he breaks into the Coburn smile).  And while these values, in league with Leone's mocking filming, undermine the very macho generics, the insufferable authenticity of 'war' and 'revolutionary' films, the sombre love story anchors the film's humanity.<br/><br/>The only heterosexual sex in the film is an offscreen rape, and initially Juan's earthy, diffuse fertility is contrasted with the abstract, literally destructive, steely sterility of Sean - this is visualised in the treatments of their respective pasts - Juan's is embodied in his very visual offspring; Sean's consists of heightened, dubious flashbacks.  These, bathed in lush soft-focus, seem to indicate a MICHAEL COLLINS-like disrupted love story with a lovely Irish redhead, but the blatant homoeroticism of these scenes subverts their narrative of betrayal, conflating the individual and the wider political as Leone does so brilliantly often in DYNAMITE.  The development of Juan and Sean (ironical doppelgangers?)'s friendship is marked by a lot of phallic gunplay.<br/><br/>DYNAMITE is Leone's most persistantly undervalued film, and it is true that in comparison to his previous film, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, it is a failure, with a less compelling narrative; less controlled style; less fully worked out mythic structure; less sense of space and place; but WEST is the greatest Western ever made, and DYNAMITE is full of brilliant things too. It is often accused of being a sprawling, unfocused mess, but look at Leone's formal genius in the opening scenes. Our first shot is of Juan, a comical figure in his shifty dishevellement, walking barefoot in the parched landscape, evidently animal, comically subservient to the driver with his hidden sandwich against his sweat-drenched belly.  In the next sequence, however, this prejudice against Juan belongs to the grotesque reactionaries, and we find ourselves horrified at our dangerous superficiality.  This may not be one of Leone's most subtle scenes, but it is overwhelmingly, savagely powerful, the vicious contempt of these forces of order distorted into a dizzying montage of chewing, phlegmy mouths, spouting poisonous hate, ignorance, suppressed sexual-desire, and crumbs until they become the indistinguishable bestial mass they condemn.<br/><br/>But just as we side with the patronised peasant, he becomes the ruthless leader of a straggling group of bandits (including his trigger-happy pre-pubescent sons), unafraid to casually murder and rape.  DYNAMITE is full of patternings like this, savaging our expectations and assumptions. These scenes also begin the analysis of the conflict between the individual and the mass/community that is one of the film's main themes, the ethics of revolution, their potential similarity to to capitalist, murderous anarchy, and the rights or duties of the individual to abstain or take part.  The film's trajectory is ironic - Juan moves from an opportunistic chicken thief who dreams of nothing but robbing banks to unwitting hero of the revolution, but at the wrenching expense of his family and best friend.<br/><br/>If DYNAMITE deals specifically with the Mexican Revolution, it compresses all the violent struggles of the last vile century.  Some of the nocturnal battle scenes recall World War I trench warfare, while the uniforms of the fascists, the street executions, the collaborators, the Holocaust-like slaughter of Juan's family, the move from the bright outdoors to murky interiors, all recall the Second World War.  Sean himself is escaping revolution and imperial tyranny, while the invocation of America as a promised land can only sound hollow at the height of the Vietnam War, and especially in the Latin American context.  While Leone's left-wing sympathies are never in doubt, he was criticised at the time for the vagueness of his approach, but time has borne out his scepticism, his despairing hope, his refusal of propaganda, his anger.<br/><br/>DYNAMITE wouldn't be a Leone film if it wasn't also a commentary on film-making, and it is his most significantly self-reflexive movie, with repeated shots of men looking, especially through widescreen gaps.  Juan himself looks uncommonly like Leone, while Coburn's cigar-chomping calm as he ruminates over his next composition, makes him an obvious director figure.  In one brilliant, hilarious, scary shot, anticipating the Saatchis by a quarter of a century, has Juan gazing through the ripped eyes of the dictator's poster image.  Many US directors are invoked and examined, from Hawks, where the redemption of the transgressor is pointlessly, egotistically nihilistic, to Peckinpah, then the major innovator in Westerns (and whose THE WILD BUNCH was set around the same period as DYNAMITE), whose montage shooting of violence is alluded to in the early carriage hijack scene.<br/><br/>This is a film packed with with memorable sequences, some exhilirating, some harrowing - the blowing up of the bridge, the train collision, the nightime rainswept executions.  It is clear to see Leone's influence on the movie brats, from the tank shaped like Darth Vader's head, to the filming of action .  But there are two scenes that stand out for me, ranking with the best of Leone: the first is Sean watching the Doctor betray revolutionaries; he flashbacks to his own betrayal by his best friend - his circular retaliation immediately cuts to the fascist's executing, disturbingly linking revolutionary and reactionary, past and present, myth and reality (in the betrayal scene, Sean views everything in a mirror, his masculine wholeness shattered).<br/><br/>Secondly, in the middle of a raging, very physical and real battle, Sean is shot; Juan's horror is expressed in a complete suspension of time and place, as oppressive quiet and darkness shrouds his helplessness.  It is a beautiful moment in a wonderful film."

"grantss","8","2","5","24 January 2015"," The best of Sergio Leone
","Sergio Leone's best film, in my opinion. That doesn't say much, though to some it might. In my opinion the four movies he is most famous for - Once Upon a Time in the West, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More - are okay but are vastly over-rated. Slow, badly produced, with holey plots, ridiculous dialogue and hammy acting, especially by the supporting cast. The only things preventing those from being total failures was the action scenes and, in three of them, the acting of Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>A Fistful of Dynamite is better in all those respects, without compromising on the action. Decent plot, though not entirely watertight. There's even a few nice themes running through it. Themes of patriotism, family, loyalty and camaraderie.<br/><br/>Dialogue is OK. Has some silly moments but mostly fine.<br/><br/>Performances are fine. Rod Steiger and James Coburn put in solid performances in the lead roles and the supporting cast don't embarrass themselves.<br/><br/>Production is still reasonably cheap though. You get the usual effect of it appearing as if the actors voices have been dubbed in, rather than being recorded live.<br/><br/>This is also shorter than those four, which is a blessing. There are still some pointless and/or drawn out scenes but these are more limited in number than the other four. Helps the pacing of the movie too.<br/><br/>The main issue with this one is the fact that the soundtrack consists of one song and that seems to be on an infinite loop...<br/><br/>Ultimately a very engaging and entertaining western."
"BA_Harrison","9","2","5","28 December 2012"," Viva Leone!
","Amidst the chaos of the 1913 Mexican revolution, explosives expert John (James Coburn) and bandit leader Juan (Rod Steiger) join forces to break into the bank of Mesa Verde, each with their own agenda.<br/><br/>Sergio Leone is better known for giving us fistfuls of dollars than dynamite, but in my opinion this criminally under-appreciated spaghetti western is just as deserving of attention as the director's better known Eastwood movies.<br/><br/>As its alternative US title—Duck, You Sucker—suggests, A Fistful of Dynamite begins in a rather comedic vein, the film's less-than-exemplary protagonists trading blows and quips in a series of comical encounters; but as the pair slowly form an unlikely friendship, so the film gradually develops into a far more poignant work, exploring numerous intelligent themes—bravery, honour, corruption, politics, betrayal, tragedy, judgement, retribution, heroism, sacrifice.<br/><br/>John's back-story, in particular, gives the film much of its profundity and pathos. Told in a series of flashbacks, it depicts him as an idealistic IRA terrorist torn between friendship and his devotion to his political ethos, forced to make a split-second judgement that will forever haunt his life and affect his future. This complexity of character, perfectly portrayed by Coburn, and brilliantly realised by Leone, helps to elevate A Fistful of Dynamite above many films of the same genre.<br/><br/>Of course, such a film wouldn't be complete without some gratuitous carnage, and Leone doesn't disappoint in this department either, delivering plenty of death and destruction in his own distinctive style and accompanied by yet another unforgettable Ennio Morricone score: sudden outbursts of violence from Steiger's deceptively buffoon-like bandit Juan; brutal executions carried out by the movie's loathsome villain Col. Günther Reza (Antoine Saint-John); a spectacular machine-gun massacre; an explosive train wreck. All of this is, of course, highly entertaining on a superficial level, but it also serves to drive home the film's more thought provoking messages about the horrors of conflict and the questionability of pursuing a path of violence to achieve one's goal."
"mgtbltp","10","2","5","14 June 2007"," Leone's last great (Zapata) Western
","Well I must admit that seeing this for the first time on the new pristine R1, wide screen SE DVD, with the original ""mono"" audio was a revelation. In 1970 I left New York City for first the Adirondacks, and then Montana, so my easy access to the theaters on Times Square was eliminated and the ability to be aware of much less be able to see the Spaghetti Westerns that occasionally graced the big screens in double & triple bills was curtailed.<br/><br/>My previous viewing experiences with this film were once on a 70's or 80's VHS tape and then dribs and drabs that I caught from time to time while switching through channels on TV. In regards to the Pan & Scan and commercial breached versions my reaction to Rod Steigers performance was decidedly negative. It seems in retrospect that the combination of cuts, trimmed scenes, and commercial breaks, emphasized the clownish facial expressions and exaggerated his accent while negating the serious side of his performance. Now viewed as a whole his performance becomes more easy flowing and contiguous. You realize that Steiger was playing Juan as a cagey Mexican bandito playing the fool when the situation required it and reverting back at the drop of a hat back to bandit leader. With James Coburn's performance I never had an issue.<br/><br/>I'm also mature enough now to see that this was a transitional film for Leone not only as a complete film but it was transforming before our eyes. I can see now why it tanked in the US. In Europe I believe you had the luxury of getting served your Leone in well paced over time releases, you had the opportunity to savor and enjoy and digest each and were ready to see what the maestro would serve up next. We ""kids"" here in the US were blasted by both barrels in 1967 when both ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For A Few Dollars More"" premiered within months of each other, and then theaters ran double bills for months at a time. Within a year ""The Good The Bad & The Ugly"" also hit the theaters and we were totally immersed in the Leone style and eager for more of the same, I think we may have been under the impression that these films were similar to the James Bond franchise where a successful formula would be repeated over & over.<br/><br/>""Once Upon A Time in The West"" was a totally different animal it did not star Clint Eastwood (which was the way the dollars trilogy was promoted (strike one) it was misunderstood upon release and panned by the critics who did not understand its nature(strike two) it was then re-cut (Strike three) and released widely to a quick demise.<br/><br/>""Duck You Sucker"" not really a traditional Western never had a chance, it was Leone's reaction to the Zapata Westerns that never did have a wide showcase or following here in the US, his quotes & references to these Zapatas would have flown over the heads of most. While Leones previous ""Dollars"" films were just fun adventures, and ""OUTITW"" was an homage Western about Westerns, this film had a Leone message, a statement, it was not only that ""Revolution is Confusion"" but also to ""keep your head down"" (Duck You Sucker) and stay out of politics, because only the people who read books survive the poor who do the fighting and make the changes end up dead.<br/><br/>There are the comedy elements from his previous films juxtaposed with serious new depths to his characters, the beginning of DYS is very reminiscent to GBU and the cat and mouse games played between Tuco and Blondie are reflected in the Juan/Sean relationship each using the other for opposite purposes. Juan is also the head of his extended family of banditi and all actions are shown to have consequences.<br/><br/>I'm pulled buy opposing emotions while watching this film, on one salient I want it to be another grand adventure a la GBU, and that is the way it started out. On another it's not up to the mythic qualities of OUTITW, though it does quote from Einstein's ""Que Vivre Mexico"" and the Hollywood tradition of Zapatas, Leone purposely shuns the ""romance of the sombrero"" we get no ballads, no soldadas (ie, no beautiful Adelitas or Columbas), no festivals all touchstones of the Italian Zapatas. On still a third salient the film has a very bleak ending. Not exactly a feel good fun to watch over and over.<br/><br/>OUTIA Leone's next and last film continues in the mode and is equally beautiful but bleak. a film about melancholy and regret.<br/><br/>Morricone's score great as usual I find a just a tad bit uneven, the leitmotif's for Juan and Sean/John are good but the grotto massacre theme just seems a bit to breezy & lighthearted for the images. Listening to the Frayling commentary I have an understanding of what he was attempting."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","2","5","21 March 2006"," Without question, one of Leone's best (spoilers)
","A Fistful of Dynamite (or Duck, You Sucker, or Once Upon a Time  The Revolution, or whatever title you want to use) doesn't get anywhere near the same amount of attention and praise that the Dollars trilogy, and Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time in America have heaped upon them, but that doesn't stop it from being one of Leone's best films. In fact, I'd probably place it as his third best film, above each instalment in the Dollars trilogy and just below the two Once Upon a Time pictures.<br/><br/>I prefer A Fistful of Dynamite to the Dollars films because Dynamite has more substance and more emotion to it. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Leone fan and love the Dollars films to bits, but all in all they're just cracking entertainment (just, he says!). A Fistful of Dynamite, though, is cracking entertainment and moving as hell at the same time.<br/><br/>One of the things I love most about A Fistful of Dynamite is Leone's attitude to revolution. He sees right through the BS of it all. He knows it's a load of crap, that the motivations are about as pure as a lump of coal. He also knows that it's the poor people who end up suffering the most. In fact, there's a great speech that Juan (Rod Steiger), the peasant Mexican bandit, makes when he's talking to Sean (James Coburn), the Irish revolutionary who has a way with explosives. ""I know what I'm talking about when I'm talking about revolutions. The people who read the books go to the people who can't read the books and the book people say, 'We need a change'. So the poor people make the change. Then the people who read the books they all sit around big polished tables and they talk and talk and talk and eat and eat and eat. But what has happened to the poor people? They're dead! That's your revolution."" Of course, with Steiger's delivery, the scene is even more powerful.<br/><br/>But as that piece of dialogue proves, the film's cynical as hell. But I think history has proved Leone's attitude to be spot on. You get rid of one corrupt regime and another one is established in its place, one that is often worse. Therefore Leone suggests that it's best to stay out of things.<br/><br/>This is Juan's attitude at the start of the film. He wants no part of revolution or politics. He wants to keep his head down and take whatever money he can with his group of bandits, all of whom are family members (Juan boasts of all of his children having different mothers). But slowly he's drawn into things. First he encounters Sean, who he thinks he can use to help him blow his way into a bank. And then, when he finally does hit the bank, there's no money inside  Sean has declined to tell him that the money was moved and that there are only political prisoners inside. Therefore Juan becomes an unwitting hero of the revolution. But then as Sean and Juan slowly become friends, Juan helps his Irish friend attack the government troops. This then leads to Juan's entire family being murdered in the caves they hide in. And it really is quite a powerful scene when Juan sees the aftermath. Before this scene he's quite a comic character. He dreams of robbing banks, he slaps his children playfully around the chops, he looks to god for inspiration and he even rapes wealthy women with his over-sized genitalia (""That's pretty good, huh?"" and ""You pass out now you miss the best part""). But after his family are killed he's left completely bereft  Steiger really does look heartbroken; his performance is extraordinary  and he rips his cross from his neck. As he says earlier on, ""My country is me and my family."" <br/><br/>After this, Sean and Juan become even closer. Sean realises that he's partly responsible for what's happened to Juan and he slowly loses his revolutionary spirit. Towards the end he even says that he doesn't believe in revolutions any more; he only believes in dynamite. And the final scene is extremely powerful. Sean and Juan meet on the battlefield and Sean gets shot in the back by the General who killed Juan's family. Juan then unloads with a machine gun, shooting the man long after he's dead. Then Juan talks to his injured friend, ""You leave me now, you know, what the f*** is going to happen to me?"" And then at the end of their conversation, Sean gives Juan his cross back, ""Oh, my friend, I did give you a royal screwing."" But Juan shakes his head. He was glad they became friends. Beautiful stuff. And then when Juan goes off to get help, we get a final flashback to Sean's past (as in most of Leone's films, flashbacks occur frequently throughout the film) and Sean blows himself up, leaving Juan completely alone. ""What about me?"" he thinks; the last spoken words. And then 'Duck, You Sucker', shoots onto the screen. But as Christopher Frayling says in his biography of Leone, and in the commentary on the DVD, a more accurate title is 'Keep Your Head Down'. If Juan hadn't of got involved, none of this would have happened. The film's much more than just a spaghetti western."

","Just saw the movie - for the first time! - the other night on cable. It is fabulous - very rich, very dense. I'd recommend it to any Leone fan. I noticed many comments about the long shots in closeup and the acting through action rather than words, which adds to the richness. An interesting note about some of the long scenes. My business partner (we run a production and communications firm) interviewed Ennio Morricone a number of years ago when he was being honored in LA. Apparently, he basically cranks out many of his film scores and then puts them ""in the drawer"" until a movie comes up. In many of the Leone movies, scenes were shot to Morricone's score, not the other way around (which is more typical), so many scenes are stretched to match the music. Back to Duck You Sucker - I'll start searching for a DVD. It's definitely one for the collection."

","Juan (Rod Steiger), a Mexican bandito, shanghais expatriate (and former IRA member) Sean (James Coburn), an explosives expert, into knocking off the Mesa Verde bank. Before he knows it, though, Steiger has gotten himself enmeshed in the Mexican Revolution.<br/><br/>I recently saw the restored version on the big screen, and it's certainly the version to see, as previous American versions had cut this movie all to shreds. I bow to no one in my admiration for Leone, a favorite director of mine who directed my all-time favorite movie, THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, but this, while pretty good, is not first rank. <br/><br/>Part of the problem is that the early broad comedy jars, and jars pretty badly, with the later very somber seriousness. Not only that, the other part of the problem is that the comedy really isn't very funny -- Steiger isn't Wallach, who could make the broad Italian-style clownish humor of Tuco appealing. His Juan does a good crack at it, but it seems really forced to me, like Steiger's heart really wasn't in it. <br/><br/>Things pick up in a big way once we hit Mesa Verde. While not an action-fest, there are several nice set pieces, and Leone does really good work pulling out the tension of the various explosions. (The explosions, particularly the final one, are exquisitely staged.) There are several haunting images in the second half -- soldiers gunning down innocents in trenches, Coburn watching a firing squad in the rain, Steiger ripping off his crucifix after finding his family slaughtered. <br/><br/>The story, once we get past the cornpone, is also pretty good. Leone is pretty obviously anti-war, but the movie steadfastly refuses to take sides in the conflict. Ultimately what matters to Sean and Juan are personal solutions, personal motives. The war simply surrounds them (a theme introduced in GOOD, BAD, AND UGLY.)<br/><br/>Steiger is better playing reluctant hero than comic clown; I think he's basically miscast here (and I like Steiger). Coburn is very good as Sean: he comes from the same laconic line as Blondie in GOOD, but this is a sad, damaged man who's laconic more as a defensive mechanism than anything else.<br/><br/>If you're going to see it, see the restored version."

","While not being at all my favourite Sergio Leone film, I still believe this movie is one of those you should have seen to consider yourself a proper cinephile. ""Duck, you sucker"" starts with a guy peeing, something kind of strange in a western film. In fact, the first scene that comes after that introduces very well and seriously one of the biggest themes in the movie, the discrimination of the poor and the Mexican revolution. Then we have the encounter between the two main characters, and a whole alteration of really silly, humorous and childish moments to very serious scenes and events. This film depicts violence of the Mexican dictatorship as crudely as many films depict Nazis. Homever, it also shows an aspect of revolutions not always obvious. As Mao-Tze tung'squote says at the beginning, ""Revolution is an act of violence"". The film, through the experiences of John as an I.R.A. terrorist shown in flashbacks, paralleling events in the film, how inglorious and dirty were actually the really hosannated revolutions, making the viewer feel at the end similarly to John, who says at a point in the film, ""I don't believe in anything but dynamite."" This movie though is not anti-revolutionary or justifies dictatorships. ""Duck you sucker"" has a quite complex theme and seriousness, next to some really silly and childish situations or jokes, and an unmemorable score which are what make the movie fall down to mark 8/10. Every Sergio Leone fan should try to understand it homever."
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","2","30 December 2014"," Viva la Revolucion ... not ...
","""Duck, you sucker!"" shouts a charming and friendly James Coburn to Rod Steiger after he's just planted a baton of dynamite in his wagon. In other words, get ready for a big 'bang' and protect yourself. The line is repeated so many times it became the film's running gag, a catchphrase so to speak, in fact, the film's title, translated from the Italian ""Giu la Testa"" : ""Bow your head"".<br/><br/>Yet the title doesn't quite work. There's something cheap, familiar, not worthy of a film in the same vein than the 'Dollars' trilogy and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". An odd choice indeed for a movie that opens with a warning about the meaning of revolution, something that made me want to tell today's youth, notably in Arab countries 'hear, hear'. Revolution isn't a social dinner, it isn't made of elegance and courtesy, it's brutal, bloody and innocent people get killed for it.<br/><br/>And anyone with a brain can start it but once it starts, no one can predict its outcome, much more whether the new order will be better or worse than the previous. The only certainty in Revolution is that the wealthy survives, and people are the suckers. These Libyans or Egyptians who were so eager to throw the power out, what did they win? Are they in a better situation? Sergio Leone, a man of vision, witnessing the revolutionary waves that shook Europe in the late 60's and Italy was no exception, and couldn't see past the violence, the bloodshed and terrorism.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the Maestro didn't have a political conscience, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" spoke powerful statements about the end of the western myth where modest entrepreneurs were sacrificed on the altar of progress and civilization, when capitalism killed the frontier spirit. The opening of ""Duck you Sucker"" works like a powerful continuation, Juan, a Mexican vagrant, urinates on a rock full of ants, an animalistic metaphor reminding of Sam Peckinpah's masterpiece ""Wild Bunch"" where kids were feeding red ants with a poor scorpion.<br/><br/>Juan pees on the ants, like the passengers of the stage he'll get in, pee on the insects peasants are. Distinguished bourgeois and aristocrats treat peasants with the same contempt and condescension's while Juan acts dumb to comfort their opinions, before fooling them. They get carjacked, their clothes stolen and left naked with nothing. This act seals a brief victory of peasants but don't get yourself fooled, this isn't a victory of classes, this is not ""Viva Zapata!"", it's pure and simply taking money, wealthy people are loved for their money more than hated for their attitude. And Juan is not interested in politics.<br/><br/>On the same day, an oddity passes through him and his family, a man riding a motorcycle, an easy rider in the real meaning of the word. His face is friendly and smiling, his name is Sean, or John, the English version of Juan, this is how predestined to meet the two men were. Sean is an expert of dynamite but he's not interested in politics not anymore. Juan doesn't care, he needs his skills to open the safe of Mera Verde's bank. Both men feel different, Sean is classy and stoic, Juan is extroverted and hot-tempered but both have one thing in common, they have no faith in revolution.<br/><br/>Yet Sean has a reason, he used to believe, he was an IRA agent, but he was betrayed by his closest friend, as the film progresses, the many flashbacks punctuating the action reveal more and more about Sean, his life in Ireland, and a special triangular relationship, these parts are conveyed by one of Ennio Morricone's most emotional themes, something that resonates as a powerful eulogy to a past drown in an ocean of nostalgic tears and the ashes of a faith that will never recover. Sean doesn't believe in revolution, because it's men's work, and men ought to betray. Facts will prove him right. Juan believes revolution is lead by men who can read telling those who can't to fight. The character of Romano Valli proves him right.<br/><br/>If anything, Sean incarnates the second title given to the film ""A Fistful of Dynamites"", something that conveys the same catchiness than an Eastwood film, Eastwood who refused to reprise his iconic role, rightfully letting Coburn's contagious smile illuminating the screen and making one with Rod Steiger who took Eli Wallach's place. Steiger's character suggests the idea of ""Duck you Sucker"", ""bow your head, you peasant, you're the one who'll get screwed at the end"". And the film is full of some of the most brutal massacres and scenes of execution including a heart-wrenching one where peasants get casually massacred on trenched like cattle., where a whole family can be killed. This is ugliness after idealism. So much for the chants.<br/><br/>The whole irony of the film is that the most disillusioned men about revolution, the most eager to go to America, after having nothing to lose, will be the most helpful to the cause, somewhat because deep in themselves they have courage, they have strength, and they are part of a vanishing breed, men who follow their instincts. And this is what Leone movies are about, men who act, who help themselves, who save, they're disillusioned but they'll give the meaning their life deserve.<br/><br/>And together, Coburn and Steiger will write one of the most underrated Western stories, one whose only fitting title, was ""Once Upon a Time the Revolution"" forever incarnated in my mind by these irritating ""Sean, Sean"" as irritating than a past obsessively haunting your past, like Harmonica's tragedy, like Noodle's phone call, Coburn in his greatest role, is a man haunted by a past helping to build the future of man who lost his.<br/><br/>And isn't the revolution, a way of killing the past for a better future?"
"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","7 April 2014"," The Final Western from the Auteur of Westerns.
","From the auteur of westerns, Duck, You Sucker! is the final western from director Sergio Leone & is rightfully claimed as the most overlooked film of his illustrious career. Serving only as a producer when the film went into production & later talked into directing it, this film turns out to be a quite good standalone example of its genre but pales in comparison to what Leone accomplished with his last 4 films.<br/><br/>Set in Mexico at the time of revolution, it tells the story of Juan Miranda; a Mexican outlaw leading a bandit family, who meets an IRA explosives expert on the run named John & forces him into his scheme of robbing the Mesa Verde national bank, only to have tables turned around for him when he ends up freeing the rebel prisoners & is hailed by them as a glorious hero of the revolution, thus attracting unwanted attention from the army.<br/><br/>Leone's direction isn't as memorable as his previous works & although it features some of his signature styles, it is often too exaggerated (one example being the extreme close-ups of people's mouth while they are eating & talking). Yet, the story is steadily narrated & only gets better as the film progresses. Cinematography presents a raw, conflicted look. Editing could've could've worked with few more trims. And lastly, it features one of Ennio Morricone's most playful compositions.<br/><br/>The performances by Rod Steiger & James Coburn as Juah & John, respectively, is good & their chemistry together is even better. The revolution itself is brilliantly depicted whether it's by any means accurate or not, the effects look majestic in parts & the finale as well as the character's introductions are its finest moments. On an overall scale, Duck, You Sucker! may not score much when compared with Leone's earlier works but as a standalone feature, it is an impressive work of its genre that can really benefit from a wider audience.<br/><br/>P.S. Also known as A Fistful of Dynamite and Once Upon a Time... the Revolution."
"JasparLamarCrabb","10","1","2","23 March 2013"," Thoroughly entertaining...
","SPOILER ALERT! The uncut 157 minute version of this Sergio Leone film is thoroughly entertaining. Petty Mexican thief Rod Steiger believes he's recruited IRA bomber James Coburn to help him rob a bank, but in fact ends up recruited by Coburn to fight in the Mexican revolution. There's a lot of comedy in this film mixed with a lot of extreme violence. There are many action scenes and perhaps one too many executions. Leone manages to offset the gruesomeness with some very big laughs, such as Coburn tricking Steiger into unwittingly freeing 1000s of Mexican rebels. Steiger & Coburn have great chemistry and they're backed by a first rate supporting cast including Romolo Valli as a duplicitous fellow revolutionary and silent Antoine Saint-John as a maniacal Colonel. Steiger's haminess is a perfect match for his over-the-top character. Though legend has it that Peter Bogdanovich and then Sam Peckinpah were signed on to direct this with Sergio Leone producing, it's a safe bet that not even one of those great directors would have made something so audacious. Ennio Morricone's score is one of his most memorable."

","This Sergio Leone western(also known as ""A Fistful Of Dynamite"" stars Rod Steiger as a Mexican bandit who gets mixed up with IRA explosives expert James Coburn, who then, for their own reasons, become embroiled in the Mexican revolution that is devastating the country, but which both men can use their skills to make a difference.<br/><br/>Both actors are good, but film itself is terribly disappointing, being an overlong, heavy-handed, and turgid polemic that will likely bore the viewer into a stupor.

","James Coburn is John, an Irish revolutionary in exile in Mexico whose specialty is blowing things up with nitro and dynamite. Rod Steiger is Juan, a local bandito who wants to break into a bank, and thinks John will help.<br/><br/>""You make the holes with the holy water, and then I walk in and do the dirty work,"" Juan pleads. ""John and Juan...Can't you understand it? That is...destiny."" And so it is, though Juan has no idea what kind of destiny. For John, the fire of revolution still burns, and its flame is a deadly thing, for Juan and those he loves.<br/><br/>""Duck You Sucker"" is the last western of Sergio Leone's career, though far different in content and tone than his other westerns set north of the Rio Grande. Politics takes center stage this time, specifically the radical kind that inflamed both Mexico in the 1910s and European movie houses when this film came out.<br/><br/>What is Leone trying to say? Sir Christopher Frayling, the Leone scholar who provides a DVD commentary for ""Duck"", describes its agenda as anti-revolutionary, that people who get caught up in it only get themselves hurt to no good end. But the film is rife with scenes of capitalist oppression, from an opening stagecoach ride where Juan endures the company of some snooty bluebloods to a long-pan scene where right-wing troops massacre civilians in concrete ditches, My-Lai style.<br/><br/>The movie does open with some pointed words from Chairman Mao, declaring ""The Revolution is an act of violence"", followed by a scene of Juan urinating on some ants. The camera seems to hold on one staggering ant, and you can argue Juan is that ant. But Leone seems to answer the bigger question, is revolution worth it, with an emphatic yes. The cause of overthrowing Mexico's ruling caste seems entirely righteous as depicted in ""Duck You Sucker"", and Juan is no gentle Gandhi type going in. So I'd take Frayling with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>As a revolutionary, however, Leone is not satisfying. ""Duck You Sucker"" struggles with a very long and convoluted story. There are two notable story jumps that are never explained, one in which Juan fools John into blowing up a church containing John's employer, and another when a sudden setback puts Juan in need of rescue. A rough and ugly tone predominates, as if Leone was trying to show the other makers of spaghetti westerns he could be as raunchy as them. Finally, the minor undertone of humor goes out of the movie halfway through, leaving you with a lot of unrelievedly heavy scenes.<br/><br/>Fortunately, there's a saving grace found throughout ""Duck You Sucker"": The majestic Ennio Morricone score. It's one of his best ever, even more inspiring than the music for ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"". Surprising light and graceful in places, it suggests an influence from Burt Bacharach's work on ""Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid"" just as Leone's tonal direction takes cues from another 1969 western, ""The Wild Bunch"". The melodies and themes work wonders at giving ""Duck You Sucker"" a richness and ballast the script seems to labor toward.<br/><br/>Steiger and Coburn make a terrific team despite a pair of dodgy accents. Leone gives us so many close-ups you begin to feel like Coburn's dentist, but the actors merit the focus by rising to each other's level, Steiger showing us as much charm as Coburn and Coburn as much intensity as Steiger. Alas, unlike the other Leone westerns before this, there is precious little in the way of interesting supporting work except for Antoine Saint-John as a Mexican SS officer.<br/><br/>Frayling calls ""Duck You Sucker"" a sign of Leone ""growing up"", but I see it more as the great director bending down to the level of filmmakers around him. Still, in its lead performances, in its dazzling musical score, and in moments of isolated wit and grandeur that pop up especially in the first half, you get a feeling for Leone's uniqueness."
"tmwest","Null","2","7","26 November 2006"," A tragicomic western, Leone's third best.
","Sergio Leone, probably due to the great financial success of ""For a Fistful of Dollars"" could afford to do whatever he wanted and ""Duck, You Sucker"" is a consequence of that. It is a very personal film, and much more suitable to be seen on a DVD at home, where you can see again and again certain scenes, up to the point where you you think you grasped it. The first sequence, where poor Juan (Rod Steiger) goes into a giant stagecoach full of upper class rich people is pure comedy.From the caricature way they bash the poor, you know they are in for trouble. Those people on the stagecoach seem to belong much more to a Visconti film then to a western. After this comic sequence, the film will slowly start becoming a tragedy. Mallory (James Coburn) shows up, an expert in dynamite, and they join forces. Juan is unwillingly fighting for the revolution, in his own mind all he wants is money. Mallory (Irish) has been traumatized by his past, and he acts like a man who does not care if he is dead or alive. After TGTBTU and OUTITW this is Leone's best film."

","I can't say much more about this movie than what has recently been said about it here. Only that it's great to have it on DVD and also great that people are starting to take another look at what is one of Leone's more ""low key"" films but which is really right up there with the best of them. The story is told in quite a sobering, down to earth way, and perhaps because each point isn't driven home with a sledgehammer, the film is sometimes dismissed as a ""lightweight"". It does have some hilarious exchanges between the two leads but also tackles a serious topic (revolutions and their effect on people). The video release of this film (with sizable chunks of the story missing) couldn't have helped matters much. Watching it (almost complete) on DVD, you become aware of the great locations used, the great use of music, and the inventive way sound is used e.g. sometimes overlapping from one scene to another. Not to mention great acting! And also the great set pieces - any one of them could have been used by itself as a finale in a lesser film -Leone sure gives value for money! 10/10."

","Whenever I'm talking about Westerns, I'll always say, ""Fistful of Dynamite"" is the best western of all time.<br/><br/>This movie continues Sergio Leone's tradition of making all other Spaghetti Westerns look like Disney films. It's tough, violent and doesn't stall from start to finish.<br/><br/>It follows an Irish explosives expert, and a Mexican bandit. The friendship is driven on the Mexican's belief that the Irishman will help him rob the Mexican National Bank. But the bandit inadvertently becomes a hero in the Mexican revolution.<br/><br/>It's not quite as cold hearted as the likes of Fistful of Dollars, or The Good The Bad and The Ugly. But this is what makes it so much better, as you will care about the characters. Even the bandit is open about how he loves and lives for his children, where usually they would not even blink an eye at killing their own brother.<br/><br/>The film also makes use of flashbacks portraying the Irishmans past as a terrorist. As it seems strange having an Irish terrorist in a western the flashbacks give some idea why.<br/><br/>This is a magnificent film, but unfortunately is not very well known as it is shown very rarely on TV.

","A Fistful of Dynamite' has the usual elements of a Sergio Leone movie. He made this movie after his Dollars'-trilogy and the best western I know, Once Upon a Time in the West', and before his great crime movie Once Upon a Time in America'. Compared to those five movies this movie is not that big a deal, but compared to most other movies this is actually pretty good.<br/><br/>The story has the Mexican revolution as background. The two heroes are Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) and the Irish Sean Mallory who is a wanted criminal in his own country. At first they are not really fond of each other but you know in a story like this that will change. Mallory is an expert with explosives and that gives some of the better explosion-sequences I have seen on a screen.<br/><br/>The story is pretty standard but with Sergio Leone as the director it becomes a little more than that. The movie opens with a delightful sequence where Juan steals from some rich folks who just insulted him in many ways. The first sequences between Coburn and Steiger are great as well. Like I said we have the familiar Leone things here. The close-ups do their work and the music by Ennio Morricone fits the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>The movie is very violent, with lots of on screen explosion, war violence and executions, but that is the period of time and the background that is chosen. It helps the movie to be more convincing. In the end this is simply a very good movie by probably the best western-director that ever lived."
"Hancock_the_Superb","8","2","8","20 July 2002"," Good, but disappointing by Leone's standards **spoilers to the basic plot**
","When I first bought ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" last fall, I expected an exciting, action-packed film, with great shootouts and great battle scenes. While the film itself was very good, it disappointed in the last aspect. Sure, the opening scene is pure brilliance (the shots of the wealthy passenger's mouths as they insult Juan and the Mexican peasantry and the storming of the stagecoach), and there are other exciting action scenes, like the storming of the bank in Mesa Verde, and Sean's introduction, but as a whole the film lacked.  <br/><br/>   Sergio Leone didn't even want to do this film (or ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" for that matter); he had become disillusioned to the Western by 1968; but after the international (though mostly Italian and American) successes of his Dollars Trilogy, the studios forced him to make OUATITW, which bombed in America (though this could be explained perhaps by the fact that nearly half an hour of the film was butchered by the editors for American release), though extremely successful in Europe.  He wanted to start ""Once Upon A Time In America"", but the studios forced him to make this.  Again, this bombed in America, but again was a hit abroad.  After this, Leone wasn't quite as big stuff as he had been when he had made his simple, beautiful, almost whimisical Dollars Trilogy, or even OUATITW.<br/><br/>   There is occasional brilliance, but as a Leone film, this is pretty bad. The flashback scenes in particular are quite plodding, and certainly below Leone.  In this film, there are five-six flashbacks, but none of them are really effective as far as I'm concerned.  Take OUATITW.  It had a single flashback, and it was arguably the best scene of the movie (even though it lasted maybe forty seconds).  ""For A Few Dollars More"" featured flashbacks that weren't classic, but were at least somewhat effective.  Here, they appear to be little more than filler.<br/><br/>   Despite these complaints, ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" contains many great scenes, good acting (esp. the absurd Rod Steiger), and a great, odd score by Ennio Morricone.  I would kill myself to get my hands on an unedited copy, but this will do fine for now.<br/><br/>   Seven stars."

","Sergio Leone had come off four more or less brilliant westerns (the ""Dollars Trilogy"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"") and this looks like another, but it isn't. Set in 1913 we have motorcycles and automobiles alongside horse-drawn vehicles. In fact, if you take ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" as chronologically (though not actually) his first western, one has a progression into the modern world. <br/><br/>But while Leone's first four westerns were thoroughly groundbreaking; lyrical and both humorous and surpassingly brilliant in spots . . . this movie is a letdown. <br/><br/>The stars, Rod Steiger an James Coburn, are nearly always watchable. Unfortunately, Coburn, while a fine actor, has problems with accents. Here he tries an Irish brogue (which is relatively more passable than his Australian accent in ""The Great Escape""--barely on the good side of Dick van Dyke's cockney in ""Mary Poppins""). Steiger's method acting conflicted with the director's requirements, but he got stuck with him (he wanted Eli Wallach but the studio thought Steiger more of a draw).<br/><br/>What to make of this mess, which starts with a man urinating on ants (where is the SPCA--Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ants?) and it's a roller-coaster ride of quality. Leone is still capable of great shots, such as when rifles burst in through a window on either side of Steiger's head. <br/><br/>However, as with all Leone's flicks, unpleasant images abound. Not just urination, but rape, presented almost as a human need, and unnecessary nudity. <br/><br/>I can't give a spoiler about the ending because, frankly, I didn't make it all the way through. I slept through lots of it and I doubt I'll revisit it.<br/><br/>Leone could be a great director, but he often confused bloat with impressiveness. His smoothest movie was undoubtedly the equally unpleasant but also imminently watchable ""Once Upon a Time in America""--more than ten years after this curious bit of confusion.<br/><br/>I haven't seen ""The Colossus of Rhodes""; but apart from that, of the movies where Leone is listed as sole director, ""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""For Few Dollars More"", ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America"" are all pretty good films. And, as I said before, the ""Dollars"" movies were groundbreaking, forever changing our expectations from westerns.<br/><br/>""Duck, You Sucker"" (aka ""A Fistful of Dynamite""), the director's sometimes wacky, sometimes serious tour of the Mexican Revolution, is Leone's notable failure. Well, everyone is entitled to one. It has some great Leone signature images, but the characters are thoroughly despicable, the acting even from the headline stars is variable at best, and the story (such as it is) is not compelling. It's only for people who have to see all Leone's movies . . . or, like me, thought we did."
"estebangonzalez10","9","1","3","9 September 2015"," Another brilliant film from Sergio Leone that doesn't deserve to be overlooked
","""Where there's revolution there's confusion, and when there's confusion, a man who knows what he wants stands a good chance of getting it.""<br/><br/>With every new opportunity I get to watch a Sergio Leone film, the more I fall in love with his direction and style of film making. He is becoming one of my favorite directors of all time, and so far every film of his that I've seen is either a masterpiece or very close to being one. Duck, You Sucker (also known as A Fistful of Dynamite or Once Upon a Time the Revolution), is a glorious and epic film that unfortunately has been overlooked by many. I got to experience the two and a half hour restored version of the film and all I can say is that it is incredibly entertaining. This is the second film in Leone's Once Upon a Time trilogy although this one takes place in Mexico during the Revolution of 1913 and it is his most forgotten work probably because its squeezed in the middle of his most revered films. This was Leone's final spaghetti western, and I only wish he had made more films like this because they are completely captivating. His classic trademarks are all included in this film beginning with his fascination for extreme close-ups contrasted with his wide angle shots, his collaboration with Ennio Morricone, whose score is always influential in the story, and his unique introduction of main characters who we don't know for sure if they'll be the hero or the villain. The introduction of the two main characters in this film is memorable and the chemistry both Rod Steiger and James Coburn shared together was a plus. There is very little I can criticize about this film because Leone once again had me guessing where the story was heading and what motivated each character. His spaghetti westerns always broke genre conventions and he did so once again with Steiger's character who is an outlaw we eventually end up rooting for. Leone loves to mix things up and during some flashback scenes it becomes evident how much he has influenced modern filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>We are introduced to Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) in the very opening scene as he is begging a traveler who is passing by to take him into town. He is mocked due to his poor man appearance but eventually is allowed into the comfortable and elegant stagecoach where some wealthy passengers are heading to America. He is treated with disdain and has to listen to all kinds of hateful and racial remarks when all of a sudden a group of bandits hold up the stagecoach. We discover that they are Juan's bandit family, and it was all part of a well planned robbery. The victim ended up being the leader of the band and he leaves the disrespectful passengers naked in the middle of the road taking all their belongings with him. As they are celebrating their conquest, a series of explosions go off near the road and a man in a motorcycle passes by them. Juan shoots at the tire and the man suddenly stops revealing himself as John Mallory (James Coburn). Not too pleased with what the bandits did to his motorcycle he sets off an explosive in the stagecoach and threatens them. John is an Irish Republican who is wanted by the British army, but due to his expertise with explosives Juan wants to recruit him for a bank robbery and tries to convince him to stay with his family. What Juan doesn't know is that John is really in Mexico trying to help the revolutionaries led by Doctor Villega (Romolo Valli) and isn't interested in money. Juan unwillingly becomes a part of the revolution by trying to stick with John and that gets him into trouble with army Colonel Gunther Reza (Antonie Saint-John) and the tyrant Governor Don Jaime (Franco Graziosi). What ensues is a series of epic and confusing adventures for Juan and John. <br/><br/>Duck, You Sucker is a wonderful epic film that perfectly balances the comedic moments with the action. Steiger and Coburn are excellent together and it was fun to see how they each kept on facing each other when Juan was trying to force John to do things his way. At first I didn't really care much for Steiger's character, but over time he grew on me. The true hero however was Coburn's John. His entrance is as splendid as any of Leone's introductions and he literally shows up on screen with a bang. The visuals might not have been as groundbreaking as they were in Once Upon a Time in the West, but the performances and the score truly enriched the story. What's fun about Leone's style is that his narratives are never straightforward and that always makes for an entertaining adventure. It is missing the usual western duels but it focuses more on building the friendship between the two leads so you can take it as a western buddy comedy of sorts more than anything else. It also has some very emotional scenes as well so Leone once again manages to squeeze different genres into this powerful film. It may not be a masterpiece, but I had a blast with Duck, You Sucker. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Sergio Leone had conquered the spaghetti western with The Good, The Bad & The Ugly and Once Upon A Time In The West that his last western, A Fistful of Dynamite gets swept under the rug. While it does have the grit and tension of his famous trilogy, there's something about it that makes it a peg below. It feels more like a Sam Peckinpah classic. Although West neglected him entirely, Dynamite misses Clint Eastwood's touch. James Coburn and Rod Steiger (with his seemingly expendable family) are apt enough substitutes, but they're both unlikeable anti-heroes. We invest in Eastwood's character because of his calmness and endurance, but Dynamite is like having just The Bad and The Ugly.<br/><br/>Marvin's character tries to have this quality, but his backstory takes away the mystery and slows down the film and makes him seem weak-willed. It's still fine though, and is more or less as good as A Fistful of Dollars. Here, Leone's closeups are used for social class critique as he compares the rich and the poor, sometimes too obviously, but he weaves it into the story pretty well even if it is a long slow burn. Unfortunately, his right-hand man Ennio Morricone's score isn't the best, with some ridiculous crooning and croaking though it still creates atmosphere. Which is what Leone's spaghetti westerns were all about. Atmosphere. Great to have one last dip, just to make sure the well was definitely tapped out. I'm sure he knew it too.<br/><br/>7/10"
"zardoz-13","9","1","3","11 September 2013"," Sergio Leone & The Mexican Revolution
","Sergio Leone wanted his protégé Giancarlo Santi to direct the Rod Steiger & James Coburn epic ""Duck You Sucker"" while he served in a supervisory role as an executive producer. Things changed when the two stars insisted that Leone take over the helm. Santi wound up handling the second unit work, while Leone handled Steiger and Coburn. ""Duck You Sucker"" pales by comparison with Sergio Leone's earlier masterpiece ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" Indeed, the picture lacks the charisma of Leone's period ""Dollar"" westerns with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef. This tale about the Mexican revolution appeared at a time when Spaghetti westerns were declining in numbers. Some directors already were exploring political themes within the framework of the Mexican revolution. Simultaneously, American westerns were forging on to the turn of the century so the hardware that the heroes and villains used seemed modern by comparison. Automatic pistols replaced revolvers. After he helmed ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" ""For A Few Dollars More,"" ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" Leone had done everything he had wanted to do with the western. Early foreign westerns imitated American westerns until Leone revolutionized the genre with his bounty hunter trilogy. Everybody imitated Leone. Later, he would return briefly to the western genre with two Terence Hill comedies. Essentially, the Leone who had created the Spaghetti western as we know it, faded into the background with ""Duck You Sucker."" In many ways, this spectacular looking adventure movie shows a Leone of greater maturity. Nevertheless, he didn't personalize the mise-en-scene of the Zapata movies as he had done with period Spaghetti westerns. Directors Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Sollima emerged as the foremost practitioners of the Zapata westerns respectively with ""The Mercenary"" and ""The Big Gundown."" Furthermore, Leone was moving away from his carefree but violent movies. The protagonists in ""Duck You Sucker"" are a disillusioned IRA gunman on the lam and a Mexican bandit who cares nothing for the revolution until he winds up being a part of it. The friendship between these two men that dominates the sprawling action is deeper than that between Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef in ""For a Few Dollars More."" The themes of death, betrayal, revenge, and commitment recur throughout this lengthy adventure movie. The initial showdown between Juan (Rode Steiger) and Sean (James Coburn) when they meet in the desert is pure Leone. Indeed, while it isn't as much fun as his previous westerns, ""Duck You Sucker"" contains scenes that recurred throughout his earlier films. Flashbacks play an important role here as it did in ""For A Few Dollars More."" Railroads are featured prominently in the action. Everything is big. Sean blows up a building and literally brings the entire structure down. The end gambit when two trains collide head on in the desert is the heart of spectacle itself. Juan is a bandit with a large family of armed and deadly sons. Juan dreams of robbing a legendary bank in Mesa Verde. When he finally gets around to it, Juan is fooled by Sean and the revolutionaries. All the loot has been moved and all Juan can find is political prisoners that he liberates and winds up being a champion of the revolution. However, Juan hates revolutions. Gradually, the disillusioned Sean comes around to Juan's point of view while he is struggling to work out a predicament that occurred in Ireland. Sean's friend (David Warbeck) betrays him to the authorities. When police come looking for Sean, Sean is prepared. Not only does he shoot both cops, but he also kills his father. Mind you, ""Duck You Sucker"" is a brilliant movie, filled with insight, but it shuns being a flippant shoot'em up with no philosophy. Ennio Morricone contributes another memorable scene. The showdown at the bridge in the desert is awesome."
"deltajvliet","7","1","3","19 October 2009"," A Fistful of Leone
","Legendary director Sergio Leone made one final Western following the success of Once Upon a Time in the West and the Dollars Trilogy, and while it doesn't stack up to the monumental greatness of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, it remains a noble effort and solid film. <br/><br/>Where the movie fails to meet the grandeur of its predecessor is in the scope of its execution. The score doesn't quite match Morricone's magnum opus. The characters aren't quite as colorful as Blondie, Tuco, or Angel Eyes. The battle doesn't quite have the magnitude of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly's. But these are minor criticisms if they can be called criticisms at all. <br/><br/>Duck, You Sucker! is easily identified as a Leone movie by the many elements found in his other work: gritty close-ups, sun-baked deserts, even a bridge explosion not at all unlike the Civil War battle's conclusion in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. But what differs this time around is the replacement of Eastwood with a new anti-hero, Mexican bandit Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger). Co-protagonist John Mallory (James Coburn) serves as an effective foil, a noble-minded revolutionary working alongside local guerrillas to create a better Mexico. There is something to be said for the pair's chemistry, and in many ways they're similar to Blondie and Tuco. <br/><br/>As with the Dollars Trilogy, Leone paints a beautiful film on his celluloid canvas. The aesthetic has a gritty, epic feel, and as always the most is made of the Southwest's (Spain's) grand, majestic, sweeping landscape. <br/><br/>What really sets the film apart is Morricone's score. The man is legendary in his own right, but the Leone / Morricone duo is nearly beyond superlative. Any time the two come together there is the potential for a masterpiece. And while Duck, You Sucker! doesn't quite attain such a status, it has repeatedly, and deservedly, been called one of the best Spaghetti Westerns. <br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Sergio Leone created some memorable movies. Mostly they're remembered for their irony, comedy and Clint Eastwood. <br/><br/>'A Fistful Of Dynamite' is probably his least well remembered, and that's a pity because although it may not be the masterpiece that some would claim, it is certainly an epic. <br/><br/>It contains all of his flawed genius. There are the usual needlessly drawn-out episodes, the irrelevant digressions, and of course his trademark wretchedly dubbed voice-overs. But amongst these are the stupendous vistas of the barren 'west' (usually somewhere in Spain), the minutely choreographed operatic confrontations, and his other great asset; the soaring, beautiful music from Ennio Morricone. Much of the emotional impact of this movie is down to Morricone's lyrical interpretation of the moment. I believe that his interludes at least equal those of 'The Mission', a movie that is usually regarded as his master-work. <br/><br/>And for the first time we have what I might call a serious character actor, in the person of Rod Steiger. A few years earlier he won an Oscar for his part as the bigoted racist policeman in 'Heat Of The Night'. Although never a handsome heroic figure in the mould of Eastwood or Coburn, Steiger could nevertheless act either of these men clear off the screen, and here brings to a role the sort of gravitas that was so lacking in other spaghetti westerns.<br/><br/>Once again we see the histories of the protagonists reprised in occasional flashback. They fit pretty seamlessly into the story-line and pad out what in this case would be a rather two-dimensional character of Sean Mallory, represented by Coburn. <br/><br/>The story is the old one of revolution and its betrayal. In response to a throwaway cynicism by Coburn, Steiger's Juan Miranda spits out a furious denunciation about poor people serving as cannon-fodder for contemptuous academics. It is entirely believable as well as true. And there is no shortage of betrayal in this movie. <br/><br/>As a consequence of which, in one particularly tragic scene, Steiger's family are annihilated. His unspoken demonstration of grief and despair at their discovery is heartbreaking to watch. It is an object lesson in body language and facial expression that many a modern movie-star should take as example. And Morricone is right there on the money, with a lament to make you weep. <br/><br/>I said that this movie was an epic. And any who doubt me should pay close attention to the scenes in which captured revolutionaries are being slaughtered at a railway siding. The camera pans across huge pits in which hundreds of extras are being executed by soldiers in a take that could have been lifted straight from 'Schindler's List', had that movie come first. Later, we see a great disorganised mob attempting to board a train. The chaos of disparate people, possessions and props, the animals, dust, steam and noise create a genuinely authentic appearance of society in meltdown. You could hardly believe that it was all manufactured. And once again I wonder if it wasn't an inspiration for Spielberg's take on Jewish 're-settlement' so many years later. <br/><br/>If this were not a Sergio Leone western with all its cheap jokes and visual gags, but instead emphasised the issues of revolution, it would be an acclaimed work with a reputation to rival that of 'Doctor Zhivago' or 'Lawrence Of Arabia'. But as it is, it must jog elbows with the trivial though similarly titled 'Fistful Of Dollars', whilst standing in the shadow of the much more popular 'Once Upon A Time In the West'. Such a placement does not do this movie justice at all. <br/><br/>Because of the typical - and at times, rather crass - Leone gags and operatic drama, it is difficult to appreciate the monumental moments of conflict and the quiet interludes of personal reflection with which they often jar, making this work difficult to define as a piece. The director seems to stray beyond his commercial and popular mandate into the world of serious political commentary where his cheap humour has no place. He clearly demonstrates that he can indeed do both, but not perhaps in the same movie. <br/><br/>One thing I'm pretty sure of; it will entertain you in ways that you wouldn't expect, and some scenes will stay in your memory for a very long time - as indeed will the music."

","It is always interesting to see a weak film of one of the world's most honest directors, a fellow that knew his limitations and still provided one of the most original bodies of work in modern cinema. Leone's westerns are shot with the heart and are cut with his teeth. This long epic of dynamite blows, broken-english curses, glaring disconnected Irish flashbacks, zooming galore and close up of bare buttocks provides a wonderful acting duel between Coburn and Steiger, a sort of Quixotean duo of the Mexican revolution. Think of a similar kind of material polished by craftier hands and you get the contemporary and striking railway extravaganza `The Emperor of the North Pole' directed by Robert Aldrich."

","The trailer for this film says ""Sergio Leone - the master of adventure."" Maybe he was, but first of all he was the master of the Western-genre. This is his only ""Zapata-Western"" (A Western about the Mexican revolution) with as much bombs and explosions as gunfights. The word adventure fits in more with this film than it does with his dollar-trilogy or ""C'era una volta il west"".<br/><br/>""Giù la testa"" is one of Leone's worst movies, but that isn't reason enough to not see it because this is still one of the best Westerns from the 1970's. The sets are magnificent. Even if it is a long film and misses the common Leone-action scenes, it is never boring or bad. The acting from Steiger and Coburn couldn't be better. And the dialog is almost magic at times. Personally I liked the flashback-scenes!<br/><br/>Morricone makes one of his best scores. The score is not so strange as some have said (it is called experimental and weird at times).<br/><br/>I recommend ""Giù la testa"". The only reason to miss this is because it's not that original - the style reminds very much of ""C'era una volta il west"" and it's story is a bit similar to ""The Wild Bunch"".

"Theo Robertson","7","2","10","29 May 2005"," Entertaining Study Of Marxist Ideals
","It's no secret but Sergio Leone was a supporter of Marxism . All his work has a socialist ideal running through it and A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE is the most obvious example . Look at the opening sequence as Rod Stieger's is given a lift on the bourgeois coach . Oh what decadent pigs they are , the imperilist American , the priest spreading his opiate through the land , the arrogant philistines who look down their noses at the proletarian passenger who they view as a worthless parasite , but most of the all the sexually repressed woman who takes great joy in discussing her sexual conclusions of what these peasants get up to when the lights are turned off at night , I bet she has a few dark secrets . Of course you just know that revolutionary karma is on its way <br/><br/>I have to honest and say that despite recognising the philosophy of Leone I've never been much of a fan of his work , his films tend to be overblown and obvious with sometimes totally silly scenes and with the exception of ONCE UPON A TIME IN America none of them can be classed as masterworks of cinema but A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE ( Who decided to call it DUCK YOU SUCKER ? ) is better than most even if it suffers from the directors usual faults in that it's over long and we get too many close ups . I really do wonder if Leone viewed editors as decadent reactionaries <br/><br/>What makes this movie better than most of Leone's movies is that the story while not exactly being groundbreaking is thoughtful and involving . A revolutionary comes across an IRA fugitive and enlists his help to overthrow the government . At least unlike American movies this Italian effort doesn't go out of it's way to make the noble misunderstood Irish bombmaker the focus of the story , he's there as a catalyst / plot device more than anything . Despite not having the most convincing Irish accent James Coburn does seem to have been hired as something more than as a hunky , macho action IRA hero unlike Richard Gere in THE JACKAL and Brad Pitt in THE DEVIL'S OWN . Rod Steiger is fairly convincing as the peasant revolutionary and it's rather scary that this is perhaps one of his last notable performances . The use of humour is genuinely amusing rather than silly and the movie contains a very memorable soundtrack . Come on I bet you were calling "" SEAN SEAN SEAN "" after seeing this <br/><br/>Apart from calling for socialist utopia the subtext of the movie features guilt and redemption with Sean's flash back sub story to the fore but I've always thought the most moving and intelligent part of the subtext is when a former revolutionary tells of the time when he was tortured into informing by the state "" I thought I would never break under torture but I did .Nothing can be changed . The dead will remain dead . What am I supposed to do ? Kill myself ? I can still be of use to the cause "" which is a fairly unique thing in a film since nearly all informers in movies don't need to be tortured in order to give out info while no one seems to feel any guilt at sticking in their former friends to their enemies"

","""Duck, You Sucker"" is a Leone movie and I freely admit that I was expecting something akin to the Dollars Trilogy (both of them came packaged in the Sergio Leone Anthology, so it's not too big a stretch). Which is nowhere near the case, and that suits me just fine. But it is bogged down by a solemn vibe, and even though revolvers are (mostly) traded in for explosions, you start to miss the larger-than-life presences of van Cleef, Eastwood and Wallach after awhile. I was on board with the revolutionary politics of the thing, but the pacing is all off.<br/><br/>I do like Rod Steiger and James Coburn, both wielding iffy accents (although Steiger seems a bit more at home with his). And there were moments of great poignancy, particularly in the cave and the final scene. Between the pacing, the uneven tone and Morricone's score (very ""Butch Cassidy""), it's not my favorite.

","Sergio Leone is well known as one of the greatest directors of westerns, with films like the brilliant Once Upon A Time In The West. This film is very different - although you can tell it's a Leone film (the long, near-silent takes, frequent close ups and use of slow motion), it's very different. Framed against the Mexican revolution, it's more political, showing us the brutality of the Federales and the determination of the revolutionaries. James Coburn is excellent, playing a really interesting character - a known killer and a wanted Irish terrorist who still has a sense of humour and honour. His main co-star is Rod Steiger, who perhaps overplays his role as a Mexican bandit, but is nevertheless fantastic - he has some wonderful lines and at times sounds more than a little like Tony Montana from Scarface! The explosives expertise of Coburn's character is put to good use, and there are some impressive explosions and action scenes, especially towards the end. But rather than being a straightforward western, this film has elements of tragedy, comedy and politics to go along with its brooding atmosphere and obligatory action. Whilst not quite up to the standard of Leone's more famous films, this is still a classic."

After a few seconds of this, the camera pans back and you see...Eli Wallach? No. Rod Steiger with his pants down to his knees. He pulls and zips them up because what you're watching in the opening sequence is him urinating on that tree.<br/><br/>Yes, I knew I was looking at Rod Steiger but he did a very convincing job playing Eli Wallach in this movie. James Coburn's Irishman seemed a little cool-headed for an Irishman. Also, there's this one scene where Leone does extreme close-ups of people's mouths while they were eating. That was a little gross, but what the heck? Just a minor gripe. It's still vintage Leone. He takes his time telling a great story and, as usual, the facial expressions of the characters tells a lot of the story without them having to say anything. And the story is very well constructed. And the new DVD version is fantastic. A great story told by a great story teller. And of course, let's not forget Morricone with his great music. (SEAN, SEAN, SEAN). 9 out of 10."

","Phewh, what a relief from the  Hollywood production in the nineties and now of antagonistic buddies that throw one-liners at each other.  Together with Rod Steiger's superb acting as the accidental Mexican revolutionary Juan Miranda and slightly less impressing performance by James Coburn as the IRA revolutionary specialist on the run, director Sergio Leone creates a rugged diamond of film here.  Sergio starts the movie with provocative scenes that take the audiences to very fragile ethical grounds (referring to the post coach robbery scene with Juan and the rich woman) setting a serious athmosphere to the movie.  It gives you the indication that the characters are complicated and have their own ethical struggles in midst of the greater scheme of on going revolution.  Then it continues as a comic driven revolutionary film or so-called Zapata-western where Juan's emotionally rich character carries the movie all the way though.  Leone's style of extreme close ups and Ennio's imaginative score that is both humorous and beautiful just make this a very enjoyable film to watch.  James Coburn is great as the easy going IRA man and the relationship of the two not so equals develops beautifully.  Rod Steiger has become one of my top 5 favorite actors (just amazing in ""The heat of the night"".  In spite of somewhat weak storytelling this movie is going to be one of the most memorable movies I have seen. This is a forgotten jewel of film history and all lovers of insightful creative movies should see this Leone film.  9/10."

","The least remembered of ""spaghetti western"" stylist Sergio Leone's features, probably because within its first half-hour it all but buries the genre the Italian director had helped father with ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and then moves on to an unexpectedly epic and lyrical meditation on loyalty and friendship over a bloody, violent revolutionary backdrop. Set in the early years of the 20th century in Mexico, it's the second panel in the director's trilogy about America, completed by the earlier ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and the later ""Once Upon a Time in America"", telling of the unlikely friendship that develops between greedy, petty Mexican thief Rod Steiger and idealist Irish dynamiter and former IRA revolutionary James Coburn, who become swept up beyond their own expectations in the uprising led by Pancho Villa. Following on from 1968's masterful ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", Leone maps out the last gasp of the outlaw spirit on the way to civilization, underlining the violent and often wayward routes that change often takes - it's no accident that the film is prefaced by a Mao Tse-Tung quote, ""revolution is an act of violence"" - and the sacrifices demanded of those involved. It's also a good example of Leone's talents - the film retains the director's unique, in-your-face visual stylings while crossing a number of different genres with striking, surprising ease, and is also surprisingly intimate, since it's (very well) carried by Steiger and Coburn in its entirety, with only one true supporting role and everyone else bit players or extras with little or no dialogue. Many have looked upon it as a political film, but it's not so much about politics as about the way politics impact upon the average person."

","I don't normally like Westerns, but I have seen this one over thirty times! By now, Sergio Leone has become legendary. And as one of his last films, ""Duck, You Sucker"" goes out with a BANG! (Literally.)<br/><br/>Set in the early 1900s during the Mexican Revolution, James Coburn plays an Irish terrorist who has fled from Ireland (and is also wanted by the British Government for murder, and terrorism), and appears to be ""mining"" wrecklessly by pitching sticks of dynamite in every which direction. Rod Steiger, master of disguises (""No Way To Treat A Lady"") plays a not-so-bright Mexican Bandido who tries to enlist Colburn's ""pyrotechnical"" talents to go into the banking business (i.e. do a bank heist).<br/><br/>Also cleverly disguised is the 'Banco de Mesa Verde' -- a bank used as a political prison. They both get swepped into the revolution (unwittingly on Steiger's part, but Coburn seems to be a veteran at this sort of thing), and the adventure continues. Possibly some of the best staged explosions (very realistic), and lots of action and suspense. Coburn is every bit of the cowboy Eastwood was (in Leone's earlier films), and more!

The script is both dramatic and subtle, and all of the characters are multi-dimensional, rare in movies of this genre.

","It's always funny and ironic when a big budget film centers on another country's revolution which would lead to big or small budget movies with beloved high paid movie stars never being allowed to be made there. Still, there is always that ""progressive"" 6th grade mentality when dealing with perfect yet scruffy rebels verses the shiny yet formidable capitalists... Capitalism is, by the way, what makes Hollywood run; even imported stuff like this... There's no art without money... <br/><br/>That aside, Duck, You Sucker is an uncomfortable viewing with two great actors, Rod Steiger and James Coburn, both who can go wonderfully over-the-top but here trying for the Clint Eastwood/Charles Bronson less-is-more style that worked previously under director Sergio Leone's artful direction. But here it seems awkward and restrained. <br/><br/>The opening sequence in a stagecoach full of society people who are way too obvious and conceited to be anything more than representations of why we should back the seemingly humble revolutionaries, forcing us to pity the initially quiet and meet Steiger's Juan, until he shows his true colors that in any other movie would be that of a likeable villain. Leaving Duck, You Sucker with no real antagonists, just antagonistic and cliche stereotypes of people not nearly as rich as the Hollywood and Manhattan elites. <br/><br/>The soundtrack has been panned in every review, and that is should. ""Shaaaaaaaaaaw Sha Shaaaaaaaw"" is sung throughout and almost seems like a practical joke within an otherwise grungy motif where a more edgy score is needed, and would fit. But the biggest problem with this class-envy ""War Western"" is it takes too much time to tell a story that could easily fit under an hour and a half. <br/><br/>This movie is just plain bad. Liberalism is a part of most Hollywood movies even dating back to the 1930's but when that aspect is preachy and overdone, it might as well be propaganda or promotion for a, as mentioned in the beginning, world where art would not be allowed."
"Criticalstaff","10","0","1","15 May 2020"," A Masterpiece
","This is one my favourite movies ever.<br/><br/>This is peak Sergio Leone. Everything here is perfect. And the parts that are imperfect reinforce those that are not. The story is maybe the most interesting and mature that Leone ever did in a Western genre film. It is political, while also being epic. It is funny and cartoonish while staying tragic and dark. It is violent, and at times very violent. But it always stays beautiful even when you witness terrible gruesome scenes.
The plot loosely follows two characters that are opposites while being both anti-heroes. I think that you might not like the movie maybe if you do not empathise with at least one of them. But if that is the case then Spaghetti-Westerns in general might not be for you.<br/><br/>However, even for Leone films these characters stand out. I could not help but root for Juan all along, because he is so honest and generous and you see that he has his heart on its sleeve, even if of course he is dirty. There is an endearing lovability to this character that you don't see often in film. The same quality Han Solo brings to Star Wars. He is a man of the people and essentially, he is the people. He is Mexico. He is the masses. Also you love him because his failures are only vices. Juan is not evil. He is not a schemer. He takes what he needs and goes against the people he goes against not from a place of hate or malice, but rather by opportunity and immediate interest. But you could say that his character really reveals itself in the ambush scene with the army tanks on the bridge. Because in contrast to Mallory's devil-may-care (and at the same time holier-than-thou) attitude, Juan chooses not to flee but to confront the army head-on. He does that by loyalty to his family, to his friend, but also because he is proud and you can see that deep down he knows that it is the right thing to do. And it is this selflessness, and the ensuing sacrifice he endures that make him such a compelling character. A character that is so unique in fiction.<br/><br/>It does not mean that Mallory is not a great character either. But it is very much a rather typical romantic hero. He is the bitter idealist, with a tragic sad past. But through the movie, he goes back to his roots and becomes confident again in his dreams but also in who he is and what role he plays in this story, the revolution. Sergio Leone has very frequentlyused flashbacks. And certainly the ones in this movie are the most beautiful ever, and that is largely due to the music, but also because they are more poignant than any other.<br/><br/>Usually these flashbacks work as a reveal mechanism that also acts as an anchor to the characters/protagonists emotions. Here in addition it functions in Mallory's character arc, where he finally understands that his Irish friend/Dr.Villega is the hero. That these events are not about him. He is only a secondary character in someone else's story. In the course of the movie, he learns to care not about an ideal/a cause (or himself for that matter) but about people. About real people with hopes and dreams and aspirations but also weaknesses and failings. He learns to love people that are broken, because he is himself broken. The genius of the movie is playing these characters alternatively side-by-side, then against each other, then together. Mallory is the idealist turned cynic, while Juan is the street-wise hustler turned hero. And they both fulfil the dream(of the Revolution or whatever) together.<br/><br/>I love the story. It follows a generic Western-film-plot of robbing the bank and evading the law, and it leads you right into civil war. There is this magnificent sequence in the Good the Bad the Ugly where the protagonists stumble upon a Civil War battle for a bridge. This movie is basically that sequence extended over 2 hours. And it is fantastic. I like that the kind of socialism/anarchism that the film represents, that I could only qualify of typically Italian, is also put in balance with it's own realism. It is all summed up in the people and the books speech that Juan delivers with passion. The film might be for socialism, but I see it first and foremost as an ode to pragmatism.<br/><br/>A note on the music. Sergio and Ennio are at it again. It is beautiful, it is sad, it is epic : it is perfect. And that is why this movie is one of the absolute masterpieces. Not only because all these elements work; they work together. They all in service of the story. You do not really watch this movie, as you live it. Of course for today's sensibilities it is rather long. But this is how movies were made in the 60s-70s. (on this point by the way it is remarkable that it never feels long). There is so much in here, they explode a bank, they derail a train, they collapse a tower and a bridge. Nobody makes movies like this any more, to the point where nobody know how to do movies like this any more. But this is Art. This is Cinema."
"pppfdjj","8","0","1","14 March 2020"," Actually A Good Movie - With A Few Continuity Issues
","I have always been a big fan of both James Coburn and Rod Steiger- and this movie (overall) is really well done for a 1971 production and would not disappoint any Coburn/Steiger or Sergio Leone fan (especially lovers of Leone's highly popular Eastwood spaghetti westerns - which I have loved since childhood!).
Obviously I am sure (to no one's surprise) that these low budget style movies were forced on most occasions to take a few 'short cut' liberties on expenses and logistics to keep them on track with filming and time constraints. However, I am, admittedly, one of those, at least, 'semi-purist' movie fans that does not mind a smattering of directorial creative flexibility and freedom - as long as it is well placed and sparingly portioned. However, I can get a slight itch of irritability with scenes, logistics, or continuity that are obviously out of place... especially with storylines that are framed around historical events - such as The Mexican Revolution of 1910. I completely understand financial restraints, but I find it hard to swallow whole that such an epic scale motion picture would allow utilizing such a noticeable number of historical inaccuracies in their props. At least four or more of the firearms, including the MG-42 machine gun (German, WW II, designed 1938, mass-produced 1942), and several pistols (Astra 400 (1921), Browning HP (1935), etc. were all manufactured well after the 1913 revolution timeframe - not to mention Coburn's MC being at least (what appears to be anyway) a mid-1930's Harley flathead with wide tires (??) fitted with J-frame handlebars and tanks to make it look older (far from an expert admittedly - just a guess). And how is it even remotely possible to ride around on a bumpy, rut-filled gravel desert road with unsecured glass vials of extremely volatile liquid nitro-glycerin? (HA!) Yeah, I know...

Basically, set in Mexico 1813 during the Revolution, Mexican outlaw Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) leads a family of bandits. He meets John 'Sean' Mallory (James Coburn), an Irish Republican explosives expert on the run from the British. Wanting his explosives skills, Juan relentlessly tries to make him join a raid on the Mesa Verde national bank. John in the meantime plans to use his explosives for service with the revolutionaries; the bank hit becomes an orchestrated revolutionary attack on the army organized by Doctor Villega (Romolo Valli). Juan is only interested in the money, so he is shocked to find there are no funds and it is being sued as a political prison. John, Juan and his family end up freeing hundreds of prisoners, causing Juan to become a ""great, grand, glorious hero of the revolution"". The revolutionaries are chased into the hills by Colonel GÃ¼nther Reza (Antoine Saint-John) and his army. John and Juan volunteer to stay behind with two machine guns and dynamite. Many of the troops are killed and destroyed with machine gun bullets and on the bridge, which is exploded, while Colonel Reza survives. After the battle, John and Juan find most of their comrades, including Juan's family and children, have been killed by the army in a cave. Juan is angered and goes alone to fight the army, only to get captured. John sneaks into the army camp, and witnesses his fellow revolutionaries being executed by a firing squad. Colonel Reza and his men had tortured Villega who informed the army, this evokes John to remember the betrayal of Nolan (David Warbeck), his best friend, whom he was forced to kill. Juan faces a firing squad of his own, but John arrives, blows up the squad and the wall with dynamite, and they escape on a motorcycle. John and Juan hide in the animal coach of a train. It stops to pick up the tyrannical Governor Don Jaime (Franco Graziosi), who has stolen a small fortune. The train is ambushed, John tests Juan's loyalty, he tells him to choose between shooting the Governor and accepting a bribe from him. Juan kills Jaime and steals the Governor's loot. Juan is greeted by a large crowd and again unexpectedly hailed as a great hero of the revolution. He throws the money back into the coach to John. On a train with commanders of the revolution, John and Juan are joined by Dr. Villega, who has escaped. Only John is aware of Villega's betrayal. They find out that an army train, led by Colonel Reza, carrying 1,000 soldiers and heavy is due to arrive in a few hours, which will surely overpower the rebel position. John suggests rigging a set of explosives to the locomotive for the upcoming train to collide with. He asks for Villega's help, rather than Juan; Villega realises that John is aware of his betrayal. The army train speeds towards the locomotive, John jumps in time as the two trains collide, but Villega, feeling guilty, stays aboard is killed, along with many soldiers. The ambush is successful for the revolutionaries, but as John approaches to meet Juan, he is shot in the back by Colonel Reza. Juan enraged fires a machine gun at the Colonel. As John lies dying, memories of his friends and loved ones flash before him, he keeps Villega's betrayal a secret, and tells Juan that he died a hero of the revolution. John dies, and Juan sits watching the remains, unsure what he will do next. Also starring Maria Monti as Adelita, Rik Battaglia as Santerna, Franco Graziosi as Governor Huerta and John Frederick as the American on stagecoach. Steiger is alright as the money-hungry peasant a reasonably good Mexican accent, and Coburn is also alright as the walking arsenal. This film (originally titled Duck, You Sucker!) is apparently considered overlooked, I personally see as the weakest of Leone's films, there are some good sequences with explosions and guns blazing, but everything in between I found a bit boring, at least the score by composer Ennio Morricone is reasonable, an alright Spaghetti Western. Okay!"

","I really suffered with this film! I felt bleeding from my eyes! Why Sergio, seriously now, why?
The whole idea of the film is that when you have given everything you had to offer to the westerns, you invent a new era. So, Sergio Leone remembers the Revolution of Mexico. And because he has used every rediculous idea with shooting in his previous films, he now finds... explosives! But, what western can it be, when you explode innocent people crossing by? So, the Revolution gave the context, that the exploded people may in the end be ""not so good"". Well, I think he failed even in that! I sympathized the victims, I hated Leone and his arrogant, amoralist protagonists!..
I didn't really manage to watch the whole film, to be true. But believe me, I watched more than I could stand. The scenery and the explosions look so fake. The miniature of the bridge is so obvious it is a model in scale. The visual effects are worse than those in the adult films of Gousgounis, if you know! Also, the film is even more amoralistic. The one protagonist is a bandit, ok, but also a crazy killer, who enjoys slaying innocent people. In the train, one guy begs him to spare him, ""I have children"", he says. The protagonist throws him off the train right away! Then he says the outrageous: ""I have children too""!?
The other protagonist is an Irish explosives expert. He enjoys doublecrossing his best friends! First, he doublecrossed IRA and his own counrty, and got found in Mexico as fugitive. Then he doublecrossed Mexicans, preparing robberies with the worst killers. Then he doublecrossed the killers, and then all from the beginning again! I wonder, what teaches us a film like this? To be a piece of crap?"

","James Coburn's Irish accent is irritating and atrocious. Might as well have hired Richard Harris or Peter O'Toole or Patrick McGoohan."

","I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of Rod Steiger in the first place - he's basically a male Meryl Streep (a stupid, inconsistent, different bad accent in every movie) and lots of hammy over-acting. But here he's just doing a Tuco impression (Eli Wallach in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly). Give me the original, please. Coburn's stupid fake Irish accent is nearly as grating.<br/><br/>The graphic violence? Well, that's the director's trademark. You don't go into a Leone film expecting tearful embraces, poetry readings and discussions about feelings.<br/><br/>This is such low-grade, recycled garbage the stench of it retroactively rubs off on the rest of Sergio Leone's work. In fact, now that I've seen the full, un-cut versions of Duck, You Sucker (aka A Fistful of Dynamite) and Once Upon A Time in America, I can confidently say that, by and large, Leone was a bona fide hack.<br/><br/>He ripped off Kurosawa's Yojimbo with A Fistful of Dollars, an obscene, nearly shapeless, gratuitously violent bloodbath with so few redeeming qualities it would never be shown on TV if it didn't star Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>Having stumbled into a Euro hit he kept Eastwood on board and made For a Few Dollars More (surely the most on-the-nose movie title in cinema history). This second instalment in the so-called Dollars Trilogy explored a relationship between Eastwood's Monco and Lee Van Cleef's Col. Mortimer, part humor, part mutual admiration, part rivalry, with liberal doses of sly comedy worked in to good effect.<br/><br/>Now Leone had a bankroll, so he embarked on the ambitious The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. He shot what must have been a million miles of film, got an all-time brilliant score out of Ennio Morricone, an all-time impressive performance out of the estimable Eli Wallach, and managed, in its original incarnation, to create a rambling, shambling, violent, black comedy, buddy film that would be a late-night staple of generations.<br/><br/>The movies all got released in America and now Leone was as hot as anybody on this side of the Atlantic. So he made Once Upon A Time in The West with Bronson, Robards and Fonda. For all the talk of that film's epic status, it's a solid film whose ambition is just beyond its grasp, with the same trademark continuity problems and sloppy editing that were prevalent in Leone's earlier work.<br/><br/>And then this workmanlike, repetitive, dull pile of garbage with a musical score that could just as easily been by Burt Bacharach. It's not hard to believe it would be over a decade before somebody gave Leone the money to film the even-more-execrable Once Upon A Time in America.<br/><br/>By my count that makes one great movie (Good,Bad,Ugly) and two above-average ones (Few Dollars More, Once Upon...West) and three terrible movies (Fistful of Dollars, Fistful of Dynamite and Once Upon...America). Your mileage may vary."
"professorjeffreypbrown","7","0","2","18 May 2016"," Love Sergio, but this one was wanting
","I have no problem overall with the movie. The story is decent, albeit a little far fetched, but after all, this is fiction. But the movie is near 2 1/2 hours long. A half hour could be cut just by decreasing the amount of time the actors stare at each other. Sure, I know it's a Sergio technique, but it doesn't work well when there's little tension. When the bad guy is staring down the good guy in Once Upon a Time in the West or the Good, the Bad, the Ugly there's real tension there. Two unarmed guys staring at each other in an empty room, not the same thing. There are also disjointed moments in the film, like when Miranda's (Rod Steiger) kids are lying about dead in a cave. Didn't see that happen. And why did Mallory shoot his friend in the Irish pub? Again, overall a solid film. Classic? Nope, fell far short of that for me."

","""Duck, You Sucker"" (1971) Duck, You Sucker! (Italian: GiÃ¹ la testa), also known as ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" and ""Once Upon a TimeÂ… the Revolution"", is the last Spaghetti Western directed by the legendary Sergio Leone and it is also his penultimate film - his last being the gangster epic ""Once Upon a Time in America"" (1984) with Robert De Niro and James Woods. This however, stars James Coburn and Rod Steiger in what is probably Leone's most patchy Spaghetti Western.<br/><br/>The screenplay was written by Sergio Donati, Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni and follows the escapades of John Mallory (James Coburn) in 1913 during the Mexican revolution, an Irish Republican explosives expert who has fled from Ireland after killing British soldiers. In Mexico, he meets Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger), a Mexican outlaw and together they raid the great bank of Mesa Verde. However, John has already joined forces with the revolutionaries.<br/><br/>The screenplay is rather episodic at times and there does seem to be a lack of focus, especially up to the bank raid. After that, politics and the revolution are brought into sharper reality. The direction too, is fantastic at certain points. The scene where John and Juan find most of their comrades, including Juan's family and children, have been killed by the army in a cave is one of the best pieces of work Leone ever did. The massacre, later on in the movie, shot in an abandoned sugar mill in one shot, is so huge and horrifying that it amounts to one of the best depictions of mass murder on film. Yet at other times, the direction seems to be rather by-the-numbers and not at all inspired, like the slightly predictable shoot-em-up final. The cinematography by Giuseppe Ruzzolini, though, is excellent at all times, as is Ennio Morricone's strange score that will definitely grow on you. The performance by James Coburn is his usual minimalist stuff, but he does that very, very well. Rod Steiger sometimes overacts, yet it is different from anything else he did.<br/><br/>So, it is not Sergio Leone's best movie; in fact it is probably not even as good as his basic (if classic) ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964). Yet when the film gets it act together, there are scenes that equal the best he ever did."
"kargaan","7","0","4","7 November 2010"," Fairly Boring Sergio Leone Film
","A Fisful of Dynamite doesn't even come close to being as good as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly or A Fistful of Dollars. I enjoyed the movie to a certain extent until it just became a chore to watch. There is a whole lot of unnecessary scenes and random shots in the movie that add to the minutes of this long two and a half hour movie. There's also these boring flashbacks thrown in the movie that make no sense at all. Just do away with these flashbacks because they don't progress the story or explain anything about the characters. Speaking of the story, I didn't find the story that interesting. So all we have left to make the movie worth watching is James Coburn and a few good action sequences with plenty of explosions. If I were you I would only watch this if your a die hard Leone fan but if your not your going to be really bored and disappointed."
"btm1","10","0","4","2 December 2009"," A Fistful of Dynamite - Duck You Sucker
","At first blush this would seem to be another Sergio Leone ""spaghetti western."" One of the greatest actors of the last half of the 20th Century, Rod Steiger (""The Illustrated Man,"" Jud in ""Oklahoma,"" ""On the Waterfront,"" ""The Pawnbroker,"" ""In the Heat of the Night"") is Juan Miranda, a Mexican bandit chief. But this is not the Eli Wallach one-dimensional bandit chief of Leone's famous ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" In the beginning we see Miranda as a brutish, illiterate, immoral thug. But a much more complex personality is developed in this movie, and Steiger is splendid in the role.<br/><br/>John H. Mallory (James Coburn) is an old Irish revolutionary bomb expert traveling in Mexico(for reasons we don't learn until the middle of the film) in the Mexican Revolution era of Zapata and Pancho Villa. John is motorcycling on a road in a barren part of Mexico when he encounters Juan and his family who try to rob him. John counters Juan's guns with his explosives starting is a comical string of Juan's attempts to capture John, who he wants to use to aid him in robbing a bank he had dreamt of robbing since he saw it as a child.<br/><br/>The two do become embroiled in the Mexican Revolution, to the dismay of Juan who sees the futility in revolutions because his experience is that a successful revolution just results in one set of rulers replacing the other, with the peasants suffering continuing under the new regime (after his release from prison leftist Mexican muralist David Siqueiros expressed a similar disillusionment in a mural depicting a sequence of revolutions that circled back on itself.)<br/><br/>I saw the English language version of the film on cable television's Independent Film Channel (IFC), which shows films uncut. It included the opening scene of Juan urinating while waiting for the stage coach."
"coolpoolshark285","10","0","5","28 October 2005"," Should there be ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" on DVD?
","Before I ask this question, let me just say that ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" is now one of my favorite movies of all time. It's a film that deals with the revolution, courage, and companionship between Rod Steiger and James Coburn in the movie. Now, should there be ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" on DVD? Although, I've seen both the PG rated version, and the extended R rated version on Encore Westerns(which accidentally put the PG rating to show the extended version). My point is that there should be a 2-disc special edition which shows both the PG version and the extended version on DVD. What would you think? It would also have special features on it, too!"

","As everyone knows, the Spaghetti Westerns of the 60's and early 70's revolutionised the Western genre and inspired the Americans into making more good ones. And of all the Italian Westerns, Sergio Leone's are paramount. Naturally with Leone there are the three classics with Clint Eastwood; followed by the epic ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" with Fonda & Bronson in 1968, and then this one in 1971. And of all the films mentioned here, guess which always draws the short straw! This is a great shame as this film is certainly no worse than the others, and if anything its a lot funnier, with great humour balanced with good action and two unforgettable characters, beautifully drawn-out by the lead actors. Rod Steiger plays a chicken theif who gets drawn into the Mexican Revolution of 1918 by IRA man James Coburn. and it is HIS journey from lovable rogue to reluctant realist which forms the lynchpin for the movie. Both actors are in full character mode complete with convincing accents, and the film never fails to make its point. But like all genres or movie canons, once the public gets a taste for something special nothing else will do, and although this movie held up at the time, it is not often remembered. YES Leone could go beyond the Dollars!"

"Jekyll-3","8","0","3","8 May 1999"," Another good Sergio Leone flick
","Another good example of Sergio Leone's 'spaghetti westerns', with some slightly oddball twists, such as Coburn's part as an Irish terrorist. Although the storyline seems kind of disconnected at times, it does evoke the epic quality that Leone seems to be obsessed with. But where did the title 'Duck, You Sucker' (the version I saw was Fistful of Dynamite with Duck... as the subtitle) come from? Sounds like one of Pam Grier's films! And were they really saying, ""Sean, Sean"" all the time in Morricone's theme?"

","I first saw this film in college on a Saturday afternoon televised on one of the local stations, not knowing the name of the film, not recognizing Rod Steiger, and not knowing who Sergio Leone was. Since then, I've become a huge fan of Sergio's hilarious, highly individualistic westerns. I have to say that this film is probably my favorite and has the most interesting and well-studied characters of all of his films, ahead of Eastwood, Eli Wallach, Bronson, Henry Fonda, Van Cleef, and ClaudiaCardinale.<br/><br/>Sergio's game, right off the bat, is his thrilling introduction to the main characters, Juan (Rod Steiger) and John(james Coburn). Packed with banditos, burritos, dynamite, and the unfolding intrigue of James Coburn's character, the first hour is as exciting as any hour of any film ever.<br/><br/>Secondly, Sergio's cinematography is still better and more innovative than almost any director who has ever won an Oscar. Unfortunately, it seems like Leone didn't have a big-budget studio backing to insure the quality of this film production. But this movie, is definitely worth searching for if you're a serious film student. Sergio's camera work is really dazzling. Also, Morricone's score is too weird to believe, you've just gotta hear it for yourself.<br/><br/>It's really too bad that Leone only made one more movie after this, because all of his movies are so incredibly entertaining, but if you consider that most of his movies ran an hour longer than anyone else's, had more plot twists than your average soap opera, and were erupting with more jokes than any French Film critic could stand, then its hard to be disappointed."

","I first saw this film in 1990 at 25, and I didn't keep it because I didn't understand it then (it was part of the Viva Leone season at Christmas 1989). Having spent 3 years of my life subsequently in a foreign country I can understand the cynicism and imagery of it. Like the beating up scene in 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly', the mass shooting scene in this film is reminiscent of Nazism in WW2. Up to the time where Rod Steiger discovers what's in the bank the film seems fairly light-hearted but afterwards is anything but.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film for me lies in having no clear good guys or bad guys, just different points of view and the tragedy of people killing and being killed, often not really knowing what they were killing or dying for.<br/><br/>Having it on video allows me to examine some minor details, like whether the men being executed at one point have been seen earlier in the film - I can't clearly match all the faces involved!"
"gratian-2","7","0","3","10 July 2000"," Spaghetti & TNT or 'Whatever.'
","This film. like the other Westerns of Leone is a spoof of many of our no less prized cultural norms.  The interplay and undercutting of both heroic and anti-heroic, the wit and warmth make for this viewer at least an irresistible combination.  The film is filled with much of the post-modern humanism which pervades our culture in recent years, of Hamletic indifference; ""If it be now; 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come.  The readiness is all  Since no man of aught he leaves knows, what is't to leave betimes? Let be."" (V.ii.220-225): meaning 'random' or 'whatever, never mind.' For these reasons the film speaks to me even more now that it did thirty years ago, and places it at the top of the list of 'Spaghetti' Westerns."
